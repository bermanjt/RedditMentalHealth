1,"Last night around 10pm my ex dm'd on ig, basically saying hes sorry and will do anything to get me back. I answered and we texted till 5am. Im not going to lie, it felt amazing to speak to him and hear him tell me all the things ive been wanting to hear for so long. His mom spoke to me and told me she missed me, and how happy he was that i was speaking to him. 

He said he wants to put the past behind us and start a clean. We spoke about how our views have changed &amp; about the things we did wrong in the relationship. I still love him so much and i think of him everyday, so this conversation was like a breathe of fresh air to me.

I dont know exactly what to do. My mom said i should follow my heart, and it says i should be with him. But i'm terrified of things not working out. I told him we can just be friends because i want to take things slowly and i dont want to rush into anything. Im terrified that its all too good to be true, but i also feel prepared incase i end up heartbroken again. I just wish i had some clarity and i want to see him in person so i can know what to do, because it doesnt feel like its really happening. 

Have any of you ever gotten back together with an ex? Please if you have any insight or advice I would greatly appreciate it

2,"My [19F] boyfriend [19M] and I have been together for 2 years. A year ago, he was kicked out of house because his family thought I changed him. Anyway, we had a friend who (at the time) was kind enough to let him stay with him. The situation was horrible for T. He had to sleep in an attic because all the bedrooms were full. And it was just an all around bad experience for him. He stayed there for a year. 3 months ago we moved into dorms for college. We’ve both started to realize that he’ll have no where to live once the winter Semester ends. My mom was so kind to let him stay with us when we are breaks for the holidays but I know she isn’t gonna let him live with us. Our other friends have claimed they’re going to move into an apartment but when the fall semester begins. Neither of us work. We were going to try and find an apartment together but who are we kidding, no landlord is going to let two 19 year olds without jobs rent a place. T needs someone where to live for the summer and his entire family can’t be trusted. He refuses to move back with our friend because it was so terrible over there. I’ve have secretly been looking into youth homes he can go to but they all have terrible reviews about being discriminatory, rude and not helpful at all. Can someone please give me some options for him to live during the summer. Somewhere safe. ",21Dec2018,1
3,"I’m done overthinking everything and I have become desperate at this point. I’m just going to spill everything and if anyone has any serious thoughts or tips then please, please, please do let me know.

Where do I even start? I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost two years now. Everything was great till the “honeymoon” phase ended and he started being less affectionate and giving me less attention. He used to be ALL over me constantly everyday all the time and it gradually stopped, which left me very sad and surprised. He does tell me he loves me still and does do or say nice things here and there but it’s so rare now compared to before. I can’t help but feel worried that he doesn’t love me anymore. 

I have anxiety and depression which make me quite paranoid, needy and make me overthink everything everyone does or says which is a problem, I know. Before anyone tells me to get therapy, I am going to therapy once a week. My boyfriend knows that I have anxiety and used to reassure me everyday all the time over whatever it was that I needed. However, with time, he slowly stopped doing that as he said it felt exhausting and he doesn’t understand the need to reassure me everyday. I understand his perspective and I know I need to work on this but i’m not sure how.

There have been a few things that have been causing me to be anxious in my relationship which i will list now and want some thoughts back on;

1. he doesn’t really compliment me much as he used to nor does he really smother me with love and affection like before. do you guys think this is a red flag? should I be worried? :( or am i just being clingy and needy?
2. I’m currently on a holiday away from him which makes me miss him even more so he suggested we watch a show together at the same time and all that. I wanted to watch today but he said he couldn’t cause he promised his friend he’d play games with him. It upset me cause like, I’d do anything for him. He knows I’m sad and miss him yet he’s gonna play games with his friend? we watched a little bit of that show yesterday but it was just one episode. I asked him to watch with me today and he said “Sorry, I promised my friend I’d play with him today..I didn’t play much yesterday.” like?? :/ does his friend matter more than I do? it hurts …how would you guys feel about this? is this ok?
3. he has a friend that is going through relationship problems (his friend is engaged to some abusive women and they both cheat on each other) and like my boyfriend mentioned this to me briefly but refuses to tell me things in depth “out of respect for his friend” which bothers me cause like..I tell him everything? I don’t even know this friend, why can’t I know stuff? his friend is also cheating on his finance (she is cheating on him too) and my boyfriend was like “I don’t approve of his actions but I understand why he did it.” like what? he said the whole cheating thing his friend is experiencing is “situational” which was really overwhelming to hear as this whole time we both agreed and talked about how bad cheating was…yet he says this now? I don’t get it and I got upset with him so he said “if your mum cheated on your dad, would you understand?” and I said yes cause they’re in a toxic relationship but I don’t know…it’s just weird…he tried to make me understand but i DONT KNOW…it’s just weird…cheating is never ok :/ he says his just an outlet to his friend and I hope thats all it is… Im scared of being cheated on and hurt.
4. he doesn’t plan dates…it’s usually me that does? he says he’s not creative :/ should this be something I should be upset about? I just wish he’d plan something for once.. :/ he kept telling me he would do all these things for me before we got into a relationship and in the start of it then…it didn’t really happen much or often? :(
5. he didn’t get me anything for christmas and apologized. (he has gotten me gifts for my birthday and other things but just not christmas this time…he apologized. I’m not sure why he hasn’t? He made a comment about being broke so maybe thats it but I don’t know.. I put so much time into his gifts and him…the least he could have done is given me a card..
6. he doesn’t tweet about me or show me off as much as he used to..he rarely mentions me and it makes me sad. :/

I think i’ll just stop there.. I feel like a stupid cry baby but I can’t tell if I’m losing my mind and my anxiety is driving me nuts or if these are all red flags and I need to do something. I just want some guidance. I do not want to break up with him as I’m so madly in love with him. If he didn’t love me then he wouldn’t have stayed with me or been with me right now, right? or am I stupid.. :( 

I’m desperate for tips, thoughts and advice.  please don’t leave any snarky or rude comments as that’s the last thing I need right now.

tl;dr 

 weird phase in my relationship right now, honeymoon phase over and I’m anxious.",21Dec2018,1

I'm kinda' being lazy right now and just asking for any advice or tips on how to play Santa. 

Descriptive side note, I'm also quite young, super lanky, black and the costume is like 5 sizes too big (says ""one size fits all"" and it really would fit all!).

7,"Talked to a good friend today who told me that she's been to a club recently and that her drink has been spiked and she experienced panic attacks and blackout etc. Made me remember a certain evening I had at the same venue. I always blamed it on just too much alcohol, but now I'm not too sure and want to hear your opinion.

So, before we went there we drank a bit, but just moderately. So yes, I was pretty drunk, but still capable. At the club I only had one more drink. I only remember a few fragments, one being dropping my purse, the other throwing up at a McDonalds after we left. My friends told me that I was acting way more aggressive than normal and shouting and cursing at anyone, even though I'm normally a rather calm person. They brought me home at some point, and I remember that I couldn't manage to unlock my door. Other than that, everything is wiped.

Are there any substances that make you aggressive? And would people even drug a male, isn't that off of the stereotype? Opinions?",21Dec2018,1

He had this friend (lets call him A) who i never saw or thought in a million years as someone i would go for.

We ended up dating and fast forward to now, we've been together for a year. So now ""C"" came back to my state and has been hanging out with us since hes been back. I thought my feelings for him were gone but I can't help myself to think about him alot and stare at him. I purposely make conversation with him just so i can look into his eyes. The feelings i had for him have all came back. ""A"" and I live together and idk what to do. Im in love with ""C"" and I was inlove with him first. What should I do?  ",21Dec2018,1
13,"Background: I have known her (she’s 20 now) since 2014 and we have been really good friends since early 2017. Around that time we got back in touch and unlike last time I talked to her (2016), she was just doing alright, ambitious, basically everything was okay and it has been like this since then. 

Until this October. She got together with her (ex) boyfriend (he’s older than her, 22-24 I think) this August and they broke up this October. Before they broke up, she told me that she just can’t do it anymore, that they are just arguing and that he humiliated her. After that she just told me she was depressed because of the break up. 

We then haven’t talked for some time - we both were busy because of school - until recently when she told me more. She said she was still crying daily, she felt down and she believed she was a piece of shit. She said he told her that “she is sick, she is not worthy of any respect and that she should go fuck herself”. I was glad that she at least broke up with him but as it turns out, she is still coming back to him and chatting with him - that is, until they argue again. 

I told her that she should leave him, that she deserves better, that nobody should be treated this way, I tried to talk her out of his and suggested cutting him out of her life forever and moving on but despite all he did to her, she still loves him and says that she is fine now and that she would feel depressed again if she stopped chatting with him. She also said that she wants to get better, that she knows this is wrong and that she tried to move on and forget him several times, but without success

I honestly don’t know what to do. She’s my best friend who lifted me up when I needed it and I really want to help her but I feel like I just can’t do this anymore. This friendship has been draining my energy for the past 4 months and it was mentally demanding as well. And despite saying she wants to get better, I don’t feel she really wants that and as a result I’m trying to help even though she doesn’t want that

At this point, I could think of these 4 options: 
A) I will keep telling her that she should move on from him (and that is for good)
B) I will just accept that she’s doing fine now and will hope that one day she will do the right one (or that she will learn what was the right thing in a hard way)
C) Go “idle” and mind my own business until she decides she really wants to move on
D) Part our ways

Can you please tell me what should I do now? Thank you very much! ",21Dec2018,1
14,"My good friend that I’ve known for a couple of years doesn’t seem very close to me anymore. We used to hang out and call each other for hours on end but recently I’ve noticed he’s so much more different than me in so many ways. For example, our music tastes: I’m a hip hop and metal fan, I love that stuff and it’s something I’ve had an interest in for for a really long time (acquired this taste after I met him) and he prefers a more chill, ambient, classical piece of music. Also, our humor has changed a lot as well: I’ll send him videos and tell him things about how I find *insert a video/any form of media* pretty funny and he’ll nitpick every part of it apart and criticize every part I enjoy and it kind of ruins it for me. Also, I’ve been in a pretty bad situation with money and just in general family issues for a while and I’ll tell this guy about it and he’ll just say something along the lines of “that sucks, I’m sorry to hear that dude.” But expect me be supportive of him all the time. Also, when in the middle of a conversation he’ll say something along the lines of “sorry one sec” or “brb for a sec” and then just not text back. 

Anyway, I just want to know how I can break him off as easy as possible, I met this guy in school and I’ve moved since then but I can’t just ghost him as I’d see that is just generally mean and I know exactly how that feels as I know he describes me as his closest friend for the sole reason of “I’ve known you for the longest so yeah” and he’ll constantly text me but sometimes never respond when I text him.",21Dec2018,1
15,"Fair warning this is probably going to get pretty long since there’s a good amount of important details but I’d appreciate any advice. I’ve been dating the same girl since I was 17, I’m now 21, and things have been pretty good overall. We’ll call her Ashley. There was the usual bumps in the road that comes with a high school and college relationship but we’ve managed. At around 18 another girl entered my life. By entered I mean I had a class with her and developed a huge crush on her, but of course never acted because I was/am in a relationship. We’ll call this girl Sam for the sake of the this post. The final year of high school came and went without much interaction between myself and Sam but in the minimal interactions we did have there was undeniable chemistry there. Fast forward to a year later and I’m still with Ashley, and occasionally thinking about Sam. I then run into Sam at a local food store she works at and we have a small conversation that again feels like there’s chemistry. Some more time passes and I haven’t really thought about Sam and things with Ashley are still great, until Ashley tells me that all throughout our relationship Sam has been consistently inquiring if we were still together and making comments about how she finds me attractive. I ignore this comments as to not mess with what me and Ashley have. Fast forward again until now and I’m still with Ashley but these past few weeks I’ve been thinking about Sam a ton. I should also mention I’m not quite feeling the same about Ashley and have been considering breaking up with her. Another key fact is Sam has a boyfriend. Now I guess my question is do I break up with Ashley based on my recent feelings despite 4 good years together? Do I pursue Sam like I’ve subconsciously wanted to for a while now despite her being in a relationship? How do I deal with my fear of ending up alone if I do end things with Ashley and Sam isn’t interested anymore?

16,"Short Version:  in the 90s my grandfather built my a doll house, I never got to take it home.  Both my grandparents passed away last year and it needs a new home before the house is sold.  It is very precious to me and my extended family.

Long Version:

In the 90s, my grandfather built me a doll house.  My grandmother I decorated it together.  It is a very large doll house.  My father refused to allow my grandparents bring it to our home (he said it wouldn't fit thru the doors, but as an adult I recognize this as the cheap excuse it was.  There were/are many ways to get into a room including using a window or partially disassembling it.)


So it stayed at my grandparents house.  Over the years, all of my cousins, my mother's cousin, and MANY other children have played with it, love it, and hold it in a special place of endearment.  While it hurt that I could never have it strictly as my own, it is a great pride to me that it has brought joy to so many.


Fast-forward to now and both my grandparents have passed away (unexpectedly).  Their house is up for sale and my brother is living their to prevent squatters (that's a problem in that area).  He has a son and a girl (not his daughter) over for the weekends.  The girl LOVES the house.  She 100% thinks it's hers.  She is four or five, the family has explained to her its not hers many times.

My brother wants to give it her.  My aunts want me to finally HAVE it in my home (they are willing to drive it across country to my home.)  And I am stuck in the middle.  


While this other girl is like a niece to me, I am well-aware I may not be in contact with her ten years from now.  So basically if I wanted the doll house back when she grew out of it, it is not guaranteed.  

My brother's next place (after the house is sold) will be bachelor pad size and he is not known for taking good care of the items in his possession.  The girl's mother is similar in that regard.  My mother shares my concerns that the doll will lost or damaged should it be entrusted to a guardian of the girl.  

My father still refuses allow the doll house in his house after 20+ years and the death of my grandparents/his in-laws.


While I have other cousins, my brother and I are the only ones of our generation with kids.  I have all boys.  My husband and I are the most likely to have the next child (when you look at the current status of me and my cousins) but we aren't even planning on that.


I feel terrible about taking my doll house from this little girl, but at the same point in time I don't want to leave it with her for fear of losing something I worked on with my grandparents and which has become a family heirloom.

19,"I was debating posting this on the jobs subreddit, but I thought a lot of the thoughts that I’m going to share aren’t really important there. 
Okay so I’m just going to start here. When I was in high school I did great, I ended with a 4.2 gpa and I was great at math. When I graduated I had a few scholarships, but I had no idea what I wanted to do. The first thing I thought was to go to nursing school like a lot of women in my family had, my mom, my sister, my aunt. So I did. When I got into nursing school I was the youngest person there and I’ve never really gotten along with people well, so I didn’t join study groups or anything like that, mainly because I felt like an outsider. These people talked about how their career as a nurse meant so much to them and how they were so proud, meanwhile I was just there for the job. So after 3 semesters of struggle unlike anything I had experienced in high school, I graduated and passed the state boards first try. I think the teachers could sense that I wasn’t into it because they regularly made remarks asking if I really wanted to be a nurse or if it was just family pressuring me and things of that sort. 

So here I am almost 2 years later, I’m an LPN and I don’t see a successful or happy career in healthcare in my future. I feel like if I stay where I am I’ll be miserable. I want to go to school for math or maybe science. I don’t know what careers I would be suited for, but those are the things I was good at. I don’t want to be stuck earning $35k a year, I’m tired of living paycheck to paycheck. But I don’t think I’d make as much if I were to start over somewhere else without schooling, and I don’t think I’m in a good mental health place to go back to school. Even if I was I’d have no idea what I’d do. One of my biggest problems is that I thrive when people tell me what to do. And I feel like a lot of good careers are centered around you being in charge and deciding what to do, and I just can’t do that. 

I just don’t k ow what to do and the thought that my life might be like this forever is causing me so much stress that I usually just shut down whenever I start to think about it.",21Dec2018,1
20,"So, I recently was hired with a company. I’ve only been there for 3 days so far. It is a salaried position, but the salary pay does not kick in until mid-January because I’m training and only working 3 days a week up until then. 

When I was hired, I was just asked to bring my ID + social security card. There was no mention of a drug test and I wasn’t asked to take one. There was also no mention/verbiage of a drug test when I signed the employment contract. I’ve filled out my tax forms and will be submitting my info for direct deposit. 

My question is, because my salary pay doesn’t kick in until mid-Jan, is there a possibility that they will ask me to take a drug test that day?

I smoke pot at night. I’ve been abstaining for it for a month now because of the job search and I wanted to practice some self control. I do not use any other substances.

24,"The gentleman that lives nextdoor has been their a very long time. Never married. Buried both parents. Never left home. Not sure what kinda religion he is. He has stated before that he is a ""Moonie"" or whatever the correct term is.  He has a website for his ""broadcast"" he does all the time. This man lives on disability and gets his parents insurance checks. Very socially awkward, naive,very sweet and kind but.. also does some quirky and dingy things. Since I have lived here, He has a small trailer in his yard. An ex-felon has lived in it before and it caused alarm.. I have children..so this mama bear is on guard always. So this man moved out of trailer, never saw or heard from again. Fast forward to September of this year. . ANOTHER male moved into the trailer. No car, No job.. I noticed him each morning at the school bus stop with my children. When we asked about this man, neighbor said he came here from another state and needed help getting back on his feet. OK, logical answer, being kind and gracious to a complete stranger made my hairs stand up on edge. So every morning and every afternoon I saw this man walk down our road to the gas station near us and come back with smokes and a few items to eat or drink I assume..but who knows. By the end of October I noticed more activity and that the man was allowed to come shower and use the bathroom in the neighbors home, their was not a working toilet or shower in the small trailer. A light would always be on at night and then in the very early morning hours. About 2 weeks before Thanksgiving, I stopped seeing the man who was staying in the trailer. I tried not to think too much about it. However, after Thanksgiving I saw my neighbor with gloves, sacks of black garbage bags, cleaner, and boxes. He was cleaning out the trailer. He left the trailer door open to air it out during the day. I still dunno what happened to that man or if he was able to get a job or if something else could have happened. In January of 2019 He is supposed to have 2 twin male brothers come live in the trailer. They are coming from New York. In my mind I'm thinking.. there is absolutely nothing here to offer them in our town. Very rural, quiet.. and although it is 20 minutes away from downtown Birmingham, AL. it  still bothers me that he just lets strangers come live here with no true knowledge about them or anything. It is just unsettling to me..call me paranoid, fine..maybe I deserve that too but you cant be too careful nowadays. In the meantime.. I keep my eyes and ears open and lay low.

25,"My brother just completed his first semester of community college and isn’t doing well. Barely passed two classes, failed his third. 2/3 of them were college prep classes (i.e. classes under 100 designed to get students up to college-level work).

He’s been kicked out of my moms house, and I on the verge of being kicked out of my dads. He spends his days in bed with the curtains drawn and his juul &amp; weed vape. He’s upset about his circumstances in life but isn’t doing anything to change it.

Hes 18 years old. He thinks he’d be fine on his own, but I know for a fact he wouldn’t be. I was kicked out when I was his age for different reasons, and i know first hand how incredibly difficult adult life can be, especially when pursuing a college career. I was lucky to have the support of my grandparents, and am now working towards my B.A. at UC Berkeley. He doesn’t have the same drive for school, and my grandparents told me that they aren’t willing to extend the same support for him that they did for me (if he does get kicked out).

I want to help him out, but it’s hard to communicate with him. He gets incredibly defensive and shuts down when I bring up areas in his life that he needs to improve on. He had so much passion and potential, and it’s heartbreaking watching him squander it. How do I get thru to him?

I live alone with my cat--which is the best living situation I've had so far. My life is SO much better than it's ever been--even my older family members seem to think I have my shit together.

I've tried so many things to try to optimize my performance. I've even been forcing myself to go to bed early enough to get a full night's sleep for the past couple weeks. I've been making time to write three pages of stream of consciousness writing every day. I have a special place where I can rant about stuff when I need to. I've grown up with cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. I force myself to do fun things almost every day in order to decompress. I feel like I should have no excuse.

Yet I still feel like my life is completely chaotic, like everything's falling apart. All this shit I have to do keeps piling up and there's never any end to it. Tomorrow I have to call a bunch of doctors to schedule and reschedule doctor's appointments and I have to go to the store and I also have to buy groceries tonight or tomorrow and I've been putting both of those things off for days now and it feels horrible. My living room is covered in boxes from packages I've ordered for getting ready for Christmas. My kitchen is covered in dishes and I'm out of clean bowls and normal spoons. It seems like when I change something or add a new thing on that's supposed to help (like this getting enough sleep thing) I'll feel great for a few days, and then I end up feeling like shit again.

When I make a switch from working full time to school and part time work, or from school and part time work to full time work, it's the same--I feel really good and relieved for a few days and then I start to feel like shit. I feel like I'm having this weird combination of never having enough time to get anything done and not being able to MAKE myself do the things when it's time to do them.

I feel like I've done SO MUCH SHIT to try to fix all these problems. I don't WANT to deal with this for the rest of my life. I have goals I want to accomplish. I'm so passionate about so many things and I'm so in love with this world and I have so man amazing people. I don't have TIME to feel like shit!

Am I doing something wrong? Is there something I'm missing? Is there something wrong with me? What the hell do I need to do to fix this?

A little context:
In the month of November, we had sex on two occasions, one during her fertile period and one about a week before her period was supposed to come. 

Both times we had used a condom, but during the second occasion I found out the condom dried out midway and I stopped penetrating once I found out.

Both times I had withdrawn before ejaculating away from the vagina. So it's condom + withdrawal.

My GF's period was supposed to come on the 12th, but till now it hasn't come. She said that she hasn't had a late period in a very long time, so the both of us are quite worried that pregnancy might have occurred.

We have also googled for some early signs of pregnancy, but she says that there's none of which she agrees and relates with.

Dear redditors:
What are the chances that my GF is actually pregnant? Like it would be good to get a rough gauge from you guys, or better if there are any legit statistics of pregnancy rates using two birth control measures?

34,"This post ended up being super long and I brought up a bunch of problems other than the priority issue in the title. Sorry in advance.


—


I've been seeing this coworker who works in the same coffee shop as me for around two months. We both started working at the cafe around 3 months ago, he started 1-2 weeks earlier than me. 



Our personalities are very different: I'm extroverted and make friends really fast, while he is more introverted and warms up to people very slowly. Although he started working earlier than me, I became friends with everyone in around a week while he still has a lot of coworkers he barely talks to.


Around a month after I started working at the cafe he asked me out for dinner. It was pretty out of the blue for me because I never felt a heavy vibe that he was interested in me. I've noticed him glance at me a lot during work but he never really talked to me much. The first few dates were slightly awkward, he's just a pretty quiet guy so there were a lot of silences. Now after two months he's warmed up and talks a lot more but he's still a pretty quiet person in general. Which is totally okay, I would never try to change him and I'm content with the silence.


I feel very comfortable and relaxed when I'm with him,  he just brings out the calm side in me. My sisters and close coworkers all say that he's the type of person you just can't dislike, They don't seem to especially love him, but they describe him as a nice and decent guy.


He takes things very slowly, and I like that. It took around 3 weeks for us to hold hands and cuddle and almost a month more for us to kiss. It works for me because we're just trying to get to know each other and taking it slowly gives me more time to think things through. Everything happened so quick in my previous relationship that it was a blur to me, and I regretted it. So I appreciate him taking things slow.


Around a month in seeing each other I tried to end things because I felt like I didn't really know where things were going and I had concerns over the fact that he was Christian while I'm not anything (agnostic I suppose). I told him that I didn't want to get into anything that won't end well and it was unfair for me to keep seeing him if I'm so flaky. We never truly addressed the religion issue so it just kept building up in me, I also tend to think too much sometimes.


I tried to do it right and say it in person at a cafe or something but I ended up having to tell him at my house. It made it a lot harder for me to say it to his face, so I didn't say it very well. I sounded very insincere and weird. Also I think I wasn't completely sure if I wanted to end things, but since we never talked about our feelings that much I felt like I was going to explode if I didn’t say anything about my doubts and concerns. I also just needed to know what he was thinking.  The vibe and location was not right to have that conversation, and all he said was ""okay, thanks for letting me know"". I felt extremely bad since he had to awkwardly leave the house afterwards.


In the end, he called me and asked me for the reason, and we talked about it over the phone properly. He said that his intention was to date me, and he just wanted to take it slowly so we could get to know each other (which I appreciate and like). He said that if we were to date he wouldn't just commit to me as a couple (only see me etc), but he would also commit to our problems, and we can work through it together. He said he didn't know I was thinking that much about the religion aspect and he was sorry that I was having bad thoughts (I was worried that he wished I were Christian and I was scared that I would be judged by his friends and family). I told him that I wasn’t a virgin and everything, and he said that wasn’t his expectation. He told me we couldn’t have sex (before marriage), and I said I know and I wasn’t seeing him to have sex either etc. He said that he doesn’t expect me to convert to Christianity and I shouldn’t feel pressured.

A lot of it was irrational but I think also necessary fear, because it’s an issue that will always be there. But he’s not judgemental at all, and his family seems very chill regarding the religion part. His sister is not Christian and she lives with her boyfriend. So we managed to talk it out, kinda. I told him I needed to think more and I told him to think more as well (whether or not he actually wants to date a non-Christian girl).


After thinking it out for a few days, I told him that no matter what happens, whether we date or not or anything, it would be worth it with him and I would like to try. I trust that if things don’t work out we will still be okay. He said he thought a lot more and his decision is the same. So we’re still seeing each other.

That all happened a month ago, so I try not to overthink the religion part and he isn’t trying to not talk about it now as well. Other than working at the coffee shop he’s also an intern at a church, and he never really talked about the things he was doing before.


The thing is, I think I’m just really scared of investing, liking, and ultimately loving someone.


The previous relationship I had ended very badly. It my first relationship and it was only 4 months long. Long story short I wanted to break up with my ex many times before because I just didn’t like him that much. Thinking back, I think I got together with him because I moved across the country and just needed company because I was lonely. I never brought it up though because I felt like he never did anything wrong, and it was wrong on my part to drag it on. Anyways, turned out he was a liar, and I found his Tinder a day after he ghosted me. I slept for 15 hours for the first week (I kept track), and it messed me up for a month. For me it wasn’t as much a broken heart, because I never loved him, it was just a very very deep sense of betrayal. I never doubted him and I fully trusted him, and even though I didn’t like him as much as I should’ve, I was never anywhere close to being unfaithful.


I know for a fact that the guy I’m seeing is 10x better than my ex (my sisters say that too), and that he’s just not the type of person to do that to someone. At least I hope so. I focused very hard on not getting jaded by my previous relationship, so I don’t think I have any baggage except for being scared of the potential hurt I’ll feel if things don’t end well. It was already excruciatingly painful when things ended with a guy I didn’t even like that much, I can’t imagine how horrible it will feel if I invest.


Sorry for the super long backstory, but I needed to let you guys get a grasp on where I’m coming from.


The issue I have now, is that I’ve been feeling very depressed the past month.


My sister has been very depressed and has anxiety issues lately so I feel like I don’t have the right to tell her my problems since she’s having it way worse than me. She's been staying over at her boyfiends place a lot too, so she hasn't been home for the past week. All of my close friends are either halfway across the country or they’re on vacation, so I can't reach out to them either. I also can’t talk to the guy I’m seeing because he’s a main part of why I’m so sad. 


I've just been crying at home the past month, and I feel like I have no one to reach out to.


There’s a few things that’s been bothering me and I don’t know how to bring it up to him.

First of all, around a week ago his internship friends from the church came over to our coffee shop, and I served them (I’m front of house cashier, he’s barista). But he never bothered to tell me that they were coming, or that they were his friends, or introduced us. We barely talk at work, and that’s mainly because I don’t want to seem unprofessional at work since most people know that we’re seeing each other. But it just felt weird that he didn’t tell me. It wasn’t until I saw his Instagram story (he shared the story he was tagged in), that I realized they were there.

He wasn't trying to hide the fact that they came, since he shared the Instagram story. When I brought it up to him afterwards that I didn’t realize those were his friends, he talked about it naturally too. But if it were me, I would’ve introduced him to my friends. I wouldn’t necessarily say that we're seeing each other, but I would go at least say “Hey, this is my coworker xxx”. I don’t think they even knew about me, yet he said he was very close friends with the other church interns.


I would just suppose that if you were intending on dating someone, you'd naturally introduce them to your friends? Even if I wasn't planning on dating someone, I would probably still introduce my friends to my coworkers.


Another thing is that his parents have come to visit him and his sister for Christmas, they live across the county so they don’t get to see each other often. I don’t know if it was because of what I said before, or if he just doesn’t want them to “officially” meet me (which I genuinely think is okay since we’re not dating). But I feel like he’s purposely trying to not let his parents meet me. Before his parents came I said that I probably can’t go to his house for a while, and I said “you get what I mean right?” And he said he understood. To be honest I don’t really know what my intention was when I said that but I just said it. Anyways, I don’t usually work Mondays, but this week I did. And when I showed up to work he said “Oh I thought you don’t usually work Mondays”, and I didn’t think much of it. It wasn’t until later I realized that his parents came to the coffee shop after I got off work, so I felt like he was purposely trying not to let us meet.


Also, I don’t have any plans for Christmas, and I told him that I’ll probably just stay at home since my family isn’t here and my sister has plans. He told me his family is going to have dinner and some friends are going to join too. But he didn’t ask if I wanted to join.


He invited me over to the place he’s sharing with his sister and his sister’s boyfriend on our 3rd or 4th date, and they both seemed very chill. He’s seen my sister and her boyfriend too. So I don't know if he's trying to hide me or what.


He doesn’t use his phone very often. He’s not materialistic (thrifts everything) and isn’t really into social media (rarely posts on social media). When we’re together he never uses his phone and he rarely uses it when we’re in a group setting or when he’s at work too.


But the main thing that brought up all these emotions is that he’ll “forget” to reply to me. A few days ago he messaged me via snapchat, and said that we should plan a time to meet up soon, and I replied the next day, but he opened the message and but didn’t reply. I didn’t think much because he sometimes gets distracted and replies later. But 5 hours later, he messages the work group chat to ask a question, yet still didn’t reply to me. And that's when I got really upset and messaged him ""you have an issue with replying"".


He apologized and said that he read it after he woke up and forgot to reply, and he asked what I sent again. I didn’t bother replying. I don’t think I’m overreacting, since this isn’t the first time. Before he sometimes would just stop replying, and I’m genuinely okay with that. Since someone has to eventually stop the conversation. But it really gets on my nerves if someone leaves you on read when it’s a message that needs a reply. Especially since he was the one who asked.


I know for a fact that if he cared, he wouldn’t forget. And I think it's stupid that I even needed to bring it up as if I was begging for attention. I think it's basic manners and to reply to someone. If it wasn't the fact that we're seeing each other, I wouldn't give really give a fuck. But it means a lot more if the person you're seeing ""forgets"".


He’s not a very organized person in general, there was once he almost forgot he had work, or he almost forgot that we were supposed to do something on a certain day. He doesn’t have a schedule or anything like that, he's pretty much a mess. But, the more I think about it the more I feel like I’m probably not his priority, that’s why he could forget. I would never forget if I was in the middle of making plans with someone I liked, even if I were a mess.


We still met up the day after that at a coffee shop for two hours, but I was feeling upset and down so I was really distracted the whole time. He tried to hold my hand like usual and we did for a while but I just wasn’t feeling it so I let go, I didn’t reach for his hand like usual afterwards. We had normal random chatting and it was soso, but when he asked how I was doing and I almost cried because I’ve just been depressed with work, school, and my issues with him.. I didn't know how to explain so I just said ""I don’t know"". He knows that I've been weird the past month so he said that I could talk to him, but I said that I didn’t really want to. He didn’t ask any further, and then he left (he needed to do some coffee shop training afterwards).


I’m not trying to test him, it’s just I genuinely don’t know what I could say to him. I haven't told any of my friends how I've been feeling either, since no one wants to hang out with a person that feels like shit. I don't think anyone knows how I'm really feeling, all I’ve said was that I’ve been a bit down. 


Yesterday he messaged me on snapchat to say good night and that we should meet up soon because “he feels like it’s been weird between us the past few days or like there’s a weird tension”. And I don’t know how to feel about that. It seems like he cares yet he also seems like he doesn't.


I don’t know what to say to him or how to bring up all these mashed up feelings, am I thinking too much? How do I reach out? I don't know anymore. I feel like maybe I should just stop all of this before I invest even more feelings because he clearly doesn’t care.

- Friend has re-added me on the game, though I don't know if this means anything. The thing is there is a bug that sends some friend requests twice (so the old request from when I first started playing the game may have still been there), so maybe he just auto-accepted it. 
- He has not blocked me anywhere. Though when we talked, where he found out what happened, I was the last person to send a message. I have not sent anything new. 
- Last thing he said was  ""I did care about you that whole time"" context is: he was absent and I had irrationally thought he didn't care about me. So, it's past tense means he doesn't care anymore, or am I reading too much into it?
- I had scheduled a gift on steam a bit ago for Christmas. I don't really want to cancel it, but I don't know if this will be seen as too pushy. It's just a thing I usually do for my internet friends, get them a game on steam, and I had scheduled the gift a while ago, as I said. 
- I told one of our mutual friends about what I did, and I've been talking to that friend. I didn't do anything like asking him to help me fix it, I know it's my mistake and I have to do that myself. 

Ultimately, I'm probably being impatient. I just would like to hear thoughts on this, if any of you have them. Do I wait until he says something? ",21Dec2018,1
38,"Little back story first:

We met a while ago and at first it started out as a’ see where this goes’ kind of fling. I ended up with feelings and she didn’t and I confronted her about them, told her how I felt and she didn’t feel the same way. Although it sucked, I felt better and it was for the better. Fast forward a few months, we became very good friends and she started dating a guy she knew from a while ago, I am very happy for them. I lost any and all emotional drive or feelings for her other than being friends and her and said boyfriend are great for other (he’s a really good guy).

Recently, she’s moved. I went to visit a few weekends ago, her boyfriend was there also visiting (they’re in a serious long distance relationship for the time being). We had plans for the whole weekend and it was a blast, we all had a great time and it was great to meet her new friends also who we were out with us all weekend. 

So here’s the meat and potatoes, we all drank all weekend. Alcohol is a lovely thing, isn’t it? I rarely Black out. There’s more times than not that some parts of the night I don’t remember, and this was the case this Friday night. Some of the night isn’t very clear to me at all. Again, it happens. Apparently, this part I missed. I told her I still had feelings for her. I don’t not remember this at all. And I do not have feelings for her anymore either. I love the friendship that we now have, and that’s it. 

I don’t remember the conversation, what it was about, how it got brought up, how I said this to her, what exactly it was that I said, when I said this, or any bit of detail regarding this. But apparently I did. Remember, this was on Friday night. 

Saturday was completely normal (other than being hungover). She didn’t say anything, didn’t act any different, or hint at anything. Saturday came and went, we again had a blast. I was actively talking to other women and doing my own thing until it was time to take care of some people in our group and that ended the night earlier (and more different) than expected and how I’d hoped. 

Sunday got here, we were hungover again and I had to leave. Got my flight and headed home. It was a great fun fast tiring weekend. Or I thought it was. Couple days went by, not much talking. Much less than usual. Didn’t think too much of it though, we have a few days like this from time to time. Then it keeps persisting and I ask what’s up, so she tells me this. 

She’s upset about it and thought we were in a good spot just being friends. My stomach dropped when I read the message that I said this. It seriously upsets me because I don’t have those feelings anymore. At one point in time, yes I did. And I had already had that discussion with her. Now I don’t and I’m actively looking for other relationships or at least seeing what happens. She’s upset and confused now, and I can understand why. I still don’t know why I would have said that to her, and it’s really bothering me. 

I apologized and flat out said I don’t remember saying it. I feel like shit now. I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to ruin our friendship or their relationship or have anything be ruined because of this. I know everyone says ‘drunk mind is sober thoughts’ or some variation of that. Hell, I say it all the damn time. But I’ve never been in this situation before, and I’m just realizing that it’s not always true. I’m giving her time and space because she’s obviously still upset about it and that’s the right thing to do. 

What can I do to right the ship? What about to calm me down, because this really is upsetting me? Has anyone been in this situation before? I really don’t even know what to do at this point anymore....

41,"Hey guys so im 21 years old and my moms 65 years old. When I was younger we fought a lot but it was due to her drinking alcohol, and over the years we got a lot better once she stopped drinking. But recently i find myself getting frustrated with her and I hate to think it is because of her age, but we get in a lot of arguments and I get frustrated. 

For example, i went to go buy antifreeze for her car. The guy said it was 100% and we just have to mix it with water 50/50. I call mom and I tell her exactly that, and she then dismisses what I said and says super slowly,  ""No. That is wrong. You need to get 100% antifreeze not 50/50."" It takes her about 2 minutes to say this. 

She clearly didnt listen to me and we got in a fight when I got home because it just feels she is so adiment on telling me what to do and what I have done wrong. The way I come across is not patient and I admit that but I get frustrated with her and tell her you know you could instead listen to me so you dont have to explain the whole thing from start to finish while I am in line at the store. We fought and then about 10 minutes later she says ""im sorry I was just confused."" Then i said ""you know if your confused just ask me to repeat it and we dont have to go through the whole run down"" 

It is things like this that frustrates me and make me not want to listen to her. Whenever I am doing something she will tell me I should do it a different way and I say no I am fine with cooking my grilled cheese this way. Then she starts saying ""you never want to learn anything and you will get no where in life with that attitude.""

She just explains things so slowly and will get confused on the way of explaining it which takes her a really long time explaining it to her. She doesnt have alziemers and I think its just from her drinking all those years. 

Maybe you guys have similar stories or some advice would be appreciated. I know I should be more patient but I think its cause all of our years of fighting makes me get really frustrated with her and her expecting me to respect her when she doesnt respect me.  Thanks guys. ",21Dec2018,1

I joke about lots of things, like which one of the girls are baddies and teasing a friend about it. We also break out into random song at times, and do impressions. 

However, some of my jokes tend to go too far at times. It gets to a point where the people who DO get paid are giving me friendly warnings from time to time. I went on another sub to ask if I was being an asshole for making these jokes, and others have confirmed that I am. 

I don't mean to do any harm, but it sometimes slips out without a thought. Recently, I was sitting in an office chair and I said, ""You wouldn't hit a guy in a wheelchair, would you?""

46,"So TL;DR on the situation that happened today: Man got off a bus with a skeleton mask and bulletproof vest to (supposedly) get into our school. He realized we started later in the day and scurried off.  And school was cancelled because of it.

Tomorrow the school decided to remain open even after that threat since the police said nothing came of it and was probably some guy going to work. (Because a guy goes to work in a bulletproof vest and a latex mask...right?)... any-who I have 2 finals to take tomorrow but I don’t know if I feel comfortable going knowing the threat is still out there.

48,"I'm a sophmore in high school. In my short high school career, I've maintained a 4.0, but now, my precious GPA is threatened. I know that it isn't the biggest deal in the grand scheme of life, but's important to me. Not only that, but my friends and grandparents are counting on me to get have all A's. As of now, I do have all A's, but that could change.

Three weeks ago, I had to go hunting with my dad for a week. This seriously set me back in Algebra 2 in homework and I also missed a chance to retake a test (my lowest test score). My school offers a double-up math so you're basically getting twice the math as you would normally. I remember turning in homework awhile back, but apparently it was never graded. This caused my work habits to be very low. I have since got it back up to an A but it is on the verge (91.2 and I need at least an 89.5). I have to score over 92 to maintain my grade. I already took the first half of the final (non-calculator portion) and I didn't feel that I did great on it (I did good?).  Of course, that is the harder part. Tomorrow I have the calculator portion which I have to do well on. 

I know that it isn't ideal to wait this long to bring up ungraded homework (literally thr last day). I falsely believed that my grade would be fine without it anyway. What should I do? Please offer serious advice only. Thank you.

Most of the people I help are just looking to mooch off the state for benefits and don’t actually want to work towards self-sufficiency. I’d say 8/10 of my cases are like that.

For those who lived on campus and then moved off campus in their later years at college, how did you go about finding a new roommate?

I'm in a very happy situation with my current roommate. We were randomly matched our freshman year. We're both juniors now, and I want to live off campus next year. Her sister will be a freshman at the same school our senior year, and she wants to live on campus with her sister to keep her sister on track. Which leaves me potentially in need of a roommate.

I'm not against the idea of living alone, but it's so much cheaper to split the rent with someone.

So how do you go about finding a new roommate? How exactly would I word an advertisement that essentially contains the message ""I live on campus currently and am looking to not live on campus next year. Will anyone have a vacancy or be willing to rent for 1 school year with me?"" I don't think of myself as particularly picky, but I've been told it's unreasonably picky to prefer your roommate(s) don't have a cat, aren't smokers, and aren't into incense, essential oils, etc since I get scent-triggered migraines and can't handle those things.

57,"I don't mean methods for dealing with bouts of anger like breathing, I mean like I've been varying levels of constantly angry for nearly two months now and I'm tired of this. I want to be able to feel other emotions again. 

Why am I angry? It's a very very long story. I'm a messed up person. I have borderline personality disorder and that's kept me from ever holding a lasting or healthy relationship be it an actual relationship, a friendship, or something in between. My mother psychologically and emotionally abused me for my entire childhood ending in what I assume caused my disorder. Shortly after I turned 18 I started seeing a psychologist. After 2 months of meetings she threatened to call the police in 48 hours to have me forcefully admitted if I did not admit myself into a drug and psychological rehab facility over a fear that I would hurt myself or someone else. I spent 5 days in rehab and was prescribed very heavy medication (Seroquel and Ambien at the same time) before being approved for release if I so chose. I went home, and my mom forced me to get rid of the medication because she was scared that I would abuse them or they were unsafe. Two weeks after going home from the rehab facility, my family had a ""meeting"" with me and told me that they couldn't live with someone who had a ""dangerous"" disorder like I had and that I had 1 week to find a new place to live or I would come home from work with everything I own on the sidewalk. They changed every lock in the house that night. I got a cheap apartment, and a second full time job and worked 100+ hour weeks every week for close to a year before I got a promotion and could quit my night job. Fast forward 6 months I got an even better job, moved 4 hours away, and life improved a lot. I no longer struggle for money and can buy more than 1 days food at a time. Fastforward almost 3 years to today. I'm still left fucked up though. I have no sympathy for anyone. I have no trust for anyone which is a huge part of why I can't hold a relationship for more than 2 months. I'm unbearably lonely all the time because of that. I only have 1 friend who even puts up with me at this point because nobody wants to be friends with someone whos mood changes from annoyingly happy to suicidal in minutes.

I started talking to this incredible girl around 3 months back. I fell for her instantly. She started to fall for me a week or so after, but was hesitant because she has anxiety problems. It gets to a point where she asks how I'm so perfect and understanding to her, so I breakdown to her. I explain that I have x disorder, and that I'm in a much better place now mentally, but I still have extreme abandonment and trust issues and that it would take a very long time to fix, but all I need is someone who wouldn't leave me and I'll get better over time. I wanted to and still want to get better. She responded and said that she was completely understanding and that she was okay with having to work on both of our mental health. She accepted me for who I was despite my plentiful and clearly laid out problems. It was the most incredible feeling I've ever felt in my life. Guess how that situation went. 6 days after our 1 month proceeding a big fight she cut it with me because she changed underestimated what I told her.She just didn't want to try and work anymore despite her telling me that I treated her better than anyone has before. That absolutely broke me. I've had a lot of people leave me, and I'm used to that, but to have someone expressly say that they accept you and then leave you... it's a whole other kind of hurting.Every day since then I've felt so depressed and helpless, and that feeling of helplessness makes me angry so I just get explosively upset at any small thing that happens.

Humans are social creatures. We need other people to be healthy. All I want is to have someone who won't leave me but I know without a doubt in my mind now that because of the particular way I'm messed up, I'm not capable of having relationships or being with people. I don't know what to do anymore. The only ""cure"" for BPD is talk therapy, but I obviously don't trust therapists anymore, and I actively subconsciously make myself such a toxic person because I'm so scared of abandonment that people cannot be around me for more than a couple months at the most.

He was a porn addict and would watch it next to me, offer it to me, and try to get me to hookup with his girlfriends (this was when I was 12). When I was around 13 I stopped talking to him. Things were REALLY bad. We lived in the same house and I never made eye contact with him again once I knew what was happening. He tried to fist fight me (ever since I could remember) every day and eventually I resorted to kicking him in the balls (daily) to protect myself. I was suicidal because of my home situation.

69,"The two of us have been friends for many, many years now. We don't live close by, so it's not like we can just meet up whenever we want; however, we're very close nevertheless, regularly texting and calling one another.

Last month, we had a really nasty fight. I caught them in lie, wherein they attempted to gaslight me by saying something that directly contradicted what they had said before, and changed their story when I called them out on it. I then speculated openly as to why they were lying to me, at which point they flew into a blind rage - they resorted to calling me names (narcissist, bitch), denigrating every aspect of my character, downplaying my place in their life, bringing up past arguments from a long time ago as if they had only happened yesterday, etc. The next time we spoke, I provided evidence of them lying to me, which I managed to find very easily following a quick Google search; they changed their story *yet again*, and accused me of violating their privacy.

Since the conversation ended, they've been been giving me the silent treatment, refusing to answer any attempt I make at texting them. I was hoping to talk through our differences, or at least reconcile and move on. This is not the first time they've attempted to gaslight me, or behaved in this manner after I said something they didn't like. I thought they had outgrown their past habit of lying, but this episode proved differently. Even so, I feel really bad about it. The two of us generally get along very well. It's just that my friend angers *so easily*, and I never know how to defuse the situation.

I've been thinking about sending them a Christmas letter and maybe a gift card for the holidays. I know it's a little late, but I thought that it might help to make amends, or even serve as a means of initiating a dialogue about our issues. Besides, I like to bring some cheer into their life wherever I can. They've been going through tough times and could use whatever support they can get. Is the Christmas card a bad idea?",21Dec2018,1
70,"I’ve had issues with severe depression ever since I can remember.  I was molested as a child and sexually abused, assaulted, and raped.  Every day I feel like I get slightly worse than I was the day before.  This was by multiple people at various stages in my life.  The first time I lost my virginity was with my boyfriend at the time...I asked him to stop and he refused even though I was crying in pain, which made it a very awful experience.  Later on (before I was with my s.o.), the guy choked me and hurt me during sex (which I didn’t consent to) which has badly traumatized me, given me nightmares, and caused a lot of sexual problems.  I have been with my current bf for 5 years and he has been very understanding.  When we first started dating, I didn’t have sexual problems and it was great.  But these past couple of years have been getting progressively worse.  I have found my sex drive has been continuously decreasing, I have been become more severely depressed for longer periods of time and more often, and I have been gaining weight which has led to a big decrease in self-esteem.  I just have no interests in anything anymore.  I love my bf and we have had a good relationship but I feel like I’m losing myself more and more.  I have tried several therapists in the past, but it’s only made me worse and I don’t have the money for it.  I don’t know what the point of living is anymore.  One of my ex bf’s used to guilt me and beg for sex all the time, and it’s had a big impact on me.  With my current bf,  I have continuously had sex when I didn’t want to out of fear of being seen as the “shrill gf” who doesn’t want sex.  But it’s probably made things worse.  My bf started to pick up on this and it made him feel pretty bad, which I still feel bad about.  It’s gotten to the point that I have reoccurring nightmares about all of it.  A big part of the problem is that I just don’t see myself as a sexual being anymore.  I wish it wasn’t like this, but every time I think about it, I get embarrassed or disgusted and can’t get into the mood.  I don’t even masturbate, and I absolutely hate anything other than vanilla stuff.  I worry that my lack of desire and adventure means he’ll eventually leave me.  It just feels so unfair.

I just don’t know how to cope with sexual abuse and be able to have a healthy sexual relationship.  Being used and seen as a sex object has destroyed my sense of well-being.  I can’t help but relate sex with my bf to the feeling of being a sex object, even though it’s not the same thing at all.",21Dec2018,1
71,"Disclaimer:  I am going to be vague on some of the stuff here to keep anyone who might know the situation to figure things out.   

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

Me:  Currently a father two two kids.  Not married (divorced).  Have a great job (six figures).  Emotionally stable and a great father to my current kids.   I have them 50% and shared joint care.   Didn't want any more kids.

Her:  Currently a mother of two.   Not married (divorced).  Has a great job (70k).  Seems to be a great mother to her current kids and has them 90% of the time and primary care.  Wanted another kid (but was ok with not having one).

Our Relationship:  We dated for a while and had an ""oops"" moment.  I certainly had more feelings for her than she did for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Situation:

So after finding all of this out.  I was weighing my options and I wanted to sit down with her and talk through them.   Long and short, she pushed me out and stopped talking/communicating with me.   Would not share any information with me about what was going on.   

I initially went over and told her that I would move in and we would figure it out together and we would go from there.  She said no.   Then went completely silent.  

Now I am finding out that she has severe depression and anxiety.  To the point that she has had to have help with routine tasks when she gets like that.  Something I was not aware of before hand.  

Originally we had more options up front, but now later in the game, the options are getting fewer and fewer because we are unable to communicate and talk through it.   

My concern is the following:

1) I don't have any real say so in this until the end.   I feel helpless that I cannot even help make decisions, and I am getting frustrated that I do not have any control over that.  I have tried talking, calling, stopping over, etc. and nothing.  

2) If she has this type of depression/anxiety, I want to help and figure out what I can do.   In the limited communications, I was told, there isn't anything I can do, and to just deal with it.

3) It feels like this to me (maybe my emotions) that she wanted someone to get her pregnant, and now she is going to call the shots and keep me in the dark.  That she essentially wanted a sperm donor. 

4) How do we raise this kid if one person is not even able to function and talk about the situation?  Is it healthy for a baby to be raised in that situation.  Do I let her raise it so there is less pressure on her due to depression or anxiety?  Do I go for 50/50 and just deal with someone who won't communicate?  Do I try for custody and have the say so?  

I'm really at a loss on this.   Two reasons... I fell for her and it is disappointing that we aren't together.   The second is that we are having a baby and we cannot communicate to figure out whats best for the baby, her family, my family, us, etc.  That's really difficult to know what to do.  

Any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated.   

Side Note:  I don't need anyone telling me that we shouldn't have gotten ourselves in this mess in the first place.   We both realize that.  We both take ownership of that.  We also recognize that mistakes happen and I am trying to figure out how to proceed.

72,"Seeking some feedback on a straining friendship— my college friend and i (f/29 both) have known each other for about 10 years. Early on in the friendship, she really encouraged me to be the best, most ambitious version of myself. I considered us to be pretty close, until some issues beginning about 6-7 months ago. She has had some ups and downs recently, and I know she’s stressed out and not totally happy, but lately things have been over the top.

To provide some background, I’ve been in a relationship with a guy she hates, and she has been very critical of my career path, which i feel has been progressing steadily on a upward trajectory, not due to exceptional talent, but because i have a think skin for stressful situations and i can stick with a situation that’s not ideal long enough to see some kind of positive development. She wanted me to quit and take a lower paying role on contract with someone she knew because after a few difficult days, i had expressed a little annoyance with some aspects while taking her to brunch. When I explained i why I didn’t want to, she got pretty offended and wouldn’t speak to me for a while. Eventually she wanted to hang out again.

Shortly after that, i had a dinner party, and included her as well as some other friends and my SO. She went on a tirade a few days before, claiming she would march out or cause a scene if my SO had bad table manners (?) or annoyed her in any way, which i thought was unreasonable, but I suggested maybe she could just enjoy the dinner and socialize with other mutual friends and not worry too much about him. The night came, and the second he arrived, she marched out, leaving dinner. She didn’t talk to me for a bit after that.

About a month later, i got a few disapproving texts about my work/personal life, followed by a request to be roommates. I didn’t think that was a viable option, considering she can’t stand my SO, and i kind of enjoy having a flat to myself after a long day. After trying to politely deny it, she posts a not very nice message on my social media about settling in work and relationships (plenty of colleagues are on my social media, plus mutual friends of SO), which I wasn’t too pleased about. I just removed the post, and tried to keep my calm.  I ignored any texts for the next 1-2 days, because i was pretty annoyed and didn’t want to explode, and then got some scathing messages about what a horrible friend I’ve been, and how I’ll ditch her for any guy, don’t make the friendship a priority, etc. I’m worn out. I just feel criticized and hounded. I want to just let things go, but at the same time, she was genuinely a good friend for years, and is under some pressure.

Before I left I met with the building manager and he said that if I sent a letter of intent, I could sign the lease over to Assclown.

In September I got a letter from the Canada revenue agency that they needed receipts for my rent paid last year. I called the building's office together them and I was told that a) I am still on the lease, b) I can't get the receipts without permission from Assclown (he paid the rent and I payed him my half). 
Ergo I was told that I have to meet with Assclown to get this all figured out. 
*Shocker*: Assclown claims that he's tried repeatedly to remove my name from the lease but I don't really believe that (he probably tried  once). Assclown won't agree to a time for the meeting and won't get back to me. It's been a week since I last heard from him.
The 12/mo lease is over now but if I just cancel it (which feels like a shitty thing to do... Even to an Assclown.) I'm still on the hook for at least $1200 of rent and at this time in my life I haven't got that kind of money to just throw away.
I have no idea what- if anything I can do at this point. But I need those receipts and I'm really uncomfortable with just staying on the lease. Things have been okay so far but ASSCLOWNS aren't reliable.",21Dec2018,1
74,"Both her and I enjoy successful jobs in the military, both of which are high tempo and high stress. We dated for half a year and everything was great. In fact it was wonderful. We always talked about how life was better and how we enjoyed being with each other. We made time for each other, talked out our problems, made each other laugh for hour on end, and respected each other’s needs and fears as they pertained to our jobs. Her ex boyfriend moved to town a few months ago. She mentioned it to me because he’s also in our career field. 
We said we loved each other. The next Friday night she got drunk with her friends and was texting me about if we trusted each other. The next morning we broke up. She said she was “confused and felt weird because I have so much shit in my head” and we split up. 

I respect that if she’s not into it then it’s over. But Her decision blindsided me and her explanation left me feeling like I’m missing something. This really isn’t a workplace topic so I’ve been having trouble sorting out my feelings. With the holidays here it’s just magnified those feelings. Either way it’s over and I’m having a lot of trouble moving on emotionally because of how rapidly we broke up. My big (and to this point unfounded) assumption is that she had sex with her ex and doesn’t want to share? I have so many unanswered questions and unresolved feelings and not many outlets to express them but at the same time I want to respect that she wanted our relationship to end, however shitty this makes me feel.

I've been a dog trainer at a large chain retail store (the one that isn't Petsmart) for over a year. I'm incredibly passionate about my job, putting in extra time to learn all I can about everything we carry and all animals, especially dogs. I love my clients, and my store was performing very well until recently. Our awesome manager got promoted and we got a new leader, who is just completely unfit for the job, but that would be manageable by itself. About 2 months ago, she made a terrible hire as the department manager in charge of animal care. We'll call him N. N is 23 and currently dating a 16 year old girl that may likely be pregnant. He's stealing from the store constantly (smart enough to avoid cameras and managers), so no iron proof. He's condescending to anyone he perceives as beneath him, even though he does nothing, knows nothing, and is terrible with customers. He makes disgusting sexist remarks about female employees (I am male, so my complaints about it have been ignored and the female employees have been too scared to say anything). Whenever another manager is not around, he goes out to smoke pot and comes in stoned off his ass, to the point where customers have complained about his odor and behavior. Another employee (an older lady that had worked here for 27 years) called our company hotline to complain about it after inadequate leader did nothing. He framed her for theft within 3 days. He brags about how much he steals from other stores as well as ours, knowing we'd have no proof anyway. He's technically in his probationary period and he's had complaints from 5 different employees for different things, and he's missed 4 days of work (2 is the max in the prob. period, but again, incompetent leader.) I know people he has worked with at 2 other jobs (smallish town) and he's been the exact same way at those jobs. It's to the point where myself and three others are on the verge of quitting, even though we love our jobs immensely. Just wondering if anyone has any ideas. Sorry this post is so long. I will be answering questions later tonight if anyone has any, and I will update this post with more information as well. Thanks, Reddit",21Dec2018,1

78,"2 years ago right on Christmas day I had my heart broken by the girl I thought I was going to marry, it honestly affected me a lot due to her leading me on for a few months just because I had told her that if we were to break up I wouldn't want her in my life anymore. 

I knew that I was head over heels for her, and if it ever came to that situation I didn't want to see her with someone else.

But after some time I was able to cut ties with her, and get over it in a way. I've been ready to get into a relationship and actually find someone who will love me for a while now. I've signed up for tinder and I've had a few matches that never lead to anything other than one of us getting ghosted by the other. 

Honestly, I only have 1 friend I hang out with/ talk to on a daily basis. I spend most of my time at home or at school drawing/doing homework. There's no one I've met in college that has caught my eye, and I work as a painter with my mother so that's not helpful to this situation.

Basically what I'm asking here is for some advice. I'm hella lonely and I really want someone to love. I know it must seem like a stupid situation to be upset over, but it really has been affecting me these past few months. I refuse to do a long distance relationship because I want something physical, I want someone to hold in my arms whenever I feel like it and I had a really bad experience back in the day.

79,"I know, it's impossible to tell someone you haven't met why you don't like them, but how can I try to work it out for myself?

I'm in my 30s and I don't really have friends, and I never really have. I'm not shy, I get on with people I meet and acquaintances are friendly and come and talk to me when I run into them, but I don't really get over the fence from acquaintance to friend. I don't think most people actively dislike me, they just are indifferent to me. I have had a few close friends before, and those friendships have mostly ended with them ghosting me and me not having any idea what I did wrong.

I recently went back to uni and took it as a good opportunity to meet 30 new people who were all also new to each other so in theory I would have a good shot at making some friends, but 4 months later I have lots of people who make chitchat with me when I see them at class or when I go to a social event, but that's it. Other people have formed obvious friendship groups and others go and do things with other people from the course outside of class but I only see people at the open social events. This has been the pattern since I was at school.

When I was much younger I know that my response was to be a bit needy and self-pitying, but I'm not anymore - I try to be open to social situations but I'm conscious that no one should feel obligated to hang out with me so I never put someone in a situation where they feel like they have to invite me or accept my invitation to an event. I think I put other people first, I help people out whenever I can and give a lot of time and thought to the people who are briefly my friends.

I just don't know how to work out how I rub people up the wrong way to make them only like me is small bursts - because I must be doing that for my experience to be so consistent over so many years with so many different groups. And it's not like I can ask someone and get a real answer - ""Hey, how come you don't like me as much as you like your friends?""

**Why I failed**

I'm not motivated at all to complete this Diploma (Programming). I had a different course in mind that was only available in another city. My parents couldn't handle the thought of my leaving home just after high school and forced me to study here. So I settled for the one thing that I felt like I could tolerate do to the little to no studying it required. My first year went fine since it was a generic course and most of the basics are easy to logically figure out without much preparation. I was pumped at the beginning of my second year and started feeling out of place. I started feeling unmotivated to go on because I knew that this wasn't something I wanted to do. I just had to. That mentality was present during every practical task I did and every lecture. Over time I stopped feeling the need to do either. I used gaming and drawing to distract myself and keep my mind off the consequences. I ended up totally lost and unable to get through the final exams due to a lack of engagement on my side. 

**My dilemma** 

Once we had completed our final exam, I realized how badly I'd messed up. I had the power to push through and pass whether I wanted to or not, but I chose the easy way out. I had financial support for my first year and my family had paid for the second. In order to get funding for the third I'd have to pass, which I didn't (although there are alternative ways to get funding atm). My parents haven't been shown a single whiff of my results throughout the year (I knew they weren't at all presentable and kept it hidden) and it's close to coming to the end. I cannot hide it anymore. I have to tell them in about 18 hours from this post. It will be the first time my siblings or myself have failed an academic year. I'm prepared for the verbal lashings that will happen and what this will do to my relationship with them. My problem is with what to do next and how to explain why I failed (and threw several thousands of dollars away). I know my parents will treat it as a betrayal of trust and they'll just see my reasoning as laziness (which it probably is).  I'm not sure if I can switch over to another Diploma/Degree at this time.

**My current options:**

* Redo the year and pull my socks up to actually do the work. 
* Take a gap year and find a job, I intend to put most of the money towards studying what I want.
* Convince them that I didn't know how to handle the work and tell them that this might not be for me (Hopefully getting support for what I want to do)

I'm not looking for sympathy or pit or anything. I'm fully aware that this was in my control and that it is way too late to change things. I dug my own grave here, but I need advice from here on out. I'm open to more options and I'd like to thank anyone that responds in advance.",21Dec2018,1

I don't really want to go into too much detail about it bc thinking about my parents fighting really makes me sad, but my mom said that she thinks that the only reason why they've been together for 17 years is bc she always caves in in arguments. She always says sorry and they fight about it again around the same time next year. 

Do you see why your boy is skeered? What do i do if my parents get a divorce. My dad has the money and my mom works at a daycare, but my mom's the nice one and my dad isn't around that much is very scary when he's mad and he's strict so if you screw up a little bit, he gets mad. DO YOU SEE WHY I'M SKEERED? Everything changes when a kid's parents get divorced.

91,"so Tuesday night i picked up my boyfriend from work, and as far as he remembers, he had his phone and wallet when he got on in the car.

when we got home he took the dog out and he checked his back pocket for his wallet and he realized he didn't have it. normally when he gets home he dumps everything from all of his pockets onto the kitchen counter, and he did that Tuesday night, but we didn't see his wallet there.

he also didn't have his phone on him either when he came from taking the dog out. i tried calling it and we didn't hear it. we thought it was in the car so i was going to go get it, but he said don't worry about it we'll just get it in the morning.

Wednesday morning we search around the car for the phone and wallet with no luck. we're starting to stress out now, this is the first time he's ever lost his wallet. the phone is easily replaced but his wallet has his bank card, drivers id, and social security card (even though i told him multiple times to not keep it in there.)

Wednesday night we searched the kitchen and bedroom for the wallet, still no luck.

Thursday, today, i searched the car again with a clear head and still didn't find anything. i had a friend come check the car too in case i was just missing something but she didn't find it either. 

we're about to move in a week so this is very stressful that this has happened. we've checked the apartment parking lot three times, checked his work breakroom, and even asked the apartment office if anyone has turned in a wallet and there's nothing.

what should i do next? should we just assume it's been stolen or is it still just hiding somewhere? i try calling the phone but it's dead and immediately goes to voicemail so i don't think someone has it, because why wouldn't they charge it to try to use it?",21Dec2018,1

93,"I’m a dual citizen. I wanted to move to the country I have citizenship in. I’ve been interviewing with with a company and I have a chance of getting a job. Only problem is, I just took a real hard look at financials and it’s going to be incredibly expensive to stay there, between finding a place to live and paying taxes. (I will either have to pay 20 or 40% of my salary in taxes.) The country in question is also going through a housing crisis so rent is upwards of 1k a month for a 1 bed 1 bath. 

The truth is, I HAVE been wanting to do this for a very long time. And I’m going to make myself go, however I’m beginning to have second thoughts about this for a couple of reasons

1. Being far away from my support network: I have anxiety issues and my depression flairs up from time to time. I’ve made some really great friends recently and I’m close to my family now. I’m scared to leave them behind and isolate myself.

2. Draining my savings: I have a pretty decent amount saved up right now. I don’t want to spend all of that just trying to live where I want to live. 

3. I’m happy where I am right now: I like the city I live in. I’ve made some good friends and have some great hobbies. 

So, I still don’t want to give up my dream of traveling, because I love it very much. I was thinking of taking 3 months off of work (quitting my current job) and traveling around Europe using my savings. I have family I can stay with in two different European countries. I’m comfortable with the idea of backpacking around for a bit. 

This way, I can still get out there and experience new things without blowing my savings completely and paying exorbitant taxes/rent. 

Then I can just come home whenever. 

Part of the reason I’m afraid to change my mind about all this is that seems to be a trend for me. I can be indecisive and flighty and I’m trying to stop being that way. I’m trying to actually commit to things and see them through. But again, I also don’t want to make the mistake of isolating myself and losing all my money. But I might also just be talking myself out of this whole thing. I think taking a risk would also be healthy for me and would help me grow. 

I also have a lot of people who are encouraging me, supporting me, and telling me to follow my dreams. I don’t want to let them down or disappoint them. I can deal with people thinking “I knew she could never do it” because those kind of people’s opinions don’t matter to me anymore. It’s my friends and loved ones that I care about.

I feel like I'm not a human being...I try to form connections but people just seem to stop, they don't stop being friendly for me to think I've done something wrong but clearly they're just not interested in pursuing things further. Having lost friends and partners compounds that feeling too. I don't know what's wrong with me that people can so easily walk away.

On top of that being friend-less doesn't make you a good friend, people instantly think there must be something wrong with you (evidently they're not wrong) to have no friends, I'm not clingy at all so that's not an issue but being friend-less I sometimes think if people are friendly they're just taking pity on me - eg. my supervisor knows I'll be alone for Christmas so suggested I join her this Saturday while she goes to see an 80's band locally, my boss is great but it just felt like pity. 

Being so isolated for so long I'm sure my social skills are dropping, but also I've nothing to talk to people about - I try to do things but have you tried going weeks or months with no friends and try to find new activities, new hobbies, gone to bars alone, etc?

My indecisiveness, insecurities, and my ability to heavily rely on other people for basic necessities have caused me to have very low self esteem. There's not a day where i don't contemplate on how much i could've done to be better but don't.

I focus too much on not making any more mistakes rather than just living life accepting that everybody makes mistakes. I hate that about myself.

I know that I'm not suppose to say this as I LOGICALLY KNOW FOR A FACT that this is untrue, but I secretly admit that everyone I see acts perfect. It's just that I see that everybody doesn't make humiliating mistakes that I make or contemplate how bad their mistakes are like me. To me everyone looks like that they have everything under control which I know for a FACT that this is UNTRUE. 

I don't know, everyone expects more out of me for my age and its not even like BIG things but I just takes them too seriously. And i hate myself for that.
Why can't I be everyone else who have everything under control.

We hug super...strongly(?) but when it comes to a conversation it just never seems to kick off. Does it get better? Is this bad? How can I fix this? ,21Dec2018,1
101,Unlike other people my scapula is popping out a lot and it looks unnatural and I really want to change it but I don’t know how. I’ve asked my doctor before if there is anything wrong with my back and they have said no but clearly it’s different than other people’s backs and yes I do have bad posture but I swear to you it is not a hunchback. ,21Dec2018,1
102,"I (23f) have decided to take care of my mental health. There’s a lot of things that have happened in my life and things happening that are affecting me really strongly. 
What I am looking for is people to share their experiences with therapy and if it helped you. I don’t have insurance and will be paying out of pocket and I know it can pricey.  I just want to know if it’ll be worth it. ",21Dec2018,1
103,"I live in an apartment complex where my upstairs neighbor and I share a vent system.  My upstairs neighbor has two small dogs, and she doesn’t take them out very often.  Because we share a vent system, I can immediately smell whatever is going on upstairs bring it cooking, smoking weed, or in this case: her letting her dogs sh*t in her living room on a daily basis.  Every night at about 8-10 PM, the poop smell wafts downstairs to my place, and it really spoils my day to day life.  I work hard to keep my place clean and tidy, but it smells like dog sh*t every night.  I haven’t lived in the US terribly long, so I’m curious...  what would most people do in this situation?",21Dec2018,1
104,"I've got a few friends I've bought xmas gifts for. I doubt they have anything planned to give to each other or me, because it's just not been a thing among us - none of us are religious, but I wanted to go the extra mile and celebrate.

But, if I were in their shoes, I might feel guilty about not having a gift to reciprocate.

But, if I tell them in advance, I don't want them to feel obligated to buy something, because we're a bunch of poor millenials. 

What should I do?",21Dec2018,1
105,"I know this will sound ridiculous, but I (23F) am turning 24 soon (December 22nd) and lately turning 24 is giving me major anxiety and depression.

I think feeling depressed and anxious about another birthday passing is because I’ve lived with a disability since I was born and a chronic illness since I was about 12. I haven’t had many experiences or opportunities due to the limitations from both my disability and chronic illness, and my health has gotten only gotten worse over the years. Therefore, feeling like I’m only 6 years away from 30 and have done pretty much nothing with my life really scares me

Is this feeling normal? Especially at the age of 24. And how would you suggest coping with these feelings?

Any and all feedback is much appreciated. So thank you in advance! 🤗

TL;DR: At the age of 24 I’ve done nothing with my life due to disability and chronic illness, and it’s making me feel depressed.

109,"This week I've been getting picked up by my aunt because my cousin goes to school with me.  My cousin has been sick for the past week.  As we get to my cousin's house we go to his room and play videogames in his PC, but my uncle and cousin have leave to the doctor.  As a result im left alone in his room playing videogames waiting for my mom to pick me up.  I get tired of playing and decide to watch youtube so I close the game tab.  Looking at the desktop I see in the corner a file that reads ""Calculus.""  My cousin is a year younger than me and is not taking that course.  Out of curiosity I do the thing one should never do, snooping another person's files.  To my dismay I find that there are no items about Cal but instead nudes of girls that probably go to our school.  I finally ask what should I do?  Should I report it his parents or is this not even something to be concerned about,  Am I being a p@$$y, or is there another ethical solution?  For clarification me and my cousin are semi-close and I wouldn't like things to be awkward.",21Dec2018,1

112,"So basically this girl at work seems super into me. We hung out at a popular coffee place 3 weeks ago for the only time so far. We msg quite a bit on social media, but she kept saying she was busy with stuff whenever i would ask to hang. I called her out on it and was like if you dont wanna hang out that's fine and she said thanks for understanding.  I basically said you dont wanna hang our talk but she was like no i do!

So I basically said whatever you really dont care. She went on a spew about how its not about me, someone decided to hurt her previously, she didnt wanna go into the exact reason because its personal. Im so nice and funny and she loved getting to know me at said place. Saying it was huge for her and she was super proud of herself afterwards. The reason it seemed like she was avoiding it was because it makes her anxious and she has to wait till shes ready and that shes going through her own battles. 

Being the idiot I am I apologized the nexy daya she was like oh thanks for understanding my sitch. Im sorry for coming off that way.

Looking at it, it seems to me she flipped what she was saying, and most of it sounds fucking generic. Because at first it was thanks for understanding after i said if you dont wanma hang, and then went into the whole spew i summarized previously. Idk what to think.. 

She playing games or does she need time to heal from said past relationship? Why can't people just be direct and tell the truth. I feel like she's lying.
Also ill expand on it more if you have any questions. ",21Dec2018,1
113,"So I work at this grocery store and at the time I was a bagger/cashier. I mostly bagged and when I did they had me help them stock because they don't hire any stockers they usually just have two assistant managers in the back stocking. All the assistant managers said they liked me back there and they asked me I would want to move to the frozen department. I said no the only thing I wanted to do is be a stocker like how I have been helping them. They said they would talk to the upper managers and two assistant managers talked to them. The upper managers said yes as long as I get customer service trained so I can help them out and it would only be about two weeks of training. At first, I was hesitant about it but they convinced me. Now about almost a year later I am still at customer service I have talked to the HR and upper managers 3 times and they said they are working on it. Then they said they would start training me back there but they never did. Then they said ""They can't create positions like that"" But then they started hiring a girl to be a greeter. It really pisses me off and I am not for sure what I should do. I tried to get a different job but I can't really find one that near my wage I have now.

114,"My brother has an Instagram account, to avoid revealing his identity, I’ll call it RKPwhale. Basically, 3 years ago, a kid we both kinda know made an Instagram account called RKPwaleFanclub, and it’s a bunch of videos of my little brother’s old musical.lys and he edited music over them to be funny—but it just came off as mean.
The big issue is, when people search my brother’s Instagram name, that fake account comes up, and the worst part is that the accounts “name” (the name aside from the username), is EXTREMELY vulgar. 
I’ve contacted Instagram and they legit “accidentally” banned my main account and when I said, “what the hell just happened?” They said it was a mistake but they can’t take down the account.

115,"So I was friends with a boy when I was 14 at school and we recently reconnected and became best friends for 2 years and then we started to fall for each other. Eventually we became boyfriend and girlfriend. At first it was perfect and he promised me he’d always love me and never leave me but during the last couple of months we’d been arguing a lot and we had a big argument that resulted in him splitting up with me and saying I deserve better.

We’ve still been speaking and he says he promises to become a better person for me and that after Christmas and New Year’s Eve we can have a fresh start after having a short break from each other if that’s what I want and it is what I want, however i’m having conflicted feelings about getting back together with him after what he’s told me and what i’ve heard.

He has schizophrenia although he’s medicated for it (i’ve known this from the start of our relationship) and recently he’s had a relapse. He told me he has never hurt anyone and never will but last night he told me his dad pinned him to the floor and so in response he hit him. I don’t know if his dad was trying to restrain him or pinning him down but it scared me a bit. I told him the truth and he said he completely understands because i’ve been hurt by people in the past and I have anxiety and issues surrounding things like that.

I also found out that the night he split up with me, he had a meltdown and smashed up his kitchen and had to be restrained so he wouldn’t hurt himself. This scared me too as I didn’t think he did things like that and situations like that really scare me. 

All throughout the two years I’ve known him we didn’t have any arguments until the last couple of months and even when we argued he never ever put his hands on me and we would cuddle afterwards and he’s never made me feel unsafe around him, he shows me so much love and affection and he says i’m the most amazing person he’s ever met and that he wants me to be happy and healthy and he supports me whatever I decide to do. 

If he’s never behaved like that around me and only his family, does that mean he would never behave like that around me or is it understandable that i’m nervous?  He’s always been so sweet to me and we’ve been through everything together and he supports me through everything so it’s hard for me to see him as a person that could behave like that.

Should I give us a fresh start?",21Dec2018,1
116,"Okay so I'm thirty. I've been managing my family's retail business since I was in my early twenties and graduated from university. This dude has been coming in for years. Yes he spends money but he's always an ""issue."" We deal with thousands of customers and he's probably one of the oddest repeat we've ever had.

What I know about the guy is he's in his late forties or early fifties. I'm pretty sure he's married and he has kids. His father is super wealthy. He has two brothers. I've dealt with the two brothers and they are sorta assholes but absolutely nothing like him. His two brothers are super athletic good looking guys. This guy isn't. He's awkward, weird, and nerdy looking.

Whenever I've dealt with him he's always loud, in your face, and obnoxious. He's also very amped up like he did cocaine or drank ten cups of coffee. I swear it's like an act or a defensive mechanism. It's like he needs to be the loudest guy in the room and drown everyone else out. He just goes on and on and on. It's like he's afraid of quiet or anyone else talking.

He's got this ""I'm superior"" or ""I'm special"" attitude about him. He seems to not like anyone else even hinting he's not the smartest bestest person in the room. He's very demanding with his requests. 

He always wants me to help him, not my staff. Whenever he comes in it's a scene. It's not necessarily ""bad"" but he's super high maintenance and he's always got ""issues"" during the transaction. I get the feeling he does abnormal stuff on purpose to show off that he's special or important. He seems to always want special treatment or services not because he needs them but instead so he can tell himself he's not a standard customer and he's special. He always want me to acknowledge him even if I'm busy helping other customers. He also always talks down to everyone. He's got an opinion on everything and he's always got ""advice"" for running my business. He's been known to stand there and lecture me with his stupid ideas like he's a genius giving out wisdom.

If I ran into him in my personal life I'd probably avoid him and think ""what a fucking jackass"" while observing him. I try to be nice and accommodating with him because he is a regular customer. I've thought about telling him to shut the fuck up a few times cause he's super aggravating. I've had customers look at him funny and even ask questions like ""what the fuck is that guy's deal"" or ""what the hell is wrong with that guy?"" after he's left.

So one day I overheard him threatening a staff member. He's never done that before. He didn't like the way something was done and said to the kid ""you'd better do it right or else, you don't want to see or else."" I'm certain he wasn't joking around and he didn't know I heard him. He seemed super agitated (way beyond normal) the minute he walked into my store because he was yelling at the kids with him. When I heard that I went over to him and told him to stop. He looked at me and was like ""how dare you, I'm going to go someplace else!"" He said something else (which I forgot) but basically he didn't think it was my place to confront him like I was much lower than him. I told him I'd be perfectly fine with him not coming back. Dude pays and storms out.

So the idiot comes back a few weeks later with family members. He's in my business but he's not acknowledging me like he usually does and he's kinda quiet which is odd. I was pissed off at him from that incident two weeks ago and I just asked him what was up the last time he came in. He was speechless and looked at me puzzled. I kept asking him why he was threatening my staff and yelling at me. He remained speechless. The people with him started profusely apologizing for him and he just kept quiet. I think I must have tried to get him to answer for his behavior for five minutes and he just stood there saying nothing.

He rarely comes into my business but now he's extremely polite and quiet. Actually he seems scared of me cause he won't really look me in the eyes anymore. He started doing his loud shit once and merely I looked at him and he shut up. His family members didn't modify their shopping in my business. 

I think this guy might just be a bully. He found a place where he could be an asshole or a pain in the ass and get away with it. I think maybe he got off on it. Like any other bully he's actually super insecure. I barely had to do anything to stand up to him and now he's ""afraid"" of me.",21Dec2018,1
117,"I'm really stressing. We have a 2.5 year old and one on the way.
My husband doesn't really have the greatest work ethic. He's the youngest in his family and was handed everything.
He had a good paying warehouse job that he had for a few years and hated it, so he found another warehouse job, but a few months into working there, he got a warning because he was consistently working too slow. After the warning, he was calling in multiple times a week (regardless of how much I begged him to go to work), and ended up getting fired.
I work full time and make a decent salary, but it was really tough while he looked for another job. I went back to my old serving job, on top of my full time job, and I was working 60 hours a week while pregnant. It took him months to find a job, and it was with a lot of begging, nagging, and applying to jobs for him.
He currently works part time as a stocker/cashier at a grocery store, and has a second job where he works 5-10 hours every other week as a holiday gig.
He calls in sick to his grocery store job (which pays decently and is his main source of income) a few times a month, for small things. He's tired. He doesn't want to. He thinks he might be getting sick, maybe.
He wants to call off tomorrow at the grocery because he's schedule with ""a condescending bitch"" and ""doesn't want to get pissed and walk out.""
Since he's already been fired once, and it was still pretty recent, I have been absolutely TERRIFIED that he's going to get fired. I have never called off work because I just didn't want to deal with a co-worker/work/whatever, and I don't understand how he's okay with just calling out of work, losing a whole day's pay, possibly putting his job in jeopardy, and putting his co-workers and managers in a harder position. This is the first time I'm hearing about the ""condescending bitch"" and he won't explain anything to me, so it's more frustrating.
I'm at my wit's end. When he does this, he just tells me he's going to call off, I beg him not to, I give reasons why he shouldn't, he gets pissed, and he does what he wants. Then I'm terrified that he's going to lose his job.
When I explain to him how much strain it's putting on me, and in turn, our relationship, he turns it around and says I'm just threatening to divorce him (I'm not, I literally say ""you calling in so much is putting a lot of stress on our relationship"").
And it's Christmas.
And we have a toddler and another baby on the way.
And he doesn't care about the stress that it puts on others.

119,"So either Tuesday or Wednesday (yesterday), I had $11.21 (unsure about the cents but i think it was 21).

Today I looked in my account and had -$3.29 (negative). I looked in the recent charges and the last charge was an $8 charge that I already had paid for. After this I had the $11.21, the next day I had $3.29. According to the transactions, at no point did I have the amount $11.21 at any time.

Well it's payday, so I put in my check on the online app. Usually when you go to the bank they let you have $100 or $200 now, then the rest later. But on the app they postpone giving you any of the money until tomorrow, giving all of it at once. I put in my check, and would wait tomorrow to see what my balance would be.

&amp;#x200B;

Well 6 hours later or so, I now have $96.29. All of the \~$350 from my check is still processing. I have no idea why my $11 went to negative $3, or why this $96 showed up in addition to the amount processing for my check.

What's going on here? I know apps aren't as secure so I might uninstall my banking app. But that doesnt explain any of this. Id think if I got hacked i'd have random things being bought on my card.

121,"A few years ago, I dated a guy who would push my sexual boundaries. Not in a bad way, but I was shy and wasn’t experienced. Whenever we would hook up, he would thrust into me over top of my underwear as to not actually go inside me and have sex. It’s what we did and it was fun. He always showed me respect until he cheated on me and then we ended things. 
I somewhat held sex over his head when we broke up and told him I had planned to have sex with him that weekend but decided not to because we broke up. We immediately started hooking up again and doing what we did where he thrust his dick into me over my underwear.

Fast forward to my new partner. We’ve actually had sexual, and I put two and two together and realized my last partner had been moving my underwear to the side and sticking his penis in about halfway without me knowing.

Can I consider this sexual assault even thought I fully participated every time and kept coming back?",21Dec2018,1
122,"Okay, so i want to start this by saying i am happily in a new relationship after everything has happened, my partner makes me so happy and is a million times better for me than my ex ever could imagine to be.

Over the past few years i was with this girl and we basicly lived together, she had moved in with me and my parents (pretty much) we were in love, but wr had our faults as a couple. We split up twice, once in the januray of 2018 and once in april, through both periods being seperated we would be hooking up which clearly wasnt good for the moving on part of our lives but it did get us back together for a small period of time. 

At this point i would like to mention that she was good friends with my best friend, before we were together and during, at points i felt insecure about this because they had kissed before but she always told me it was a drunken mistake but they would be texting each other in secret all the time. 

So i should begin the story now that all the back ground has been done. When her and i broke up in the april i started to feel depressed and was very emotional, and to me it seemed like my bestfriend was becoming more of her friend, he bought her gig tickets, was picking her up from work to take her home, they stay almost 20 miles apart, when i spoke to any of my other friends about what i felt was going on i was told that he would never do that to me, he wouldnt do anything to hurt me. 
I believed it. He was my best friend for over a decade, i had his back through everything and he had mine. When her and i started to hook up again, she would be showing me texts from him with him saying stuff like ""I guess hes just better than me"" which raised alarms, romours spread about the pair which they dinied.
I found out that my ex had tried to take her own life after weeks of not hearing from her, he had lied to me about it, told me it was someone else. We argued and eventually i told him i never wanted to hear from him again, and we parted ways.

Fast forward a lot of happy months to october 2018, i had met someone new and im more than happy, but i know im going to have to see him again, by this point i was filled for hatred for the pair of them. I had been so angry at him i wanted to beat the shit from him, but im not stupid i would never do something like that, i would never harm someone. I get a text from our mutual friend one morning, about the gig that me and our friends group are all going to, where we will be around each other for the first time in months. My friend had sent me a paragraph which confused me, him and i have ver short conversations via text. It wasnt him, since my now former best friend had no way of contacting me he had asked our friend to send it to me.

I was in so much shock i was so angry, i had to wake my partner up just to read the text, i felt like i needed her support for me not to get really angry. Now im not going to try and remember everything that the next said but it summarised to
""I dont expect you to want to be my friend again, you were right, me and her were hooking up, i was stupid and i gave you up, she fucked both of us over and im sorry""

We later met for coffee. We talked about everything and since i have been in such a good place lately i forgave him.

Lately ive been doing a lot of thinking when i have been trying to sleep, i cant get over the lack of trust i now have for everyone around me.
Yes it was only him who hurt me but everyone of my friends knew what was going on, not one of them stopped him, they all seen me depressed and allowed it to happen, i know its atupid to believe that they should have intervened and thats not what i mean, but if i was watching it happen to them i wouldnt want to be around the person who had hurt them. But they all let it happen.

Am i stupid for feeling like i cant trust people of who i have been inseprable from for almost 16 years? I feel like i need to move on with my life and get a new group of friends, i feel like that if i stay around with them that ill never truely feel free of this feeling. Any advice?

128,"  I went on holiday to another city recently to see my family and she is back where we’re from and she is acting really strange recently and part of me knows it’s nothing but I’m just very Paranoid that she just doesn’t Love me anymore. She avoids texting and calling me and is Busy so Often all of a sudden.

  She’s a very affectionate person and usually shows that even Through texts but lately she’s just saying short Brief things to me not even returning an I love you when we text and the one time we’ve called she hesitated before saying a sad “I love you too” 

 she’s been struggling with the loss of her older sister but that happened about 3 months back now and was fine afterwards and I helped her through a lot of tough times after it and now she’s saying that I can’t help her no matter what I do I can’t do anything about it. Then one night she texts me at 12:30am and tells me that she’s been talking to Another guy about it and that he talked her out of killing herself and this is a guy she apparently doesn’t like according to her and suddenly she’s talking to him and pretty much ignoring me.

 I’ve been feeling so betrayed and Scared for our relationship she’s pretty much all I have now. I lost so many friends and have been struggling with Horrible paranoia and anxiety and low self esteem and she’s really pulled me out of a dark place. I feel like I owe being alive to her I’d planned on committing suicide around the time I started to really get to know her and she pulled me from a very dark place I was in. 

 So I don’t know what to do anymore I’m desperate for some Advice on what I should do  or if I’m just being paranoid.  cause as one of my close friends told me “a Shoulder to cry on becomes a dick to suck on” and she’s suddenly just become so distant.

130,"I legit have 2 friends. Both i’ve been close with for at least 8 years. We have a small little group who always hangout. My brother, K (the compulsive liar), Z, and myself. I have never met someone who lies as much as K. He lies so much, he forgets what he lied about, then has to make up a new lie to cover the original lie. We constantly try to make plans in our group text messages. K rarely responds when we try to make plans. When he does respond he comes up with the lamest most unbelievably excuses. We all share our locations through the friends app on our iphones. He forgot about that. When we would make plans and he would come up with some lame excuse telling us he got called into work or something, we check his location and he’s sitting at his house. Then when we call him out on it, he plays it off like it was a joke and that it was funny. Then the rare occasion when he wants to make the plans and if one of us actually can’t go, he gets all pissed off at us. 

Today i asked him when he wanted to go get our tattoos that we’ve been planning for weeks. Then he says “idk yet. Now I have a gf though so I have to spend time with her too”. I lost it on him right there because i know for a fact that’s a lie. He has used that excuse a few times now too.

131,"this all started yesterday where when in the middle of class when I was presenting a project (very fucking nervous stuff) my teacher was correcting every single facts and information that I got wrong and I felt like a complete embarrassment to the class and to myself. That day we did not get to finish the project so tomorrow, I will have to finish suffering through the embarrassment of my faults information presentation. We will also have a quiz on all of the material that everyone is presenting so I let my students down by providing false information to them and They are all mad at me. It is 1030 pm right now and I do you have a chance before the class starts, I can redo most of it and basically crack myself over and over again. I am trying to do that but the only thing stopping me is me very stressed for the test tomorrow, which I do not know any of the material, and I am sleep deprived for the past 24 hours. I am falling asleep by the second but I still want to correct all of my information so the teacher does not get more mad at me. I recently just took a few Advil just in case anything bad will happen soon, and I have melatonin for whatever time I will be falling asleep which I also need to take a shower. Can you all please help me and give me tips on what to do! it can honestly be anything from ways to skip school, stress relief techniques, or anything that might help.

tl;dr I need to finish presenting tomorrow even though it is all wrong, but I can redo the entire thing now, even though I am sleep deprived as fuck.. please help...

I remember there was some information (information I no longer remember) written on the paper I didn't want someone in my life to know about at the time.

133,"Sorry for errors I'm on mobile. Basically, I have been super unmotivated for the last few months. My grades in school have been slipping, and I rarely study anymore. I also used to easily be able to get up early in the morning, a couple hours before school starts, and be able to study a bit and get myself prepared for the day. Now Im lucky if I manage to get up 30 minutes before I leave. During school, I have a hard time paying attention, and whenever I try to work my mind always seems to go fuzzy and I have a hard time focusing. When I get home, most of the time I just laze around until it's late enough to be a reasonable time to go to bed. Any help is appreciated. 

Also, a side note; I feel like I'm in a weird place between being depressed, and well, not depressed. It's hard to describe, but the way I act would make me think I should be depressed, but I don't feel depressed.

134,"I'm (22M) not really sure how to state this but I've kept this bottled up for some time now. Half of this should be on /r/offmychest but I need advice too.

I have a foot fetish and I feel like its a hinderance to my dating and sex life. But to me, the foot fetish is my sex life. I've had some tough times admitting to myself that my fetish dominates my sexuality, but I think that I'm finally coming to terms with it. There has been a lot of inner turmoil.

But even though I've been trying to accepted this, I still find that I lack intimacy in my life. The last real girlfriend I had was when I was 16-17, and to my surprise she was more than ok with my foot fetish. Honestly if it wasn't for her, I would have had a lot more trouble accepting who I am. 

I'll stop beating around the bush. I've been single since then. It's mostly by my own design, but in the times I've tried to be intimate since then, I haven't been so lucky. After revealing my fetish most of the girls are at least nice to my face and will play along. When I tell them about it, I let them know I do not expect anything from them in the moment, but I let them know it's a deal breaker if they do not want to participate in the future.

I have been ghosted, humiliated and turned down enough to destroy my confidence. Humiliation is cruel, and ghosting just flat out hurts. I'm thankful for the few girls that have bluntly but honestly said they were not interested. I'd rather be disappointed for a few days than be hurt for weeks. 

Like I said above, my fetish dominates my sexuality. I can't really perform sexually without the involvement of feet, and at my age it feels like dating moves on to sex too quickly for me to be comfortable disclosing my fetish to my partners. Thats not to say that I don't find other things attractive, but sex without feet is unfulfilling. 

On top of all of this, I don't know of anyone personally who is or was in the same position that I am in. I know that foot fetishes are the most common and most tame of kinks, but I can't help but feel alone in this. I can't talk to anyone about this because I don't really want to disclose my fetish to anyone that I'm not getting involved with.

Are there communities for this kind of thing? (Thats a stupid question, I know). Am I just going to have to keep putting myself out there to be humiliated until I find someone who will put up my desires? Are there any foot fetishists out there with advice for the dating scene? I know I'm still young but, fuck, I feel lonely and undesired. I could use some advice.

SO, there’s this record store in my town that I visit on a regular basis, and there’s a girl who works there and happens to be very cute. Like, stupidly cute. She caught my attention the last time I visited the store (I have no idea how long she’s been working there), because she gave off this very approachable, fun and personable vibe that really resonated with me for some reason. I doubt she was flirting with me; she was almost definitely just doing her job, but she seems really cool and I’d love to get to know her better!
So, short story long, I want to ask her out for drinks or coffee sometime, but I don’t know of a way to do it that wouldn’t feel like crossing a line. I’m not concerned about rejection, in fact I usually handle it pretty well. What I’m mainly concerned about is making her feel even a little bit threatened or unsafe coming into work, but I also REALLY don’t want to stop going to this record store.

I didn't have any complaints, but there came a point where this person started asking that we hang out over the summer. Again, there was no issue and we got a little bit closer. However, things changed last year (our junior year). V  became incredibly needy and constantly was wanting to hang out with me (even if I was busy). Now, this person doesn't have any other close friends. They have a tumultuous relationship with another person who was their close friend, and they aren't really close with anyone else at school. They make attempts to get into this one friend group, but they've brushed this person off many times. As a result, it became up to me to fulfill all friend duties. I have a separate group of friends outside of V, and I really love hanging out with them. When they would invite me to hang out with them, I would resist telling V because I knew they would guilt me into also bringing them along. Additionally, when I had a ton of work to do for this one extracurricular and couldn't hang out with V, V outright told me that ""There comes a point where I needed to pick what was more important"". During that week, I had already hung out with V on the weekend, and we had plans for the next weekend as well. Additionally, V unloads basically everything onto me and it's absolutely draining. I hear complaints about everything under the sun, and I'm expected to be supportive and caring. But, I don't get any of it back. I share something about me, and V halfheartedly listens and then goes back to what they want to say about themselves, while I listen completely to V's problems and such.

143,"There's a cultural difference between my parents and my boyfriend (my boyfriend is a 29 year-old expat living in ""my"" country) as well as a ""household shock"" just because his family is more stable than mine. My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years, and he has not enjoyed the majority of the times we've spent with my parents. My parents also find it a bit hard to connect with him. Despite giving both of them suggestions as to talking points, there hasn't been much progress. My boyfriend enjoys very in-depth questions, whereas my parents ask more simple questions. For example, my boyfriend likes to talk about his work in depth and my parents usually end the questions at ""work is good? busy?"" and ""any upcoming trips for work?"" I don't think it's that my parents mean to not take more of an interest, but they do not ask the most stimulating questions. To be fair, my boyfriend doesn't ask my parents about work (and I've told him to) and his work is very technical and not something most people would understand well. To make matters worse, my boyfriend constantly compares my parents to his. His parents are so ""perfect"": their house is clean, they are deeply in love, they plan everything out in advance and they travel the world. My parents' house is not as clean, they aren't as in love, they are much more spontaneous and they do not travel the world. I've tried to explain to my boyfriend that my parents have both had difficult childhoods (loss of parents, one parent away in the military all the time, having a sibling in rehab, etc), and I can't explain that my parents are under certain stress that his parents are not (there is a lot of financial stress on middle class Americans like my parents and there is a lot more financial security in my boyfriend's country) because my parents wouldn't want me to reveal those details. 

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the worst thing is that on Thanksgiving (a month ago), my parents started fighting with each other in front of my boyfriend. I wanted to punch them for this. I nicely told my mom to not fight because it embarrased me and she said ""well good for his parents if they are so in love after so many kids, that's not the norm"" (my parents have 4 kids like my  boyfriends' parents). My parents were also super loud and when I told them to be a little quieter for my (introvert) boyfriend, my mom just compared herself to the loudest aunt in the family and said ""well we're not as loud as Aunt Heather!""

144,"**To start, i'll make a long story short: (Skip if you want to get straight to the question)**

Back in my middle and high school days, I loved art; specifically drawing cartoons. I studied applied art and graphic design in high school with the hopes of having some sort of career in art. I did pretty well in my classes (C grades in both subjects) and even won a local competition in high school for a comic I drew. Things were great until I went to college...

&amp;#x200B;

It was at college where I realized that a career in art isn't viable where I live; i'd have to move off my island home and according to my teacher (I was doing art and design at the time) getting a career in this industry is very difficult; there's so many people with art qualifications and not enough jobs to meet the demand. With neither the confidence to live on my own or in my abilities to be better than any potential competitors. I decided to give up on a career in art.

&amp;#x200B;

Spent a couple years not sure what to do with myself.  Worked as a laborer with my dad, went back to college and did an IT course in hopes it would open more doors for me...Eh. Unsure what I wanted to do with my life, I sat down and talked with a careers adviser and they helped convince me to give a career in art another shot. I plan to do a 1 year art course at the college to get the experience and UCAS points I need for university.

&amp;#x200B;

**So here's where I stand:(The part where I need advice)**

While i'll obviously learn techniques on my upcoming art course, I'd like to build a portfolio and get back into drawing again. There's one ""tiny"" problem: I have a memory like a sieve and have forgotten a lot of my old techniques. Currently i'm practicing by doodling cartoon characters in my sketch book, but i'm not sure where to go from there... How can I challenge myself and improve?

&amp;#x200B;

My younger sister (not even double digits) has really improved her drawing skills by following a series of YouTube videos that teach her how to draw certain characters. I'm skeptical about following tutorials: While continued practice and following said tutorials has seen her art skills come a long way, it's all in a certain style. It gets a bit repetitive and I would rather develop my own style, if that makes sense?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, i've always done this weird thing since I was young, I draw with my left hand, up close and most importantly, with the paper at 90 degrees. Recently I looked at a finished doodle from all angles and found that proportions were slightly askew due to how I drew the character from a 90 degree angle. Looking back, it isn't noticeable in everything I draw, but any advice on how to avoid incorrect proportions in future?

&amp;#x200B;

**Think that's everything. Thanks for any advice in advance!**

He told me that I couldn't change my answers in my test, as the allotted time was over.

After I did this, he told me that I just ""changed"" the test and that I was getting a zero on the whole FRQ (free response question). The thing is, the test only had two FRQs, so that means I would get a 50% max. 

I feel like this is unfair because the work I crossed off only pertains to part e (the last part) of the FRQ. I realize that what I did in hindsight was very stupid, but I studied my ass off for this test and because of this one mistake all my efforts are going to be reduced to a zero.

He also never grew up with a father figure, as his father was constantly at work.) His mother constantly always says something derogatory to him, almost every time she speaks to him. Either that, or no speaking at all. She constantly asks for better and better things from him, even getting mad at low A's/High B's, because they aren't in ""her"" standard. She comes from a place where the system was very strict, and is now putting that stress on her own child. Now, for the rest of the family, they're not much help either.

I have three kids and the oldest one is 17 while the youngest one is 5. My father lives with us and helps run a small business. He also helps support us through his pension. He isn't in great health though and I am worried he won't be able to help us (physically and financially) for much longer. I work a minimum wage job and am thinking of applying for something that pays slightly better but would require a bit more responsibility. I would love to go back to school but am worried I won't be able to stick with it until I am done. My husband helps with maintenance around the house and of the small business but is otherwise unemployed.   


My husband is quite a lot older than me and we kind of ended up together by accident. What I mean is, I never intended it to become a serious relationship, but when I became pregnant my father encouraged me to keep the child, stay in the relationship, and I just kind of went along with it. My husband has PTSD but refuses to get any sort of treatment for it. I don't think he's dangerous but sometimes he seems borderline delusional. He's very suspicious and mistrustful of most of our neighbors and spends a lot of time worrying about our personal security. He has spent a lot of money on alarm systems and firearms (not all of which are registered). He's driven away most of his friends, my friends, and my extended family over the years due to his insecurity. I'm worried that his paranoia will influence the kids and that they'll become fearful of the world like he is. He's never been physically violent except one time when we wanted to take a day on a weekend in the summer and go to the park. Every time we want to go away from the house and enjoy the nice weather he comes up with reasons not to go and to stay at home. Usually it's something along the lines of that we have to do some work or some chores or property maintenance. Well, this time when as we were getting ready to go and getting into the car he said he needed to stay and finish something, and when I said he didn't have to come with us he got really angry, and grabbed my youngest child forcefully from my arms. The kids got really scared and started crying and my father even admitted he was scared too.   


My biggest worries aren't that he'll do something violent, but that he will continue to stifle us all because of his fears about the dangers in the world. If neither of us finds a better source of income we will run out of money around the same time that we need to start caring for my dad. I have maybe two to five years until my dad can't help with the business any more and starts to require us to care for him. My husband has even gone so far as to suggest that I don't work my part-time job on the weekends because it's hard for him to have to look after the kids (they're home from school) and he needs a break sometimes!   


Of course getting a divorce would give me the freedom to maybe start to try to tackle our financial problems, but I'm worried about the effect on the kids and the logistics of when they get to see their father. And, if they see their father, will his mental state deteriorate due to the divorce, or will he force himself to go back to work and start supporting himself?  


I think the only reason things have gone on this far and gotten so bad is that everyone is afraid to confront him. The friends (or anyone else) he has had that do stand up to him or even disagree with him, he's become aggressive and hostile to and pushed away.   


I don't know what to do, only that if I continue to do the same things and let things take their own course, then very soon we'll all end up in a very bad situation. Basically my father is the only one keeping things going and that can't last very much longer. ",21Dec2018,1

165,"So....essentially, this semester was supposed to be my last for my undergrad degree. I had all of the necessary courses, applied to graduate, all graduate requirements fulfilled...my major is biological sciences with a university honors co-major. After a long, draining semester...arguably the worst semester I’ve ever had mentally....I got my final grades back. In order to get the last 3 honors credits to fulfill my degree, I needed to get a B in a very difficult upper level biology class....and I got a B-. By 10 points (1% of the total points) anyway, I need some advice because I don’t know what to do at this point, I could DROP the honors status and just be done but I’ve already done all of the other course work including my final thesis. I am planning on going to a graduate program, and I’m not sure how that would look to admissions. I would have to take another 3 credit course to make up for this one.

So where do I begin. Its been 4 years in to our relationship. Me (22M) and my Girlfriend (21F) fight constantly and we both have problems that needs working on. She has an anger management issue and only says really mean things about me when shes at a temper.So when we get into small arguments it escalates quickly to a really big one. I've left some times to drink after fighting but have kissed only 2 girls but unintentional . I swear to god I really feel guilty after that because instead of going out to drink that way I should just stay home and work things through with her.

Edited: First time I failed as a Partner/Boyfriend and a Man, She found out and felt really hurt. Now this was where things started to get rough for us. We both made each other mad but no one fucked up you know. I know uptil now that this was and still is a problem of Communication and not understanding each other. I never see from her point of view. Actually sometimes i do but mostly no. Gotta work on that too myself. Anyways I was given a second chance and I finally put the effort into rebuilding our relationship up to where it once was. A year 7 months has gone by and I know I did a good job at getting things back to where it was because she told me she loved me again and we also made some small adventures together to better the relationship but again I get confused when we argue cause she says nice stuff to me only when shes happy and mean things when shes not happy. I know when someone gets angry a person does say things to hurt another persons feelings but I feel like if you really love a person, arguing and destroying someones spirit with words you dont mean is two different things.

This maybe Confusing or Dramatic but I want to explain everything thats going on.

 So yes we had a disagreement again 4 days ago because she didnt want my friends over and even tho I still feel like it was unfair I disrespected her decision anyways. I left to get wasted and left her crying. We had a fight the next day because she found out that I kissed someone else again.When she told me about it I Lied and said it wasnt true and later on that day I confessed. We called things off and in no little than 2 hours later I mailed her saying that I was thinking about our relationship and she also replied saying same and that she misses me. I really wanna work things out and we both need to work on our actions towards each other. We're both willing to make things work between the two of us but this time I need extra help at it.

173,"Like freshman year of college I met this guy and 18 year old me swore he was the best thing to ever exist. I slept over a few times, got my heart broken, cried a bit and attempted to move on. We tried to be friends because we had a lot of mutual friends, but stopped following each other on social media and I honestly didn’t hear from him for a solid 6 months until last August when an incident with a mutual friend resulted in us keeping in contact. Despite that, I didn’t really care much for him and never saw him on campus and he made it clear that, despite having mutual friends, didn’t want anything to do with me. Okay, cool, whatever. That didn’t really work out and we saw each other at a lot of friend gatherings and managed to keep it civil. Hell, I even got him a birthday card for his birthday. 

When we were together in our relationship, I did love him. It was stupid, and he took advantage if my naïvety and kindness and broke my heart. Even then, I don’t regret loving him in the way I did. I will probably always have a little bit of love for every person I’ve been with. I’ll always care and worry about him and that’s just the way I am. 

So skip a few months to this semester, I’m over this guy. I’ve been through 3 different heartbreaks at this point so I’ve definitely moved on at this point. That and just being a junior in college, I’m just really busy, no time to dwell on the past. I recently got a job at our school’s gym and he’s ALWAYS there. When I saw him, I said hi and we’d occasionally have conversation about the weather or school, just bland things.

Now a week ago, this guy starts following me back on social media and he’s just talking to me as if we’ve been good friends since day one. He’s comments on my posts and stories and even asked about my family. I oblige and answer and try to leave it at that, but he still wants to talk. He’s trying to start snapchat streaks and all of this strange talkative behavior. (He’s usually a quiet guy, who gives single worded answers, so this behavior is very fishy.)

I know he wants something from me and I’m trying my best not to give it to him. I know he better not try to hook up with me because I haven’t forgotten all the shit he’s said to me and he knows I’m not that kind of person, trying to hook up with an ex, ESPECIALLY an ex from a long time ago. I’m fine being his friend and I’m cool with hanging out, but I just don’t understand this sudden change in behavior. Should I just try to confront him on it or maybe he’s turning a new leaf? I dunno, something’s real fishy :/

tl;dr, my first crush/bf/whatever we were from a long time ago is trying to get back into my life for some strange reason. i’m slightly weirded out by his sudden friendly behavior. ",21Dec2018,1

After the zoo I suggested we go ice skating, but when we got there she said she didn’t want to wait in line. I couldn’t give her a ride home (which I apologized for), so we just went our separate ways after pleasantries (no hug).

I don’t feel like there was a spark or that we hit it off. At the same time I don’t feel like the date was awful. TBH kinda reminded me of a married couple: enjoying the zoo and each other, respectful of each other, but maybe not extraordinarily in love.

Let me explain the situation a little bit more in detail, I came into college with severe anxiety which I have been diagnosed with, and for which I take prescriptions. I was barely able to function, go out, or even take care of myself. I began to go to therapy mid-way through the semester and I began to exercise a month ago. I have been in the process of helping myself and learning to cope. 

I ended up with a 0.0 gpa for not trying and not attending class because of the panic attacks I would suffer in them. As a result, I was dismissed on the basis that I was not meeting academic standards. I just don’t know what to do right now, I was ready to give it my everything next semester. I was ready to put everything aside and focus on my studies like I did in high school where I ended up with a 5.5 gpa. I know I messed up but I have medical documentation of my diagnosis, of my prescriptions, and paperwork from my therapist. 

I don’t know if I should submit an appeal and go through more stress, or to go to a community college for a bit. It’s extremely hard because I feel as though I’m giving up on my future.

You don’t even have the care to wish him a happy birthday. Let alone think of how you could have helped. No matter what this man could ever have said  would amount to your level of childish actions. all the mean and trebblie things he said wasn’t how he truly felt. In my eyes and many other you are way worse then he could ever be you are the shit of shit.  He warned you and you chose to not listen to his warnings so he acted as such to protect you. The shit part is he even bought you play tickets even though money was thight 700$ play tickets. I bet you don’t even care he is alone at a bar drinking on his birthday becuase his mental health is suffering. I offer to pay to help and got denied becuase he said he isn’t worth fixing.

200,"First off, if this belongs in r/exes or somewhere else i apologize, I just have been kept up by this whole deal for so long and I’m sick of doing nothing about it. Also this is a long read. 

So last July, this girl I had been friends with for a couple years tells me she has feelings for me. It caught me off guard because she’s the kind of person that you’d think everyone would have a crush on, and she was a couple years older and had already been through relationships with a number of my older friends. Just the thought of being with someone that had had so much experience sounded awesome to me, something I can’t believe I thought. 

Even though it was technically a “relationship” we never really hung out just by ourselves even though we had opportunities to. Most of the time we’d be with this guy I’ll call Chris, and his girlfriend. Chris is my age and he’s a very outgoing, eccentric kind of guy, always the center of attention, and whoever else is hanging out with him might as well be a third wheel. So we didn’t have a lot of room for the relationship to grow, especially since I was back to high school in the fall but she had graduated. Chris plays hooky often, though, so he hung out with her a lot without me. I’m not trying to say the failure of my relationship was Chris’s fault but we should’ve tried to go around him if we wanted to go further. 

Towards late November it just was hell, she and I barely talked and when we saw each other it was really awkward. It was just sort of unspoken that we weren’t comfortable enough being together without Chris or anyone else. But me being the autistic socially anxious fuck I am, I still felt invested and wanted to hopefully finally lose my virginity soon. That didn’t happen with her because she dumped me in early December. I understood why but I was devastated. She suggested remaining friends but when she sent me the text it literally said “I can’t wait to have all sorts of adventures with Chris and have you by my side as my best friend” (I still remember it word for word even though my phone doesn’t have the text anymore). But every time we hung out with Chris and his girlfriend and this one other girl, it just wasn’t the same. Everything my ex said was pissing me off, and made me realize how far the wool was over my eyes. She always kept acting really promiscuous toward other people and I couldn’t take it. I even lied to everyone about having homework to do so I could leave two hours early to get away from her. I just didn’t understand how I used to be okay with her self obsession and shit and that I didn’t notice it when we “dated”. But everyone else still chilled without me on several occasions and in a way it pissed me off and made me feel like I’m always that disposable friend. 

This led me to turn to my other friend whom I’ll call Joe, who had also had a rough relationship with my ex in the past. He really helped me get my anger out toward her. I noticed after a while that Chris and his girlfriend had also stopped hanging out with her, so I felt like I wasn’t being totally out of the loop. 

I thought the whole deal with her was behind me until one day she snapped me just because she was bored, in late April. We somehow got on the topic of Chris, and she mentioned that they weren’t friends anymore and asked if I wanted to know why. She said Chris and his girlfriend asked her for a threesome, she said no, and then he cut her out of his life. And at this point I’m thinking “Holy shit Chris, that’s pretty bad”. Apparently she had told the same thing to this guy I’ll call Phil, and Phil would not shut up about how much he hated Chris after that. In addition, Chris had complained to Phil about my ex and told Phil it was best if he stopped being friends with her, setting him off further. Phil’s demeanor comes off as threatening when he’s pissed off, so that led me to tell Chris to stop complaining to Phil about my ex. 

When I confronted Chris, he asked “is that because [my girlfriend and I] had a threesome with [your ex]?” And it totally caught me off guard. I didn’t know whether to feel more surprised or angry. I ended up believing Chris, too, because he described to Joe and me later what her body was like. I asked Chris when said threesome happened but he just said he didn’t remember. I was able to deduce it happened within two weeks after I was dumped, as Chris didn’t cover his tracks carefully enough when causally talking about it all with me. 

It just made me feel so betrayed and so hung out to dry, yet I never was able express any of it to the parties involved because I found out so much later. I understand it technically wasn’t cheating, and I wish I didn’t think about it so much, but the sores are only festering. And so I want to get to the point and ask, what do I need to do to get proper closure with this whole chapter? It has felt somehow unfinished to me so any suggestions would be much appreciated. I just want this behind me ASAP. If you think I’m being an irrational asshole you can say so and I won’t lash out. Thank you for your time. Papa bless ",21Dec2018,1

What I find weird is she has had colored friends all her life, but for some reason doesnt support inter racial couples.
I personally have no problem with it and anyone should be able to be with who they want regardless. 

Well the woman I'm seeing is Samoan and white. But Samoan is a pretty dominant gene. 
I just don't know how im going to eventually break that to her, and make her understand.

207,"Well... that’s it, isn’t it? I went from a 3.3 to a 1.4 and have of course, lost favor with the financial aid. I didn’t understand what I needed to know in my classes, and honestly, I didn’t know how to ask for help in changing that. I’m close to 27 years old, was going for a degree in computer science (most of my jobs have been tech-related) and, well... I don’t have an answer to this. I honestly didn’t understand much of what I learned or the jump in what seemed like things I needed to already understand prior to being in certain classes. I honestly probably would’ve had a rougher first semester had I not had younger friends who had been taking CS courses for years now, but I didn’t want to rely on them going forward. 
Having said that, I don’t blame the professors or anything, it did seem though, that I either needed prior knowledge or better understanding of my options in pursuing help. 
I’m typing this all on mobile and I don’t know if it’ll look correct for typing so much out, damn, guys, everything I’ve learned thus far from college vs. what I’ve learned from jobs in the field is as different as night and day. It bothers me that this degree must be obtained to be considered of value (I’ve worked jobs for low income, yet have had to learn and do the same things as the other entry level graduates, despite out performing them) but what other options are there?
I honestly don’t want to go back, but I don’t want to be second class in the work place. 
What do I do now?
This has caused me intense doubt about my future and where I’ll end up in life. I’ve come far on my own right, but I wonder how much was luck and charisma vs. actual skill, actual value that can be used in my adult life?
I believe I’m further away from my goals and ambitions now and the window of opportunity has shrunk immensely due to this setback.

My bt and wifi card weren't working correctly. So I went in and asked them to diagnose and fix which was $50. They did it, blah blah blah, ordered a part to fix my antennae. Go back home and see my screen flickering and my computer kept shutting down everytime I tried to run a high powered game. So I went back in and they would fix it for free. 

The next day I go in and they had the shit eating grins on their faces; you know, like the ones when people make when they know they're fucked. They tell me the motherboard is shortcircuited and that's why everything was getting fucked up. They said this was most likely happening before I brought the computer in and they said they contacted hp. They said hp confirmed it was a motherboard problem. And let me tell you guys, my laptop was working perfectly fine before I went in to that shop. Now its completely dysfunctional.

Now I'm sittin' there going wtf and they said they would offer to help pay and build something for me. They said they were going to strip everything apart. And life would be good. So I'm like ok cool. A new pc, I wanted a new one anyways. They give me these specs.

-Intel Core i5-8600k coffee lake 6-core 3.6 GHz (4.3 GHz Turbo) LGA 1151 (300 Series).
-GIGABYTE Z390 DESIGNARE LGA 1151 (300 Series) Intel Z390 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.1 ATX Intel Motherboard
-GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1070 DirectX 12 GV-N1060WF2OC-3GD 3GB 192-Bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 x16 ATX Video Card (I asked for an upgrade from 1060 to 1070 and just changed GTX 1060 to 1070 so I don't know if that's right)
-8 GB DDR4
I have to pay for this. Everything else they will pay for minus the case cause I want a cool ass case. So in total it's gonna be around 650 from my pocket. They are saying with everything else they'll be supplying it with their parts and the stuff they stripped from my pc. Shipping and labor free as well. $300 in total came from my laptop apparently.

I don't know much about computers, I'm just a consumer. I am also gullible. My online friends said I'm getting fucked in the ass, but they're usually real cynnical.

211,"Hey everyone. I need some advice.. 
My girlfriend (22) has a history of depression, especially through her teenage years. She's had a tough life and has truly come such a long way since then in her journey to better herself. This past year and a half she's slowly been slumping back into a depression and now it's gotten almost worse than her teenage bout. 

We are fairly broke, she's still going to university and I'm working full-time with little money left over once all the bills are paid, and I really think she could benefit from therapy.. obviously that's quite expensive. I don't have benefits at work that she could use either, nor does her school have coverage for that. I love her more than anything and I want to get her help-- but Im not quite sure where to begin, or what to say. 

We try to talk about it, for me to be a shoulder for her to cry on but she's slowly closing herself off as I'm becoming less and less effective in calming her down.

She needs help but feels helpless, I need to step up and help her but I don't know where to go, what to do, or what to say...

212,"I recently got what’s called a wax pen, which is basically a thc vaporizer, that even a little bit gets you super high. I’ve only have had it for like a month but I’m scared of like relying on it too much. I think the most attractive thing about being high, is just that my anxieties go away and everything I enjoy becomes so much better. Listening to music, eating, breathing, thinking and even exercise becomes better while I’m high. I just feel like it really meshes well with me. Some people say that they get super lazy and groggy, but with me, maybe bc it’s primarily thc that I feel like active bc i want to dance, go outside, or socialize.

The only thing is this week I found myself doing it everyday. I’m on break and no ones home so I’ve been just trying to take advantage of that by just relaxing and doing whatever I wanted. If the opportunity presents itself, and I have the chance to smoke a little then I will do so. I don’t know if I’m getting carried away, but too be fair i took a 2 week break bc of finals and then I was so stressed out and everything that I rewarded myself a little too much. 

If my parents are home or if I’m busy then I won’t smoke, but like do you think it’s getting out of hand. I really can’t afford for my parents to find out (if they ever did, my life would basically be over and I’d be fucked) so that means I need them to be gone for 2 or 3 hours, which usually isn’t very often. I was thinking once maybe twice a week would be a good rule if I’m not busy or anything.

I’m just a college kid living at home, so if I was living in the dorms I’m sure it would be worse, except with alcohol, which is arguably way more unhealthy and dangerous. That’s another thing, I also don’t drink like at all, and I think weed is a good alternative to alcohol. 

Am I being too paranoid and keep doing what I’m doing, or should i just chill and ease it up a little? The only reason why I’m kind of overindulgent like this is mostly because it’s winter break and I don’t have any responsibilities right now.

Hey guys, M 20.  Off and on I've had depressive moods and have always struggled with depression. Lately I haven't really been depressed as far as I'm aware, but I haven't really not been...?
The past few weeks, all my dreams are kind of the same, normally involving me being trapped or stranded somewhere or drowning. Which is unusual, because I normally have very interesting vivid dreams.  Idk if it's because of the dreams or what but I've been having trouble sleeping too. The other day I went 39 hours before I could fall asleep, and that was with melatonin, blue light filters, warm milk, etc.  And when I do sleep I just wake up every few minutes and toss and turn.
Within the past few weeks I've also seemingly lost my appetite? It's not that I'm not hungry it's just that everything I eat, whether it be my favorite candy/cookie, my favorite pizza, or even drink, it all just tastes absolutely disgusting. It's not only the taste, the texture is even gross, including water. I'm not sure how to describe it, but water tastes bad and seems to have a weird texture, making me not want to eat or drink so I have to force feed myself.
I've been addicted to nicotine since I was 16, and have used it daily, I tried quiting many time but couldn't make it past a week. Once all this started happening, I lost all my cravings for nicotine, I haven't hit my vape in a couple weeks, and have no desire to. I used to drink every weekend and hated going a weekend d sober, now the idea of drinking repulses me.
Along with that all my favorite TV shows, movies, and entertainment have lost their appeal and luster. I used to write and draw and watch videos, now my pass time is just laying in bed with the lights off. I can't even stand music, it just sounds like obnoxious sounds, even my favorite and dearest songs.

Background: I have known her (she’s 20 now) since 2014 and we have been really good friends since early 2017. Around that time we got back in touch and unlike last time I talked to her (2016), she was just doing alright, ambitious, basically everything was okay and it has been like this since then.

Until this October. She got together with her (ex) boyfriend (he’s older than her, 22-24 I think) this August and they broke up this October. Before they broke up, she told me that she just can’t do it anymore, that they are just arguing and that he humiliated her. After that she just told me she was depressed because of the break up.

We then haven’t talked for some time - we both were busy because of school - until recently when she told me more. She said she was still crying daily, she felt down and she believed she was a piece of shit. She said he told her that “she is sick, she is not worthy of any respect and that she should go fuck herself”. I was glad that she at least broke up with him but as it turns out, she is still coming back to him and chatting with him - that is, until they argue again.

I told her that she should leave him, that she deserves better, that nobody should be treated this way, I tried to talk her out of his and suggested cutting him out of her life forever and moving on but despite all he did to her, she still loves him and says that she is fine now and that she would feel depressed again if she stopped chatting with him. She also said that she wants to get better, that she knows this is wrong and that she tried to move on and forget him several times, but without success

I honestly don’t know what to do. She’s my best friend who lifted me up when I needed it and I really want to help her but I feel like I just can’t do this anymore. This friendship has been draining my energy for the past 4 months and it was mentally demanding as well. And despite saying she wants to get better, I don’t feel she really wants that and as a result I’m trying to help even though she doesn’t want that

At this point, I could think of these 4 options: A) I will keep telling her that she should move on from him (and that is for good) B) I will just accept that she’s doing fine now and will hope that one day she will do the right one (or that she will learn what was the right thing in a hard way) C) Go “idle” and mind my own business until she decides she really wants to move on D) Part our ways

Can you please tell me what should I do now? Thank you very much!",21Dec2018,1
234,"Currently searching for a new job because, I'm tired of my boss threatening my job every time I turn around. She expects us to do the impossible and pretty much threatens you when you can't do it. She always expects you to stay over to do something (never asks). She's literally looked at me before and said. ""Well you're still under 40 hours right? It won't hurt you to stay over a couple hours."" Like, it wouldn't hurt you to actually ask me to stay over either. So, I don't stay over, or stay over as little as possible. Not to mention, the scheduling is fucked up. I was on the schedule for 12 hours this week and it was like pulling teeth trying to get them to fix it. They came to find out that they didn't even have anyone scheduled for some days. Then, I look at the newest schedule and I'M NOT EVEN ON IT!!!! I asked the same manager why I wasn't on the newest schedule and she said, ""I don't know, why aren't you?"" Like, bitch? Then she says, ""Well come the new year if people aren't pulling their weight around here, they're going to have to move on. I'm not just telling this to you either."" Like, I know she was talking about me. I feel like she purposely took me out of the system so that she could say that. I'm not sure what her problem with me even is. I can make cakes faster than the most experienced decorator there some days. I told my immediate supervisor that I'm going to start looking for a new job and she was like, ""Oh, don't be that way!"" Like, it's the holidays and she's expecting us to do the impossible and then threatening us when,, SURPRISE!!! We can't do it!!! I also shouldn't have to find someone to fix my schedule every time a new one comes out. This type of situation is totally new to me. I'm a hard worker, everyone else there seems to like me. At all the other jobs I've had, when I left, my bosses literally begged me to stay. My immediate supervisor doesn't seem to want me to leave either, but the person I'm talking about is her boss (an Assistant Manager).",21Dec2018,1

237,"So, I’ve recently come to the realisation that I’ve been a really awful person over the past year. Like, I’ve realised that I’ve become really condescending and really really cocky at times and it really tears me apart. I try to make self-deprecating jokes to try and lighten it, but sometimes I just make my situation worse by accidentally sprinkling in a pinch of overconfidence.

I guess my question is “how do I stop being so condescending and how can I mend those bonds I’ve destroyed by being so cocky?”

238,"I'm not sure if it's borderline toxic or what. It just doesn't seem healthy. She relies on them so much financially. The only reason they work so much is to be able to pay for what they want. The rest is usually given to their mother. The amount of money she asks for is extreme. Especially for someone whos only working a part-time job. I can tell she manipulates them. Doesn't respect their/ our privacy at all. One day we were sleeping cause we both stayed up all night and she knocks then just comes barging in with her other daughter and her daughter's friend. Cause her daughter's friend wanted to meet me. I'm half asleep and you think that this is a good time for me to meet people? They stay in there and have a full on conversation. Then say "" this is just how we do things around here"".  She baby talks to my SO all the time. Tries to get in the middle of our conversations. I'm a very private person, I don't open up to people easily. Yes, it's my SO's mother but in my eyes shes still on the outside. I don't know her like that. So it makes me uncomfortable. She treats them like their still a child. There are NO boundaries in their relationship. She uses them and starts pouting/acting immaturely if she doesn't get her way. They will be spending time at my house and if it's over 2 days she'll call and text them multiple times ""when are you coming home"" ""I miss you"". I've noticed she has a fear of abandonment. They come home exhausted, she wants them to help her move something or do this or that. No regard for their well-being or needs.

&amp;#x200B;

My SO and I talked briefly and I told them all the money they put into rent/giving to their mother they could have used that towards moving out. it would have been more than enough. They told me they've been thinking about moving out but haven't had others to move out with. I told them I would be more than happy to move out with them. Though this might be a problem. If she catches wind of this, then she may try to intervene. Due to her being financially dependent on them. She may see me as a threat and try to retaliate.

246,"-Hello, I am 18f. Over the summer I met a boy online who lives in the us, while I live in Canada. He was just some random boy to me and I definitely didn’t think much to it. He liked me instantaneously, while I took a while to come around and like him back. We talked more and more everyday, and as the days went by, the more I liked him. What mostly kept me talking to him was his kindness and patience. If there was a time where I wasn’t comfortable doing something, he’d understand and sit patiently till I eventually was comfortable. Now I’m super comfortable with him and he knows my biggest insecurities. I can’t imagine my everyday life without us talking and texting each other good mornings and good nights. We’re in love. I eventually met him for the first time 4 months after we started talking. He was only able to stay for 4 days, but at that time, I felt the happiest I’ve ever been in my whole life. No joke! I spent as much time as I could with him and we had such a blast!. He’s the best boyfriend ever to me and I love him so much, he loves me too ofc.

-ok here’s the issue though. He’s a secret. My family can’t know about him because they would disapprove. My parents have always been super strict on me and would never allow me to have a boyfriend, it’s just their nature and there’s no changing it. I have a tight leash around my neck. I have to be home before it’s dark out, I can’t sleep over, no boyfriends because they’ll distract me from school, etc...However they’re the nicest people I know and I am very close to them, they’re just overprotective of me and always need to know what I’m up to.

-this fall I started going to university out of town, which means more freedom and independence. This new city is where I met my boyfriend for the first time and my parents didn’t know about it ofc. The only reason I was able to meet my boyfriend is because I live here, away from my parents. 

-HERE IS THE PROBLEM THOUGH: I completely hate it here in this city, I am very sad and homesick all time. I miss my family very much everyday and it saddens me that I’m missing out on so much. I’m asian and we usually live with our parents till we’re financially stable and ready to separate. I need to go home. This sadness has made my productivity also go downhill. My grades are bad, I am always stressed and always crying. It’s a feeling I’ve never encountered before and I just want to go back to the place where I feel the most happy; home. Also, I live with my mom’s friend’s family and seeing them whole and happy makes me sad. I want to be with the people I love and eat good food and be able to have family time with them and be able to hug my mom when I’m stressed from studying. I really need home right now, where I am happy.

-my parents know my situation here and how I’m sad and so we’ve talked and decided that I should just go home and reapply again to a university there. But this means, I won’t get to see my boyfriend anymore. The person I love I won’t get to see anymore. I won’t be able to hang out with him. We’ve tried to come up with scenarios where it’d be possible for him to still see me, but they all end with the fact that we won’t get to see each other for that long, making his expensive plane trip here not worth it. 

-So, I need advice. Should I stay here where I might adjust better, but knowing me, I still won’t be happy but I’ll be able to see my boyfriend once in a while and 100% be with him?
Or
Go home where I am happy, but me and my boyfriend’s relationship will be jeopardized, which might lead to a break up, lead to me being sad?

Thank you if you stuck around to read the whole thing, I’d appreciate any advice. ❤️

He had just hooked up with my 13 year old best friend and wanted more I guess... it took me months to confess what happened and after two gruelling,awful years of court he was convicted and sent to jail for 9 months.

I have recently started getting closer to some of the ""popular"" kids in school. They're all going out tomorrow (end of the year going out) to a club in town, and I'm not sure how to join them. One of them said I am invited but they're going for food before and I'm really unsure how to ask them to meet them.

The one that invited me is not going for food just going the club. 

I have no other friends... The problem is they're quite serious people and seem to never laugh at any jokes, I feel so anxious next to them because of having no other friends. I used to be so popular but when I moved from one city to another I ruined it. I have lost confidence as it's not my hometown and it just sucks.

I'm not sure how to pop up to the rest of the group and ask them to come meet them at the club?

I'm not sure how to integrate myself in the group either. I hung out with them three days ago and of course, I don't really belong to the group... It felt a bit weird, I got a bit bullied (as a joke of course, everybody gets bullied) but didn t feel comfortable to respond, nor did I know what to say back that isn't insulting but simply funny. I'm 18. They're 17/18.

I hope this post is going to be therapeutic to me and I hope I can be as honest as possible.

my family lives in country where marriage is very important. As i was getting older, I had this pressure to settle down. I wanted to date and marry the person I want, instead of my parents forcing someone on me. So, I was trying to date someone and figure out my life as quick as possible. In midst of it, I decided to have one night stand during vacation. I have done this few times before and never even remembered guys name after.

So, I met this guy and had one night stand. It went on for like 2 hours. I got quite hormonal after that(I still think am) and got high/confused for weeks. I proposed to meet him again for sex, he was excited at first, but dropped the idea saying we live way too far to be worth it. This conversation went for weeks with me asking for it everytime. My reason was in addition to loving the first encounter, I felt like I only have few days left to be single and I badly want to experience sex with him once more. I surely thought I would never enjoy something like that again. At the end of it, I left some quite hormonal, confused, sorry kind of blabbering message to which he understably never responded.

Weeks after, I got call from home saying dad is really sick and it could be cancer. I flew out immediately and found he has stage 3 cancer. He went through surgery and had lot of complications. We are still going through this. I was there for 6 weeks and I can't explain how I felt. I was feeling very emotional and guilty. On top of it, everyone in my family were showing their frustration on me for being in different country and not getting married. They want me to come back permanently and marry someone there. They were forcing and making me to promise with lot of emotional blackmail.

I felt very alone and kept texting this guy (with my misplaced emotion!)by just saying how I would like to meet him. He obviously never replied. I used him as distraction along with porn fantasizing how good sex would be. At end of 6 weeks of my stay, I messaged him anonymously from different number asking when he will be in particular city. He got creeped and blocked me. I rationalized that this is harmless and I'm just trying my luck at sex. After few days, I messaged him again anonymously from another number, telling him that i want to talk on phone. He did go along with flirting, at end of it he got annoyed and said he can't talk to strangers. I got frustrated and revealed who I was. He got really mad and blocked me saying this is bit too much.

I called him next day from private number, he texted saying he doesnt like taking on phone and also he doesnt want to text or communicate with me. After this I came back here and I thought I finally can have some space to reflect my feelings, evaluate and probably would take therapy as needed. I thought I will take a week to get over him and after that will concentrate on how to deal with my family situation. A week passed, my brain want to keep thinking only about him and on how stupidly I acted to end it. I got way too stressed and emotional and that weekend I kept cold calling him. He texted me back saying this is way too creepy as we have met only for 2 hours. To stop it or he will report this as harrassment. I kept begging him to talk once through phone and I can explain my behavior. He refused.

Since then, I have tried letting it go and concentrate on other craps that is continuously affecting my life. But I have failed miserably. I got so mad at my family for what they have turned me into. I couldnt understand the way I was changing. I stopped talking to my brother since then and had talked to my parents only twice in last 20 days. My parents were telling me how dad is so sick and i had to do right thing, I just didnt know how to react to it.

I'm good with looking up social profiles as I work with computers a lot. I was able to find all his social profile and i kept lurking. i realized its not healthy and i blocked him. But I will come a day later and unblock him and have my feelings turnt up. I even left message on facebook to block me, but I guess it went to his other messages which he will never read. Even if he blocks, I guess I would make new profile to look at it. I went a step far and messaged his friend on snapchat but I didnt reveal anything.I started thinking, may be if i kept checking his snaps, I can eventually track if the guy i want travels. Yesterday I made fake insta profile and I got to the guy's private instagram. I feel so sick at myself for doing this. I ended up talking to him as someone for a while. I don't know what to do with myself anymore.

I can recognize this is stalking, obsessive behavior and I have no right to intrude someone life like this. I don't know if it is hormones from that stupid half assed sex or fantasy while watching porn, I definitely have difficulty getting over how it ended. I really don't know what to do. With all these happening, I managed to total my car and pour water on laptop to make it stop working (All were accident). I guess universe is telling me to fuck myself to confuse me more. I feel so emotional, confused, scared at my own life and I guess I'm doing all this to distract by creating different kind of shit. Please talk some sense in to me. I wish I live in old days where there is no internet and all I have to do is cry and get over it.

tl:dr; somehow help me from stalking this guys anymore",21Dec2018,1

This is about getting a pet btw (and the more I think about it the more trivial it sounds but anyway). 

&amp;#x200B;

So to cut a long story short, my sister and I have wanted a dog forever (and my dad too) but mum has always said no. Recently my sister has developed social anxiety and she doesn't really want to do anything or talk to us or come out of her room (typical teenager stuff I know but also other stuff to do with other people which is actual anxiety) and has recently started seeing a counsellor etc. And we've noticed that when we go to my cousin's house she is really happy with the dog so my dad and I thought that it would be a really good idea to get a dog to help her with her anxiety. The thing is that my mum is REALLY against it and it's mostly because she has a very big fear of dogs. My mum says that she wants to help my sister come out of her room and participate in things again but even though we're telling her that this could really really help my sister she is still against it. I understand that she has a fear of dogs (because of childhood things) but she doesn't want to do anything about it for my sister's sake. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from the fear she says things like: 

She's going to be the one who has to look after it (clean up after it, feed it, walk it, etc), but my sister and I are old enough to do all that ourselves (14 and 19 respectively). 

And she's worried about the dog licking everything and pooping everywhere which I think is pretty irrational and something that she could definitely get over. 

&amp;#x200B;

It just sounds like a lot of excuses to me.

I typed in $650. They gave me a receipt saying that there was a problem, and so far only $300 was given to me during that deposit. I called the number on the receipt but apparently there's no one working right now, so I'll try again late in the morning.

The outcome of all of this… 

It was December 15th, 2018 when I (think) I met my soulmate. 

I work at the mall and my jobs is to take photos for kids who come and see Santa. it was a long, busy day and probably around 6:00 p.m. when things had slowed during my shift. I had time off camera to stuff empty envelopes with coupons for future use. After much stuffing and staring into space, a group of what seemed like college students passed by to read the big sign of the photo pricings just to the right of me. A certain boy out of the group stood out the most to me. He had the most energy out of everyone of the group. You could tell he was very outgoing and had a big personality right from the jump because he, out of all of them, was really humorously excited to see santa and was contemplating doing it the most out of everyone. Anyway, I didn’t think much of it and I continue to mindlessly stuff the envelopes and eavsdrop. HOWEVER,  just moments later this boy approaches me. Nothing really unusual, people approach me all day long to ask for mall directions or about the pricings. (dfhjkgsh i’m reliving the moment in my head as I type this n it’s making me wanna die). I look up, right, and yeah he’s cute.  He looked japanese, but also white passing? I honestly can’t tell or can recall accurately, but point is he was a cuuutie. For more detail, he was really tall, just completely towering over my tiny 5’2 body. he was also wearing a white/beige snapback n he had glasses n he had a michael jackson shirt on… fun fact i absolutely love michael jackson. 

So yeah he approaches me n goes

Him: So how does this thing work? [he has a big grin on his face n i notice how cute his smile it aaa]
Me: [explains, kind of nervous cus cute boi talking to me but also keeping my chill n smiling]
As we began to talk, we hit it off pretty well. Meaning our personalities felt compatible and so the conversation flowed pretty pleasantly for me, being very shy n all.

He went back to his friend group n i just sort of listened to what they were saying to each other. 

His friend group: well u need a list of what u want for christmas to give santa!!

My coworkers gave him paper and a pen and he kneeled down and started hurriedly writing down shit. I had to laugh. He got in line {he was the only person in line} and I opened the gate thing for him and he DASHED in to see santa and santa was so over it; his big energy and how loud he was being. It was so cute n funny. 

At this point, I was really hoping he’d ask for my number or something. Wasn’t really expecting anything either, but, like, yeah.

Anyway, I take the photo and I bring him to the picture viewing station. 
*at station*
Me:
Him: you’re the best [still has the smile on omg so cute]
Me: ??? ty

At this point i was like ok this boy is probably interested n i wanna die cus he’s so cute n funny n nice to me n likes mj n is everything I would’ve wanted in a boy. HE CALLED ME THE BEST…

But then he leaves without saying anything else to me n i’m like oh well he probably wasn’t interested (Kinda disappointed)

I go to take the next customer’s photos and as I walk back to my camera I see his friend group a few shops down and I see him looking at me and i’m just like omg what if he is? 

A few minutes later he comes back and I’m like fjdgjldg
So he’s talking to me and my coworkers about buying a 2nd package of his photos and at this point my heart is racing super fast, i’m getting butterflies, and I’m like… this is going to sound SO cliche but it felt like a spark?? Electricity running through my body?? It was such an intense feeling, something I’ve never felt before but I liked it.

But then i had to walk away to help another customer while he continued to talk to my coworkers. When I was done, my coworkers went up to me and told me that he didn’t actually come back to get anything he just wanted my number.

I got so flustered n happy n dklgjd all the emotions came at once..

But get this: I’m a minor (17 years old) And that’s what my coworkers told him and he left :(. He was clearly in his early 20s. So tragic.

I’m so sad. Bye. I’ve been listening to fucking young/perfect by tyler, the creator this past week ever since this incident had happened. 

Call me DELUSIONAL or way too in my feelings  idc but Something tells me that this was my soulmate. Something clicked between us, and I can’t explain it but It’s something I’ve never felt in my life between me and another boy. It’s a feeling I’ve never experienced until now. It’s sooo weird and intense and I don’t know what to do with this feeling or this experience. I just keep wishing I was already legal. He seemed so right for me, in just this small encounter. Anyways I go home to look at my tarot love readings for mid december to see if this meant anything. Get this: my readings say my love life would be thriving during mid december and that I would most likely meet my soulmate.

I wanna cry. Bye. if that doesn’t confirm that he was my soulmate idk what does.

Soulmate if you are out there, please find me!! I didn’t even get his name… :(

Basically I've been thinking about this for weeks now and with christmas being around the cornor I'm now at my wits end. Short summary of the situation: I'm 22 years old and I've been living with my gf for almost 4 years now and in that time came to the conclusion that the relationship with my parents is toxic af. They are both very narcassistic and negative people and especially my mom is just a bully, pretends like she can say anything because it's just her thoughts and feelings and people should just deal with that. Have been having conflicts with them for about a year now, because I try to find a way to have a healthy relationship with them, but so far, it's only gotten worse. First day of christmas will be spent at my uncle's house, and even though I have no problem with the rest of my family, I really feel like not going, because I know it will just be an entire day of listening to my mom's negativity and whiny stories. I really don't want to disappoint the rest of my family, and I can't really bring into words exactly WHY I don't want to go, but there's this intense struggle in me of 'I don't want to go' vs. 'I don't want to disappoint my family'.

My other family members knew about the event immediately afterward, believed that it happened, and did nothing about it. I have come a long way, and up until recently I haven’t felt defined by the event the same way that I used to. However, someone has been repeatedly bringing the event up, saying “it feels like it happened to me” nearly a decade after the event happened. This person is currently struggling with other mental health issues, and I have sympathy for them, but I am very angry and feel belittled by their actions. I have a very close relationship with this person, and I just don’t know how to handle this. The feelings of worthlessness and self-hatred have started to resurface as a result of regularly talking about the event as if I’m comforting them, and I don’t know what to do... 

Do I have any right to be angry about this person expressing their feelings to other people? They have not talked to me about it directly, but instead I feel like they are using the event to gain sympathy from other people. I feel like this is not their battle, and it is wrong of them to say that they feel like it’s happened to them. 

Should I confront this person? I’m worried about their mental health, but I also feel like they should know that this is wrong.

But its okay to be away."" I just agreed that I had a boyfriend and tried to get him to stop with whatever conversation he was trying to get out of me.

277,"Hello Reddit,  


I am currently seeking advice because for the past 3-4 years, my father's mental state is getting worse and worse. I feel like I should be there to help him out (as he has been doing for me the past 28 years) yet I cannot get a read on him and offer the advice I'd like to give.  


Some background..  


My father has always been a very special person, when it comes to his emotional side.. well let's say it's pretty non-existent to extremely minimal at times. He was raised too man up, never grief, never give in to pain, you name it. My grandfather was a very dominant and egoistic person, he owned his own company, spent all the money on himself (till this day, we have no clue to what, but expect prostitution/drugs etc) and set out the pace for the family, he died pretty young.  


My father suffered from this at a young age, and never really changed things for himself, he kept being who my grandfather was, drinking, being aggressive, being dominant, ...  


I've never known any cognitive love from him, he never said anything, never did anything, it was all pure business. Go to school, find a job, marry, and gtfo. I never spoke to him about things that bothered me at school, my problems, ... I never really had a father figure so to speak. I had to learn everything myself by simply reading (I went for professional help due to severe social anxieties and i had no clue how to behave). Eventually my situation bettered, i found my spot and I'm very happy.  


Now despite all this, my father worked his ass off for the family, due to illness my mother never managed to work, but did do a lot of financial doings. Everything worked out and we never had any financial problems. He also cooked, cleaned, and generally was over-productive, he could never sit down for a minute. Things were reasonable.  


Then once he hit the age of 45-50, he started changing in a better way emotionally, even though it was very small, it was pretty huge if you knew how he was. He started sometimes throwing out cute words etc..

&amp;#x200B;

Fastforward to today, things are regressing, and fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Around 6 years ago, he lost his job due to the place he works at shutting down (costing 30k jobs). He was extremely lucky to get a big payout and an early retirement, so financially he was doing even better then before. Despite this, he lost his job, his contacts, any form of progression and just became a stay at home dad doing nothing all day.

Then 2 years ago he also became very ill, started having heart problems and went for surgery, they had to do the same operation 2 times because it wasn't working (unstable heartrhythm). He suffered quite a few issues for a long time and went to the hospital about 6-7 times in the meanwhile, now finally things have stabilized and with some specific workouts etc he is capable of controlling the byproducts of the surgery.   


Ever since the operation he's been in a very weak mental state of mind. The doctors concluded that he is became very fearful. They started giving him meds, but he stopped using it (by advice of the doctor) because it was making things much worse. The problem is that he is losing his character over time. He is no longer productive, he doesn't want to go out anymore, he has absolutely no interests, we never really talk anymore, just never know what to say to eachother, he lays down on the couch the entire day and is making things very difficult for my mother. She wants to enjoy life, and he's pretty much whining and being negative all day.

Yesterday I had a conversation with my mother and She's considering a divorce. I just talked to her about it and sort of agreed that i understood how she felt, it really is bad and i understand that she can't handle it (she recently lost both her parents to suicide and a sister to a carcrash) so she's not capable of handling another burden.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet my father despite his lack of emotional investment has done so much for us it feels like betrayel not even trying to the bitter end to better his situation. We talked to him about it, he knows, he refuses any professional help, he is unreachable and I feel like I'm not looking for the right solutions.

279,"My parents have this old mentality that dogs are not sentient beings, they just have dogs as alarms, which is stupid because they have an actual alarm system in the house. Two years ago, the family's german shepherd died. He was always kept outside, no walks, just a tiny blanket, no play, no love, nothing. The only thing they did OK was taking him to a bath clinic and giving him the vet attention he needed, and don't hate me for this, but sometimes I felt like the latter just prolonged his suffering. My mother was the one that took care of him. Two days after he died, my father bought another german shepherd, without consulting anybody. Let's call him Alex. My mother didn't want another dog because of all the care involved, and because they can't leave the house for long periods of time. Well, my dad did what he wanted. Honestly, I hate him. I hate his fucking machismo. It's hard to talk to him, we've had fights and I'm sure we would have another one if we talked about this. Why are baby boomers so shitty? He's like 65 so I'm not sure if it would be worth to have a fight with him. I have half-sisters with families of their own and I'm sure they don't give a shit. IDK how they do it. I have depression and I'm an animal lover, so this just makes me want to die, I can't ignore it.

&amp;#x200B;

This time around was the same, no play, no love, nothing, and even worse. Alex is bored and destroys everything, so they made a wall between the yard and the garage so he has even less space.  You know, because actually giving him the attention he deserves and training him are no options. He barks all the time. My mom told me a neighbor actually asked my dad if they were feeding him because he's always anxious and the whole street can hear him. In winter he's freezing and I've told my parents about this, they always brush it off saying he has enough hair to protect himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't live here, but I happened to be around at the time the previous dog died, I was able to give Alex as much attention as I could when I was here and everytime I visit the house. I don't know what to do, everytime I'm here my heart breaks, everytime I hear him bark or howl I get depressed. I don't even want to hear stories about him when I'm away because the only thing I can think about is how they're mistreating him. He doesn't deserve this. I don't want to call the police or something like that, but sometimes I wish a major force fixed this, I don't want to hurt my family nor our poor dog. Actually, I kind of hate the veterinary that sold the dog to my dad, he KNOWS my father is an irresponsible owner, everytime I see him he complains about my dad and still, he sold him the dog. 

Btw, my parent's house is in Mexico, I hate the ignorance here, I know not everybody is like this but there's plenty of people mistreating their dogs like this. It's also impossible to take dogs out for a walk in my area (I've done it a couple of times) because they're plenty of stray dogs or owners that leave their dogs outside so it's highly probably that they would hurt your dog and get into a fight.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Tucson with my bf in a tiny apartment, and even so, I don't think stealing Alex is an option. My father would probably buy another one.

Hello everyone. I'm a 22 year old average college student. Before I get to my question, I need to give you some background info.

I've been a quite ambitious cyclist since 18. Had to conquer every segment in strava, climbed a mountain when i got bored, that type of cyclist. As you can guess, I was training hard. I was a road cyclist and i got Spd pedals, which literally locks your shoes to the pedals. This detail is important later. That training continued for 1 or 2 years tops. And then thr trouble began.

Before I had to stop cycling, I developed a ""clicking"", or ""grinding"" noise in my knees. I didn't thought it was important, as i had no pain, and the sounds were onyle there if i bend my knees over 50 degrees. So I continued.  Time passed, and pain started to show up. At first I thought the pain was because overtraining, so I eased down for a while, which helped for a while, but ultimately pain got back even worse. There was a time period of about a month, which I couldn't function without pain meds. I went to the doctor. 

Doctor said that I probably hurt my knee. He advised me to rest and apply cold, plus, stop cycling for a while. So I did. By that time, I was already feeling depressed, because thanks to the uncle Google, I knew about chondromalacia patella, and I wasn't interested in riding anymore because of the pain. I was 20 at that time.

Enter the 2 year break.

I was working at an international sports store, and i got a quite impressive health insurance. My knee pain was back, as i was on my foot 7-8 hours at a time, plus i was bike mechanic which forced me to stay put in my place for long periods of time. I went to the best orthopedist in my area. He ordered MRI for both my knees. And it was what I feared. He said that the spd pedals that i mentioned, plus overtraining, might be the cause. This diagnosis meant that i was most probably NEVER going back to cycling, at least my type of riding. He told me that walking might help, and i should strenghten my legs to take the pressure from my knees. Cycling was out of question obviously. I returned back home, sold my companion, and tried to move on.

Background info ends here.

But the urge is still there. I loved riding because of the thrill i get from the speeds I get when riding down hill, and the feeling of my chest is going to explode and I'm going to pass out from hypenventilation. I love going back to home and not being able to climb the stairs without holding on to rails. Thats how i feel ""alive"". I want my breathe to hurt and i want to breathe like until my fingers go numb. And now it is forbidden, it depresses me quite badly as I can't satisfy these urges. 

Obviously walking does not cut it. I go rock climbing once in a while. The heights and the view from up top is a nice bonus, and knowing that your life is literally tied to a rope gives me that sort of adrenaline rush, but it's not enough. Running on the other hand gives me the sensation of speed, and the bursting lungs. But my knees is a huge question mark in this sport. I am not training to olympics, but I LOVE to train like that.

 Before I ask my questions, I should mention that I'm not running on a hard surface like asphalt or pavement. There is this plastic tile road in where I live, they are solid, but flexes a little bit while running. It helps absorbing that ""impact"" on the knees when I step on it. And also my shoes are quite soft. 

So, my questions are:

*Based on my condition, how safe is it for me to run? 
*Is there anyone with my condition that found a way to satisfy these urges?
*Can you anyone recommend me a type of sport that has any of the two requirements I have?
*The doctor which ordered MRI said that knee damages are irreversible. But I went another doctor after that and he said that knee injections could help and solve my problem. Is there anyone gone that route?

Again, I really need to do something about this, sitting on my ass after I get home is not nice. And I'm starting to gain weight which is bad for my knees",21Dec2018,1

291,"I have been extremely frustrated with my company for the past year (been working there for over 10 years now), because they are constantly trying to get me in trouble so they can get rid of me and bring someone new in. The thing is they can't find anything bad on me, so it's really hard for them to sack me for no reason.

The latest thing that happened just pissed me off so much that I was ready to quit. I got a new boss about 6 months ago, and she has been trying to stay on top of things, but since she has never been in this business before she is still trying to learn, but at the same time she is being very micromanaging, stubborn, heartless, and willing to write people up over the smallest of things. I have tried talking to her a few times about different issues, bur she never wanted to respond to any of that, she just kept giving me weird looks and talking to me in weird way like I'm a kindergarten kid (which I feel is extremely disrespectful).

Anyway, vacation in my company is picked based on seniority, and two (out of 4) weeks that I wanted went to someone who has 5 yrs seniority (1 week), and someone who has about 8-9 months seniority (second week). I tried moving my dates to accommodate for everything but that didn't help, and at the end of the day she just sent out a sheet with assigned weeks (that's how I saw my two weeks went to people who have much less seniority). What I really want to do and yell at her at the top of my lungs for this, but I know I can't do that. How the hell do I approach this issue, when she doesn't want to discuss anything (she literally just sits there and listens and nods her head, tells you she will follow up, then a day after sends you an email with the same decision she already had in the first place). Do I take this vacation sheet and seniority sheet to HR and talk to them? WTH do I do?

294,"I have been talking a guy for a few months now, and have yet to meet him (probably gonna meet him in January). At first I had no feelings for him, but for whatever reason I continued talking to him. He confessed his love for me, I didn’t quite feel the same. Out of nowhere I was in love. I was thinking about him all the time and couldn’t concentrate on anything else. I daydreamed about what it would be like to have him next to me. I wanted to meet him ASAP.
He started talking about wanting to celebrate new year with me and start the new year as “our year” with a kiss. That definitely freaked me out. I had full on anxiety for several days in a row just thinking about the kiss. This will be my first relationship, and I don’t know where I stand on PDA etc. I tried to calm myself down and concentrate on something else. I get anxiety just by writing about it.
So I got really stressed about us meeting around new year, and tonight he told me that he can’t really do it anymore because his foot is hurting so he can’t walk. When I read that it was like all my feelings were gone. The anxiety were gone. The in-love-feelings were gone. All I could feel was “phew, hope he can’t walk for a while”. Definitely not in a mean way, but just relief that I don’t have to meet him right now. This freaked me out as well, because what happened to me?
I suspect that I have commitment issues. Every time I get a crush it just disappears after a while, often after a few months. Did I fall out of love with him? Am I overthinking everything? Is it just my anxiety that’s talking? Am I too used to being single that even the thought of being in a relationship scares me? I can’t exactly end it now when he’s expecting us to be in a relationship. I feel like we don’t really share the same interests, and lately all we have been talking about is our future relationship. I want us to be friends as well, but I’m not getting that side right now. It feels like I need to make up my mind right here and now in case I need to break it off.

297,"I need someone to slap some sense into me or help me find a way to fix things with him, or at least get a friendship down the road, I'm really struggling and I just don't enjoy anything anymore, I get suicidal over the thought of this actually being over so I keep letting myself be in denial of it just so I can go on to another day.


I met him around 4 and a half months ago, liked him a whole lot instantly, we got to talking, and we basically ended up doing everything together all the time, it was even just an online relationship where I met him through a game, but the feelings I had for him, the excitement of seeing my phone light up with his texts, the pain of breaking it up were all way stronger and worse than anything I experienced in my previous IRL relationships, I just connected so well with him and really, really, wanted it to work out, but it just didn't.



A few days ago he asked me if I'd like to stay friends and see where it goes, and of course, dumb little me agreed, even though deep down I just wanted to get back together, we talked for a day and it was lovely, the next day he basically ghosted me, and I tried to end it with him, implied that I'm not ready for a friendship and would like to cut ties at least for now because I still have feelings for him, but he asked me to stay, and asked me what he can do to make it easier, we talked a bit, and then again, another ghosting (by ghosting I mean not putting effort to make the conversation going, once it dies he doesn't send anything and neither do I).




So around three days ago, I just told him I want to cut all contact and I'm sure he'd understand, and that I chose to tell him this instead of disappearing because I'm worried he might pop up randomly in my life again, and I don't want that happening, he told me that I'm being hurtful and he doesn't get it, and that I can just block him and ""get the fuck out"", he was pretty angry at me, and ended up blocking me. So yup, that was it. I only chose to do so because of how much I was struggling and how much it was fucking with my brain to be ""friends"" with him.



I see him online often on the site we met on, he instantly leaves if he sees me, it hurts a lot, I so badly wanna get him back in my life, I regret my decision so much even though deep down I know it's for the best but I just can't live with it for now, I should have retried to talk time away from him instead of the no contact and never talk to each other again.


Please don't ridicule my feelings and wants just because it was an online relationship, I've been in love before and yes even though it took me 3 years (kept going on and off with him during that) to get over my first boyfriend, this almost feels exactly like that pain back if not worse at times, and I'm terrified it might take me too long to get over it, and I don't even want to do that, I just want him back.

300,"Hi. I'm 24(m). I moved into an apartment near Boston to save money while working about a year ago. I found the place on Craigslist but it ended up being not bad. I get along with my roommates. It's a 4 bedroom. Originally a guy and girl (couple, both about 27) lived in two rooms, but have since shared one basically. There is another house-mate who keeps to himself and is about 30. He basically lives off of the kitchen while the other three rooms are upstairs. 

The woman is about 5 months pregnant and they are adamant about staying. I think (individually) they pay less rent than me, probably about 600 each, while I pay 700. The thing is, economically, it's a pretty good deal for everyone. But now they're having a child and expect things to stay the same.

I worry it will be noisy and they might expect me to help with random tasks that might pop up (babysitting, changing diapers?). I kind of feel like families should have their own place to live and I would like to get two new roommates. I don't think the landlord knows she's pregnant, but could it change the lease agreement if she adds another person to the house?

309,"So I live with my mom, dad, little brother and older sister. My sister and I are in college (travelling from home), she got held back a year and so that made us really close - spending time together at home and school helped us get closer, she is not only my sister but one of my best friends.

We live in a stereotypical suburban area, everyone is friends and looks out for each other.

Next door lives our family friends, Mr. Doe with his wife, son and daughter. His son and I are very good friends, his daughter and my sister are very good friends and of course are parents are friends too.

I would describe it as one big family (cringe) but it's true, we spend holidays together most of the time and we are always at each others houses.

I am known in the family as the person who always loses their charger, so I asked my sister to use hers, I went upstairs and her phone was plugged in (unlocked), I just took a quick glance and saw a notification from Mr.Doe, he had sent a picture.

I know it was wrong but I went on the chat and not only saw a picture that I really didn't want to see, I saw a bunch of graphic texts along with different texts confirming that they have slept together multiple times, I marked the message as unread and just plugged my phone in and went back downstairs pretending that I didn't see anything.

Long summary....
Too lame to talk to anyone I know about my life ... 
31, and grew up in Cape Town South Africa. Have always been very shy, and doubt myself constantly. I'm smart (I think anyway), good looking (I know this seems vain but it's just the truth), and charming... (Yes.... This paragraph seems a little contradictory but bare with me). 

I have always been extremely shy, and doubt myself constantly, to the point where I am incapable of making life decisions. I did not study, because I was too afraid to make the 'wrong' choice, and started working as a waiter after school instead as this was the path of least resistance... I just kind of fell into it. Worked my way up to group manager within a couple of years and then resigned to become an estate agent (again... The path of least resistance). I got married very young (20), to my first girlfriend, and divorced at 27. Immediately got into a new relationship with a gorgeous, successful girl (locally famousish (who knows how... Did I say I was charming? 😅)), Who I have been involved with for the past 4 years. 

I moved to Johannesburg, to experience another city, but also as an excuse to be closer to my girlfriend who got a contract there which she couldn't refuse. 

After having lived together in Cape Town, our relationship was just never the same in the new city. We were both unhappy, and the home situation became quite unhealthy, with (real, not just weed) drugs, constant arguing and general sadness. I became very depressed and non functional at work and life. I resigned from my job, and moved back to Cape Town, with the agreement that we were taking a 'break'. 

Now, I am unemployed, depressed, and camping in my house. All of my furniture, clothes, are still in Johannesburg. 

I have no money and I don't want to be an estate agent anymore. For some reason I can't seem to make myself just.... Live .. I have not found a new job, and my life feels like watching a slow motion car crash, except that I'm behind the wheel. 

1. How to motivate myself to seek out my passion, rather than just following the path of least resistance?  How do I even decide what this is, when every time I start to think about it I distract myself with banal rubbish because I talk myself out of pursuing any idea I have because I think others will find it stupid? 

2. What do I do for money RIGHT NOW. I don't want to do something like waitering... I'm too old (31) and that's embarrassing for me - it would feel like going backwards. 

3. Do I break up with a girl who is beautiful, brilliant, famous, loves me, but makes me unhappy? 


TLDR
What the fuck.... Why is adult lifeing so difficult for me?

323,"Long story short I had sex with a prostitute and am worried about STI s or STDs. Had a condom on but it broke and was only unprotected for a few mins. I’m not too sure on the time because I was quite drunk. The area is Tokyo in the big red light area if that provides information. I was gonna go to a hospital to get tested but it’s quite late and would have be miles from my hostel. So I’m gonna go tomorrow morning. I contacted the girl I was with and asked her if she knew if she had any diseases and she said no. But I’m still skeptical and petrified. Ive never done anything remotely like this before, my friend from uni was a not so great influence and wanted hand jobs and one thing led to another and now I’m here. I’m strapped for cash, leaving in a few days to head back to the USA and I am too full of guilt to even think about telling my mom or dad. Anyone have any advice on the matter I’d greatly appreciate it. ",21Dec2018,1

328,"So basically in one my hardest classes in college, i’ve done well. My roommate told me a month ago how this very pretty girl who immediately caught my eye the first time I saw her had mentioned me. My roommate and a bunch of other people in the class including her have study sessions for the class and he’s asked me to come but I declined as I’m an introvert and don’t particularly find group study very useful, especially because those people in the group aren’t that bright.

He told me how she asked where I was during the sessions and how she kept saying I’m so smart and so nice. This has lead to some anxiety as this is no ordinary girl. She’s one of the most beautiful girls I’ve ever seen. Part of this is because of our backgrounds. She’s Italian from an all-white town in New Hampshire. I’m Pakistani (born and raised in the U.S.) and it just feels like my background is hindering me. I feel like she doesn’t particularly know what I am and might be thinking I’m something else since I have a light-brown complexion. I just feel if she would know I’m Pakistani it would be a turn-off because I’ve always felt we have a bad reputation.

Also, I found myself putting her on a pedestal because she’s Italian and because of Italy’s grand reputation, tourism, architecture, etc. Italians have a lot of influence and clout in America and Italy has an amazing reputation and tourism.

331,"I’ve posted about my experience with her in r/emotionalabuse. Long story short she is manipulative and will lie to get what she wants. Anyways, it started with me not contacting them on thanksgiving. She called but I didn’t answer back, honestly, I just didn’t feel like talking to her bc of a prior situation( she lied to my aunt). So a couple days go by and she called and guilt tripped me for not calling and saying that I’m selfish. I told her that I’m in a stressful job and that I needed space right now. So of course she wasn’t understanding and the conversation didn’t end well. About 5 days ago I get a call from my grandpa and he said that she was hurt by the things I said and that I should call or text and amend everything. So I sent her a well thought out text apologizing, validated her being upset,  told her we should put this behind us and that me and my bf would be visiting Christmas morning. I get a nasty text back saying that she didn’t want us to visit Christmas morning and she basically uninvited us from her brother George’s party( which I got an invitation for a day before this happened). I didn’t say anything back. And then two days later I get a text from her saying that she wanted to talk, and that we were re-invited for Christmas. With my work schedule I could talk to her when she wanted to, yet I suggested another time and asked if that would work for her. I told her that we made other plans for Christmas morning, but we still would go to her brother George’s. She then sent me another text back asking what time we would be at their house Christmas morning, totally ignoring my plans and what I intend to do. 

I know this sounds like a lot of meaningless drama, but she subtlety plays this game so she can have her way.

332,"Long story short, this week is finals week and my original work week is Sunday, Saturday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for a total of 32 hours.

I asked the same foreman two weeks straight if I could go in if I was free on Friday to get some extra hours, but every Friday I ended up busy studying and having to get the grade.

Wednesday on his way out of work I asked him again if I could make up hours Friday if I was free. Turns out there’s an extra credit opportunity today to add +10 points to my final so I’m not going to pass it up.

Thing is, I’ve told him the past two Fridays that I can’t make it, and it’s been a vicious cycle of asking to work the extra day and then falling into the work of my studies. 

School&gt;work of course, but should I shoot him a text for the third week straight or just not go in? I would feel pretty unreliable since this is the third week in a row that I’ve asked and then tell him that studies have come up again.",21Dec2018,1

335,"Hello, I am currently in my last semester at university majoring in mechanical engineering and am lucky enough to have a couple job opportunities laid out in front of me.

My first option is to stay with the firm I have been working at for nearly a year now - my boss told me that when it gets closer to graduation (this May) he would like to make me a job offer. The company is more of an electrical engineering firm than anything else and my title would be ""Power Systems Engineer,"" sounds fancy! However, this company is on the smaller side consisting of \~30 employees and only 8 engineers including myself. From passive conversations with my coworkers I understand that the pay a tad on the low end compared to the average salaries of mechanical/electrical engineers in my area. This company has been around for 25 years and the CEO/bossman has big dreams to expand the scope of our work and is in the process of purchasing a new building to hire more engineers.

My second option is at a more well-established MEP firm with hundreds of employees in my area. The pay is sure to be greater according to my connections there, however I would be leaving some friends I have made at my current company along with needing to start on the bottom again.

My end goal is to move into a management position where I can help the company and my subordinates grow all the while being compensated appropriately. Should I take the gamble of staying at this smaller company in its early stages, hoping to ride the possible wave as it blooms in the industry - or risk starting at a large company where climbing the ladder into a supervisor position would be more difficult.

Any input would be greatly appreciated! I'm sure there's someone out that that has been in a similar situation.",21Dec2018,1

339,"So I'm from a third world country and decided to study engineering for bachelor's degree for the sake of my family's future. Engineering has the best prospects in the circumstances of my country and I just thought this would be the best choice. Now I'm in my 4th semester and I don't like what I study at all. All I fascinate about all day is books and movies. I want to investigate morality, learn behavioural psychology, do my higher studies on things like social development. I want to understand why we do what we do, to understand the purpose of humanity's existence. I adore western philosophy, get intrigued by history, get enormous pleasure from reading magic realism. But the only thing, the only thing I absolutely despise, is the thing I study, Engineering. I don't even want to know the inner workings of an induction motor or how heat transfer works, let alone solve hundreds on problems on it. Still I have to go on with it because I can't just drop out and put my family in jeopardy. I'm their eldest son and obviously responsible for them. They are not economically well off at all. 

I don't know what to do. I didn't want my life to be like this. It's like I'm not living my life but someone else's. And I'm just waiting for my life to start. I don't know when it will start, or if it will ever start. And how? Nothing in humanities entails a safe and respected profession in my country. Their is no good institution for that either. If I want to leave this country that would mean I have to get a huge scholarship for higher studies abroad which has to be in engineering, that would not be something I want. I feel helpless and trapped. I hope you guys will leave some encouraging words for me.",21Dec2018,1
340,"  

I currently work in my first job in corporate retail. My current position is entry level &amp; I have been here for 2 years. 

I am ready to do something more creative &amp; just something new. An associate from another area of the business recently got promoted to a new role in my department.

Her previous role sounded super interesting &amp; I wanted to go for it. I’m not positive I would like this role – it just sounds interesting. Something new. 

However they then changed her role to the lowest level in her department – a clerk. Just someone who does clerical type of work. She was doing a lot of clerical functions- but on a higher scale. She definitely wasn't considered a clerk.  She was at the bottom of her specific area - but not the lowest of the department as a whole if that makes sense. 

The previous role was more involved with the business – I did talk to the former associate who said she thinks the clerk could still be involved if they wanted. However a lot of the higher scale reporting she would be taking with her (which IDC I don't want to do reporting)

This would **not** be a promotion for me &amp; based on what I’ve heard basically a step down. 

Since we are two different departments/functions of the business the scales are different in terms of level– but everyone does treat this department as the lowest of the low at the company.

You don’t need a college degree just a HS diploma. However it’s really with a part of the business that is different so a lot of the functions wouldn’t be the same.

It just sucks they changed it to that. I would still be making the same amount of money. 

I’m just not sure this is the smart thing to do. Yes, it could be interesting &amp; aligns better with what I think I want to do. However I would have to stay in the role a year. If something else opens that would be a promotion I would be stuck there. I’m stuck getting the same pay (at least for another year). It also bothers me that someone with just a high school diploma qualifies &amp; my current role required a college degree &amp; some manager experience. I feel like I'm back to square one for another year with a low standing role. However it would be something fresh, new, and possibly more fun. 

What’s your opinion? Would any of you go for it? Or is it not worth the risk? 

**TL;DR:** Potential job I want but it’s a step down; aligns more with a direction I THINK I want to go – not sure I should risk stepping down to do so. ",21Dec2018,1

348,"I live in Israel and we have a mandatory military service of 2 years and 8 months, but because of my depression I am pretty sure that I can get an exemption from the service if I wanted to. The problem is that my entire family served in the Israel Defense Forces and they are all extreme Zionists. So if I decide to not do my military service for the country many of them will lose their respect for me and even hate me. On top of that, I know that quite a few Israelis will shame me for the rest of my life if they hear I didn't do my military service, and I don't know if I can mentally handle that. My reason for not wanting to go to the military is mainly that I don't support the current colonization by Israel so I really don't think it would make sense for me to fight for the side that is maintaining this colonization.  Maybe I can refute this reason by saying that the military is merely defending the country and it is the government's fault for the situation so by doing my service I am solely defending the country and in that case it doesn't matter if I agree with Israel's policies or not.  
I don't know if I should try to justify going to the military just to avoid ""hatred"" from other people or if I should just go with my heart and get an exemption.

",21Dec2018,1
352,"This is going to be what I feel like is a lot. It's going to feel like a rant but I truly want some sort of advice. 

First off some background. I'm 27 I work at a fast food restaurant. I make 10.50 an hour as a closing shift manager and I work a solid 40 hours every week. And I hate it. I worked my ass off to get the promotion. I take orders I make the food I know the store inside and out. The job is so easy I spend most of my nights reading books to pass the time. I want to change jobs and make more money. But I do not want to work in food anymore. But I also feel like I'm not qualified to do anything else. And pretty much nothing interests me enough to pursue other things. I don't care about any certifications offered at the community college. (Which is basically your general selection of certifications.) And by don't care I mean more along the lines of a general apathy for life and what it has to offer. I've mulled over the idea of Real Estate Salesman or Bartending. The certifications for those are relatively inexpensive and the training is normally on the job which I prefer and I am a hard worker, I just don't think I'm anywhere near financially stable enough or mentally prepared to make such drastic leaps. I'm also afraid to leave because this year will be the first time in my entire life that I've had any kind of insurance and I am in desperate need of dental work. My family has never been able to afford health or dental so I've maybe had a check up twice in my life. But a lot of ER visits to bring up the slack. Everyone in my family has been in dentures by 25 and I at least made it to 27 but that's the path i'm on. You grow up on koolaid and fast food with no supervision and when you realize how fucked up that is as an adult it's too late.

Secondly. I have very little savings. And what I do have is for a deposit on a house to rent. I was evicted from my apartment a year ago, and I am currently living with my girlfriend and her insane parents. My roommates where I was living spent most of there money on pot and kept being short on rent so I had them leave. And then I made the wrong choice of changing jobs around the same time while looking for replacements. The job I took paid more but it was at a start up that quickly failed. I unknowingly joined a sinking ship. We fell very behind on rent and were inevitably evicted. We moved a couple hours away and i got my job back but at a different store and was the promoted. We are currently searching for living arrangements seeing as my girlfriends parents never stop screaming about random things like why are there only 9 spoons instead of ten? Or who broke the extremely cheap toilet seat that has broken 6 freaking times since I've lived here because they refuse to buy any other seat but the cheapest one Walmart has to offer because it matches the decore. Despite my many offers to go and buy them a new one from home depot myself. coupled with the fact that her sister lives with us as well and she is a 35 year old drug addicted thief who manipulates the rest of her family into letting her stay here. But as you can probably guess trying to find a place to live with an eviction. Not easy. the word alone is enough for people to say no. The lack of savings comes from the fact that we've been paying off the eviction bill which was around 9000 dollars. Which is just insane. On top of paying rent where we are now and general living expenses. I'm not a great saver and I can definitely be better. But I do try.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically. I hate my job and I want to change and try to make a better life but I don't know if that will help how I feel about the job in anyway. If the job is going to be soul crushing might as well just keep what I have so I can keep reading my books and keep my dental insurance.

353,"To begin, I would like to say that I would like feedback on whether or not I should post this to collegeadvice.

So I've always been interested in theater, musicals specifically. I'm graduating this year, and my family is pretty well off so I need to decide where I'm going to college. I've always wanted to be on stage, and I love to sing more than anything, heck I need music to survive. I originally planned on going to AMDA (The American Musical and Dramatic Academy) in new York, but it costs so much, and I don't think I'd get in. I've only applied to community colleges for audio engineering, and I don't think it's what I want.

For a background in theater, I auditioned for a part in a play at Midland Center For The Arts, which is the biggest theater program near me. I auditioned for The Outsiders and I didn't get the part, that was two years ago and I haven't auditioned since, not because I'm discouraged, but I believed it was a sign it wasn't where I belong but I'm not so sure now. I also had one Drama/Public Speaking class, but the teacher had never done anything like it before, so he had no idea what he was doing. He gave us a camera and told us to make a movie, then graded it and told us to do it again.

TL;DR: I want to be on stage, I haven't had much experience but i love everything about it, should I do it or should I just be an audio engineer.",21Dec2018,1

355,"My best friend growing up (I will call Brian) and his girlfriend (I’ll call Jessica) have been dating for some time now (give or take a few years). Recently, me and Jessica have become friends, and have bonded really close. I went through the phase of being in love with her and I can’t help but think this is what is fueling my anger, just recently, I have been hanging out with Brian and Jessica a lot and I’ve kind of seen how their relationship goes. (Keep in mind we are all 19-20 years of age). The pattern goes, me and Brian are having a good time and Jessica will be sitting on the bed watching us game, he’ll notice her taking a nap or on her phone and immediately lose interest in me and go lay with her and start touching and feeling and making inappropriate remarks to her in front of me (which im used too) but I noticed Jessica was a little uncomfortable and her and I haven’t had the opportunity to talk as much recently, so I texted her last night and asked her if everything is okay, and if her and Brian are alright, she said she was fine and that they’re okay but she added she has a hard time being around him when he’s off his meds. I asked her to explain a little and she just said he has a hard time with self control. I decided to dive a little deeper so I can see how she truly feels, a long conversation ensued and she eventually told me he constantly pressures her into having sex and he tells her it’s the best thing for their relationship. This was very upsetting to me but the worst part was a joke she made, she said “I guess I should be on one of those I’m in love with my rapist shows lol” and that began a chain reaction of emotions. I asked her if I could talk to him and she said as long as I don’t kill him.  so I decided to talk to Brian before we went to sleep last night and asked him about their sex life (most of you will find this strange however I consider him my brother and it’s nothing we haven’t talked about before) I asked him how often they were having it, and his reply was 4-5 days a week, which implies it’s more than once a day. He then proceeded to talk about how it’s the only way a relationship could become successful and it’s the best way to show how much she loves him. Which was troubling to me, I told him they were both worth so much more than that and he kept disagreeing, his final comment (which I couldn’t hide my discomfort) was when he said “if I could. I would fuck the shit out of her 7 days a week”. Which I then proceeded to say “dude come on” and I rolled over and fell asleep. Fast forward to this morning, she told me she was gonna try and talk to him and that she “doesn’t really care about sex if that’s what’ll make him happy”. I truly care about this girl, not because I want to date her or anything, but because she’s been a huge part of my life and has helped me through some truly difficult times and I don’t want to sit by and watch her life fall apart because I know she can find someone better and Brian can find someone who will make himself a better person.

Although I love both of my parents very much, my mother constantly works all the time and my father is really religious, and really thinks he’s right all the time and the lord is coming every day. Anyway, my birthday is 1/3/99. I woke up that morning at my moms and she told me happy birthday, but unfortunately she had to work that morning so I didn’t get to be with her on my birthday. Then, I went down my dads. My brothers and friends messaged me, and wished me a happy birthday. By around 3, my dad still hasn’t acknowledged it was my birthday, and I thought he was going to surprise me. But the day went on, and at around 7, I went up my grandmothers, on my dads side, who lived up the hill from my dad, and even she acknowledged my birthday. I knew dad forgot at this point, but I didn’t want to accept it. How could a father forget his sons birthday? His own sons birthday? As it fell to 11 o’clock, I sat in my bed crying because it fucking hurt. I’ve always been very close to my father, but I wouldn’t ever think he would forget his sons birthday. As the clock rolled around 11:50, I knocked on my dads door and I told him straight up, while tears in my eyes in the dark, “ Dad you know it was my birthday today, right? He was silent. He didn’t know what to say. He just got up, said he was sorry, went to Walmart and got a cake for me, and came back and lit it. He told me he was sorry, and I blew out the candle, and went to bed. Never tried to hug me, or act like he cared. I never accepted his apology. All the does all day is sit around, and read the Bible. This hurt me so much man.  It just made my depression even worse. As the time rolls around again, I just wish he doesn’t forgot again.

Parents, please don’t forget your child’s birthday. Mark it on a calendar, or set a reminder on your phone. Because maybe they were looking forward to it. ",21Dec2018,1

He never responded my my mom's text messages throughout the night asking where he was. He didnt answer his phone. Apparently in his last marriage, he was messing around with a coworker while with his last wife. My mother just found this out last night.

He lost his phone, didn't return with his car, was so DRUNK, was covered in mud. He spent a LOT OF MONEY on alcohol last night. He threw up in the bed, my mom had to take care of him to make sure he didnt drown in his own vomit. She's very angry.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do about this? I feel like this is highly inappropriate, or is this just common management practice?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Employee A:

Strengths

Fast to answer the phone Asks for things to do Friendly and wants to do a good job. First one up to get to the counter if help is needed. Excellent on staying on top of returns.  
Seems to have picked up (sales system) extremely well. Cheat sheets only, really doesn’t know what anything is Always replies when she has completed something for me. \**She doesn’t want to sit idle \**Isn’t afraid to talk to someone even when she knows she wont know

Deficiencies

Doesn’t have the proper phone etiquette I think if she doesn’t understand something she doesn’t necessarily try to. Its, I don’t know what that is sooo.. that’s the end of it. \**L doesn’t like her, but they had a talk last Sat and L said she thinks they will get along better \**She doesn’t seem to get the sequence of pn#’s, she sometimes has a difficult time figuring it out \**Seems to be short with some people, phone and in person. Gives the impression she is arrogant or already knows the answer, which isn’t the case \** needs to be more “sweet”? on the phone \*\* very young/immature in business \*\* B doesn’t want to deal with her anymore

Employee B:

Strengths

Excellent phone etiquette I think he completes tasks asked of him but needs to be asked status of those tasks several times. I watched him write up an order for pick up and he filled it himself. (counter was busy) That surprised me. He seemed to just do it without being asked. \*\* he seems to have an old soul, if we can break it out

Deficiencies

Never hear a peep out of him. Hard to tell if he is here sometimes. Does not ask for things to do. Will let the phone ring right to the end before answering. \*\* no sense of urgency \*\* I think he is afraid of the question he will get on the phone because he doesn’t know answer \*\* very timid, quiet, which is surprising

Side notes:

We are definitely not keeping them busy enough at this time. Not sure if L and other office people can learn to delegate. That needs to be taught.

They both could use much more training, but they have been thrown in the pool at this point. They have to learn how to learn, and how to ask to learn.

Interestingly, gave them both an email list from a customer for pick up of 55 items. They both couldn’t get 5 or 6 items. There was no cheat sheet on those items. If we had one, I think they would have found them. I have a list of “basic” cheat sheets it hadn’t occurred for me to make until these 2.",21Dec2018,1

Treatment is going to take a long time, and then recovery from surgery could take even longer. I'm currently unemployed due to this, as I wouldn't be able to complete any design work (drawing or using a computer) without my arm.

**What are some things I could do to pass the time and feel content given these conditions?**

•  I should avoid using my right arm to let it heal

•  My health has been somewhat shaky as I recently had my gallbladder taken out and dropped a lot of weight, so my   
   physical health could use some work

•  I'm 23 year old M making ends meet as an Uber driver for dates and food while staying at my parents home, so money   
   really is tight at the moment

•  I love anything design related because I love my work! If I could do anything relevant to design without using my   
   dominant arm that would be awesome! ^(but its okay if i cant :()

•  The job season is slow at the moment, I have many irons in the fire with connections into design corporations that are

372,"  

Because there are so many moving parts to this problem, I’ll explain the main ones. I am a full-time college student working part time. Right now, I can barely afford my own rent and living expenses. My mom is disabled and has applied and been denied disability benefits multiple times over the course of the past four years. She cannot work a job to afford her own living expenses. Up until now, my younger sister has been working full time and paying most of the rent for the two of them. She recently moved out of the house for various reasons and my mother had to move out because she couldn’t afford to pay the rent. 

At this point, my mom has been working with multiple social workers and attorneys to both receive the benefits she deserves and to find a place to live, with no luck. She can only live in the living room of my sister’s one-bedroom apartment for one more day. If she stays there any longer, both my sister and her boyfriend will get evicted from the place. 

I’ve offered to have my mom stay at my place for two weeks until I can figure out where to send her, but it can’t be any longer than that because I share a lease with four other students and it would be illegal to have her move in permanently there. What I want is for her to have her own place, and right now, no place exists that we can afford. 

In addition to the cramped time frame, moving is a problem for my mom because she still has three of my siblings under her custody half of the time (the other half is spent with my father). If she moves out of a ten-mile radius from their school, then she loses custody completely. 

Most of my extended family does not associate with my mom because she divorced my father due to abuse, so I can’t ask any of them for help. I also obviously can’t ask my father, who I haven’t spoken to in years. 

I’m desperate to find her a home because just the thought of her being homeless breaks my heart. 

If anyone has ANY advice, please share it with me. 

Thank you. 

TL;DR: My mom is about to be homeless and I don’t have any resources or experience to deal with an issue like this. Looking for any advice. ",21Dec2018,1

385,"I go to an extremely conservative university in a state several thousand miles from home. I went to my friends house a couple nights ago and ended up getting so high from a tincture of THC, I stated having seizures and ended up going to the hospital. The thing is, I’ve never done drugs in my life. Never drank, never got into any kind of trouble, nothing like that. I don’t remember a lot from the night besides getting the impression that it was CBD not THC (which i thought was legal). I don’t know why I would do that, especially when I’ve never done anything like that before, have turned him down for drugs in the past, and didn’t even have a stressful day. 

What i do remember is going to his place, him putting this into my drink saying it would be fine, and then leaving as soon as I got to my apartment with other people. 

Anyway, there was an investigation done and the guy starts blatantly lying to the mediator, saying I pop pills and am always encouraging him to do drugs and stuff. I disputed all of this and got several other people to vouch for me. I asked the mediator what he thought would happen, and he said he thought it would be very unlikely and doubted I’d be asked to step away from the school. 

Fast forward to yesterday, when I got a call from him saying the council considered what I did wrong as I thought it was CBD, which is a sister to weed and an illegal substance in this state. Then I got a formal letter, that said essentially that they didn’t believe me thinking it was CBD and that I knew all along it was THC, conflicting with what the mediator said.

386,"  

TL:DR first: I have been offered a job (which I have conditionally accepted) that would provide excellent mentorship and higher pay, but much more personal stress. I am under a lot of stress and am depressed, and am not sure whether accepting this job is a good decision.

I am a pretty new lawyer - I was called to the bar about a year and a half ago. For the past year, I have been practicing family law in association with another lawyer, but essentially on my own. I pay my own overhead, including office and law clerk, but because of my lack of experience, it takes me much longer to complete work and research on my files. I have made embarrassing mistakes because of my inexperience, which I cannot bill for, and which cause a great deal of stress because they directly impact my clients. As a result, I do not make very much take-home income, although this may improve in the future. 

In terms of how I feel about practicing family law, it can obviously be very caustic and stressful. I often feel overwhelmed, to the point of questioning becoming a lawyer in the first place. But there are moments where clients express their gratitude for the work I have done, which gives me a strong sense of fulfillment. I love to help people in ways that matter. 

I have thought about practicing criminal law (or some other field), but do not have any good inroads or opportunities at the moment.

I have been offered a job at a boutique family law firm where I did my articles. They are very good at what they do, and would provide excellent mentorship and guidance. They also offer a competitive salary, and would cover all overhead costs, so I would take home much more income. 

However, the lead partner can be a difficult person to work with. She is fiercely loyal to her staff, and is an excellent lawyer, but goes through emotional extremes. She is a good person, but it can be very stressful working with her. The firm also expects a lot in terms of billable hours. 

I am working on the other side of a file with her now, and her aggressiveness has strayed into unprofessionalism. Lawyers are required to advocate for their clients to the best of their ability, but I feel she went too far in an email that she sent to me that seemed more like bullying than ethical advocacy. I called her on this in my reply, and got an angry phone call in return, during which she hung up on me. 

In my personal life, my marriage is crumbling for reasons that I don’t want to go into, and I need to make sure that I can be financially secure. I also need to protect my mental health. With everything going on in my life, I have had suicidal thoughts. I have been seeing a therapist, who recommended that I get checked out for depression, which I am doing now.

I have conditionally accepted this offer (which happened before the email incident). Rejecting it now would permanently damage my reputation with this firm. However, I am completely torn about whether going through with this job is a good idea. I feel very anxious about this. It is possible that the extra guidance would help me feel less overwhelmed, but I am afraid of the amount of stress that the firm, and this partner in particular, might put on me.",21Dec2018,1

My roommate told me a month ago how this very pretty girl who immediately caught my eye the first time I saw her had mentioned me. My roommate and a bunch of other people in the class including her have study sessions for the class and he’s asked me to come but I declined as I’m an introvert and don’t particularly find group study very useful, especially because those people in the group aren’t that bright.

He told me how she asked where I was during the sessions and how she kept saying I’m so smart and so nice. This has lead to some anxiety as this is no ordinary girl. She’s one of the most beautiful girls I’ve ever seen. Part of this is because of our backgrounds. She’s Italian from an all-white town in New Hampshire. I’m Pakistani (born and raised in the U.S.) and it just feels like my background is hindering me. I feel like she doesn’t particularly know what I am and might be thinking I’m something else since I have a light-brown complexion. I just feel if she would know I’m Pakistani it would be a turn-off because I’ve always felt we have a bad reputation.

Also, I found myself putting her on a pedestal because she’s Italian and because of Italy’s grand reputation, tourism, architecture, etc. Italians have a lot of influence and clout in America and Italy has an amazing reputation and tourism.

397,"Where I live it's pretty common to hug hello and goodbye. Even if you are just meeting them, not so much for hello but the goodbye they go in for the hug and I just hate it. I hate even hugging people I'm close to. Nothing against them, I just am uncomfortable hugging people. 

Does anyone have advice on how to get out of these situations? I don't want to offend anyone and it's pretty common for people to find it rude if you don't hug them hello and goodbye. 

I've tried just putting my hand out for a shake and they usually laugh and go in for the hug anyway.

398,"I am interested in survival tactics. I enjoy learning about ancient and modern ways to manipulate the world around you to survive. It’s thought provoking and honestly realistic in terms of what is going on around us now. 
I watched a movie called Bird Box and I noticed how birds were so distressed and obviously gave people a fore-warning. How realistic would this be if you couldn’t use your eyes? If you didn’t have an option of a dog or cat. Might be silly but I’m genuinely curious. ",21Dec2018,1
399,"I have been out of school for 6 months and I haven’t found a job in my career yet. I majored in nuclear medicine. 

I applied through a temp agency for a position that pays 21/hr but isn’t in my career, yet in the field of medicine, working in a lab tagging antibodies and antigens for tissue assessment (immunoassay), and is in my hometown. 

There is a position that pays 30/hr but is in my career and will have me travel 2 hours away to get to the mobile unit to work. It’s a PET machine and is right in my wheelhouse but I will be working alone, only with a scheduled, and being the first job out of college, I’m not sure it will be the most comfortable

There’s another position that is in Spokane, it’s at a PET clinic so will be about 20 min away for whenever I move, but is about 7hrs away from home. It pays 30 an hour and they will help me get my CT credential finished which will make me more marketable down the road. 

I already passed the background check for the temp agency and seem to be cleared to work there. 

To work at the Spokane job, they will need me to get a 7 hr AIDS course completed, and get the state license to be able to work there. 

To work at the “travel job” it will require me to pass an extensive background check process and with the other hospital jobs I’ve applied for, that’s where I fail most of the time and I don’t get an offer or get it rescinded. 

Can people on here help me (or at least give me your two cents) because it’s always overwhelming for me that I’m making the right choice and there are always multiple jobs available that come my way at one time.

410,"Ok reddit,  i'd like some advice regarding crushes in relationships.  When i first started dating my BF 2 years ago, i felt as if i met my match and was so happy, but i thought i'd no longer be able to explore women sexually anymore so i asked him very early on about inviting a woman to bed with us at some point.  At first, he said no,  but one night my friend out of drunkenness and drugs starts making out with me and my BF walks in.  Nonetheless,  it changed his mind on a threesome.  Conversations about it came up here and there but nothing serious.  Out of conversation on acid,  i asked him who he'd like to have a threesome with and he mentioned this girl, Ashley, who was kinda in the scene of nightlife.  At the time, i had no idea who this girl was and probably said yes to it. He brought her up again after i met her and I just wasnt attracted to her and told him straight up i wasn't into her. (She's very pretty and sweet, but not my type and she also has a boyfriend). He brought her up a 3rd time and started liking her photos on social media and it really frustrated me because hypothetically,  if he wanted to bring a guy into the mix and i suggested a guy i felt was attractive and he said no,  id drop it! Id never want to make him think someone else could get in between us like that.  Id still find him attractive but not keep making a 3some happen.

Fast forward throughout the year, my BF and i had something experiences with each other i can't imagine i could reach with anyone else.  However,  this Ashley girl was still a constant arguement.   We'd see her out and about and say hi but there was no connection on her end for me OR him, but apparently this ""forbidden fruit"" stirred such desire in him he admitted to me several times that he finds her physically and sexually attractive and is very attracted to her energy and wants a connection with her. This hurt.  Once he even said he thinks about her everyday. I told him to go ahead so he can figure out what he wants, but i'm not sticking around. But then he'd say all he wanted was to be honest and he feels better about telling me and nothing can get in between us and he's so thankful i understand him and blah blah blah. 

Ive avoided going out to certain parties b/c i worry she's going to be there and he's just going to follow her around like a puppy dog (he's done that 2x while rolling on ecstasy). I keep telling him i don't think he's right for a relationship, but he insists on managing this and working on himself bc he believes in us and doesn't want to lose me and says he can't picture life without me.  I feel the same way about him minus this crush he has.  It's really killing my desire for him and my confidence in myself because now i find myself constantly comparing myself to her. 

Can anyone please enlighten me who has/had a crush in their relationship or their significant other has/had a crush and how you look at this situation and how you deal with it?

417,"I’m a female student in college and there is a girl that made me rethink my life. When I first met her, she literally stole my heart and my soul.  She’s that kind of girl that everyone admires, the looks, good grades, popularity, kindness. 

She wasn’t showing any kindness towards me, I never had a chance to know her closer. She kept staring at me and I thought she wanted to be friends, but whenever there was a change to get closer everything would suddenly get too complicated (she wouldn’t be at school that day, she would be with someone else, like there was something against it etc.).
The stares continued, I thought that I was just imagining it or that she just wanted to gossip about me. That wasn’t the case. She would just intensively stare at me and blush then casually do something else. 

Knowing that no one likes me, I gave up easily and let developed actual feelings for her, because I had a hope that she would eventually do something, or even ask me out.
But she never did.

She got a boyfriend and left me broken hearted. And I hate that she still looks at me like she wants to tell me something. I won’t buy it. I’m not a fool anymore.

I need to get rid of these unpleasant feelings as much as possible, I need to study for finals. No matter what, I can’t get her out from my head. I regret that I met her. My life would be so much better without her. All this time I spent thinking about her, I could’ve invested in something more important.

I have to get out. 

I avoid her as much as possible, it doesn’t work. I hate myself, because I’m so stupid to be constantly manipulated like that.  You see, I’m a pretty easy target: I’m unpopular, very vulnerable, alone, I have anxiety with depression issues, feeling constant loneliness… struggling every single time.

418,"As the title states i’m in a pathetic predicament where despite my high salary I still stress over money. I drive a POS toyota, live with multiple roommates and still struggle. I get the concept of saving just fine, the problem is I don’t execute any of those budgets and plans. As soon as my paycheck hits I throw those plans out of the window thinking I have plenty of money to splurge a little. I even tried to have a savings account auto withdraw money as soon as my paycheck hits so I don’t go crazy, but then I spend money thinking oh well I have plenty in savings and next thing I know i’m dipping into the money I just put away in savings. 

Where my money goes: 
* investments. 
I made 32K off bitcoin in one month and ever since that rush I keep on going into more and more shaky investments. I trade options, penny stocks, and other cryptocurrencies. You name it if it has a tag of “high risk/high reward” i’m itching to invest thinking this will finally be the time I can predict the price. 

*over paying when with friends. 
When I was younger I was seen as the burnout that was most likely to fail within the group. Now being the highest earner every time we go out I’ll pick up the bill for all of us without second guessing. My friend’s never ask me to do this. In fact after a while they started telling the staff under no circumstances is the bill to go to me or they purposefully pick cheaper spots because they know i’ll try paying. This instinct is a damn mystery to me, and the only sense I can make out of it is i’m trying to say I told you so to these friends that at one point in time had a sit down with me and told me to get my life together. 

*gifts 
I love getting my parents gifts and money. I bought my dad a new Mercedes 550 for his birthday. Growing up poor seeing my dad put in 16 hour shifts day in and day out make me feel constantly in debt for what he has done for me. This I actually paid off already because i didn’t expect my sister to pitch in but she covered half of it.

The rest goes to impulse buys. (Furniture, fast food, etc...)

So to start off, i have anxiety, and lately it’s been controlling me more than usual. I am also in a relationship that i’ve been in for about 2 months now. I always get bad thoughts, nothing new, stuff like “oh that person over there? yeah they’re laughing at you” or “hey, you look like trash today, go home you absolute raccoon”. But for the past couple weeks, i’ve been stressed about my relationship with my boyfriend. What if he wants to breakup with me, &amp; he’s only with me out of pity? what if he likes someone else? i’m not good enough, i don’t deserve him,,, ya know, that kinda stuff. It’s hard to explain really, but i’ve just been so stressed about the situation (relationship) i’m in. i’ve talked it through with him before, and he’s assured me many times he wants to be with me &amp; only me. but that doesn’t help, it doesn’t get rid of the bad thoughts that are driving me crazy. Would it be okay for me to break up with him, because of my anxiety? like, say that i’m too stressed to deal with a relationship right now? or would that just be stupid and bitchy? I know Reddit probably shouldn’t be the place i go to get these answers, but i’ve already tried asking my friends and family, but they just don’t care for it like i do. i’m just so stressed and tired, but i don’t want to sound dumb if i end the relationship because of my mental issues.

I remember one valentine's day, my brother- (20 or 21 at the time) was threatened to be kicked out if he didn't come home after staying the night with a girl. So yeah, that's where I'm at.

Now this friend isn't some tinder date or anything, I've hung out with him multiple times before and my mom's heard me mention him before when I've gone out with him. We are friends, not dating or anything which i've told her too when she asked how my 'date' went. 

Also recently I had an online relationship which I literally stressed so hard over telling her about. Ended up writing a note and she said how she felt bad that I couldn't just tell her (which I think is half just my own anxiety and her being a tad overbearing).

ANYWAYS. Like how do I bring this up? I truly contemplated playing it off as a bunch of other people coming along too for like a Christmas get together, that way she knows I'm with him if something were to happen but also doesn't think we are alone? Which is stupid but my anxiety said it's probably okay. I don't know, obviously she isn't going to tell me no, like with all due respect i'm 21 and I can make my own decisions and go where I want, I don't think there should be much question as long as you know where I am...right?

431,"Hello, r/Advice. 

I don't really know how to begin. In class I have a girl friend that likes a guy. She told him how she felt and he told her he wasn't interested in her. He's the loner type, very quiet unless with the right people/person next to him. I wanted to cheer him up and I made a joke, which he liked. I sat next to him during one class, Chemistry, as I needed help anyway and he's really good at it. We started talking outside of class and I befriended him. Fast forward a few weeks, we're great friends, I enjoy his company and he enjoys mine. He gives me a letter, telling me he likes me. My heart stopped for a second, as I realized what was happening yet once again. 

He said he loved my smile. My humor. How similar we are. And I do too, but apparently he sees it in a different light. Anyway, said girl 'friend' sees this and starts threatening me. ""Hands off."" is what she whispered me while I was talking to him, smiled and walked away. 

I told him a few hours later how I felt. That I liked all those things as well, however I don't like him in a romantic way. He pretends he isn't hurt, but I know him well at this point and see it. He's hurt. Deeply. And I hate myself for it. 

Now I know I should NEVER lie about my feelings and pretend to like someone I don't, hence why I confessed what I felt, but I lost a great friend. He said he was staying with me during breaks just because he wanted to be with me and he'd no longer do that. He said he'd help me with homework and that's it. That I'll still go with him to an event tomorrow as he'd already said I was coming with him to it. 

And after that what? I don't have any other friends. What do I do? Why do I keep doing this? Is it my fault? Am I leading people on??? Why do I keep hurting my friends? 

There's another guy in the same situation as this one. I think of them as friends, but apparently it was all but an act in an attempt to seduce me and make me fall for them. Do I go back and stick to myself? I love human contact and interaction, so losing all of this will be a hit to me. 

I hate myself for this. I hate myself for hurting people over and over, and at this point I think I might just give up.",21Dec2018,1

433,"Also posted in r/vent 

 So, I am a home health worker working with only one client at the moment. I've worked for this client for over a year now and I really enjoy it. My client is my age and is very sweet. I would say that we are definitely friends. Unfortunately, she lives with her crazy mother. This woman speaks a mile a minute and never lets anyone else speak. She will find fault with literally anything anyone does, including me of course. She will go on these long tirades and even if you respond with something as simple as ""Ok"" in a normal voice conveying that you hear her, and that you are not arguing with her she will get angry. Saying things like ""Do not sit there and say *'ok*' to me/its rude, etc."" There is no winning. She speaks down to me, yells, and speaks disrespectfully on an almost daily basis over silly things like me mixing her daughters towels with her clothes in the wash. She is extremely anal about these types of things, whereas her daughter does not really mind. At the end of the day, I work for her daughter and go with what her daughter says because it is literally my job to attend to her needs not her mothers wishes. However, I still try to be as willing and open to her mother as I can because I am in her home and I do not wish to start any confrontations. She speaks to me like I am one of her children and I find it very disrespectful and inappropriate. I *am* the same age as her daughter, but I also am a worker in her home and I deserve more respect than that especially given the nature of my work. I take care of her daughter and I do it with a smile on my face. Many people, including past workers for my client, treat it as just a job and don't try to be a companion to their clients whereas I am always trying to find activities for us to do and be a friend to her rather than just some worker. My client always says that I'm the best aide shes ever had and never wants me to leave. Anytime her mother gets angry at something I just bow my head and try to mind my own business and let them work it out (they have a very dysfunctional relationship and her mother is the one at fault 99% of the time yet never acknowledges it) The last worker my client had blew up at her mother calling her verbally abusive and called Adult Protective Services on her because of some argument my client and her mother were having. In addition to that, almost every worker shes had has quit because of her mother. I do not want to quit. It is very unfair to my client because shes a great girl and we enjoy working together, but her mothers behavior has led me to a boiling point. Yesterday she came in being very rude about the laundry and I just sat there and ignored it as I usually do and worked on my paperwork. My client will usually be the one to speak to her mother and explain that she wanted it that way and that its okay with her. But then her mother turned on me saying I was rude for ignoring her and if I have a problem then I should just say it. Mind you, I'm just trying to keep the peace and not cause any issues or speak where I'm not welcome. In other words, I'm trying to keep myself out of the middle of this argument about the laundry because I'm just doing what my client wants me to do and its not my fault. I tell her ""no, I don't have a problem"" and she continues to yell and be ugly going on and on about how we (my client and I) need to learn how to communicate and how WE are the ones being rude and disrespectful for ignoring her as she berates both of us. She even tells me to look at her when shes speaking which I think is ridiculous because I'm an adult and more than that - She's not an authority to me in any way. Like I said, she speaks to me as if I'm another child of hers when I deserve the respect of a professional. So, I told her the way she was speaking was very anger-fueled which is why I choose not to reciprocate conversation (and because this woman couldn't have a conversation if her life depended on it). She talks at people rather than with people. And she continues her tirade with, ""am I being angry? I don't think I'm angry? I'm just blah blah blah."" which she is saying with a raised voice and an angry defensive tone. It blows my mind how she reacts sometimes - like do you not hear yourself right now? Anyways, I just need to hear other people make sense of this situation for me. I've never been rude to this woman despite everything shes said and done to me, but I tend to get overwhelmed and I'm afraid of confronting her because I don't think anything will come of it accept make the climate of the house more unwelcoming and uncomfortable. But, I also feel like I should stand up for myself and make it known that I will no longer be treated that way. My plan was that the next time I deemed her to be disrespectful I would tell her I do not appreciate it and if she'd like to have a conversation with me then I am all ears, but that I will not accept her inappropriate behavior any longer. And so long as she continues to speak to me like a child, I will not acknowledge anything she says. I'm sick of letting her walk all over me. This is my job and I don't think it's okay to be continuously treated like this in the work place regardless of whether its her home or not.

TLDR: My clients mother is very disrespectful to me, but I feel trapped because I'm working in their home and don't want to make things worse. Do I confront the mother in a mature and respectable fashion or do I continue to try to ignore her even though that tends to make her angrier?",21Dec2018,1

440,"I thought i had my boyfriends xmas presents DOWN PAT. Homerun, score, perfect. At first i got him a black supreme sweater, except instead of supreme it said YEET in the red bar. Thats part 1,done. Its part 2 im having a hard time with.

At first i got him a Marvel themed Lootcrate. I thought it would be perfect, when we first started dating he had been getting these for himself for a long while, expenses made him stop. He loves all the cool things that come in it and has never gotten a bix he didnt like.

Then, i went to the mall with my fam. In Chapters they were selling poker sets (cards, chips enough for 6 players, all in a really nice case). My bf LOVES to play poker but always borrows his dads set so i was GIDDY when i saw it was also on sale and didnt think twice. Now i thought he could get his actual present on Xmas and i could just keep the lootcrate for myself because im a Marvel Girl through and through.

HERES WHERE THE ADVICE IS NEEDED
I went to the mall with some of his family the other day and we walked through Chapters. His brother (who doesnt know what i got my bf) points out the exact poker set i had bought for my bf. And bf is like 'o cool' in that passive way guys get when theyre distracted. Brother then proceeds to put it in front of my bf and my bf actually looks at it, says it apparently is for 6 so thats not terrible and then says hes fine with just borrowing his dads, he DOESNT NEED ONE RIGHT NOW

I know this is selfish but my heart sank through the floor. I was thinking i had gotten him the PERFECT present and there he was, looking at it, obviously unaware of what i had already gotten him, and doesnt care for it. I tried to slyly ask him 10ish mins later if hed like a poker set, theyre on sale he could get it right now, and he still said no, he doesnt need one.


Tldr got my bf 2 presents, thinking i could give him something perfect on time instead of a mystery box that came late. Perfect present turns out isnt so perfect as he inadvertently told me he doesnt want it. What do



Do i give my boyfriend a late Xmas gift or do i give him a gift on time that he expressed he didnt need? ",21Dec2018,1
441,"So I'm a student at a large university, and this semester a group of friends and I decided to rent a house together next year.  There are five of us and two are engaged, so we looked for a 4 bedroom house.

Earlier on, I knew I had most of my credits done but kind of assumed I'd finish a full two semesters my senior year.  It wasn't until a week or two ago that I sat down and counted it out: as of the end of my junior year, I'll have 12 credits left, meaning I'll only need one semester to graduate my senior year.


The issue is that my parents cover all my groceries and 80% of my tuition, apartment, utilities, etc.  As soon as I finish school that support stops, and I refuse to take an unecessary semester and cost them thousands so they keep supporting me.


We started touring houses about 2 weeks ago and I mentioned to the two friends there that unless I can break my lease early in a house, there'll be a problem.  As of yesterday they say they've found a house but that I can't just break my lease.  We were all together this morning and talked about the situation at length.


Basically, if I go in on this with them it'll cost me an unecessary $6,000 (food and rent during what would have been my second semester).  I could theoretically afford this if I worked during this semester and my last semester, but it would bring my total net worth to 0 (I'll have no debt).  In addition, if I get an offer to start work in January or February I won't even be living there.


We were together this morning and talked about it.  According to them, this is how it would go down:


If I don't go in, friend #1 won't want to live with the others because I won't be there.  Friend #2 is engaged to her, so he would go with her.  Friends #3 and #4 would have no need for a four bedroom house, and Friend #3 doesn't want to live with Friend #4.


As a result, Friend #3 is incredibly pissed at me.  He thinks I'm being incredibly shitty and that I should accept full responsibility if it falls apart.  He also says that if it broke up, he wouldn't have anyone else he could live with so he'd have to live at home for the semester (which he really doesn't want to do) -- so I'm directly fucking him over, then.

Am I in the wrong here?  I'll gladly accept some responsibility for not explicitly auditing my credits until this point, but outside of backing out of a 'hey, let's live together' agreement I refuse to accept that their unwillingness to live with each other is my fault.  Friend 3 says I'm fucking him over, but I really doubt it's impossible to find a roommate and an apartment in a college town in half a year.


Whatever the case, if I back out I might lose some friends.  What the fuck do I do?

What certifications or courses should I take to advance my career in the future?

443,"I’m a teenager living with my parents, and they recently set a Screen Time limit on my phone through the new iOS that limits me to an hour an a half of social media time per day, as well as locking most of the phone’s functions between 11 PM and 7 AM.

445,"Hey there, 1st time poster at this sub. I dont know where else to say this so here goes.

My gf has depression and social anxiety. We've been dating for about 6years now. She always has this issue due to her past relationships and friends. Due to this she barely have any friends. Theres 1 girl that she considers her closest friend.  Although this ""friend"" of her always seem so demanding and is very entitled. She (the friend) always wants things to go her way and her way only. Whenever things doesnt she always complain and ""sulk"" where she doesnt even talk to my gf. Mind you she is the only friend my gf has. So at times ill be the only person (outside her family) that my gf ever talks to. My gf seldomly talk to my friends but her anxiety always gets the best of her so she rarely talks to them and even at the times where she does talk its barely a sentence.

So later today there will be an event where my gf and her friend plan on going. I was supposed to send them to said event. Her friend has an early-access ticket so she can go in the event early. This is a HUGE event btw, thousands of people come for this. Since my gf doesnt have the early-access tickets she has to line up to buy one. The line to this event could took 3-4hours on line. I let my gf go since she really wanted to go and her friend says that shell accompany my gf at the lines.

But she made a last minute changes to make my gf line up on her own. So she can go inside earlier. I told my gf that i would go with her on a public transport so i can line up and go to the event with her and meet her friend inside. But her friend says that she doesnt want to use the public transport and doesnt want to go alone. I cant send them and be there since its a huge event there will be no parking till the event is over. My gf felt really bad about it because she knows that if her friend doesnt want to go that means she will lost her only friend as well. I had to make a last minute adjustments where a friend of mine will accompany my gf so i will be there later on.

Its painful for me to see her like this and i wish she has more friends so this incident wont happen again but she has a social anxiety thay makes it hard. Also her preference on stuff isnt what a regular woman would generally likes. I cant ask my gf to leave her. Idk what to do.

Sorry for the long rant. Also sorry if i said words wrongly english isnt my main language.

456," I currently live in NY, and my mother in Chicago. My boyfriend got a job about there that he’s definitely taking (he loves the position and has been on the hunt for the past 5 months as a new grad). I want to go to school there, so we are trying to find a place half way between his work and the uni that offers my program. It will be about an hour away from her place. I’ve made a ton of progress in the past year through therapy. Living far away from her has been critical for my healing. If we move there, I’m scared all that progress will be lost because she’ll want to visit all the time. I’m afraid I’ll go back to that terrified kid who’s heart skips a beat whenever I hear the front door. 

I need some advice on how to set good boundaries and avoid the guilt from my mother. I’ve considered staying with my dad so I can do the the local accelerated program in NY, but I’m so done with letting my mother rule my life. My boyfriend and I have been long distance for 2.5 of our 5 year relationship, and we really don’t want to go through it again. 

Complete no contact isn’t really an option. Maybe in the future, but not at this point. Its not clear cut; she was never physically abusive, and she’s more hurt and damaged than she is cruel. I don’t want to cut her out, I just don’t want her creeping back into my head. My therapist suggested setting strict boundaries right from the get go. E.g., lets get together once a month, somewhere in between your house and mine, and we’ll call once or twice a week in between. While these may work, she may try to guilt me out of it. She also suffers from serious mental health issues (so bad she went to a psych ward because she was suicidal a few months ago). While I love her and know she doesn’t intend to her me, I’ll be damned before she turns me back into that scared, self-punishing little kid.

457,"Excuse the throw away account. I just want some anonymous advice and hope you guys can help. I don't mean to present a sob story, nor am I looking for pity.

I've stared to develop anxiety and depression problems while at university aged 21 (I'm now 33). However, I managed to get a good degree and after uni worked a 'high profile' a job as Chemical Engineer. I was able to perform this job for 4 years but found my anxiety getting worse and worse. I would constantly think that I was not performing adequately or that the things I was designing were poor quality/dangerous (despite there being no evidence to back these thoughts).

My anxiety would get so bad to the point where I was being physically sick daily before and during work. I decided that the job was just to high pressure for me. I thankfully have a supportive mother who ran her own business, and so was able to go and work for her for the next 7 years.

My anxiety never went away during this period but being family, I was able to do the job and she was able to support and accommodate me during my episodes.

So now the business has been sold, and I find myself having to look for new jobs. I have just started a new office job doing admin work, nothing special. But I can feel myself returning to the place I was at. It feels like it's too much for me and I often find myself feeling overwhelmed. I will spend my nights crying for extended periods. I have extremely low confidence and am scared to even talk to people/ask for help inside and outside of work. I like to be alone and being around too many people is very daunting for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really sure what I can do at this point. I know I am capable of so much, but feel like my mental state is holding me back. At this point I think that working 'mental' focused jobs such as offices just isn't for me, and I need to do something more basic or physical. But I don't know what.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I'm looking for two things:

* Do you guys have any suggestions for jobs that are 'low stress' that I could do while still making ends meet? I don't mind working hard or working nights as I think work is important for self-esteem. At the moment I've been thinking about doing factory or warehouse work.
* Do you guys have any suggestions on how I can deal with my mental state? I have seen doctors in the past who have prescribed medication, but found that it either doesn't do much or makes me feel incredibly sick. Ultimately I end up giving up out of frustration.

Sorry for the long story. But I assure you my life is good, I am just overtly sensitive.

Recently his (ex)girlfriend kicked him out of the apartment they shared because he isn't on the lease. They do this so her rent is only 45 dollars a month since she doesn't work and its income based (30% of their income would be charged to rent.) Like I said he can't hold a job, had a really bad drug habit and is a very bad drunk. I informed my wife I didn't feel comfortable having him in the house due to his drinking/drug use and that the only way I'd allow him to stay at my house again is if he were clean for at least a year and took care of his responsibilities (worked, took care of his kids and so forth.) 

&amp;#x200B;

About a week and a half ago I'd come home from work around 11pm. I currently work two jobs to take care of my bills/family. He was sleeping on my sofa, so I went and talked with my wife in the bedroom. She told me he got kicked out of his apartment and that he needed a place to stay. I told her he could stay the night but he needed to get something figured out regarding a permanent place to stay. Well here I am a week and a half later, in that time he has only seen his kids once which happened to be last night. I ended up working from 8:30 am until 11:00 pm yesterday. When I got home my wife told me he was in our kids bedroom because he had one of his kids for the night. I thought that was fine and our kids were sleeping in the living room. Around 11:30 pm i could hear his youngest crying (the walls in the apartment aren't super thin but you can hear loud noises/sounds.) It woke me up and proceeded to continue for about 10 minutes before I woke my wife up and asked her to go tell her brother that he needed to get up and take care of his baby. About 5 minutes after she got up i heard him not really yelling but raising his voice telling the baby to stop and to go to sleep. My wife went back and ended up staying up with the baby until the baby finally fell asleep. She than came back to bed, about an hour later his second youngest was standing in my bedroom door way screaming/crying which once again resulted in me getting woken up. I mind you I had to wake up this morning where I am pulling another double shift, from 8:30 am until 1:00 am. My wife got up and took care of his second child also until the baby fell back asleep. 

My wife has always supported her brother, through numerous stints with the law and his (ex)girlfriend but him being at our apartment is causing alot of strain on our relationship. We've gotten in some pretty heated arguments in just the short time he has been there. How do I address that I don't want him being at the apartment and that he needs to resolve the issues with his girlfriend or get his own place without seeming like I am a dick.

471,"Hi. I'm a 16 Y/O Male and I fucked up hard. Real hard. I'm from an Asian family and my parents expect nothing but straight A's from me. The system that my high school uses is IGCSE (it's an international British school) and it's basically hard as shit. P. much everyone in the school gets mostly A's and a few B's. Then there's me, who can't fucking keep up with that shit and it just exhausts me to keep trying so hard to keep up. I've suffered depression ever since 7th grade after I did some dumb shit in school and disappointed my parents. They're kind of abusive, I guess, but my depression, anxiety and bipolar issues make me think I deserve it. I have 2 friends who really helped me through with this shit. Honestly, I wouldn't have lived this long if it weren't for them. I've dated online a few times, but never truly loved those who I dated except my last girlfriend, who left me for trying to help her with her depression, even though I was constantly being despised and hated by my family I still did everything I could for her. I know it's not the best idea to make your significant other your reason to love, but I was about done before I met her. She meant a whole lot to me, but found another guy about 2 days after we broke up (found that out thanks to said friends). I was pretty suicidal for a few weeks but slowly got over her. I'm in 11th grade at the moment and have mock examinations in a couple weeks after winter break ends. I've done almost no studying because even though I want to I just can't focus on it for so long and even if I force myself to, I simply forget everything. My parents are nice to me every now and then, but I'm pretty much a failure to them because of my low grades. Less than 40% in Economics (which I understand almost nothing in) and horrible at everything else except Computer Science, probably because I'm into technology. I love video games but, my parents judge me heavily for playing them and that also contributes to their anger towards me. I can't really cry about it anymore, because I've lost the ability to do that after years of this pain and misery. Nowadays, I've just been researching suicide methods and losing all hope. The mock examinations I talked about contribute heavily to me getting accepted in a good university, but really, I can't feel worried or concerned at all. I don't really feel like living anymore, because honestly, I think I'm a worthless piece of shit who'd do this world a favor by dying. I'm tired of hearing I have potential or anything because I fucking don't. I know there are people who've been through harder shit than I'm going through, but I know and accept that I don't deserve the life I have and pity those living in poverty because most of them are better people than I could ever be. It really broke me when my grandfather passed away a couple years ago and since I live abroad, I missed a whole term of school to stay in my home country to be with him and hope that he'd get better. My grandma is also sick these past few weeks, and I'm pretty sure she's going to die as well. Of course, as I said, I can't cry anymore because of this crap. I don't really know why I bothered typing all of this up, but I just feel so lonely and shattered nowadays, I at least want someone to know all this in case I end up grabbing the gun in the other room and shooting myself before I return to the country I live in (since we came here to my home country for winter break). Also, it doesn't matter much, but my parents do beat me often because of all the times I fuck up. I'm a negative person and a piece of trash and they saw the stuff I talk about with my friends and the sexual stuff that they sent after they got into my phone, and let's just say that was a painful month. Both physically and mentally. I was starved for about 3 or 4 days, but my father (who is nice to me more often than my mother) did end up forgiving me and got me some food. No matter how much I shit talk my parents with others, I really do love my family and wish a different sperm cell was selected instead of some piece of garbage such as myself. I lost so many friends because of my clingy personality and my habit of interrupting and being too loud and active. It was mostly to cope with my depression and loneliness, but I managed to get rid of it, or at least reduce it, by forcing myself to change by punishing myself with physical pain whenever I fucked up. It did help to make me better, in the end. Just recently, I accidentally broke my dad's laptop after I lost my cool, and it hurt a lot to see his further hatred for me after he left my room and I was there with a bleeding ear and a few tears. I do cry when the beatings are taken real far, call me weak for it. I don't really care. I end up loving people too much too easily because of how utterly lonely and pathetic I feel for being the failure I am. The school I go to also has some very high fees and because of that, it angers my parents more when I keep getting shitty ass grades time and time again. They keep saying to say the word and they'll put me in some shitty school, but I just want to try and get the ""straight A's"" they want, but I never succeed at it. I know good things and success won't just come knocking on your door and you have to work for it, but I've tried so damn hard the last 3 or 4 years and I never succeed. I'm just an outright failure and a stupid retarded piece of crap. I tried taking up some creative hobbies because of how much my parents hate me playing video games. I took up writing since I was generally said I was good at it when I was young, but I'm an utterly horrible writer. I tried digital art and paper art, but I'm absolutely crap at that as well. I'm also fairly into anime, manga and do like Japanese culture, though I'm not unironically a weeb. I just call myself that as a joke. When I do write, I write light novel's due to how long I've been watching animes and shit, but it's laughable how fucking garbage I am at it. Due to me being so bad, I've lost so much motivation to write after the few friends I gathered to form a team to help me finish my LN and get it published just up and left. It really did hurt, but that's how it is. Anyways, I'll probably fuck up my mocks and just get more hatred and disappointment from my parents, so that'll be fun, I guess. I did attempt suicide with pills a few times last year, because of how heavy my depression got, but it went away at the beginning of this year. But it came back a couple months ago, because of my family hating me further and it got worse for a bit after my girlfriend left me, at first without even giving a reason as to why. There was a huge argument between those 2 friends I mentioned and her. In the end, it was apparently because I couldn't accept her being polyamorous (she wanted to ride 10 other dicks) and because I pushed too far in knowing her problems because I wanted to know them and help her further. I thought it was normal to vent to your lover and trust them with your issues, but it was the opposite to her. I'm pretty sure she stopped loving me after she came out as being poly in the middle of our relationship, and one of the 2 friends suspected she was already talking it up with the guy who she replaced me 2 days after our breakup. I wouldn't be surprised if she did, but on my part, I truly did love her and want a future with her. It completely broke me for a while after what she did. Anyways, it's 1 AM here now, if you actually bothered reading this far, thank you. You don't really have to give advice but I guess if you want to, should I just kill myself now or see if I can survive as an absolute demented failure in the future? I know very well I won't succeed, and now I don't really want to. I just want to die and rest in peace, but we'll see what the future holds I guess.

472,"About a year ago, I saw someone on tinder with a “go fund me” link in their bio. This person went to HS with a few people I know, but I’ve never met him directly. Upon clicking the link, it opened up a portal of information describing how he has been a victim of (exact words) ‘revenge gang stalking by an Austrian elitist group’ following his ‘relationship with an heiress he met on tinder’. Just a few examples he claims: these people have hacked his phone and wiretapped his calls, organized and paid off police in order to have him receive a DUI/drug charge, even goes as far to say that they have implanted something in his brain to control his thoughts. He mentions very early on that his beloved father passed away suddenly immediately before this began - which gives me the idea that his grief and inability to process it may have sent him into a tailspin. His latest video is more aggressive and he appears exhausted. He spends the last 5 mins or so directly calling out to this “heiress”, begging her to contact him.

I feel as though I am watching this person descent into complete madness. He is clearly suffering and I cant help but be worried... He mentions at one point in an early video that this group planted a bag filled with guns and knives on him. He claims to be a nonviolent guy, but I would hate to see this overtake him so much that he would end up hurting himself or someone else..

Am I overreacting? Would you report these things to the local police station, or simply report to YouTube? Should I just hope and assume that he has a mother, or family, that is keeping an eye on him? Truly having a hard time deciding whether or not I should mind my own business.",21Dec2018,1
473,"*Quick context:

I've been striving every week to try something that will help me be a better person (going to the gym twice a week, donating litter to my local animal shelter, eating healthier, meditating more). I also work as a reporter in a fairly busy newsroom.*

There's a new gentleman in my workplace who I have absolutely no respect for. This coworker of mine is loud, arrogant and very cocky in his abilities. He constantly goes around the room commenting on every matter, claiming to be knowledgeable in areas I know he is not (I've had to clean up his messes on several occasions...)

He recently got into a spat with several of my good friend coworkers, basically disrespecting his and their profession. They fired back and he made snide, rude comments to counter.

As I said, I'm trying to be a better person and stay out of it, but I desperately want to join conversations pertaining to this individual.

I wanted to know how you manage to survive this Christmas time, especially Christmas Eve.

Things are and have always been difficult with my parents; they are constantly fighting and when we sit together at the dinner table there's just nothing to talk about. This year, the situation with my parents reached it's climax again. They beat each other black and blue, my mum was full of bruises and strangulation marks. Yet, they still didn't divorce each other, live in a house togehter and pretend as if nothing ever happened.

I live together with my boyfriend in another city not that far away from my parents house. My mum expects me and my brother to come over, she said that she'll kill herself if we won't come over.

My plan was to visit my parents, stay there for dinner and present exchange and then leave together with my brother, so that he can bring me to the house of my boyfriend's parents. They are a really lovely family, I enjoy spending time with his parents.

I just fear that my mum will flip out when I leave early, and take it out on my father like she often does. I am afraid that when I leave, the situation between my parents will escalate again. But if I'd stay, it might prevent a violent fight.

486,"Hi, I drafted a resignation letter and would like some advice. I have to do this over e-mail because my boss is out of office until January. My reason for resigning is to go to school full time. I don't want my email to sound ungrateful, confrontational, or too much like an ultimatum (although it is). Here is the text of my e-mail with specific organizations and names edited out. I need to be abundantly clear that I will no longer be able to work Tuesday sand Thursdays after January 8th yet I would like to offer to work part time until my replacement arrives. Am I hitting the mark with this? What should I change? Thanks!

Hi BOSS, 

I briefly spoke with OTHER BOSS yesterday and have been working with my adviser at SCHOOL. The only way for me to meet continue my education is for me to enroll in classes that are offered only on Tuesday and Thursday this semester (which begins January 8th).  The classes are a mixture of lectures, recitations, and lab experiments and they are all co-requisites which must be taken together. This would mean I am out of office all day both Tuesday and Thursday at least through May and things aren’t going to get any better in the future. 

I’m sure you will agree that having an administrative assistant out of office two days a week is not going to be acceptable. To be honest, resigning and pursuing my education is likely the best decision for myself and for the organization and I respect you and the office too much to be anything but honest. I understand the timing is less than ideal with your recent appointment as President of ORGANIZATION, your upcoming international travel, you and OTHER BOSS being on vacation until January, and the fact that the organization needs someone to keep things running until my replacement arrives. 

Having said all of that, I don’t want to resign in a way that leaves a significant gap or causes undue hardship for you or the office. If you think it would be helpful, I’m willing to work part time (Mondays, Wednesdays, and occasionally Fridays) starting January 8th until a replacement can be found as an alternative to resigning January 7th.

I feel it’s important to be as clear as possible so I summarized what I feel are our options for the future:

1.	I resign effective January 7th to pursue a full-time education; or 
2.	I work on a part time basis beginning January 8th  (Mondays, Wednesdays, and occasionally Fridays) for the foreseeable future or until you find a replacement.

I am grateful for the opportunities I have been given. I am truly sorry to deliver this via e-mail but as the old saying goes, bad news gets worse with time and I didn’t want to wait until after the holidays to tell you.

Please enjoy your vacation and don’t be concerned with the office. I will make sure everything is in order and work with you as much as possible to provide a smooth transition.

The shelter made it very clear that she could never, ever contact them about him and that she would be barred from adopting another dog from that organization for a set period of time. 

I get the harshness of their policies. On a personal level though this has been eating at me. I'm pretty devastated overall and frankly have a hard time not feeling bitter towards the person that surrendered him. I would have taken him in but I had moved to a different country just before she surrendered him. I just want to know that they found him a home and he wasn't killed. 

Is there any chance they would tell me? Or would I fall under the umbrella of ""you can never inquire about him?"" ",21Dec2018,1

One of the results that came up was from a website called ""MyLife.com"".  In the Relationship section it showed: MARRIED

Is this something I should bring to her attention?
Should I just walk away from this?

493,"Not sure if this is the right sub - in fact if you have any recommendations please tell me. I’m going to try to keep this short. 

I’m 21, in my final year at university. I work at a pub and live in London so you can imagine it’s expensive. 

I live at home with my mother, who 1) is depressed 2) never leaves the house 3) drinks a lot  4) we argue 

Today I came home and she’s gone through my bank statements - I pay her £100 per week but it’s not enough. 

She struggled financially but it’s not like she’s trying. To solve these problems. She’s capable of getting a job but she says that computers confuse her and honestly she’s never in the mood. I know if she actually tried she would get one. I set her up with a week trial at a school but she decided against going. 

The level of toxicity is kind of painful. It’s not like abusive, but she’s constantly depressed, or angry. A week ago she was in a drunken slumber, on her bad, in the dark. It was a mess and stank of alcohol and cigarette butts. It’s a sight you don’t want to see. 

She’s struggled with alcohol all her life and depression as well. Should I move out? We argue a lot, she drinks a lot. I know she wants me to be kinder to her but I can’t do it tbh. I love her but it’s painful. I’m 21, trying to get on with my life whilst earning money and passing my degree, as well as trying to do a side hustle. 

It hangs over me a lot. When I get home I just want to chill but she’s either shouting or drunk or just depressed. I guess what I’m asking is, at what point am I being a dick, and at what point is she being toxic. 

Would I be better off just moving out and leaving her to find a new tenant, should I be giving her more money? Should I be nicer? If I move I’ll have more rent to pay but is it worth It?

494,"Since I can rememeber I hated confrontations. I loved martial arts but absolutely hated the sparring aspect all the way until i quit as a teenager. I hated competitive games even if they were harmless like smash bros. I'm subscribed to /r/streetfights and I only recently realized how much anxiety I feel watching any video from there. I never willingly put myself in a sitation where I have to argue or stand my ground. Games like dota give me so much anxiety because people can be so toxic. Interestingly I think I've improved my conflict resolution skills through the game, but that's only after 10 years of playing.

As an adult I will be forced to confront people in very uncomfortable situations and somehow resolve things. I've been fortunate not to have to do this for a long time because I was in school for so long (and basically learning things alone in a room was my job), but since leaving I've had a few confrontations where I crumbled because I just hate the discomfort so much.",21Dec2018,1

500,"I’m posting this because I’m currently in full-panic mode. I’m 17 with a driver’s license, but I’ve only been driving for a few months now so I’m still new.

I was trying to park in one of those tilted, diagonal-ish parking spots at a local Ross, and my front bumper hit and scraped against the side of another car. There was another car behind me, waiting for me to park and I feel like they may have gotten pictures of my car and license plate. It left two pretty sizable scratches from what I remember. I, being the stupid, impulsive idiot that I am, drove off to the parking lot of an adjacent store, and just sat in my car trying not to breakdown and cry for twenty minutes. Eventually, I went into Best Buy (the store I parked by) and asked for a pen to write a note that I could leave on the car, because I knew it was the right thing to do, and obviously, I didn’t want it to end up as a hit-and-run.

By the time I wrote the note and walked back to the Ross parking lot, the car was gone. This was bad, because as I was walking into Best Buy I could see the car, but by the time I got back, they had left. I talked to my sister and a couple of my friends and they tried to calm me down, but I’m seriously freaking out and don’t know what to do.

The lady waiting for me to park very well could have my license plate number, and have seen me drive off into the other parking lot, which obviously looked super suspect and scummy. I just wish I hadn’t spent so long in my car panicking, so that I would have been able to leave the note on time. I feel so bad about it, and it’s literally eating me alive to the point where I can’t concentrate on anything else. I just got done with finals today, so I was already stressed enough, and I guess that just played into my already stupid head to where I pretty much made the worst decisions possible after hitting the car. I just don’t want the lady and that car’s owner to think I’m some scumbag with no conscience. On top of that, if this all goes south, this could fuck with my college applications if it somehow translates into a misdemeanor.

Is there anything I can do to remedy this whole situation? I know I’m stupid, but I just got overwhelmed with everything in the moment and made the wrong choices. I’m an introvert and really bad in stressful social situations like this, so I have no idea where to go from here.

To the owner out there: I’m sorry, I’m an idiot and I wish there was a better way to make this right.

To all you redditors: Is there any advice you can give me?

It frightens me because if something bad happens it will fall on me.

508,"Hi everyone,

This may be a long post. This may be the most pathetic circumstance of my entire life, and I really need some perspective.

I started my first job out of college and was trained by this girl who we’ll call Charlotte, about 30, who I was instantly really into. She was extremely pretty and very articulate. She was direct and spoke her mind about things and seemed genuinely nice. 

I had to work alongside her on a lot of projects. She was in the position above mine, and I never mentioned anything about my feelings to her, but I was really starting to like her. I didn’t know if I wanted to be in a relationship or anything, but the second Charlotte would enter a room I’d be trying to impress her to some degree.

Charlotte eventually became my boss, and the person I report directly to. I was happy about this because we were friendly and I knew we’d work well together. She constantly complimented me about the quality of my work, and I’d try and make her laugh or something in her office on most days. All of this banter was non platonic at the surface, but I was slowly falling in love with this person and began really worrying about her opinion of me. At one point, she said she loved me (she didn’t mean it romantically), and that I was her favorite person in the office. 

In my opinion, I starting going out of my way to do more for Charlotte after she became my boss. On the one hand, it felt good to be of use to her professionally but on some level I was also trying to let her know that I was useful to her and liked her. I’d ask often to try and take things off her plate.

We never really hung out outside of work at non-work events like happy hours, etc. I always thought my feelings were unrequited but I really got a lot of satisfaction from her liking me personally and as someone she works with. 

Due to a bunch of circumstances, my work had been starting to slip. I was making little mistakes that were hard to catch. A higher-up supervisor and Charlotte told me I was basically on probation. During this time they’d be checking on all of my work and giving me any feedback they had. This motivated me but also put me under a microscope. I was having serious issues at home and with my mental health, and I was unable to achieve the level of consistently they apparently wanted.

Part of this felt strange to me because Charlotte had always told me I was such a good employee and that she loved working with me so much but had nothing to say to me after I was being put on probation. I don’t think it was really her idea, but she had to do what her own boss wanted. In any case, I really could have benefited from some guidance on her end on how to proceed. But she didn’t give me that. I’m not unreasonable and I understand how it may be unprofessional or unwise for her to talk to me separately from the meeting. However, this is when Charlotte went from a friend and confidant to someone I wasn’t sure I could trust. At this point, my feelings are also the strongest they’ve ever been.

The circumstances were getting to be too much and I finally decided to go into Charlotte’s office and ask whether she thought I should pursue a new job elsewhere. I know this was a stupid move, but I was desperate and thought maybe Charlotte could talk to me like a friend. She had had a few more jobs than me and could maybe give me some advice. She seemed really upset at first when I told her how I was feeling, but when I asked about possibly getting another job she starting getting really upset. She said, “I’m not telling you what to do,” and “you need to be an adult.” This was all true. I was being immature and stupid. All of my logic was clouded and I was a dumbass. But her response felt very cold. I was worried about this.

The next day I was called into the COO’s office and fired. Charlotte was there. The COO said he heard about our discussion and that things were clearly not working out. We had a short discussion and he told me he would like me to do remote work part-time until I found another job, and that Charlotte would still be my boss. During this short time I couldn’t reach Charlotte for questions about her own projects. Any attempt at a conversation was ignored and she only ever reached out to give me extra assignments, ask about deadlines or give me negative feedback (after I was already on my way out). 

This destroyed me because despite all of this I still had strong feelings and felt as though we’d never be friendly in any way again. This feeling hasn’t changed.

I saw her recently (I have a new job) at a party and she was still cold to me. She was really curt and she didn’t ask much about how I was doing. We took an Uber back home (were in the same city) and when she got off she didn’t say a word to me.

I know I made very dumb mistakes but I’m extremely upset about this for whatever reason. I’d love for someone to tell me bluntly what exactly happened or what I should take away from this (outside of the very immature behavior at work), because it’s constantly on my mind and I think my head is a little too clouded to see it clearly. I gave as much detail as I could. ",21Dec2018,1
509,"I've known my dad is attracted to men for years now. 

It started about 7 years ago when our iCloud accounts were connected and the app Grindr appeared on my phone even though I hadn't downloaded it. I was pretty naive at the time and didn't know what Grindr was, but after some googling I got the gist.  I tried to make excuses for him like maybe he didn't know what the app was for or maybe it was a mistake or maybe our account was hacked? But given my parent's visibly rocky relationship, I started to wonder. 

4 years ago, I decided I had to know what was going on. I'm not proud of the lengths I went to, but I found the evidence I was looking for. Emails on his computer and hotel reservations confirmed my suspicions. He was having an affaire with a man I'll call Chad. My heart broke when I found a hotel reservation made for the night before his anniversary with my mom. I waited up that night and when he went to leave, I asked him where he was going. He looked at me straight in the eyes and said he was heading to work.  

But I didn't say anything to either of my parents. I did my best to swallow my feelings and flew back to my college town as if nothing had happened. Cut to today! I haven't thought about my dad's affair in a while, and had actually been assuming (/hoping?) that it was a one time thing that was over now. After all, it's been years! But I'm home for the holidays and just saw a calendar notification on my dad's phone lock screen for a hotel reservation he made for tomorrow night. I got on his computer and found recent emails from Chad, the exact same guy from years ago. Apparently they've kept up their affair all this time. 

i just don't know what to do with this secret! Confront my dad? Talk to my mom and out him (assuming she doesn't already know)? Try to find out who Chad is? Stop snooping altogether and keep silent?? It's all so complex and I have so many conflicting feelings about it!! I'm just tired of carrying the burden of this secret.

512,"I've struggled with trying to see if I am the one to make any moves in this situations. I have a lot of friends who work in finance and wealth management, and often they have told me I should step in because whats happening could really hurt my personal bottom line down the road. Deep breath, here goes:

My father is a very frugal man. He never made much, but always saved hard. He has been able to amass serious wealth for someone who never made more than 60,000 a year and supported a family. Also lucked out with skyrocketing real estate in Massachusetts/boston area. My sister and her husband have basically been making a series of bad financial decisions for the better part of a decade now. Clearly there are psychological issues in terms of money. He works at a cell phone store in management and my sister is a nurse. They probably combine for 150-170 a year. They lease 2 high end luxury cars, somehow got a mortgage on a home worth around a million, and spend money like theres no tomorrow. The guy inherited a bit of money, so early on I think he got used to this lifestyle, but its come to light that he's about 60k in CC debt, and they just had their 2nd kid. I also think I found out that his parents have been paying their mortgage for the last 5 years but they are now tapped out. These are the kinds of people who will go to dinner with you and order the most expensive things and split the bill, and fly business when they do fly, don't look at the prices on anything at the grocery store, buy each other 3000$ + birthday gifts, stay in 5 star resorts, etc.. I have friend who are millionaires who live much simpler. I've disagreed with their behavior forever, but it wasn't my life and I moved on. We literally have moved across the country and don't live in Boston anymore because we were able to move jobs and live in a more affordable city.

&amp;#x200B;

So lately they've been hitting my father up for things. A lot. my dad has been caving and writing them checks, paying bills, etc etc. He's old, he loves his daughter. I am beginning to get worried that because I'm so far away from home they are going to manipulate my parents into paying for their lifestyle. I should add they also belong to 2 country clubs. My dad said he was worried if he didn't help them they'd miss mortgage payments. So I have this situation where this freaking leach is causing my family anxiety up and down. I know at the end of the day its my father who is making these decisions, and he can do what he wants with his money. But he's 78, and I'd hate to see his entire life savings be sucked away, and I am personally already preparing for war whenever the inheritance situation happens, because I know they will try to get as much as they possibly can.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just a shitty situation, and it seems anything I tell my dad rolls off him. So maybe I'm overstepping, but I've been quiet for years.   My mom said hes secretly a mess, and it's been causing lots of fighting and anxiety.  Imagine every interaction with your daughter involves me guilted into giving some money.  Thats essentially how it's been going.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never asked for money, because i've actually learned from my father how handle money correctly, and now I'm beginning to feel like I have to intervene in some fashion. Am I wrong to think this? What would you do if you were me?  I'm a pretty shy person.  I keep my head down, work, enjoy my hobbies and family.  Confrontation isn't my thing.

&amp;#x200B;

To add, me and my wife are financially fine, we don't ""NEED"" an inheritance, but the idea of it being squandered away on Audis and steak dinners makes me sick. Also might I add we are in this situation because of my fathers influence on me.  Although I can't stomach to be as frugal as he was.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll add my one thought was to really advise my dad to ""HELP"" them get out of debt but udner the caveat that they make big concessions, eg: normal cars, weekend jobs, etc and help with the paying down.

About a year ago, i was noticeably a happy and smiling kid. everything brought a smile to my face and i could crack jokes and make people smile for hours. i had so many interests and so many friends. i had hobby’s, i played sports, i had things to do. i could easily talk to anyone and make friends and basically lived a happy, sociable life. near the end of 2017 was when everything kinda just started getting sucky ya know? 

by the end of 2017, i had already lost a large majority of my friends. i lost friends that i considered best friends before. and for no reason. there was always no reason for anything and it i was making me beat myself up mentally... i always blamed myself for being the reason they left, ultimately causing a lot of self doubt. this made me spend A LOT of time by myself. i wouldn’t wish loneliness on anyone. being lonely and not receiving any social attention felt torturous. “what am i doing wrong” or “what’s wrong with me” crossed my mind every night while i cried. it eventually made its way to where i am now. 


as a person, i would say i’m dull or i don’t have a personality. i feel like i’m just here on earth. i never do anything. i don’t ever really show any expression at school or talk to anyone really. i still can’t bring myself to introduce myself to someone at all. i don’t laugh at anything and i can’t find anything that i enjoy. everything is boring to me. i can’t find fun. i can’t find excitement. i can’t find friends. i can’t find people to talk to. i just don’t know what to do with myself. all i ever do is go to school and work. 

but it’s infuriating almost cause in my head, i’m colorful, i’m creative, i always think and dawn ab space and go beyond reality. i know i have ideas and i know i have important things on my mind but i just CAN NOT BRING MYSELF to express it and show it. the thought that i can’t brings me to tears. 

other than that, idk what else to say. this isn’t really something you can give advice on, and i’m not really expecting this to be answered, and i understand that. i would just like to have some option on why i’m losing myself &amp; what i should do to make things easier.

He yells at people whenever they go to pet them; yells at me for wanting to spend time with them on the rare occasion I visit. Hopefully you get the picture. 
So here is where I'm hoping to get advice: 
1. Is it possible I'm overreacting? 
2. If I'm not, do I try to change the situation? They have six months let in their care. Do I try to get them somewhere else? 
3. If I try to move them, I have no idea how to go about that. I live in a veryyy rural area and the only thing I can think is to board them at a Vet which seems like it would be super expensive. All my friends are in the same situation as me (moving around on a month-to-month basis)",21Dec2018,1

526,"I work at a factory, have been for about 4 months. I was approached the other day by the owner saying they love what im doing there and they want to promote me to floor supervisor. I was floored, after 4 months? My ego kicked in immediately and said hell yes im in. 

Then I realized how complicated everything really is. I used to just come in, pop my headphones in, and bust out parts, now I am responsible for all this stuff, and its totally overwhelming. I dont want to let them down but now i feel trapped cause I already said yes. They said theres a very steep learning curve and its totally normal to feel the way I do, its just I went from an easy job with less money where I could just chill, to now having to learn this whole other thing and be looked at constantly by the owners cause im charge of all this shit. 

The feeling of panic is really starting to set in. Im thankful they said its a learning curve and dont expect to learn everything right away, and thrilled they think so highly of me to give me this spot only after 4 months, but im officially freaking out now. I dont know what to do. Literally, everything now is foreign to me. 

My brain is telling me ill be fine, but my heart is saying ""dear god kid, wat the f\*ck did you just agree to?"" And it almost feels like i was forced into it, they didnt exactly tell me you're doing this, but they didnt give me much in the way to say ""i dont know about all this"" 

So now, I got the next 4 days off, but all i can think about is work next week. Is it normal to feel like this? Or did i just blow a cake job to endure a level of stress i never had before for a few bucks extra? 

AND THE WORST PART OF IT ALL, im working side by side with the owners daughter, who is unbelievably cute. Like, so cute I just wanna bite my hand to keep from saying something. 

So not only do I have all this new stuff, I now also have to keep from staring at the cute office girl who I think is the cutest fuckin thing ive ever seen in my life.

527,"So I am a sophomore age 15, male, and there’s this girl in my math class that I like. And. Want. To. Date.

So winter break just started and I really wanted to start talking to this girl and unfortunately we are changing seats after winter break which means I will most likely no longer be sitting with her. 

We’ve exchanged a few words like her saying thanks after I picked up her pencil or me asking her a question math related but that’s about it. 

I know her Instagram but she has like 1500 followers and 800 following and I feel like if I followed her and she didn’t follow me back, it’d be awkward trying to talk to her after winter break, I also have her snap but I didn’t add her because the reason above.

She’s popular as you can see by her followers so I feel like that’d already puts me at a bad place.

Well it turns out a few weeks ago when my little sister was in cheer, the girl I like was her teams cheer coach, along with 3 other sophomore girls. So I was thinking about starting up a conversation at the last 2 minutes of math class saying, “hey, my little sister told me that you coached her team” then follow up with something else. I also wanted to ask what her Snapchat was depending on how the conversation went but that could wait a few days later.

529,"There is several aspects to this, but I will try my best to put it all here and make as much sense as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

To start off, my dad has been off work for around 7 months (maybe longer) as he is unable to walk due to some (supposed) nerve damage in his leg which means he can not do his job, he is still ""employed"" but I believe at this point his sick pay ran out some months ago, they are just leaving his job open for him. I say supposed nerve damage because doctors have yet to agree on anything, and we are still awaiting results from the last electroencephalogram (I think it's called that). On top of this he is starting to develop swells/sores on his skin which the doctor called something else but said they are not ""sores"".

&amp;#x200B;

To add onto this, the woman he is living with is awkward in this situation as they are no longer ""together"" but she will not move out. She has got her own house in place so can move out, but hasn't/won't. I have to be purposely vague on this part because I only know what my father tells me, when I go around they act fine together but when she isn't there he tells a different story. Bottom line however is he wants her out, and the latest on this was she wanted money for furniture before she can leave, as I understand it she was asking for very little money to the point where it doesn't make sense for her to be asking for it.

&amp;#x200B;

To add onto this she will not help my father in that she will not make his bed, clean his sheets, do his laundry, and he claims she does not cook but again that is his word and I have my doubts on that last claim as a couple of times when I have popped round she has given him food, whether a total lie or an exaggeration though I do not know.

&amp;#x200B;

This was all ""ok"", we were getting on with things and I was visiting as regular as I could, however yesterday I went round and my father was very drunk. He usually has had a few lagers when I go round, that's just expected really for him, but yesterday was another level. He tried to hide it, but he could barely speak straight and remember anything he was telling me. When I was leaving he was looking at me as though he wanted to cry, but he never said anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today my sister went around, she doesn't go around as much as me (1-2 times a month .. if that?) but she does have harsher working hours - but I believe she also doesn't feel as close to my dad as me for reasons in our past, nothing bad but I believe she feels he was not there enough growing up, which I agree with but also understand that he worked 12 hour shifts every day (well night) so that we would have money to pay bills and such. Anyway, so she went round after the nurse had been. The nurse had asked my father is the woman he is living with is helping with things and he said yes (he said he said this because she was there). When my sister went round afterwards my dad phoned back the nurse and told her (now that the woman had left) that she does not help out at all and then he also made the claim that she hits him, and my sister said that at this point he broke down crying. My fathers mother was also round at the time as my sister had took her there to visit him. My sister says he wasn't drunk at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

Following this they are getting social workers involved after Christmas, and that is all I know about that. Since my sister was there for all this the social worker has been given her number. My father hasn't directly told me any of this, so I don't know if he knows I know what has been said or not. I just don't know how to handle any of this. I don't know how to take the ""hitting"" claims, I am not calling my father a liar but he can be playful with the truth, but I really don't know what to make of this at all. About 2 months ago we had a hospital appointment and he kept saying he hoped they kept him in for however long so he would have someone to help him rather than being at home.

&amp;#x200B;

As per my fathers words that the woman he is living with does not do anything as much as I sympathise I seem to be the only one that realises that he is not quadriplegic, he simply has lost functionality of a leg and can't walk or stand for long even with support and is in constant pain. Hopefully this will soon be resolved, and yes having a carer come in and change the bed - and even dress you would be nice, but though it may be a struggle I just feel like if he gave any effort he could do it himself. He should be able to cook, he doesn't need to be reliant on someone for that for example. There are people far worse off than this that have made the best of their situations. Am I just being a jerk in thinking this? I understand that sitting in the same chair for 6 months being unable to even get out of your house is depressing but you have to fight your best fight.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have my car license, but I am taking it within the next couple of weeks, I haven't told him about it incase I do not pass, but I am taking it with the intention that I will be able to get him out of the house in someway and if nothing else just drive him around to get fresh air and see things other than his TV. Maybe this will lift his spirits.

&amp;#x200B;

And though it sounds selfish it is stressing me out a lot because there is nothing I can do. Well, there is and I try to do as much as I can. I pick up medication, I go the shops for him if he needs things, but this is taken for granted because I work from home people assume I am free 24/7 and it's no problem to spend half my day running errands for someone else. But looking forward, ultimately what (should) come of this will be the woman moves out and he ends up there alone. Then what? Then he's completely alone and I have to start going round 7 days a week, I can't hold a job like this, I can't hold personal relationships like this. I love my father but I can't sacrifice my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what I am asking for advice on, just the situation as a whole I guess. I don't know where to go from here, what to expect, what to do.

532,"So, this actually has been escalating for a few years now. I live with my parents, along with my sister and brother. Sister and I are both adults (mid-late twenties) and brother is 16. A while back (2 years ago-ish?), my sister ordered super expensive $500 sneakers. USPS said it was delivered and signed for at neighbors house but they denied it. So, my sister called the cops and filed a complaint. Fast forward to last week, another package goes missing so she goes to their doorstep to politely ask if they received it. Nothing, conversation was civil enough from what I understand. Then yesterday morning happens, another package goes missing so sister goes back and they BLOW UP on her. They made comments about me, asking if I went to rehab (I never did, but admittedly did have an issue with drugs. I’m clean and sober for 14 months, tyvm!) because they apparently got bills addressed to me for rehab which I never went to (mind you, they never sent me these letters or returned them to me). Then they made comments about my dads mortgage, again because they received mail meant for our house but never received or returned from them. It went badly. Just about an hour ago, I was walking my dog and I addressed them. I told them to please not make comments about me, to not talk to my family, and I admittedly did insult their son (who is a demonic rascal and has been since he was a child) and the mom’s brother, who used to send me creepy Facebook messages when I was a teenager and also lives at that house. Called the son a criminal and the brother a pedophile, I know this was probably wrong of me to do but I was triggered by yesterday’s comments, which I wanted to address, and she also called me a ‘drug addict’, which I felt I had to defend myself against.) Anyway, I hate conflict and I DON’T want this to escalate. We switched to sign-on delivery a while ago, but this still happens (packages sent to wrong house). Also, I don’t want them to be spiteful and take legal action such as a restraining order, or something of the sort. I just want it to die out and I want to politely ignore them, and I’d like for them to do the same. I know I probably shouldn’t have addressed them today, but I really felt I needed to tell them to please stop making those comments about me, as they don’t know me and to return my mail.

For starters, I recently confided in another friend from our group (I'll call her B) that i felt as though A didn't like me being friends with her boyfriend, even though ive known him for nearly 4 years and I'm already in my own relationship. B told me that A had actually mentioned that she didn't like the fact that I was friends with him, and now that i know for a fact that she feels that way, I can't help but notice the sulking and annoyed looks whenever we all hang out.

The way she always acts miserable as soon as I join the group is bad enough, but now I've just found out all my friends are going to a party without me and it only occured to B to let me know and ask if I wanted her to find out if I could come. 
When A found out that I knew about the party, she and her boyfriend both got mad at B for telling me about it. Turns out they were planning on hiding it from me so they wouldn't have to invite me :)))) ouch :))))

Thing is, I've known her for so long and I know she's not all bad, she can be very sweet sometimes and she's never directly nasty, only passive or behind my back, but it still makes me feel awful because I know it's happening.

For much of the semester I was pretty depressed and contemplating suicide every other day. While this isn’t an excuse I hope it gives some context. I took all these classes at a community college to save money, so I didn’t waste an insane amount of money, but still a considerable amount.

553,"Okay here is my situation , i’ve been working in a Couche-Tard for the last 5 years , but today i’ve been offered a new job that pays more. The thing is I have to be bilingual (french and english). My mother tongue is french. But im scared that my english isn’t good enough for the job. Still im using it everyday with the Couche-Tard customers and haven’t encounters real problem since the past 5 years. 
So im scared that I wont be good enough for the job and lose it and then I wont be able to pay my bills. 

Im torn between keeping my old job with the minimum wage or a slightly higher paying job where I have a risk to get fired. 
A part of me is telling me that this is just the stress of being out of my comfort zone. But the other part is telling me that I might lacked of skills. 

So yeah I would like some advices on the situation. ",21Dec2018,1
555,"I'm so embarrassed about it and absolutely terrified to tell him. How am I supposed to do it?

And yes, I'm gay, if the ""him"" isn't enough to say it. No need to ask. That makes it even more fucking awkward.

I don't know how to tell anyone, I've NEVER told anyone in person about this. I feel disgusted of myself whenever I think about it.

It happened since I was really young, and she'd just tell me she ""could do it"" because she ""was my mother and so she could do whatever she wanted to me"". And it didn't stop until I was in my late teenage years. And I've never talked about it to anyone.

I've cried about it a lot, but I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone about it. To look them in the face and talk about it. It's much worse because of my gender. I'm too embarrassed to even say I cried about it. I'm so embarrassed about everything. The only reason I can even talk about this here is because of the anonimity I have with this throwaway account on this site.

I don't know what to do. I don't know how I'm gonna tell him. I'm so terrified he's gonna be disgusted of me from now on if I tell him.

I don't know how to tell anyone, I'm pretty sure I'm just going to get weird looks for being a boy and being abused by my own mother. Scratch that, I did ""try"" to tell someone; I tried telling one of the workers at a park once when I was younger, He just gave me a very weird look. Like, the kind of look you give to someone you're weirded out by.

I'm so afraid no one would take me seriously and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so sick. I'm disgusted of myself. I hate myself so much.

I don't know how to tell him, how am I supposed to do it? What do I do if he ends up disgusted of me? I don't know what to do, please help, what am I supposed to do? Is it worth telling anyone at all? I have no proof. I never told anyone when I was younger. Please help me, I don't know what to do anymore",21Dec2018,1
556,"So, I [22] met this girl [19] in one of my lab groups this semester at college. We started going out about month ago, and hit it off really quickly. I really like her; we get along really well, have a lot in common, and want similar things from life. I feel like she likes me to, there’s some kind of spark there.

Today, I was asked out by a girl I work with. I turned her down, but wasn’t really sure what to say. I’ve noticed her before. She’s attractive and seems like a nice person. Normally I’d have accepted, but I really like the girl I’ve been going out with; and although we haven’t really talked about being exclusive yet, I don’t really want to go out with anyone else.

I want to bring it up, but I’m not really sure how to have this conversation. I’m not very good at this sort of emotional stuff. What should I do? Should I text her? Should I wait until our next date? How do I bring it up?",21Dec2018,1

558,"Long story short- i'm a few months out of a relationship and I am not wanting to get involved with anyone, anytime soon ( i have a lot of solo trips booked next year and a relationship would ruin this as i actually enjoy my own company) anyway, a few weeks ago i reconnected with an old friend, whom i had a fling with about 3 years ago but it was nothing serious, he is also recently out of a relationship... so we caught up, one thing led to another and we're making out in his car. The following week I seen him about 4 nights, and things got heavy every single time ( not sex)... we've been hanging out and we talk everyday, i actually enjoy his company and he says he enjoys mine.. 

However im really confused because a small part of me wants him in my life, hes a really nice person and i do enjoy his company, but also majority of me does not want a relationship or anything romantic and I'm not sure what to do... any advice would be great!

Also- Im gay ( F) So this whole situation is very new and confusing to me..",21Dec2018,1

561,"So I'm 24. I have people that I used to be friends with that I hang out with once in a blue moon but no real friends consistently. I just don't have a passion for anything except for it all to be over. I usually get by with it but when something good has a chance of being in my life and then goes away. The depression is unbearable and this may have finally been the one that broke me. 

A few weeks ago this girl at work started to be friends with me. I actually like her and we've been talking every day for 2 weeks for a while each day. So I asked her out today at the end of work since the holiday break is coming. She said she wasnt sure how to bring it up but she was dating someone but thought I was cool, and enjoyed talking to me and would still be down for lunch if I wanted. Then she told me she put in her 2 weeks today. So the rejection I can deal with, but combined with the back to loneliness I can't. Thought I started to make a friend but instead here I am, more aware of my loneliness than ever. Drinking myself to sleep. ",21Dec2018,1

564,"A friend of ten years and I haven’t talked for a month because she blocked me after I said something offensive. I tried reaching out and apologizing via texts, leaving voice mails, and calls, but to no avail. I’m having trouble moving on and accepting that a decade long friendship may actually be over. ",21Dec2018,1
565,"Hi so my best friend of 7 years has a lot of difficulty expressing her emotions. Growing up, she never experienced much affection like the rest of our friend group, which is why I think she has this.

There’s been a lot of instances of her not knowing how to say hi or bye without it being awkward, finding it difficult to say heartfelt things, not knowing if she likes a guy or not, and being unable to hug or show any affection. She’s also prone to pushing people away, even her closest friends, when she hangs out with new people. 

One instance was when all of us threw a surprise birthday party and she didn’t even react. I jokingly said “If you could feel emotion, would you cry right now?” And she jokingly replied “yes”. All of us who threw the party left pretty hurt and disappointed, which sucks because she definitely loved it. Another one was our last day with one of our close friends. We took a bunch of cheesy pictures together and she didn’t want to be in any of them.

The way I see it, she just can’t find it in herself to react to situations that would demand any level of emotion or expression of affection (which includes greetings).

But she feels a lot, I know it. I know she cried after I wrote a birthday letter, I know she wants love but rejects it all together, I know she cares for her friends in ways most people don’t. But at the same time, I feel like this is a really unhealthy state to be in for the sake of her current and future relationships. I end up not wanting to speak to her about personal things (and that translates to anything later on), hang out with her alone, or continue the friendship after high school. But I know she just has difficulty expressing her emotions, so why am I being a jerk about it?

What are your thoughts on this? Do you guys relate to my friend? Do you think so should try to make her more comfortable opening up or is this friendship not made to last?

Thanks for reading!

566,"Very recently, I found out that one of my choices of universities has closed their door on the Fall 2019 quarter, and I don't know what to do. I don't want to enter late and have to do another year if that's how it goes, and I really don't want to go to a community college. I'm incredibly worried. I have other choices, sure, but I don't know if I'll be accepted.  
Any advice?",21Dec2018,1
567,"Long story short, Im not proud of how I acted two years ago. I was an RA at my university, and I did not like my boss. He kept me back after a staff meeting one day, and told me that he knew I was causing tension on the staff, ""stirring the pot"", that my name often came up as a problem, and causing drama. I did not feel this way, and I broke down. I did not take it nicely being accused of things I thought I hadn't done. I cried and pretty much told him this wasn't true, and went as far as saying that I was angry with him for not spending time with the staff as other bosses did. He has called me emotionally unstable as well. I admit I WAS going through a lot during this time, but I do not like that I essentially lashed back like an unprofessional. I know this incident is the reason that I also was not promoted that year.   

I feel like I handled this unprofessionally, and am embarrassed. We were fine after that incident, and have been on ok terms as well (no tension, especially since I moved to a different building with a different boss the following year). However, now that I have graduated (last May) I have this overwhelming fear that he thinks of me as this awful person, and does not like me for what I did. Im afraid my name is said and people just think negatively. I am working on trying to get over things more easily, as this often tears me apart. Does anyone have any advice on how to essentially not give a fuck what other people think? Like part of me thinks I should go back and apologize, but I also feel he may have seen that as a minor incident and Im overreacting. ",21Dec2018,1
568,"-My mother is stuck to her phone chatting with random people and dont really gave a shit. I dont want to sound ungrateful but now she barely do house works or actually talk to us bcs she's busy 'chatting.'

-I hve two little siblings and we were raised in a toxic environment although now its gotten better. My parents fight alot over small things. Sometimes too much. 

-Anyways, growing up, my father doesnt let me do shit outside house because of his constant fear. Im 16 and my father doesnt let me buy a rollerblade bcs I might fall. Also, there's a mall 1.4 km from my house but I wasnt allowed to go there cus I might get kidnapped. I cant even go to school camping when I was 12. The camp was at MY SCHOOL. 

-Idk how to write this out but just all of this combined, I can see this will affect my lil siblings. At least I know how toxic this is and I have the desire to be better and successful. But what if they dont and grow up to be worst? I dont even know what to do
