0,"First day on Reddit, so give me a break if this post is a mess :)

I'm currently in school and was talking with a guy in my class for about 2 months before things fizzled out. We talked every single day and went out on a couple of dates. On the last date we went on we stayed up til 4 am talking and making out. The chemistry was there and I got a nice text the next day telling me he had a good time. But then he stopped initiating text convos, he fully moved away from me in class and gave a lame excuse why, but also still flirts with me randomly and I catch him staring at me all the time.

I'm not usually the type to get attached to guys that I've only been on a couple dates with, but for some reason this dude got me. It's been over a month of weirdness/distance and I'm still not over it, maybe because we see each other almost every day still? And I guess because he still flirts with me? Idk, but I do know this isn't the way I want to be treated by someone so I need to move on, any advice on how to do that?",06Jul2018,4
1,"We met a few months ago and have been talking about daily ever since. She lives across the country, we're both in our mid teens and meeting up is unrealistic even if we wanted to. Regardless, she sometimes comments about how ugly she thinks she is and/or how much she dislikes herself in general, which is somewhat odd as she is upbeat most of the time. Anyways, when this happens I tell her that she is beautiful and awesome (which I do believe) but she always replies with ""no I'm not"" or ""thats not what others have said"" or ""maybe but thats with filters"" or something like that. I don't know what to do, she refuses to budge on her opinion, nor does she seem to acknowledge my compliments, rather dismissing them before considering them. I don't think she's being an attention whore because she's really not that obnoxious about it at all. I don't know what to tell her to change her mind, or even if I can.",06Jul2018,1
2,"I had bumped into my bosses wife earlier this week, and she surprisingly knew who I was... as her kid was trying to play with something of mine that caught his eye, she kept saying, repeatedly...”you’ll have to ask her permission, I think she works with daddy...arent you so-and-so?” 


I’ve never met this lady in my life, so I’m sure he was talking about me to her. Maybe it’s nothing, but she kind of had a snarky tone when she said that...

3,"Some background, I am a 22 year old male from U.S.A. born and raised with paki background. Really religious and i work about 60 hours a week right now. Trying to launch a business and get my other R.E. stuff going.

Girl involved is 6 years older lives in pakistan never met her in person but we've seen each other.

We randomly met 4 years ago while I was searching for school advice and she was on the same student board at the same time. Ironically it was our first and only time going to that site and we were both Pakistani's so it was I guess ""in the cards"" 

There's been tons of drama back and forth so I will spare you the details but here's what it comes down to. I told mother about this thing 2 years ago that I am interested in marriage with her. Her response was to get my degree first (Which I can understand and did complete this year in Psychology) I only did it to get it done as I wanted to run my own business. I currently have a real estate license and am focusing on growing that while starting up a business. I asked my parents in regards to marriage again and unfortunately when my parents sent people to her place they reported negative things. So they are not intersted in persuing this further. They go to pakistan regularly, I have only been there 1 time and each time they have went since I have told them they have not gone to visit the girl's family. 

Their argument is usually that her family has a bad record and she has bad relations with everyone in her family plus she talked to me so who else is she talking to. Shes getting up there in age and aint getting any younger. I am out here working my ass off trying to earn some money which is the other objection they have against me. I don't make enough money to support myself. 

Dad works 60hrs a week as well. We're shit poor. I asked my mother to go with me to visit her but she took it up with my dad and he threw it on me. Father said if I am so interested then why do I need to visit her, just go and get married to her and come back and do the paper work. And he said this really sarcastically, I want to visit to make sure this is definitely something I want to do. I planned on going to pakistan since I run a wholesaling business and think it would be a good idea to talk to my suppliers and meet them in person. Its a good chance to go and meet the girl as well. 

My experience with her has been varied but its also been due to her circumstances. Now she's really nice and she does listen to what I say and I do genuinely feel she wants to be with me. But I do wish I could visit first to make sure. 

I only have about 2 grand to get me through these few months if I do end up going so that will eat up about 1300 dollars for 2 tickets if I take my mother. (if she agrees) Another issue is the fact that my sister is technically engaged but she's also never seen the guy as my parents decided it would be a fantastic idea to get her married into some family that we have never met nor have had any sort of contact with but had some long distance relative that lived in the same neighborhood as them several years ago as a relation. The guy's family pushed to get engaged but now that they have her commited to them they are saying they will wait till all the daugters have been married off in their family... And my family feels that I should wait until my sister is married since it is ""culture"" 

I have never met the guy either, when I talked to the family they do sketchy businesses involving illegal money and fancy cars... HMMMMMMMMMMMMM So if I say yes I will be hated by my family as my sisters do not like the girl I like either. Obviously being protective of one of thier brothers. 

Another thing is, my mother expects me to spend the rest of my life in their house living ""together"" whereas I planned on moving out after I was married since I am allowed to. I have always wanted the freedom to make my own decisions as my room is not even a private area. They come in when I say not to and basically they have no respect for boundaries. If the boundaries issue, ability to make my own decisions, and continuous lectures' issues are solved I don't mind staying with parents but they are getting more and more controlling rather than easing up. 

I originally wanted to study religion but father forced me to go to school to get a degree that was ""useful"" since in his opinion religion is a useless degree and I won't be able to get a job with it. I also went ahead and asked his opinion on going to become a dental hygenist as they make good money and you can get it done in 2 years he refused and said no become a dentist. Which drove me away from the thing entirely. Which is also why i got the real estate license. It was quick and I could make money.   


I expect to be making money soon with the business going and Real estate advertising finally running so there's that. 

I just want opinions, I literally have no one to talk to. When I try to talk to the girl I am intersted in she starts to freak out since I have been unable to visit her for 4 years now. I dont want to stress her out even more. I have been praying since I was 14 to get married or atleast engaged by the time i was 21 cuz I have cousins that took forever to get married and I just wanted to start my life early. 

I know technically I am allowed to marry whoever I want. But I can't seem to get support from my parents to do as I say. And knowing them, if I leave it up to them they will get me married to some overweight desi girl saying she's a nice girl (not that there is anything wrong wit overweight girls, its just not for me) (I myself take care of my weight and diet properly so I expect the same out of my partner which the girl I like does) And then it goes further and I just don't know what to do at this point. My brain is fried, I am trying to get this darn business going plus no support plus no one to talk to plus general anxiety and stress. I just dont know anymore. Someone help me out, have you been here what did you do? How did it turn out? 

I pray five times a day, quran in the morning, even get up for tahajjud at nights when I can. I pay for everything I want myself, I have bought my own things for business with my own money. I pay for whatever I can. I get groceries I go to pray every frieday in the mosque, First or second line each time. I don't even see my dad pray at home anymore. 

There's a lot more but I just need advice on this right now, as you can tell I have some undiagnosed mental issues going on here. My advisor suggested I get checked out for adult ADHD and anxiety disorder (which obviously implies depression, which is something I have had but won't acknowledge as something that affects me, I can keep fighting it) So yeah thats that.

4,"This was a couple days ago and mind you I don't have my snapchat anywhere else and it said she ""added me by username"" I messaged said girl to see what was up and she said that a ""friend of a friend"" gave her my snap. She wouldn't say who though. I then asked her for her Instagram and realized she's the friend of this girl I accidentally ghosted a couple weeks ago. The conversation we had was pretty short and only lasted a few days. My question is why would she give this other girl my snapchat? Why do girls usually give their friends other guy's snaps?

7,"My brother, Ted, wants to be a doctor.  However, he has changed his major many times and has only managed to get an associates in nursing.  He has attempted pre med, biology, chemistry and finally settled with nursing.  He could only do the associates because he ran out of funds and became in debt with all the institutions he attended and only one granted him a degree solely on the basis of number of attempted hours.  

He has enough credits in the hard sciences from when he was doing the first three majors to apply for DO school but feels thst osteophathy is some ""pseudoscience"" just because is not MD despite a DO can practice in any state and American territory, and can do any specialty (e.g. my husband's old ENT was a DO and so was a previous psychiatrist I saw).    


I helped him look for MD programs but given he has too many ""w""s in his transcripts, he doesn't look like an ideal candidate for most (not even for one overseas or México).  


TLDR: DO school might be his only real chance at practicing medicine but he's being a literal ""choosing beggar"".  ",06Jul2018,2

11,"Normally, I don’t really care what people think of me, and was going to whole heartedly going to go through with getting my nips pierced. To give y’all an idea of my personality and/or style, I am referred to by most of my friends as a “hippie” and have my nose pierced, as well as two piercings in each earlobe as well as my cartilage. I have wanted a more adventurous piercing for awhile now, but given the professional nature of both my college program and career choice, I opted against any more facial or ear piercings for now.  
     I have always thought that nipple piercings (a simple, horizontal barbel) were cute as heck and thought that it was a great choice for me. TMI, probably, but one of my nipples is inverted and I am very self conscious about this, and have heard that piercing can fix this. Just as I was making plans on where and when to get them pierced, I mentioned the topic to one of my close friends and she was very against me, to say the least, saying that any future partners would see me as simply a fuck buddy and never wifey material if I were to do such a thing, and that I would never be taken seriously by guys that I hooked up with. This opinion scared me, and now I am hesitant to go through with this decision. Is this really what I want? Anyways, I would just like some input on the topic. Are they really that “trashy”?

15," So, I'm currently in college. In January, I'll be celebrating my 21st birthday. By all accounts, it's something I should feel proud of, but there's something embarrassing that is **constantly** hanging over my head when it comes to my age, and that's the fact that I don't have my driver's license....

 I'm sure to many of you, that sounds absolutely ridiculous, and I'm not really arguing that point. The reason **why** I don't have mine yet is the important part. Essentially, I just have a massive, almost crippling fear of driving. Any and every time I get behind the wheel, I'm immediately struck by the thought that I'm either gonna end up hurting myself/family or even worse, someone else on the road. And this isn't just a minor, passive fear; I'm not joking in the slightest when I say I have **atleast** a 3-4 nightmares a week pertaining to me being in a car crash due to my driving incompetence. Some weeks, it's even a nightly occurrence. I've been having such dreams for what feels like close to a decade at this point, despite never having been in a similar real-life situation that would  actually warrant such a fear. I'm completely calm in cars when someone else is driving, but freak the hell out when I'm given the chance to drive, despite my obvious desire to learn. 

 Another problem is the actual process of practicing itself. My mom's car is pretty small and works perfectly for my height. But mom herself is unbearable to drive with. She's one of those parents who freaks out the entire time, which I can't take given I already have lots of anxiety towards driving to begin with. My dad is the calmer one, but I can barely see out of the windshield of his vehicle, and even so, I don't have contact with him enough to practice anyway (My parents are divorced). I feel I'd benefit from an actual Driver's Ed course, with a professional who could help me, but I'd actually need a vehicle for that, and I'm not sure I could afford it even if I did. I'm tired of having to be driven everywhere by my mom at my age, even if she doesn't seem to think it's a bother, but I don't know how to get over this horrible fear I have. It's been the one constant problem I've been dealing with for years (aside from depression, but that's unrelated), and I can't figure out how to fix it. 

 Has anyone else gone through something similar? Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for reading...",06Jul2018,3
16,"So a little backstory, I've been heavily smoking weed for about 3-4 years now. I started when I was about 17 after my parents had split up to help me cope with the situation. At this point I've primarily been taking dabs (I smoke about a gram to 1.5g of wax a day) and the interval between taking dabs is anywhere from 0 minutes to 60. It's really started to effect my personal life and put relationships I deeply care about at risk. I know you're thinking ""just stop smoking weed then duh,"" but it's not that easy for me. If I don't smoke I can't eat, sleep, enjoy daily activities I usually would enjoy, nor hang out with friends/family without the urge to leave and go get high. It's the oral fixation and the habit of taking dabs that I'm addicted to (I don't even get high anymore, I just get some level of satisfaction from coughing and sweating and dying.) I haven't smoked in about a week and I've been experiencing an insane lack of determination to do anything, I can't eat more than a few bites of food at a time and I can't enjoy myself playing videogames or playing with my dogs like I typically would. Are there any remedies, distractions or tips y'all could give me to keep my mind off my addiction and/or regain the optimism and will to get out of my bed and get back into normal functioning society?

Shes usually very sad or gets sad easily because of that, but it becomes a problem when every little thing sets her off. Sometimes i think it has more to do with her up bringing than her depression, because if I say “ily” instead of “I love you” or text back literally 10 mins late without an explanation she’ll go nuts.

It’s gotten to the point where she gets mad when I’m with friends or playing video games because she wants me to only have time for her and her alone.

Lately though, she’s been picking up bad eating habits. She’s skipping meals and she gets mad at herself for getting hungry. She even threw up recently and I think it’s because of some pills that suppress hunger. 

I don’t know what to do, no matter how many times I reassure her and no matter what I do she’s never satisfied. She’s never pleased with herself or her life.

As a matter of fact I am just barely getting over the time she cheated on me last November because “we don’t see each other too much” (I work and have college). The only reason I got back with her is because while we weren’t together she was showing a good change in character

I’ve been a qualified healthcare person (glorified salesperson) for about fifteen years. I used to LOVE my job but now it’s become soul destroying. I’m bored, so bored. The industry has become all about retail and overpriced items. It’s killing my soul. I have come as far as I can in this job short of owning my own business. Management (managing million dollar + practices), admin, finance, retail and customer service are all part of my job. 

I have a bachelors in psychology and a diploma in organisational psych and diploma on child psych. I did all that by correspondence years ago for fun. 

I want to help people. That’s my goal, my driver my raison d'être. How, I don’t know. I can retrain but only by correspondence due to financial restrictions. I am thinking about just applying to some charities and other similar organisations to see what happens. 

How do I write a cover letter that will get me noticed? I have tried to change careers a couple of times over the years but don’t get a look in because I appear to be so narrowly qualified. Also, how do I explain I’ve only been at my current job for 6 months!! (I accepted a four day a week position because I thought my problem was just too much work). Now I see it’s actually burnout.

My roommate and I are more like sisters, we've been living together for the better part of a year and grew really close really quickly. And while growing close to her, I also naturally created a bond with her son. 

Now my roommate (K) has fallen on difficult times, as you do, and between financial, family, and personal troubles, I grew a lot of sympathy towards her and offered to take care of her son whenever she needed, free or at a low cost. She was there for me through tough shit, and I want to have her back too. 

A few months back she told me that she wanted to give me a decent amount of money in return for the babysitting. I told her I was grateful and to take her time with it. This was when I was less worried about money myself and either had a job or had a good lead on one. I have not been paid. 

I should mention that when I babysit it's never for super long amounts of time. If it's more than 4 hours, he's usually asleep and she just wants me to keep a baby monitor on me while she goes out with her friends for a few hours.  No big deal. Kid sleeps like a rock, won't even notice she's gone.

35,"This will be a super long post but I will try to space them out.  I am 18 F dealing with my 59  F mother.

I start an internship in the fall in Boston and I'll be moving up there, but the relationship I have with my mother isn't the best. We get along fine, but she says she can't trust me and won't leave me alone in our house. She constantly mocks and teases me, belittles me and sometimes puts me down. In return, it makes me very bitter and sardonic towards her. I think this is because of what she's put me through, yelling, screaming, taking away my iPhone in the past, going through my cell phone and looking at my messages, invasion of privacy.  3 years ago, she let our dog out of our backyard, and in return, she was ran over by a car and really affected me. My mother has GAD and has many fears and phobias and mild agoraphobia. I promised her that I'll visit every few months, but don't really want to be with her for long.

I don't think my mother is emotionally abusive per se, BUT she mocks me about being shy and having social anxiety, tells me I should eat less (I'm in a normal, healthy weight range, and not fat at all!) I would say my mother has slight anger issues. For example, we went into a branch of Chase bank, where we both had accounts previously. She started yelling and stormed out when a teller couldn't assist her quickly enough. I could tell that she was really, physically angry. She can scream and yell and then offer to buy me things. I can handle these. We actually get along great and have tons in common and have laughs and such, but she can get too much sometimes. Sometimes, I feel down or depressed whenever I'm around her too much. Is this common for anyone else?

My mother doesn't work and hasn't for a while and probably won't be a while. She is 59, and hasn't had a full time job for 20 years due to laziness/ wanting to work and her anxiety. She goes to a psychologist  and went to a shrink a couple times and has been diagnosed. She is considered low income so can only choose one or two doctors in our area, It's Florida for anyone who was wondering. (although, I am not, because I have more liquid assets and make more annually.)

Internship starts Sep 5, so I have a little under 2 months to last with her. I try to be civil, peaceful, whatever, not yell/get angry. I'm home all day and don't get out much unless I go to the library, or the gym. How can I let the time pass as soon as possible?",06Jul2018,1

I asked my folks and my old man said to be patient because we look at each other like my mom and he look at each other. She cut me off for a week until we were with mutual friends and she couldn’t even speak or look at me. Then we went silent until she right before I went to work and she went home for a while, and she just held me for a few minutes. I could feel her heart on my chest and she could feel mine. We split because we have stuff to work out as individuals. I worked on my things but she runs from her problems and I can see she is running out of room to run. She will need to face these things eventually and I want to hold on.

39,What to do when anxiety levels are high?,06Jul2018,4
40,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety for the past few years after a series of unfortunate events. The past year has been fairly decent in terms of symptoms- anxiety has been high but depression had faded into the background for the most part unless I forgot to take my medication. However, in the past week feelings of loneliness, worthlessness, self hatred and numbness have increased to the point that I feel similarly to before I was on medication, immediately following several life altering losses. 

I’m afraid to talk to my friends or family about the extent of my depression these past weeks because I worry that they (my friends in particular) will view me as a burden and abandon me- something which occurred with my old friends when I was at the worst after personal trauma and several family emergencies.

41,"I know that sounds weird but I’ve realized I don’t think I act properly when I get a compliment. Like, usually, it’s just a simple thank you. And that’s usually more than sufficient. But then I decided to download a dating app and my true awkwardness has really started to shine. 

I don’t have confidence, like any at all. But, I figured I’d have to do something if I ever wanted to meet a girl, get married, etc etc. So, I downloaded bumble. And to my surprise, I’ve gotten a fair number of matches. Some girls have started conversations nicely and talks have been fun. But a couple of girls started with compliments. One flat out started with “wow, you’re really hot” and I couldn’t even think of a reply. I know thanks isn’t going to do anything but that’s about all I got. Even the nicer conversations got weird when they tried saying something I do is cool or interesting. Like I just completely avoid their advance and move on to something else. Is there a smart way to reply to keep things going smooth? All my conversations on there have just cut off and I’m pretty sure it’s because I got weird after they said something more “forward”. And honestly, I think I get that way because I don’t actually think they’re being serious. Like I really couldn’t fathom someone thinking things like that about me. ",06Jul2018,2
43,"Sorry if this isn’t appropriate to post here. Wasn’t sure were to ask. 

I’ve been depressed for a long. Long time and gettin tired of it. I recently watched a movie called the secret life of Walter Mitty and I couldn’t help to feel I feel connected to him. Especially the fact that I love photography and capturing the moment. It resonated with me like no other. 

So I booked something I’ve been pushing off for 2 years because I either didn’t have anyone to do it with, being scared or some bullshit reason.

46,"I don’t have many friends. This friend is kinda the only female friend I have. There’s a few things that I’m not really sure about how to handle. We are both in our early twenties, I’m married she’s engaged, and also a year older than me. 

First off, her fiancé is emotionally abusive. He could be more, but as far as I can tell that’s as far as it goes. He is also very manipulative towards her. Anytime we go out to eat, he has some reasoning as to be angry at just about nothing. Things like getting upset at the server during and obviously busy night, when it didn’t even take that long. The last time he got mad because somebody got their plate before his! (Table next to ours, and it was just the way the server had the food on his tray.) Omg a tragedy!!! Or getting irritable that the bartender won’t let him drink if he forgot his ID. Duh.....
I don’t think he’s been in customer service before, but me and my friend met doing customer service work, so it’s appalling that she lets him act like a 7 year old with a temper tantrum. He acts like this towards everyone. He’s very entitled (she is too except for when it comes to him). He is also really not nice to her when they bicker, which is 90% of the time. I go very back a forth as to whether or not get involved and tell her that he is that way. My husband and our mutual friend has the same feelings towards him. They’re supposed to get married next summer so I’m hoping she could realize this on her own. He has OCD and is bipolar. He/ they use this as an excuse for his actions. I know what those episodes look like, and he’s very rarely having an actual episode. I’m solely in our friendship for her, not for him. She only makes time for other people when he’s at work/busy. Basically they don’t spend free time apart from each other. They’ve been living with each other for like three or four years now. He gets upset if ever she makes fun plans without him. God forbid she makes plans with our only other friend, who happens to be a guy. He gets extremely jealous. Enter more bickering... 

She could do so much better than him, but she’s the best he’ll get, ya know?

Another conflict is that she thinks that I’m ashamed of my body. I’m slightly overweight, not morbidly obese, but definitely could lose some weight and then some. I’m not embarrassed by my body, I honestly don’t give a shit. I love my body and would gladly show it off to anybody. A few months ago, we were on a trip and they thought I didn’t want to go into the hotel pool/hot tub because I’d have to wear a bathing suit? I told them “no public pools are actually the grossest thing on earth” (I used to competitively swim so trust a girl) and also I had recently bleach the shit out of my hair so I wasn’t sure if anything would happen to it. I gave them these completely valid reasons, and they seemed to still think it was somehow related to my body/weight. Recently she has wanted to go to a spa, the ones where people walk around naked. I’ve done these spas like twice in my life, and am SO okay with the way it is. But when she was talking with me about it she kept emphasizing how much I could cover up or wear a bathing suit if it made me more comfortable. I never mentioned anything related to it, when she asked I said “cool let’s go!” And then she said all that... she’s no Greek goddess either!

She pretty much has avoided me the past few months. She keeps saying she’s “going through things” and hinting at it through social media. I try to contact her just to she if she needs a friend around and she doesn’t answer for days, if even at all, and just doesn’t make any effort to spend time together. I finally stopped giving attention and then she asked me about he spa thing, which was a over a week ago. We still haven’t gone btw, so i dont know. 

Here’s the thing. I get needing to have personal time, people go through shit. BUT, her and I were going through similar difficulties in life. I HAD needed a friend. I feel like I was practically begging her to be my friend and she didn’t even have the courtesy to text me back, until way later. I gave her time to be alone when she wanted it, for four months! And when I needed a girl friend she was nowhere in sight. Every time it’s an excuse of her going through things, and how can I be that mad at that? But how much longer before it’s just an excuse not to be around me?

My husband thinks I try too hard, I guess I just care too much? He thinks it’s signs that she doesn’t want to be my friend, and I agree. But then why would she still invite me to something, and still refer to me in social media? I honestly have no idea what I could’ve done to offend her if I have. I never talk badly about her fiancé even when SHES TALKING ABOUT how he’s being an ass. 

Sorry if this is confusing. It’s very confusing to me too. I guess I’m contemplating just cutting her out of my life or trying to stick it out. I feel like girls have done this to me a lot throughout my life and it really sucks as an adult to still have it happen to you. But I really care for her as a person and want to help her/still be friends. What do I do? I’m so frustrated at this point ",06Jul2018,3
47,"TL;DR: I don't know what would look good on me or how to present myself because I don't know what role I have in society.

So my friends seem to know how to dress themselves to present to other people what they like and kinda conform to a stereotype almost. One friend dresses in all sorts of thrift shop stuff she sews together to look really neat and the image she projects in very much that of an artist. Another friend wears sports wear and is very athletic. Yet another friend dresses in suits to seem professional and dignified.

I look at myself and don't know what role my body type would look good in. I'm not athletic, I'm not fat, I'm not creative with clothes, and I don't want to dress in suits all the time. I don't really know what I ""am"" so to speak, so I don't know how to express that through clothing. 

 I like to dance, but I am not a Dancer. I am drawn to music, but I am not an Artist. I like tech and am a computer science major, but am not a Geek. I need help making my self image tighter and more concise. How do i find out what I am?Thanks for the help!",06Jul2018,1

49,"I was at the mall today to try and catch a bus after picking up some groceries. I was using my skateboard as transport while staying off the sidewalks, which the “no skateboarding, no bicycling” signs apply. 

Now like I said, I was skateboarding, but that was in the parking lot, the bicyclists go through the parking lot as well. I was about to make it to the bus stop and I get intercepted by MALLSEC (yes, they have a goofy name, I’m aware of that entirely). The guy comes up to me and asks what I’m doing. I just stated that I had to catch a bus home, and was grabbing some groceries. 

He says “ok, well we got complaints of you skating on the sidewalk in the plaza area, and we have video evidence.” I would assume he was referring to the area of the mall that has the water fountain and food vendors around. I tried telling him that he then followed by requesting ID. 

I told him I wasn’t going to present any identification, as he wasn’t an officer of the law. He got mad, and said I had to stay where I was. I told him I’m not going to comply with him, and as I was leaving he tried grabbing for me. Low and behold, he happened to get a handful of my concealed handgun, and he went into full on berserk mode. He called on the radio to dispatch to bring back up, and to call the police because there’s someone with a gun on the property. 

I tried telling him that I’m licensed to carry, and that my state allows concealed carry on all property outside of government buildings and events. He ignored me, so I tried to grab my wallet to show my certification. I didn’t have time to reach into my pocket, because by then the guy shoved me on the ground, and tried to take my gun away. He was able to successfully get the gun out of my holster, and at this point I was just in awe. He tosses my gun in his security car, and locks the doors, I kept trying to tell him that what he’s doing was illegal. 

At this point MALLSEC backup had arrived, and they all had their pepper spray drawn, and also formed up in a way that pinned me inside their circle with no escape. I kept trying to tell them that I’m not breaking any laws, and they kept ignoring me. I let my guard down, and some big dude behind me grabbed my arms, and zip-tied them. 

The police arrive shortly after, and they asked what the problem was, and the MALLSEC guy who originally “detained” me was making up a BS story of how I threatened him. I told the officer that it’s not true, and that I was just going home. Then I told the officer the story of how the MALLSEC guy grabbed my concealed handgun, all because I refused to show ID, and that they took my gun. 

I had a lot of respect for the officer, he tells the security personnel to leave us for a private talk. He asks me for the full story, and I explained it to them, and all while I was getting into the story, I felt a snap behind my back, and my arms were free. I reiterated that they took my gun, and he said that the altercation would’ve been avoided had MALLSEC’s actions never happened. 

He goes up to the security guys, and asks that my gun be returned. I got it back to being fastened again, and I salvaged what groceries I could, and went home when the officer was done with his investigation. 

I asked the security guys if they were going to pay for the lost groceries, and one just smirked and said “we aren’t obligated to cover your stupid ass” 

I muttered under my breath “fuck you...” the guy heard I said something and asked what I said and I just said “you look pretty”. I made it home eventually, but here I sit contemplating on calling management of the mall for the mistreatment I witnessed with these security guards. Hopefully management would side with me, and I at least get some coverage from the lost groceries. 

Would it be worth doing that? Or should I press charges? I didn’t find anything in my state’s laws about unauthorized persons touching my gun, but I bet that’s considered assault. ",06Jul2018,1

54,"Over Christmas 2017, I’ve exchanged gifts with one of my good friends “V” from Australia (I’m in New Zealand). However, at that same time we were in the process of moving to another city so I had to find another address to get it sent to safely, and even pick it up from there before I left. This is where my friend “P” offered her address to be used. I trusted her enough, since my best friends have known her for a long time. 

And this is where it all started going downhill. 6 months ago, she only let me know as soon as I had moved to another city that the package from Australia had already arrived days before to her house. So I thought, fine whatever that’s cool. Just please get it sent to my new place now. And then she started telling me things like “Oh sorry, my sisters opened it thinking it was from Aliexpress”, “Sorry, I don’t have the package with me, I’m in Wellington at the moment”. I didn’t want to come off as rude trying to pressure her to send me the package... but I had to get to my other friends to talk to her about the package since she was starting to ignore my messages. 2 months ago, she finally said she would send the package.

I still don’t have it.

Tried to follow up 2 weeks ago, she apologized and said “Sorry, it’s just the postal services here are bad it’s happened before it’s supposed to be there already”. Gave it another week and messaged her, Snapchat message has been left unopened deliberately even though she was messaging my friends in it in the same timeframe. I also send a lot of parcels both locally and overseas so I know my local mail shouldn’t be taking more than 2 weeks, so she’s clearly lying about having sent the package.

64,"I’m currently 19 and I am in the stage of my life where I will regret doing nothing with my young age ten or twenty years down the road. 

Since I was about 5 years old, I’ve been obsessed with video games. I’ve played them all my life and although I’ve never skipped school (tried, strict parents shut that down early) or let it affect my grades too negatively I kind of always known it was a problem. Maybe an addiction. 


Every day after school I would hop on my computer until it was time for bed. During the weekends I would do the same except all day. I’m out of school for just over two years now and without any aspirations for what I want to be or what I want to do. I merely treat every day as a weekend and play games until it’s time to go to bed. 

During the first 8 months after school I had no where to get a job. I tried and tried but I live in a small town and eventually one place told me to stop bringing in resumes because they have so many. 

Eventually I got a job another town over and I hated it. All weekdays from 7-5. It got so bad that some days I would lie and call in sick. I would play games during these days but I honestly believe that it was because I truly hated the job. Eventually I got laid off for the winter and it took me a month to find another job. 

I work part-time at a gas station and it feels really comfortable. I work 3 days and I stay home for 4. I love it but I know it’s too comfortable for my own good. 

I have no desire to go to school purely because there is nothing in mind I want to study for and no idea for a job I’d like.

After about three dates I asked him what his intentions were and he said ""just platonic relationships because I'm just out of something serious - I'm sorry if I lead you on but you can always come here to get away and hang"" to which I responded he didn't lead me on, I'd love to be friends, yadda yadda. I was kinda surprised because he always seemed into me and eager to hang out - he was a nurse and would drive to get dinner with me after super long and tiring days/weeks, even chose to hangout with me instead of going to a show. We never even kissed - at no point was anything sexual or romantic. 

We didn't talk for about two weeks but on Easter I got a snapchat from him, to which I sent a text the following day. We went back and forth a bit and finally did a phone call where he said he missed the restaurants we used to go to. We ended up going out again around the beginning of May / end of April and things were still platonic but he paid for everything again like before. We went to an arcade and had dinner - we both agreed it was fun when he dropped me off later that night. He even waited for me to get inside (bless his heart lol) 

He sent me texts maybe the following week or two after, then suddenly he started getting worse responding. Like 10+ hours to respond. He was also not active on any social media - no more snapchats, snapchat stories, anything. Last I saw him online anywhere was Memorial Day on words with friends. I suggested we catch up around the middle of June.

He called me about three weeks ago but I missed it, when I called back he didn't answer. I got sent to voicemail pretty quickly. I sent a text instead of voicemail and he never answered. Wtf? So what should I do? Is this ghosting or should I reach out as a friend/concerned person and see what's up? ",06Jul2018,1

So I've been friends with this girl for several years but we haven't really seen each other since high school. We've kept in contact through fb messenger and our conversations have usually been basically therapy sessions for her. I've never been that open with her.

 About any trauma, she's had or former boyfriend troubles. About a month ago she broke up with her boyfriend and had been dropping hints about being interested in me throughout our conversations. This whole thing kinda escalated the other night where I had mentioned that I've never really been with anyone and none seem interested in me (like directly I have had oblivious moments). Then that escalated to us describing our ideal types which escalated to sexting. Which has continued into today. 

So we've agreed to have a friends with benefits situation where if anyone were to have feelings and the other didn't then it would stop. TheSo so far so good. The issue is she's been messaging me nonstop about the subject and it feels overwhelming. I'm not sure if I want to go through with it anymore. Yes, I think she's attractive but I haven't seen her or hung out with her in person for years (I've never hung out with her ever really) and now we're going straight into sex? It feels lopsided and I'm not really sure what to do. I don't think I'm worried about my performance because she's fine with leading.",06Jul2018,1

82,"My older sister is 25, still lives at home and only has a bare minimum part time retail job with no aspirations to speak of. Her maturity level seems to have stopped at the age of 16. Ever since she was little she's had what we call her ""issues."" At first they started out small, she was a germaphobe that refused to touch pencils and coins. Then she had to wash all (and I mean every item in her wardrobe) of her clothes every single night. No one could touch them or they would be ""dirty"" again and she'd have to wash them over. A few years ago she got a stray cat that had health problems and eventually died from cancer. It peed and shat all over her room and that didn't seem to bother her. The moment she got the cat is when her hygiene took a turn for the worse.

She used to take 30 minute showers every day, put make up on, brush her teeth. Now she will go weeks, up to a month without a shower. It's horrid. She starts to smell so bad that any room she walks into has a lingering stench for a good few minutes. Use of deodorant is rare. I can't remember the last time I noticed her brush her teeth and I've been on a family vacation with her in a small cabin and in hotel rooms for two weeks. She wears her hair in a ratty/greasy bun every day. My mother has to fight with her to shower or brush her teeth and even then it doesn't happen. She's been to therapy and has taken medication but it does nothing. Oddly enough she's still an extreme germaphobe when it comes to someone touching her laundry or possessions. 

I used to be close to her but as the years went on I surpassed her maturity level which saddens me and makes it hard for me to relate to her. I also can't bring myself to be around her because of her hygiene and just wish she was a normal older sister that I could look up to again, even though I know she has some sort of mental illness.

Hi y’all. I’m 23 and doing the adult struggle, but I talk to my family everyday and try to be involved as much as possible from many states away. I’m also incredibly close to my aunt, she’s like a second mom and best friend to me and when my mom had me at 23 and my brother at 28, she was super supportive and a huge force in our lives (ex: one summer she made me a “passport” and each week was a different country). She had her children later and life and has been struggling a lot financially. She has 3 wonderful girls and does so well raising them on very little. My mom makes pretty good money and is the “stuck up” one. 

Anyways, her children are different. They read instead of watching tv, one has severe Autism (she was nonverbal but now will talk to certain people) and the oldest is a moody teen. I think they’re wonderful. My mom however throws it in my Aunts face how weird they are and has even called them “slow” on multiple occasions. She never makes an effort to be in their lives and will constantly ignore them but will get upset when they’re indifferent to her. Today was my breaking point. My 17 year old brother apparently pinched/kicked/poked the youngest girl and she freaked out because she’s fucking 6. My mom found out and pretty much accused the 6 year old of lying instead of my SEVENTEEN year old brother to keep his hands to himself. It pissed me off because she went on her tangent about the girls being weird again and my aunt tried to play it off but it’s obvious that it hurts her because she has such a great relationship with us and she wanted that for her kids.

It was gonna be a girls trip type thing, but we were returning the same night; only a few hour drive. She told me 5 days before the trip that her husband and a bunch of their friends are going to same town for another event and she was going with them and we could meet up later for concert. 

So basically I’m now having to make a few hour trip alone to meet up with her and a ton of people I don’t know to have them drop us off at said concert and then drive back home alone for another few hours. I’m pissed. It took the fun out of the whole trip for me. I’m pretty much driving 4-5 hours ALONE total for a 2 hour concert and I don’t feel it’s worth it anymore. 

I told her to see if someone in their friends group would want to buy my ticket and they could go since they would all already be there. I made sure to be kind about it and let her know I wasn’t intending for anything to come across as shitty. Now I think she’s mad at me.

Into the story. A coworker of my girlfriend has a boyfriend who occasionally goes away on business (1-2 weeks a couple times a year at maximum). She is his whole world but it’s pretty clear she is only with him for his money and because of how it makes her look. 

She just got a dog and she is a horrible owner (for context, it’s a 10 week old golden doodle and she only feeds it 1 and a half cups of kibble a day, and she limits its water intake. I literally heard her say to the dog “that’s enough water for you, you’ve had too much”. This was when we were at the beach in 35 degree Celsius weather. The dog was on the verge of passing out so I snuck it a bowl of water which it drank in seconds). 

She will frequently come into work and brag to her coworkers (my girlfriend included) that she has cheated on her boyfriend “again”. She’s proud of it. It makes her feel special. She will even say things like “it doesn’t count because I was drunk” or “it’s fine because the guy was really hot”. Whenever she’s asked if she would be fine with it if her boyfriend did the same to her she looks visibly uncomfortable and dodges the question. 

I don’t know what to do because if I tell her boyfriend it will probably trace back to my girlfriend and I don’t want to make her work life suffer. I also don’t want this guy to keep investing his time into someone he loves but who is just abusing his love. I know it’ll probably end up with her being found out in the end, but I don’t want to have it go on any longer. If it were me I would want to know ASAP. What should I do? ",06Jul2018,2

102,"So in the UK school system you do high school until age 16, then from 16-18 you do a thing called sixth form, where you choose normally 3-4 subjects, and then after these two years you go to university depending on the grades you got the things called 'A-levels' which are the 3-4 subjects you do in the sixth form. 



One of my A-Level subjects is economics. and the teacher is a bit on the cold side, she's fair, don't get me wrong, but yeah, just a bit on the cold side. Basically I was absent for 3 months due to mental health and when I came back my grades dropped from A's to C's. If i'm honest I think I've done pretty well, considering. But my unreliability and inconsistency means betting on me is risky, and this teacher doesn't really want me in her class as she wants to keep her class results as high as possible, and like I said, I'm a bit of a liability.



Here's the crux of it though. I'm going to try and get into Oxford university. At the risk of offending you, the reader, and getting no responses, I'm just going to put it out there that I know how ridiculous this sounds but I honestly don't give a fuck what anyone thinks. I've got one life I'm going to at-least try this. Only thing is, the process of getting into oxford starts with the teachers setting your predicted grade, from which you can get your foot in the door of the university you want. For the course I want to do, I'll need at least AAA predictions. I've got these in my other two, but I've got my interview with my economics teacher and I've got a bad feeling she'll predict me a C. If she does, then my journey to Oxford is over before it even begun. If I can just make the case for her to predict me even a B, and then when we come back in September, I can impress her even more and bump it up to an A before the deadline to send off my application to Oxford.

Hey there , M/20 here in Australia.

Long story short, I went through into last semester with a lot of personal issues and privately battled a great deal of stress after starting a new job, switching friendship groups and adjusting to a new scenario at home (parents split up). 
I had a few close relationships with some girls at uni, though they never seemed to lead anywhere and if it got to intimate I usually just distanced myself because back then I feared commitment and getting into a relationship in the first place*. 
How wrong I was !!!!
That’s when I  met this shy and rather cute girl on the very last day of semester in a bar with some mates after exams. We got on well and started chatting  and I remember thinking she ‘isn’t my type’ and not really thinking much beyond she’s cool. 

Later I got a request from her and straight up ignored it.  I think I was trying to play hard to get. Ikr I’m a grub at times. I hate that I did this.

fast forward ,
 It’s still there now and I remember walking past her in the hallways just a few weeks ago and her smiling at me and me thinking ,dang, I’m growing attracted to you. 
Did I miss the train due to my foolishness? She’s still single somehow
How can I work this? 
How do I approach this girl and start a new?

I’m ready on all fronts and know how to do it safely and kinda some people who I would want to do it with. But the problem is that I have stretch mark scars on my stomach that I’m really self conscious about. I have been losing a lot of weight and I’m not really as self conscious about I’m chubby but like my body shape. But when I was bigger I developed these stretch marks that run along my stomach and under my boobs. Some are light and fading but some are deep and bright pink. I hate them. I’ve tried everything. creams, oils all the internet has told me to do but they stay on me. I’m terrified that if and when I start having sex that the person will judge me. And I know that I should be having sex with someone who loves me for me but in reality I still know that some judgement might happen in the beginning. What do I do? Never have sex? Hide my stomach during sex? Cry myself to sleep? Just some advice would be nice! ",06Jul2018,4

So I knew everything getting into this relationship but I’m not super emotional as a man. So I really need ideas or points of view to help me understand her more and help push/walk her through these emotional break downs. How can I help her more or what can I do to show her I’m here for her when I can’t be physically there for her?

114,"This is my first ever post and I am unsure if i'm even in the right sub.   
I am seeking advice or any insight into how to respect my mum's decisions in her life post-divorce with my dad. My dad was a very successful stock broker in the late 90s/early 00s and retired at 40. My parents divorced a few years later and mum took over half of his money and was granted almost full custody over my siblings and I for various reasons. She was an amazingly supportive and caring mother, however her lifestyle choices have led me to lose respect for her. She proceeded to live off the divorce money until we all graduated high school and is now studying creative arts. She has spent 5+ years and well over $100,000 pursuing her art and is yet to demonstrate she is going to make income from this as she is reluctant to even put her works up for sale. Meanwhile my dad has to work full time to support himself and assisted us growing up. She blows money and chooses to travel the world and stay in luxurious, expensive apartments studying at various art institutions, whilst never having earned any money herself since becoming a mother. I struggle to respect her and the older I get I feel our relationship is growing more tense as I see my father working so hard to get by and I am beginning to have to make a living myself. I recognise i might not respect stay at home mums as much as I should and struggle to understand art professions. Can anyone give me some advice or insight into what life is like for most women post divorce? Or any artists who can explain how they started selling their work? Perhaps even advice on how to not be resentful to someone I love so much? I hope this made sense. Thanks in advance. ",06Jul2018,3
115,"A bit of backstory, I'm 21, male, graduated high school, never went to college, and have been working steadily for about 10 months. I've got just over 3k saved up. I had more, but I was originally saving up to get a car. Which I did. I don't really pay for anything. Every other week, I give my parents roughly 100. USD More, or less, depending on what they need. Aside from that, I just save all of it. Or buy things I want. Usually, never more than 100 dollars out of my checks. I work as a Sales Consultant at Best Buy, and get paid a bit above minimum wage in my state. I make 11 bucks an hour on week days, and 12 on Sundays, and holidays. It's pretty much just a cashier/salesmen position. Not quite, a Geek Squad elite, but not some fresh out of the womb kid. I like it well enough. But, to be frank, I hate the Geek Squad douche bags at my Best Buy. Most of them are elitists, who won't talk to you if you don't know how to defrag a PC. (90&amp;#37; of their job) One guy is okay though. Ironically, I'm confident I'm much more technologically literate than most of them. But I digress.

Anyway, I've been living with my folks for my entire life. I had planned on stating to work straight out of high school, and moving at the nearest possibility. But due to a combination of my terrible decisions, and things not working out for me. I've been at home longer than I'd thought I would. Now, I'm 21, and I don't see any possible way I can afford to move. I just don't make enough to pay bills, make rent, or afford food, and entertainment. I've crunched the numbers as best I could. Using estimates from houses I'd realistically rent. (I refuse to live in a slum, or ghetto.) And I'd barely be about to maintain my rent + electricity, water, car insurance, and other necessities. Let alone afford that, on top of groceries, the cost of maintaining my car/house, clothes, and entertainment. I just don't see how it's possible. Even if I skimp on entertainment, buy off brand food, and go without entertainment entirely, I'd probably still be over my monthly wages. 

What is some advice you can give me? I'm willing to listen to anything! Thanks in advance.",06Jul2018,2

124,"About 4 years ago, I moved to Oakland to repair and possibly rekindle a romantic relationship that ended terribly due to poor communication and my difficulties with assertiveness - I ended things in a weird, wishy washy style, which kind of emotionally traumatized my ex. I feel really guilty about that.

Although the romantic relationship didn't work out, my ex and I became close friends.

I am unhappy in this part of the bay, because it is very hot, loud, sunny, and polluted. But the plus-side is that my friend and I live about 15 mins away, and get to hang out spontaneously when we want to.

I am considering moving to a quiet home in a nice, quiet, cold, foggy area of San Francisco with goid air quality.

I loved the places I looked at, and know I would be happy there.

But, it's an hour away from Oakland.

I do have business in Oakland twice per week, and would be more than happy to swing by other times too, to visit my friend.

But, when I told her this, she freaked out, told me I make stupid decisions, and hung up the phone.

I feel sad, and now am second-guessing my decision.

I really want to move to this new place, because I'm unhappy with my current living situation. But, I also want my friend to be happy.

125,"Okay, I don’t know what it is with me but I do and don’t fall in love. Explanation? I’ll give you the most recent which just actually sparked a week ago. (Quick disclaimer) I have never been in a REAL relationship i.e. gone out on a date, or anything like that actually. To get into detail about my “relationships,” I have had some but they were all kinda long distance. My first ever boyfriend, or at least someone I called boyfriend, was actually last year. We had known each other through school and started talking after he moved cities. Well, we lasted a good month. “Second,” was yet another guy I had met at school, only difference was he was going into the army. We actually hung out and to be completely honest with you, it wasn’t bad. We lasted 5 almost 6 months and our communication was through FaceTime, calling, and letters. We broke up because we actually felt unready for our relationship but that ended on good terms. Well, you’re all caught up. Now, this one sparked about a week ago. My friend got mad that I was literally living under a rock and decided to make me a dating profile. She told me that if I didn’t open up and meet someone then I would really just be hurting myself. I went off and on on the app. Well a week later,  after reopening the account, I got a whole bunch of messages! People seemed more interesting! Anyways, one guy stood out in particular. Our profiles completely matched! He texted me and from there we haven’t stopped. What’s the problem? He doesn’t text anything meaningful, if you were to see our messages, you would ask how can we text so much but there is little to no juice? Me! I literally ask him so much questions because I’ve been so open with him and he always answers in 3-5 words and 1 of those words isn’t even a word! It’s an abbreviation!! Don’t get me wrong he is super sweet and he had mentioned that he wanted a relationship but now, I really don’t know what to think. He called me baby, and so it wouldn’t be awkward, I did too but now I don’t know. I really want to still talk to him but I don’t? I think I really like him, it’s just he doesn’t seem interested.

131,"I have been ordered by the court system to take drug and alcohol tests every month. The alcohol test measures etg in your urine sample. They are only suppose to show up for at most 80 hours from what I was told. I failed mine after 7 days. I was confused and thought it may have been a false positive. Since I was unsure I bought more etg test strips online to test myself from home. Again, it has been 8 days this time and the test came back as positive. I am 5 foot 8 inches, 160 lbs and 24 years old. I read online that liver damage or hepatitis c may cause it to show up longer in your system. I went to the doctor to test my liver function and it was normal and all of my blood work came back as normal. I have no idea why I am unable to get rid of the etg in my liver. I am concerned because I have to take another test on the 13th and cannot fail another one.

I should also mention that I am a bartender and often have alcoholic drinks spilled on my hands and arms while working. Is it possible that my skin is absorbing the alcohol and leading to a positive test? I have read that other everyday things can cause a failed test. However, I do not use mouth wash often and rarely wear cologne. If anyone has any idea or comments I would appreciate it.

132,"I feel hopeless. Very hopeless. I failed my college exams and my personal life is getting messed up. I'm an American exchange student living in South Korea, and adapting to the new college environment is hard. Not only that, my stomach has gotten horrid aches for the past few weeks of exam stress. I decided to leave Seoul (to another town- South Korea is a very mountainous place) many times: I wanted to get the fuck away from the noise of grumpy crowds yelling is Seoul- summer is the worst season. Unfortunately, I could not... I have a serious diarrhea problem and can't travel far. I have to wait for weeks.

This makes me fall into temptation into playing World of Warcraft. I played it excessively for back in 2014. I was mentally unstable(paranoid personality disorder), and I had to keep myself together to avoid mental breakdowns.

But registering for World of Warcraft and paying for subscription is complicated in South Korea. Verification after verification... along with outdated programs (ActiveX). I couldn't do it, so months after I arrived in South Korea (2016), I decided to call it quits. The desire diminished after that...

But stress and hopelessness had brought the old demons back.

I have a dream. I have a dream to live independently and leave my family, which they are having conflicts. However, in Korea, there is no financial opportunity to do such a thing. The place is competitive, and getting a job is near impossible. And if I do, I will face a lot of physical abuse. You heard me. That's Korea. Your boss will beat your ass up if you screw up, and these shitbags are relentlessly demanding. I can't take this kind of shit. I also have a rage disorder and I will go nuts and beat their faces if they lay on their hands on me. I can't go back to US, as Trump is screwing up everything. And don't mention about going to different countries... immigration policies are tightening up (especially in northern Europe).

And everyone is conflicted within and came from broken families... generally worse then I. Most of my people around me divorced, having various mental disorders. If I had a problem, they blatantly refused to help me due to this. Even if I tried to help them.

This means I can't get a girlfriend. It will end up in a disaster. I don't want a perfect one, but someone who is very gentle.

This hopelessness was prevalent before I started Warcraft or any other gaming shit. As time passed by, it grew. I mean, I went to therapists and took various medications and it only grew worse.

I have no hope... as many proven facts declare it. And many moan-and-groaners I encountered explained about how humans aren't capable of controlling tempers and better off being lonely... and preach about these bullshit principles about discipline and forfeiting happiness.

I tried to shove that away, but this took too long. I have to come to terms with this. No hope. No happiness. More demands. In order to survive, I have to be uptight and not make any mistakes. It takes one to call up a disaster. That's what I had to learn in order to survive in dreary life. I cannot fight it, nor escape it.

And I am getting tired of the rat race to survive... I wish to plug into the world of Azeroth and shut myself up there... forever.

I have a craving by the way... desires to own a female character. Especially a blood elf. Beautiful, and elegant these gals are, and I want to play as them... again. I loved my blood elf priest. She was my companion who wiped away my tears of pain as she took to many amazing places...

I miss having her. And I want to have her back. The best memory of my blood elf is seeing her in a sexiest slutmog, riding Heart of Aspects. Imagine flying with her...

Sometimes I have a fantasize about putting my head on her lap. And she serenades me to sleep. Just having her comfort me wipes away my hopelessness.

Sorry for being delusional. But I need to say this because my school psychologist forbade me to lose hope, not be uptight like that. However he did not help me any longer with that due to lack of time. I don't know what to do... My lust for my blood elf grows stronger every damn moment. Hell, I already said I can't leave for trips.

Although I am in no mood for playing this game, it won't take long to figure out how to successfully go through verifications to start my Korean account. Any glimmer of willpower will diminish after that.

I wish to fight off my negative influences from hammering into my head. I wish to brush them off. I'd rather be disapointed with the consequences of optimism rather than living with pessimism. Honestly.

I went to r/nowow, and I failed to get good answers. I need your help.",06Jul2018,1

(he is 17 and she is 20) i should add. i just don’t think i can do this friendship much longer... it’s been like this for 2 1/2 years and i’ve put up with it for the sake of the friendship and memories we’ve shared. i grew up with this girl and she’s been there for me for so long. but she’s not the same person anymore and it exhausts me when we hangout. i’ve explained all this to her on why we don’t hangout as much anymore but she won’t take a hint.. she’ll show up to my house, we work at the same job, so i have to be around her sometimes due to our scheduling (i have applied to several new places and gotten call backs so it won’t be for much longer) she’ll text my mom and ask if i’m home too... it’s hard to avoid her. i try to dodge her calls and texts because i can’t deal with the arguing and negativity anymore. any better tips on how to respectfully and not harshly explain this to her? i can’t see her benefitting my life or helping me grow anymore.",06Jul2018,1

135,"Not really sure how I should go about this? I'm going to be deliberately vague about genders and parties here, so hopefully my post isn't so obtuse as to be illegible. There's going to be a little backstory here as well.

My parents divorced a long time ago, and the one who got custody of the children (while better then the other) has a history of being emotionally abusive. They managed to find a wonderful partner with kids of their own, and said partner has been more tuned in and caring about the livelihoods of my siblings and I then our erstwhile parent has. Our parent, on the other hand, has been terrible for the partner. Said partner's children, understandably, resent our parent for being such an emotionally abusive person. Perhaps the only saving grace for the kids involved is that when our parents got together almost everybody was in college and/or graduating high school.

Scrolling forward to today, my siblings and I dearly love our parent's partner and consider their kids family, and while we know they dislike our parent we hold no grudges- bluntly speaking we commiserate entirely with the resentment they feel towards said parent. I kind of thought that they considered us family as well- barring the miserable person who is one of our progenitors. But one of them is getting married recently and my siblings and I had noticed we had not received an invitation. This despite the fact their parent was putting together plans for us to attend the wedding.

After further discourse between the parties involved, namely our step-parent and their child getting married, my siblings and I were given the impression we were implicitly invited and they had just forgotten to send out the invite. Only to turn out the invite was sent online half a year ago, and we were told given the limited venue size we can bring only ourselves (no extras)- slightly problematic considering significant others and the like.

Just to emphasize, my siblings and I love our step-siblings and step-parent but our parent has been nowhere near as gracious towards them as their parent has been towards us. I don't know if, were I in their shoes, I would not hold resentment towards the family of the emotionally abusive partner who ensnared my parent. While I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt a little, I know my siblings and I would not begrudge them the slightest if they do not want us at their wedding, and I am worried that their parent has strong armed them into sending us invitations when they have neither the space nor desire for us to attend. How should this situation be handled? I think the person getting married feeling's should come foremost, but I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure if we're misreading the situation and I'm anxious about binning the step-parent's plans regarding us and the wedding.

TL;DR: Biological parent is abusive, found wonderful partner with wonderful family, step-sibling is getting married and step-parent was putting together reservation plans including my siblings and I despite missing invites. Prompting step-parent about invites for clarification led to them talking to step-sibling and ultimately finding out they were sent online six months ago. Kind of now doubt there was a mixup here, siblings and I want what the marriage couple wants.",06Jul2018,1

140,"This is a somewhat complicated story. I’ll do my best to keep this short, but I apologize in advance if this is super long. 

I started a podcast with a close friend around three years ago. After a couple of months, we decided to try adding another cohost. At first the relationship was good, but over the next two years this guy revealed himself to be a compulsive liar, manipulative, and an emotionally abusive person. After a few straight months of terrible behavior from this guy, I talked to my other cohost and producer about parting ways with him. After making the decision as a group, I sat on it for a little while. Eventually, he and I ended up getting in a fight and he attempted to lock me out of the accounts related to the show. I promptly cut ties with him and moved on. 

Up until this year, we were fairly active in our local convention scene. Through these cons, we met a couple of shows around our same size in terms of content delivered and viewer size. One of these shows, was extremely active and hosted by a couple of awesome guys. I always wanted to collaborate with them, but our bad cohost was extremely against the idea. He argued that their content was bad and their viewership was worse than ours, so supporting them didn’t do anything for us. He once accused me of trying to “jump ship” from our podcast after writing a few articles as a guest for their website. 

After we cut ties, he started working with this group of individuals. Needless to say, I was a little surprised after everything he used to say about them. I let it go, wished him the best, and limited my contact with this group of guys so that my former cohost wouldn’t get mad and lash out at me. 

For the most part, I keep my distance. I have him muted on pretty much everything and I don’t follow his content at all. Over the last year, my communication with this group has been pretty much nonexistent with the exception of the occasional comment back and forth on social media. Our producer is best friends and roommates with the former cohost, but I have really strict rules about not asking for information about him. 

Recently, my ability to keep that commitment has been difficult. My producer, who is a close friend of mine, and the former cohost have been going through a rough patch and it is greatly affecting the producer. Checking in with him often leads to long conversations about the cohost.

Today I found out that the former cohost thinks that we are stealing content ideas from the group his is currently working with. Furthermore, he thinks that our content’s layout was his idea and we’ve been spending the last year essentially “capitalizing” off of his ideas in spite of the fact that our show has basically been the same since before he joined the podcast. Finally, he told my producer that the guys from the other show and him think that we are a “joke.”

This is really eating me up. I feel as though I have been nothing but professional in my treatment of him since I parted ways with him. I’ve been super careful to respect his relationship with my producer. Furthermore, I haven’t told anyone that we’ve ever worked with about the reasons why he was kicked off the show. Even here, I have been super careful to keep things as vague as I can so it doesn’t reflect poorly on him. 

Meanwhile he is ruining our relationship with a group of guys I really respect and spreading false information about our show. I shouldn’t be surprised about the things he’s doing. In fact, this behavior from him is completely predictable, but I’m having a hard time pushing this aside. 

I’ve thought about emailing or messaging one of the guys to try and explain that I’m not stealing anything, but if what the cohost is saying is true,  than I don’t know if I can trust them not tell him about the conversation. I don’t care if he hates me more, but I don’t want to throw my producer under the bus and potentially put him in a bad place with his friend. 

What should I do? What do I need to do to finally get this guy out of my head?

141,"I have a friend of the opposite sex and I want to hang out with her, but just her. I feel like if it we're just us, though we're both very socially awkward, I would be able to hold a conversation with her. Because of text and even in person, just asking a question can lead to a series of other conversations. 

But we can only hang out downtown. She is not at her house where I live and lives with relatives near downtown. She doesn't have a license so it's not like she can go back home. So we decided we are just going to hang out in the city. 

I don't know whether she is because it's a dangerous city or because maybe she just isn't comfortable with one-on-one conversation in person, but if I ask her to hang out with me, her brother comes as well. Don't get me wrong, her brother is my good friend as well and I met him before his sister. But I feel like I have to censor myself at times, not with cursing (we don't curse) but certain topics I want to talk about with her. He ends up feeling like a guardian of the group and it's like a playdate with a parent watching over us. 

I'm also very unsure of what to even do when I go downtown now because I feel like I exhausted all of what I wanted to do. Sure we can do a general hangout but I don't know the city like she does.

142,"This is a throw away account for obvi reasons.

  We have been dating for 4 months and from the start I could tell that this wasn't going to be a forever relationship due to core ideological differences, but I still liked him a lot. However, it seems the fire in my heart for him has burnt out although his is still raging on. I want to break up with him because I don't want to lie to him about my feelings and give him a false sense of love. On the other hand, I know if I break up with him he will hurt himself and become extremely depressed.

  We both have depression although his is worse since he keeps everything in and doesn't reveal any of it, not even to me. I know he has on numerous occasions tried to cut himself, but he always gets interrupted by someone. He is a really nice dude, but I just don't see him the way i use to.

  I am now split and in desprate need of advice. A part of me is saying ""it doesn't matter if you're happy or not. Making him happy is more important than you're happiness"" while another part says I should just use him and try to get him to break up with me over time. I don't like either of these thoughts, but I don't know how else to handle this.

144,"TLDR: “animal lover” is super irresponsible with money and animals and now another beautiful sweetheart is going to die and she will continue to go through 3 animals a year and I need to do something. 

So I’ve been friends with this girl since high school but while my other high school friend and I have grown up and become better people she has just done more and more irresponsible things. Now she’s got a 5 mo only puppy with parvo because she refuses to try for a better job and used the little money she makes mostly on herself.

I am absolutely livid. She had a dog in high school named trigger. She’s an orphan and was living with a friend’s family that was clearly abusive so I picked her and her dog up and took her to her cousins house, gave her a tracphone or something like it (this was like 4 years ago). She graduated high school and between then and now she’s given trigger away (because she didn’t have time for him), gotten a pug off craigslist with her gay best friend (that was 5 weeks old and it died in less than a month), got another Craigslist dog named Sadie who is the sweetest babygirl, then tried to foster a sweet but starving street cat (that died), then got a puppy named daisy 6 mo after she got Sadie and then she gave SADIE to another friend because that Friend was doing all the care taking and she was too busy for SADIE so she GOT RID OF SADIE to have time for the NEW PUPPY. If that was hard to follow it’s because that’s how it’s been. A fucking mess.

3 weeks ago she texted me saying “I need you to be my moral compass. I saw these Craigslist ads and these kittens need homes” I told her how fostering animals like I’m doing it the best way to help the most animals as much as possible. She decided I was right. The next day there were two kittens on her snapchat story. Thanks bitch.

Now she’s had living situation issues for awhile and she just moved in with two guys. The gay friend who also killed the tiny pug and another dude. So now there’s the other dudes two more dogs and her two kittens and her puppy. 
AND HER PUPPY WAS JUST DIAGNOSED WITH PARVO

And she can’t fucking afford real treatment because she’s irresponsible with money and couldn’t afford pets in the first place. And I tell her how important vaccinating animals is and she agrees and then DOESNT AND THEY FUCKING DIE.

I am so angry. I can’t be indifferent to her neglect. No it’s abuse. Neglect to the point of death is abuse. But when anyone tried to say she’s doing something wrong or whatever she gets real sensitive and angry and can’t fucking take it. 

If I call the apartment office and report the 5 unregistered animals, animal control will take them and some will definitely get put down. AND she will keep doing this. Over and over until she fucking dies. 3 animals a year until she dies and she’s 20.

How do I stop her from abusing animals? She’s convinced she loves animals more than almost anyone. ",06Jul2018,2

146,"I got this job as a care worker in a care Home titled “Care Assistant Bank” And it states in the contract ‘The Company does not guarantee to offer you any shifts and you are not obliged to accept any offer hat is made to you”. 


About a week ago my manager said through verbal communication that if I wanted to she could change my contract to a 36 hour a week contract therefore I am guaranteed hours. I said yes please because I definitely need the work. However.. next week I have only been put down for 12 hours (that’s one long day), when I asked the person who writes the rotas why I only have 12 hours that week when I’m contracted 36 she said ‘well I just don’t have any shifts available for you’... is that not illegal if I am contracted to 36? 


But because me and my manager only spoke about this verbally with no documentation she may have not changed my contract yet. (I have not signed this contract as as it is all done via internet and I thought it would just be on my emails but when I checked it was still ‘care assistant bank’ 


So if my contract still states that I am bank would I get in trouble if I said I am not working on Saturday? 


I feel like they are mugging me off because I am fairly new there and I need some advice. They either legally give me 36 hours or they  allow me to decline any shifts? Although I’d love definite hours, they know how much I need this Saturday off but will not let me have it off.

154,"So basically I started dating this girl I met online  for around seven months now started in January 2018. We are three hours in time zone by the way. We both play the same online game which is how we met. As time when on from when we started dating she mentions that her parents are strict about dating since something she did back in middle school and now they are always in her business. So some things that I noticed that as we texted and talked or even played our game I was always the one that sparked the conversation todo so I never once got a text saying that I should get on to play which doesn’t bother me much but just a little puzzled. Since we have a time zone difference I tend to stay up until 4am my time just to talk with her and like thirty minutes in she said she’s tired and I’m just here was waiting for her to call and it’s 4am plus I only stay up to talk with her. Fast forward to June she starts college which she goes 12 hours a day also got her first job. After she starts she tends to be away more and we don’t talk a lot. I bring it up and say I feel left out she said sorry and said why and I believed her. But as the weeks go on I noticed a shift in how she was with me. I just assumed it was from working and school which was understandable. So I try and text more and I complained a little bit that we were starting to feel distant which made me feel worry I guess.( I do overthink and worry a lot like almost over everything like bad headache? Has to be brain cancer. Yes a hypochondriac.) Anyways she says I started to be clingy and was worrying over nothing. Which I felt I was in the clear because she was sketchy lately like the never responding or even reading without responding and like somewhat dry conversations that we’d have. Also one day I go on Snapchat and noticed she blocked me I immediately got mad and messaged her on iMessage. We never used iMessage because she said her parents monitored her texts. She said she couldn’t talk and blocked me because parents came to the school and said bye quickly. She could have done a better job at what she did I feel by not blocking me.

I f****d up by not immediately dialing the number I was given to verify. Let me go back..

Friday night my favorite band was playing at the House of Blues in Boston. This was my seventh time seeing them live, and they were absolutely killing it. I was in general admission on the floor, in the middle of a huge crowd of people, just jamming out and passing my thc pen to my buddy every now and then. 

That's where Cinderella appears (real name Lauren - or so she told me).

I notice a cute girl standing next to me, stealing glimpses. I asked if she smoked and passed her the pen. Then we talked a bit, danced, kissed, danced some more, and talked again. She was separated from her friends who were towards the front of the press. She lives around Boston and it turned out this was her seventh show as well. What are the odds, right?

So we danced a bit more and told me to give her my phone. I asked what for, then immediately had a *facepalm* moment and complied. She put her number in and gave it back to me. We kissed a little more before she left to go find her friends, but with some pleading in her eyes, saying ""call me"".

I think to myself ""wow, this is the best show I've ever been to!""

Fast forward to Monday. I had a crazy busy weekend but she was in the back of my mind the whole time. Monday was busy as well, but I figured I've waited long enough so I shot her a text. 

No response.

Tuesday I decide to call her as I originally meant to do. I try three times hoping what I was hearing was a mistake, but each time on the other end is a Verizon recording telling me that the number I have dialed is no longer in service.

My heart screams and dies a little bit.

I run through all scenarios in my mind. Could she have given me a fake number on purpose? No.. why would she? I didn't even ask for her #, she took the initiative on that. I couldn't think of any other explanation other than she just put her digits in wrong. What terrible, shit luck this was!

Now since, I've tried all possible avenues I could think of to find her. I've searched her name and city on FB, I've posted that I was looking for her on the FB event page, I posted a missed connections thing, and I've even tried calling similar phone #'s by replacing one digit. All to no avail.

I'm still hoping I'll be able to find the owner of this glass slipper, but I don't know what more I can do here.

170,"Hey reddit. I need some advice on with something that happened at my Canada Day party involving my girlfriend and my work superior. Using a throwaway to protect the identities of those involved.

Anyways, some context. I work in Retail as a permanent part-time employee for a year now. The person I am going to talk about is a Keyholder who I am always stuck working. Every. Single. Shift. I've asked to not be scheduled with her before due to her being verbally abusive to me at work when I first started. This went on for 3 months. I still get stuck with her every shift. I bring this up to say that I have tried to avoid her at work. Anyways, I had a party on Canada Day. It was supposed to be a small get together where I BBQ'd some stuff and played board games. However, my girlfriend and I accidentally mentioned this party in front of my keyholder and she basically invited herself. I didn't stop her as to avoid her yelling at me at work(I usually put up with her to avoid her raging at me, even if shes being a twat). So the day comes and only 3 people show up. Her, her boyfriend, and their friend. I invited 3 others but they ended up going to our cities downtown. Keyholder ended up bringing booze and mj with her. I didn't drink or smoke but my girlfriend got drunk and had a few tokes. She seemed really out of it and I did my best to keep an eye on her, but I had to go to the bathroom really badly(I don't think those burgers were sitting well in my stomach). I spent a good 25 minutes on the shitter just trying to finish my business. When I came out, they were leaving(finally) at 2 am. After they left my girlfriend broke into tears and explained that Keyholder forced herself onto her. She said she kept trying to kiss her as she moved her head, and continually rubbed her privates over the pants, as the boyfriend watched. We tried confronting her over Facebook but she kept saying she was busy and couldnt talk. Eventually, I had enough and said we need to talk about this, my girlfriend is having panic a lot over this. She then went on to blame my girlfriend, says she was asking for it for calling her cute and pretty. She said she had to get it out of her system. She also said she cant be blamed because she was also drunk and high. Now, I have to face her at work and have her be crazy to me, know she molested my girlfriend, and I feel as if i can't do anything about it. I can't just quit.

171,"So the other day my husband of 7 years told me he prefers women with a size B/C cup size. I’m an A. He’s always said he loves my boobs. And he’s never made me feel self conscious about being small breasted until the other day. And he prefaced it with, “don’t take this the wrong way but...” 

I’m upset with him for even saying anything. Why would he tell me that? It hurt coming from someone I trust sexually. And now I feel weird with him touching my boobs bc all I’m thinking about is how he doesn’t like the size. 

Is he a dick for saying that? (I think so) Do I just need to get over it?... I don’t know how to handle this. ",06Jul2018,399

Her “baby dad” has come in many times, threatening to beat her ass and not caring if we call the cops. It’s just an endless cycle and no one even cares. I care, i would love for her to be rid of him but i wouldn’t even know where to start. It seems everyone who has worked with her much longer and has just became used to it. Is that wrong of us?

175,"I am a trainer at my job, and used to be very close friends with my colleague, Maria. Maria ended up basically dropping me. I would try and talk with her and maintain our friendship, but realized she wasn’t putting in the same effort.  After trying to explain my feelings and my desire to maintain my friendship with her multiple times, I quit trying.That was about a year ago. Since then, work has become pretty hostile for me.  The training team is very small, with just one other person (Jo) besides myself and Maria. Maria trained Jo when she was first hired with our company, and they are now as close as Maria and I used to be.  They leave me out of everything. They sit with each other every day and work together on projects. They never reach out to me and ask for my opinion, even though the projects they are working on effect my daily job duties as well. For example, when I realized that a new training curriculum had come out, I messaged both of them instantly.  I found out that they had known for days and not let me know.  Things had been tense with the team for a while before this happened, but this was the final straw. I reached out to my manager and explained what all was going on and how I couldn’t work this way. He told me I should extend an “olive branch” every day and try to talk with the team.  He also talked to Maria and told her to do the same thing.  On one occasion, I tried to message Maria and she rejected it (I had a pop up telling me that she ignored the message).  I told my manager this. Nothing really came of it.  Another example: we have a program for students in training classes to work with a mentor after training for their on the job training.  They worked together to completely restructure the program and didn’t involve me at all.  When I found out they had been working on the project without me, I told my manager. He brought up the project in a weekly touch base meeting and asked for a list of who would be doing what (I guess to force them to involve me).  The project was pretty much over at that point and the “task” they gave me was to proofread lessons that had been created years ago and didn’t need to be changed. So I basically was completely left out of it. The other day I figured out that they are working on a test review without me. We just had new material come out, and they are working on the test review without me. That is something that effects my job daily when I am teaching a class and something I feel like I should have input in.  The only reason I know that they are working on the review without me is because I saw it in Jo’s shared drive folder. They have not said a word to me about it.  They sit together every day and never reach out to talk to me.  I will admit that I don’t reach out to them either, but it is so uncomfortable when I talk to them.  Jo isn’t as bad as Maria. Jo will at least talk with me and make me feel included when she is around. Maria, though, is very hostile with her body language and tone. She will not make eye contact with me and is very short with her responses.  If she sees me walking down the hall, she will turn the other way.  If she is talking with a group of people and I come to join, she promptly leaves. I honestly don’t know what I have done for her to feel this way about me.  I tried really hard to maintain our friendship, but she wasn’t putting in her part and I stopped. I explained my feelings and gave her chances to fix it or tell me what I can do. She would always say she would work on things but never did. I don’t know what else to do. Work is miserable for me right now. I have tried multiple times in the past to talk with my manager and even HR, and nothing has been done. I don’t know what could be done, honestly. I feel like this is going to continue and that I am going to just be left out of everything. Should I just quit? Does it seem like I am blowing things out of proportion?  I feel helpless.",06Jul2018,1
176,"Hello,

Is it possible for me to be in depression and anxiety and 100 other states of mind that fuck my life up just because I am too Nice with people?

I am starting to get an ugly feeling that I am pushing people away because they think i am fake.

I do speak a lot about myself i reveal myself to almost everyone which i know is bad. I help anyone with whatever my possabilities are.

And all the bad things about me pretty much come from not having many people around me.

For a very long time i just sat at home and closed myself emotionally and socially.

Now trying to recover and while trying to recover i met that girl with a boyfriend which decided to pretend she likes me and she just played me baddly and pushed me back few months so I started over and now I am starting to figure it out but i need a 💡 i need more motivation, which can only come from other people. Because i dont run towards my goals i try to push/pull people who are going the same way and then eventually become friends and push it together this is what motivates me.

I dont know... Just confused.

Any advices?(on anything)?

177,"My Partner is disabled, over the past 12-18 months this has had a major impact on her health and mobility, where it is becoming more and more difficult to get her out of the house.

Since about 3 months ago she has barely left the bedroom, and spent all hours either playing Fortnite, or watching others play fortnite. She has spent hundreds £££'s on twitch, and basically stopped dealing with her actual life. I think she has started a relationship with one of these people, but I have no real proof, but twich chat is public, and the way she talks to him is very suggestive.

183,"Some backstory, the guy has been my classmate since 1st grade. We've known each other for so long, but we're not close. We just used to be normal friends. He's a troublemaker but he was still decent to me. 

But he suddenly changed. I don't mind teasing every now and then. I get hurt, but I'm not that sensitive to cry about it. But he will literally mention my name at least once every day. He will relate me to the most random stuff to make fun of me. Sometimes he would come up with fake stories about me and tells it to everybody in the loudest voice possible. 

I have anxiety and someone mentioning my name is enough to make me tense, not to mention if I'm being made fun of. He's a severe attention seeker, but I'm the only one he makes fun of the most. I'm overweight and unattractive. I have low confidence and he will do everything to make it worse. He makes it so I'm reminded and makes sure I get demeaned at least once a day. He has this weird obsession to make me feel like crap all the time. Especially when I make a mistake or embarrass myself, he will not shut up about it. 

You might ask, why do I put up with this? I don't, I tell him to shut up multiple times and also ignore him. It doesn't work. He still does it.  I try to not let it hurt me, but it's everyday. It crushes me. I've been trying so hard to be more confident and open, but when he's around it's like I'm not allowed and he reminds me why. 

 Most of them laugh with him, but some also defend me. I'm grateful, but it just makes me look more of a victim because I always need to be defended and I feel so ashamed. Some ask me why it doesn't bother me. It does, I'm just not used to expressing my feelings. My expression is always calm when he does it, so people assume I'm not hurt. They all know that being awful is his nature, he just does it to me the most. It is tolerated by everyone. After all, he's just joking around right? Bullying is not really taken seriously here. 

Telling my parents or the school won't help. Tried telling my mother. Just said I'm overreacting, you're too sensitive, just ignore him. I feel like the school will tell me the same thing and just create unnecessary drama and judgement. 

At this point what's left is to take care of this myself. I'm so tired and drained. I have never done anything to him and I get treated this way. No one understands how this feels and I just want it to stop so I don't have to look for people who do. 

But how do I do this? I can't even talk to him normally anymore. It doesn't help that I'm a shy and quiet person. Please tell me what I should do and how to approach this situation.

194,"so my best friend (let’s call her lynn) and our mutual friend (who’s also her beat friend but we’ll call him douche) have been sexting and just recently been exchanging nudes. He’s a great guy and everything but he said something that threw me off and making me question him as a person. 

Anyways, a couple of days ago I hung out with douche and our other guy friend. I was talking  how nobody treats me the same as Lynn and this other girl in our group of friends and douche says “well I treat all the girls in our group the same.” 

Our other guy friend chimes in saying, “No you don’t.”

They both exchange a little smile and since everyone thinks I’m some kind of idiot I don’t catch on. Well, bitch, I do and know he’s showed our other guy friend the nudes or that convo. I haven’t even seen them or looked at the convo because that’s private. I only know the bare minimum that something is going on but douche doesn’t know that. 


also if he shared that with our friend, it’d be putting lynn into a tricky spot since other friend and lynn work together. 

so when our friend left, I confronted douche. this is where I have a few misgivings but I don’t regret what I said. Basically I confessed to knowing the bare minimum about the situation and if he told anyone he’d be as good as dead to me. he said he didn’t and that he would never. but idk if he’s lying or not. 

In terms of relationships I never thought of him as an ideal candidate. He seemed to have a nice personality but backed out way too many times on potential and lead lynn on so many times. he was a good friend but no where near boyfriend material. I know it’s none of my business to interfere but if her nudes get out there could be some serious consequences. I don’t know if I should tell her that I confronted him about it or if I handle this wrong (but it’s far too late to go back on this now). help.

198,"So my mom (F40) had a baby in January. The baby is very temperamental. He constantly needs a change of scenery and a change of pace to remain calm. The point is that he is a handful more than other babies. 

So my step dad(M46), never having a child before, decided it would be a good idea to get a guard dog. So he sank in $1600 for a purebred German Shepherd. We name her Kona. Keep in mind that my step dad and mom are the only ones who wanted this dog. 

I (F18) for one thought this was an awful financial decision, especially because the dog wouldn’t be specially trained nor did it come from any police dog background. She was only going to be a puppy as well.

So the dog gets here and it’s clear my brother (M16) has a liking to Kona. He starts to watch after her and bond with her. He cleans his entire room top to bottom just for the dog. My mom explains the dog will sleep in HIS room because Kona does not get along with the dog I already have. (My dog is a small, indoor dog who is very low maintenance after I spent the time to train him that way.) 

This is all fine by me.

As the week goes on, Kona gets less and less attention she deserves from my family. We haven’t had a puppy in a long time, and we already have a baby in the house. So the last thing anyone wants to do is watch over Kona.

So all my parents want to do is lock her in a cage and put her on a leash. I explain to them that german shepherds in particular have bad separation anxiety. And you also need to help her release energy by playing and walking with her. 

They didn’t really listen to me and decided to lock her in a cage one night. She wouldn’t stop howling and barking for two hours so I just researched training myself and took it into my own hands. I took her into my room and slowly introduced her to her kennel in a healthy way. 

But the night she was in my room I could only squeeze in a few hours of sleep because she was constantly chewing, pissing or shitting. My room is not organized for having a puppy like her.i have a lot of art supplies that she gets into and my schedule has been so hectic lately I haven’t been able to organize my room. 

And I know I should walk her, but I personally do not have the time to because I work and am preparing to go to college soon. 

I’m more upset at my brother because he is incredibly lazy. All he wants to do is play video games. 

Like last night I got home from hanging out with friends and went to the bathroom to get ready for bed. My brother texted me and said Kona had been crying in his room so he put her in mine?? She pursued to shit three times but my brother was still playing his game. He couldn’t be bothered to stop and take her outside for ten minutes to properly show her. 

And it’s hard to have this dog in general. My parents also trust me to watch after my baby brother sometimes because they both work full time. My mom owns a restaurant and my step dad works in a branch of high security (idk what, sorta like fbi forces). 

There have already been days when I have to watch over the baby AND keep an eye on the dog. 

I cannot train her by myself. I didn’t ask for a dog, I didn’t beg nor pay for her. And yet I find myself looking after her. 

What should I do? Should I just keep my mouth shut and look after this dog? Or should I dump her back to my family? I’m just so frustrated at my lack of sleep and her constant energy, it feels like IM the one who just had a baby.

Also: sorry for my english

We were highschool sweethearts. He transferred to our school when we were sophomores,  and we kinda clicked since he's American and I was one of the people in our class who can speak english (it's taught in our school,  but only a few dared to speak it because we're all afraid to be laughed at.) He told me he's thankful that I was speaking to him because our classmates wouldn't. Then,  after five months,  we started to date. 
There were things that we had to go through,  like my parents thinking that our relationship would hinder my studies, my being reserved (introvert)  and him being so friendly (extrovert)  and all those culture shocks. Eventually, we surpassed them. 
When we graduated in high school,  we got into our own paths. He went to an engineering school while I went to medical. We still went out, but we rarely had time for each other.  Luckily,  internet and phone were there. 

September, last year. I was interning in a hospital as a nurse while he's in another city that's five hours away if you travel by bus. While I was getting ready for my shift,  he called me and told me he missed me and wanted to see me. I reminded him that we're both busy,  so we couldn't really see each other,  and he said that he's going to see me after my shift,  which was 7pm-7am. It's good because we both were free after my shift and we could actually meet,  although I was worried because I knew he's had many things to do even in his free time. We kinda talked for a while until my shift started. 
When we met up, he held my hand and we had a date. He was smiling all the time,  and I was happy to see him. We complained about the things in our workplace,  but all was good. It was a good time. 
Until he broke down. Night came and while we were on his apartment,  he held my hand and told me he's thinking of killing himself.  He showed me strings of email asking for help (to josamaritans) about what he's feeling. He also told me how,  despite every loving person in his life,  he felt lonely and depressed all the time. I was so shocked. I'd known him for a long time and I'd never thought he's depressed. I remembered there were lots of crying and me telling him how much I love him,  how much he's worthy of happiness. He hugged me and told me how thankful he was that he finally had someone to tell about what he truly felt. I told him that he could tell me everything eveb before that night. 
  I remembered texting my parents that I couldn't come home because I had to do some things related to my internship (parents are still strict even until now) just to stay with him. We laid in bed to sleep,  and he was aslept after two hours or three. I couldn't sleep because I was worried that if I closed my eyes,  he'd be gone. I remembered touching his chest and feeling his pulse just to make sure. 
After that night,  he promised that he wouldnt do something dangerous and we went to see a psychiatrist I know. He had therapy sessions after that. 
March,  this year. I was studying in my room when my mother called. She said he shot himself. I was in denial because I didn't think it was real, but mother couldn't have joked about something like this. I calmed myself, but couldnt keep myself from crying and shaking. It's so painful. Up until now, it's still stabbing me. 
He didn't leave any notes,  and the months after his breakdown were good memories. In the headlines, it was said that he did what he did because of too much school works. I was so angry because they couldnt have been more wrong. 

It has been months, and all I could think of was him. I miss him so much and I love him so much. I try to focus to other things, but after everything,  I go back to thinking about him.  I couldnt tell anyone because they're already worried for me. Most are even uncomfortable of talking about it

201,"I have had the same group of friends for pretty much my entire life, but I have moved away to go to university and now I have no idea how to behave around strangers. I don't even know how one goes about the process of making friends. I feel like people think I come across as angry or depressed, but I don't really know how to act formally. I miss being with my old group and just being able to joke around or be sarcastic without having to worry about offending anyone. That's really the natural way that I behave, but obviously I can't act that way around strangers. I still speak with them, but I am in a different location and a different career field than them, so I suspect I will need to establish friendships outside of that group in the future. I have been here for three years and I know absolutely no one. Are there any resources available for socializing myself and learning how to act around people outside of my old friend group?",06Jul2018,1
202,"Hey Reddit.

This is yet another post about ghosting, but it's a little different.  My best friend isn't exactly ""ghosting"" me, he's just distant, generally unresponsive to messages, completely different when we're together, but absolutely refuses to acknowledge the change.  Let me explain a bit more.  This guy has been my best friend since high school.  Typical best friend stuff:  all sorts of secret shenanigans in high school and college, long talks, awesome chemistry, best man at my wedding, traveled the world together, etc.  Thick as thieves, right?  Never any departure from this, and, in fact, he has always trusted me with extremely private information, including about his family drama.  When he was at my wedding with his fiancee at the time (now wife), I had no indication that anything was up, but right after that--poof, nothing.  Wouldn't respond to texts for months at a time, curt responses, stopped giving me updates about his life (he lives a couple states away) and denies being upset or having any problems with me both times I've asked over these past three years.  To the point where I'm almost made to feel like I'm being a little crazy about this.  Sitting here now, it felt like I'm being gaslighted a bit, but maybe it is in my head.  I've asked my wife about this, and she's noticed the same thing, but she's obviously bias.  It's been a couple years since I've broached the topic and we recently ran into each other at a mutual friend's wedding.  The distance was devastating.  All conversations cut short.  Limited information about what's going on in his life.  Felt like he was being pleasant for the sake of everyone else's company.

Reddit:  I know you're getting a slice of this--mine--but am I sounding crazy about this?  It's been affecting me for years, and I feel like I have to lay it all on the line at this point.  At what point am I harping on this too much?  Is there a certain way to present this that would increase my chances of an honest, open response?  Honestly, this has been albatross for years.

204,"My wife has been dealing with various health issues over the past year, almost to the point of being bedridden. During that time, I had a flexible job and could still take care of the necessary life tasks, like cooking and shopping for groceries. She works a part-time, remote job that she can do from her cell phone. She can pretty much do it anywhere, even if she is out and about in town. She has recently improved health-wise and is functioning again. 

We are in a tight spot financially and I had to get a more set full-time job, working 12 hour days regularly. It is also remote, but I have to be glued to my computer during that whole time. 

Since I don’t have that flexibility anymore to take care of all of the stuff I was doing before. I really need her to step up and help me with some of these things. Every time I bring it up or try to tell this to her, she gets super defensive. She claims that she is responsible for so much more than me and has to do laundry (which I actually do) and clean the house. I’m just getting so burnt out trying to juggle everything.

208,"I'm a college graduate and have moved out of the house, and I have a 9 year old half-sister. My parents are divorced (have been since a young age) and I have lived primarily with my biological father and step mother since then (biological mother's side of family is not relevant to this post); I see my step-mother as my real mother as she has played a much more significant part in my upbringing (I'll refer to her as Mom). However, I am faced with a dilemma regarding the differences in how my mom is raising my half-sister.

My dad and I agree that mom has been more overprotective of my sister than she has been with me (is her biological child after all). She's also a stubborn person, who is often quick to think she is right and finds it difficult to admit she is wrong. However, her reasoning isn't without merit, she tends to make very good decisions regarding everything (raising children, which route to take home, what places to visit on a vacation), and as a result she has a lot of pride in her parenting abilities and believes she is right. She also has a master's degree in consulting and has a successful career as a doctor, despite coming from an impoverished country (at the time) so she's very proud of her achievements. However, Dad and I think that she is excessively stubborn with my sister, some examples:

1. she forces her to learn piano (has been this way for 5 years), even though my sister hates it and wishes every time to not play. As a result, my sister's learned to bargain her way (""If I have to play piano, then I should get something in return"") and Mom agrees with it because she puts a lot of her childhood hope in her (she never played instruments as a child)
2. She is often too outspoken at the dinner table when deciding what menu items to choose, since she has a track record of making good decisions but even with guests we believe she should be a little lenient to their opinions. As a result, this rubs off on my sister in that she is bossy.
3. She has trouble admitting her fault when confronted by me / Dad, and often throws a fit but fails to realize her faults. She has a habit of rubbing in her being right and thinks of her ""track record"" as a way to justify how she can disregard our opinions.

As a result, we're worried that eventually my sister's stubborn and prideful behavior, which is already starting to develop from being under Mom's wing all the time, will become permanent and she won't have an open mind when she's older. It's been difficult already for me to bring this up because I've been at school and my dad doesn't bring it up because it just causes fights with Mom, her stubbornness makes it a paradox to discuss her stubbornness in regards to her parenting.

I know that people rarely change, especially at the age of my parents (early 50s), so asking Mom to change and be less stubborn for my sister's sake would be very difficult (but advice regarding this would be appreciated!) I'm thinking of maybe going to family counseling, but since it isn't a huge issue that will immediately tear apart the family I don't know if it's a necessary step. Does anybody have experience with this situation and have any advice for what I (and my dad), can do?

tl;dr: Mom is really stubborn, Dad and I don't want my sister to become stubborn but it's already starting to show, hard to discuss with her because she's stubborn

209,"I'm turning 28 this year, and already have a college degree in English Literature, and am pretty much monolingual. I have a couple of questions and I don't know which is the biggest one. To me, the most pressing one is, should I continue doing what I'm doing?

Last year, after three years of refusing to seek a job post graduation (or maybe I couldn't get one, just seeing all the lousy job postings on the internet, which asked for scans of every concievable document, cover letters, and CVs, and where I'd never be sure if someone would even see the application, I simply gave up), I convinced my parents that they would really have to support me in my quest to gain a second Bachelors degree, this time in math. I decided to go to Russia to get this degree, as any other university that would accept me would cost three to four times what I would spend in Russia, and they didn't have any of the math courses I wanted and needed. I enrolled in October 2017 in a year long course that promised to give me a B1 in Russian, and the chance to compete for a place in Russian universities. So far so good.

After a few weeks in Russia, bad things start happening and never stop. 

1) I have OCD. The toilets, bathrooms are filthy. The corridor of my dorm is dark and seems filled with something malevolent, I hate going out there, because the moment I leave the safety of my room, I get these terrible thoughts  and ideas that I've become contaminated. I went to see a psychiatrist in Russia, but he seemed pretty useless to I stopped going, and the medicine he prescribed did nothing but make me kind of apathetic and more interested in acting out aggression towards others (but I never fought with anyone).

2) It's been 10 months, I still can't speak Russian although I passed my exam. I'm also having trouble studying for my math exam which will be here in a few days. I can't even begin to tell you what my study habits were. But I think I spent most of my time swinging between extreme fear and extreme anger, possibly even rage, I'm uncertain if there was a lot of time to study. Plus, I feel like I am going to get a heart attack everytime I have to speak to a stranger in Russia. 

3) Whatever confidence I had in myself and my abilities is gone. I claw at my skin with my fingernails because it's the only antidote to this gut pain I have inside me. I'm constantly thinking of killing myself either by jumping in front of a train (it's super easy in Russia, they don't have platform barriers in the metro), or with this long kitchen knife that I have. When I was at home, I spent weeks planning my own death on and off, but not seriously. Here, I'm still not serious, maybe I just find it more entertaining than anything else I have going on.

4) I felt that all my Russian teachers hated me. 

5) Learning Russian is incredibly boring torture. Nothing seems to stick. It's repetitive, and I feel more productive writing out all the ways I want to destroy myself. It's horribly immature but I've had this character traits since I was very young. These days it takes the form of planning my own death, trying to destroy my 900 dollar cellphone, clawing my skin. Btw, I had dyslexia when I was a kid, I don't know if this contributes to the way I am now. And I developed anger management issues during the course of this year from hell. I self-harm out of anger, and treat my cellphone like a person that I'm trying very actively to crush into powder and cast into hell.

6) I have chronic headaches now that I'm approaching exam day. I spend a lot of time lying in bed because the pain is a bitch.

7) I don't have any other emotions besides fear and anger. I'm not really interested in stuff and just feel very hollowed out, I dislike talking to anybody, it's just boring, and I'm certain this (studying Russian, math etc) is not something I'm good at. But the only thing I really wanted even before I graduated college the first time was to get a degree in pure math from an actually good university, turn into somebody else, and fly away. And if I don't do this, let's quote Scarlett O'Hara, ""What would I do, where would I go?""

So, should I continue or not? If I discontinue, I'm going to be very regretful very soon. Btw, I have a twin sister. Also here with me, seems to be dealing better. And I'm certain I gave myself brain damage by strangling myself in my sleep---because I stupidly wore my lanyard and religious pendant to sleep the night before last.

I said that's odd and we had an argument about it and she said I'm being paranoid so without thinking in a rage I looked at the messages and they were too friendly for friends so I flipped out and she said that they got a bit too close nothing physical just they both felt low and they was comforting each other. After a calm conversation she agreed to stop talking to him and deleted Snapchat. Today I found a box of empty condoms and one in her car.

214,"Last year I stayed at a Comfort Inn.  Before the stay I emailed them to ask a question.  This morning I got an email from them with the subject ""comfort inn stats for 7/5/18/"".  The email is just a spreadsheet that was attached.  This spreadsheet has all of their information including occupancy, average daily rate, and their revenue.  This is all sorted into tabs by month and each tab has a daily breakdown.  I know this wasn't meant to be sent to me.  It was also sent to two other people.  I found one of them on LinkedIn and she is the  Vice President of Hotel Operations for the hospitality group that owns the hotel.  That makes me think it was important and someone probably didn't get it that was supposed to.  My guess is that another employee that has the same first name as me was meant to get the email, but my name showed up first and they didn't double check before they sent it.  After all, when you send an email at 3 am, you probably aren't thinking to double check it.

There's a concert happening this weekend that me and a few of my buddies got a bunch of tickets to, so naturally we we've been asking as many people as we were close to to come and join us.

I have a friend, we'll call him John, and he got dumped a few months ago by his now ex-girlfriend (we'll call her Jane). Recently, I found out that John isn't over it yet and still needs some time to move past it, which I've been through before so I understand where he's coming from. He also mentioned that he isn't comfortable being around her for now, and will almost certainly just leave if she were to be with us in a social event. He also doesn't want anyone to know about it right now and it was an honest heart-to-heart between him and I. Problem is, his ex so happens to be one of my closest friends.

Months before I knew about how John felt, I had asked Jane to come hang out with us for this event, letting her know that John would be there if that was alright with her. She was cool with it and had said that her and John were on good terms. 

How do I properly deal with this situation? I feel like I can't tell Jane what's going on because of John's request to keep his feelings private.",06Jul2018,1

221,"A few years ago I dated this guy. We were in love. We had to end it because of our cultural differences (he's a Pakistani Muslim and I'm not). I was heartbroken but we stayed connected for a long time.  
After we broke up, I dated a new guy for about a year. We broke up eventually because of financial issues for both of us. We still talked on the phone a lot and I was so happy to be able to truly call an ex a friend.  
After him, I started dating a third guy who is my current husband. He is very jealous and so am I. He and I both promised we would not stay in contact with exes or anyone we used to have sexual relations with. This was a little hard for me because my second boyfriend was just a good friend at this point. However I agreed to the promise.  
One night the second boyfriend texted me. I didn't see it because I had his number blocked (but on Samsung S7 edge, you can go through and see blocked messages in settings). He was murdered that night on the streets. Sounds made up, I know.  
For the next few weeks, I was so devastated and even a little mad at my husband for making me stop communication with him. I wish I had seen his message that night he died.  
Well anyway, I still ended up marrying my husband because I love him.  
Fast forward to today. My first boyfriend (the Pakistani) has been reaching out to me on tumblr a lot lately. I have told him that I'm married now and he congratulated me. I sometimes blog about my thoughts and feelings and shit and I guess he actually reads them. I had recently posted something about how I was having a shitty day, and how I hope my late friend/ex is having a good time up in heaven etc etc. My husband read it and demanded I delete the post because he doesn't like when I mention my dead ex. I deleted it.  
But my first boyfriend had already read it and messaged me asking if I'm doing better. I can't believe this.. somebody actually cares. The one person who should - my husband - gets jealous of a dead man, while my ex is actually looking out for me. Now who knows, maybe my ex has other intentions in mind. But it still made me feel cared for.  

My husband saw the message from my ex before I even could (he just happened to be using my phone when it popped up) and demanded I delete it and never respond. I agreed.  
But now... I'm having flashbacks of when my second boyfriend was killed... when I didn't see his text.. when I didn't respond to him. I just have such a bad feeling in my stomach by not responding to my first boyfriend's Tumblr message. I am not the the type of girl who leaves people on read. If you know me, you know I always respond. And I even made a little promise to myself that I would never not-respond to someone ever again unless they were straight up harassing me.  
My husband has never had a serious relationship before me. He claims he's never even said ""I love you"" to someone before me, so this is probably why he doesn't understand what it's like to care for an ex without having romantic feelings for them.
So I decided I need to respond to boyfriend 1. I do not have feelings for him anymore, I don't want to be back with him and I love my husband more than anything. But boyfriend 1 is still a human I care about. I need to tell my husband this and I'm prepared for the shitstorm that'll ensue.  
But I just wanted to know what you guys think / the best way to handle this / or if you think I'm actually in the wrong and need to refrain from communicating. Also should I mention something in the message saying that I cant really keep talking to him anymore because it would be unfair to my husband?",06Jul2018,1

I've been with my girlfriend for two and a half years now. We are going to start college next month and we have both been really excited about the experience for a while now. Recently I have had some anxiety about the future and it has taken a toll on me in the last few weeks. I really love her and I never want to lose feelings for her, but whenever I think about the future or even see a couple getting engaged on the internet/tv or even just seeing a couple being happy and care-free like that my heart drops and I feel sad. I don't want to lose feelings for her, but sometimes it feels like I am even now. Both of my parents said that the reason I feel like I am losing feelings now even a little bit is because I am so scared of the future and it is seeping into my current life. That makes sense to me because whenever I am with her or talking to her and I am not thinking about anything like that I feel normal and happy. But when I do I feel empty and sad. The feelings tends to not really go away until I talk to someone, but then it comes back later. I don't want to lose her and I am really scared I am going to.

I guess my question is how can I stop thinking like this? I have a history of overthinking things and I tend to work myself up, but it usually goes away. How can I make this go away?

224,"  I'm a teenager living in an underdeveloped Asian country. I live in a family with mid income but I have all my basic necessities covered. I'm an above average student in school. But my parents have high expectations for me. Education here is really bad and really corrupted. They shove down 14 subs down your throat with options and either you digest it or do bad in exams. Moreover even if you are prepared well, there are really high chances of your exam copies being not properly checked and your marks being miscalculated. In short, there are every chance of you being messed up in the board exams and eventually your education life. I have school for 8 hours and tutors for 4 and other studies for another 2. I barely get any free time at all. 

People in my country are really small minded. They have no creativity and no good taste in anything at all. They judge people by numbers and degrees. They don't get along with you if you are different and have a different approach to life. 

I consider myself very different from all people. I have different tastes in all matters and my philosophy is very different from everyone as well. As such I don't get along with people. I have no true friends or anybody to talk and have fun with. I have no one to exchange my ideas with. I stay at home and barely go outside to socialize. I also stay indoors as life security here is very risky as well. Having no social interactions and circles, I feel very stranded. I've became a complete social outcast. 

The topics and matter I'm interested in are different from the matters relatable in my society. My education and pressurized life has stopped me from flourishing my creativity and artistic pursuits. I'm chained in a cage of my own. 

I feel sad, depressed and find no interest in anything. I try to stay positive, but negativity surrounds me all around. I'm losing interest in life and everything. 

There are chances of me going out of this country and settling abroad. But the chances are very low and even if they are there, they will take long to be accomplished. By then most of my essential times of life will be gone and wasted. 

I need help. I badly need it. Please provide me with whatever advices you can.

234,"So I get that it’s nobody’s place to tell somebody if they should keep a baby or not, but let me explain the situation.

My girlfriends best friend since middle school (we’ll call her Samantha) got into a relationship with some guy (we’ll call him Brian) about a year ago. We heard nothing but bad things about him for a very long time, when asked why she was still with him, she would always talk about good qualities he has. One night she broke down and explained that when she tried to break up with him, he threatened to kill himself. 


Samantha has always been a go getter, she got a decent job out of high school, and two months ago bought a house at 19. Brian on the other hand, dropped out of school in 10th grade, refuses to get a job, and spends his day smoking weed and screaming at his PlayStation. 


My girlfriend, Brian, and Samantha all recently moved into the house she bought. We tried telling her that she shouldn’t let Brian move in because of the relationship problems they’ve been having, but for whatever reason she insisted he came.


Brian owes her over $2000, still doesn’t get a job, acts extremely entitled in the house he hasn’t put a single dollar into, speaks disrespectfully to Samantha and my girlfriend (he told her “You’re not my girl, why do I have to listen to your bitching?” When asked to do his dishes), he’s hit her and left a visible mark because “I get grumpy when you wake me up, you should know that”, and much much more. Samantha drives him everywhere he wants to go because he doesn’t have a license, he said “I don’t care, you promised,” when she didn’t want to drive him to his drug dealers in the rain. I’m having a hard time explaining just how much of a piece of shit this guy is. He even brags to me about stuff that he steals!


So now in these two months, it seems like Samantha has just given into being his personal sugar momma. She used to be so motivated, but now she calls out of work for no reason. She used to be so clean, but has completely given up on trying. My girlfriend had to have a talk with her recently “if you two won’t help me clean, then I’m only going to clean my room and bathroom.” Their house is so gross, I refuse to go over there. He’s just so manipulative, he gaslights her all the time, twists her words every time they get into fights (multiple times a day), he’s simply bringing her down in life.



Then last week she finds out she’s pregnant, and she’s going to keep it because “he’s always wanted to be a father, and I think babies are cute!” We’ve tried explaining to her that Brian is already a black hole in her bank account, taking care of him and a baby will ruin her savings. She’s had ambitions to open her own business, and she’s saved up 10k, but having a baby with this man at this point in her life will ruin those dreams.



I just feel like these are the days she’ll regret for the rest of her life, and she’s simply not listening to logic. He seems to have her under some spell, and we’re afraid she’s going to finally wake up after it’s too late. Her own mom is trying to talk her into abortion, she hates Brian. 



So is this something that we should just stay out of and let her learn on her own? Is this something that we should keep working at because we care about her future? Let’s not forget that this manipulative abuser will be raising a child. 


Does anybody else have experience with their friends being stuck in manipulative relationships? We could use some advice.",06Jul2018,1
235,"So I work two jobs, both 32 hrs each.

One is manual labor ($18/hr) and the other is a theater ($11/hr).

When I first signed up for the manual labor job, the higher up told me I’d be working 32 hours per week from 5am-1pm.

I got the theater job right after working from 3pm-10pm right after so I could make some extra bank so I can get an apartment and pay for my college tuition.

The manual labor foreman keeps telling me that I have to work extra hours some days, and gets upset when I tell him I agreed on the hours given and that I have to leave at 1pm like me and the boss agreed on so I can work my other job.

I just got called up to the office by two firemen and they told me that they are the priority and the other job is interfering. They said it’s nothing personal (although the other two foremen have NO problem letting me leave on time), and that I have to choose between the jobs.

I'm nervous to post because I'm afraid I sound ridiculous, but I feel like I'm missing out on life. I'm 21. I went to college at a super huge school for a semester far away from home. I ended up becoming really depressed and I moved back home with my new Fiancé. 

Over the last year, I overcame my depression and now I have an awesome full time job with no solid plans to go back to school but dreams of going back. Recently, I've been looking back and I really wished I got to go away to a small school in the North East where I'm from. I wished my experience was different, but now I'm too old to go away and be independent. 

In addition, my fiancé is older than me and he has kids. He frequently tells me about his adventures all over the country and all of the experiences he's had. Due to my social awkwardness, I've never even been to a party. He makes me feel like such a loser compared to him. I have dreams of traveling too, but I know I'll never get there. I'm writing because I'm wondering if there's anyone else who feels like they've missed out on college and high school? And how do you cope with unrequited dreams and desires? How does one accept their life as it is?

I despise the language, I hated High School and I don't have any real friends. You might be wondering why?

First of all I HATE not being able to express my self in Dutch, because i don't know the right word or the pronounciation. Since they have a different word for everything.

Second it's fucking hard to learn, and it still is after 7 years here. I'm fluent in 3 other languages and none are this hard, Dutch is a mix of German, French and English, and their grammar is a fucking mess.

Third not being able to talk to girls, because how easy it is to humiliate myself infront of them. If I pronounce something wrong i get judged instantly.

Fourth, the namecalling. I love it. Refugee,Black Cunt,Asylum seeker,Filthy Outsider and the list goes on and on and on. (And I'm not even Black I'm like 1 tone darker then other people here.)

Since I didn't have any friends to hang out with I never left my home, to pass time I played a shit ton of video games and worked on getting real fit. Even though I look real fit I never had a girlfriend and never went out. I don't live in any big city like Amsterdam (Thank God) so you don't really have anything to do where i live.

240,"My boyfriend works as a security alarm installer. He's healthy, I make homemade meals as often as I can, and I help around the house to make sure getting to work is easy for him. Most days he has to drive far away. Our entire relationship (5 years), he has always had similar jobs. In previous jobs, he would get too sick or exhausted from either the labor, or the driving, or both, to go to work, and call in once every 2 weeks (or more). He wasn't ""fired"" from those jobs, but they ""didn't have enough work for him anymore"", and he has had to find about 5 different jobs since we first started dating.

I thought his current job was going a little differently, as this seems to be the first one that doesn't overwork him, considering he still has sick days left. However, as of today he has one sick day left, and they weren't happy about him calling in. I am worried that he will never stop getting sick beyond his allowed sick days, and that he will have to find new jobs over and over again with large breaks in income between them for the rest of our lives.

I've talked to him about it. He doesn't have a college degree, and doesn't have good credit (and now I don't either, although I did at the start of the relationship). It would be a lot of money, time and work (that we don't have) for him to go back to school. He isn't qualified for any other type of job that will pay enough to survive, and he can't keep doing hard labor and driving long distances forever. He needs to work for himself, choosing his hours and where he works, doing something other than hard labor. 

He is good at anything creative and crafty, like art, music, woodcarving, glassblowing, etc. We always arrive at this conclusion: he needs to be selling his art. We don't have enough money to start his own business yet. He would have to save a lot of money first. However, because he keeps loosing the jobs he is trying to save money from, all that money has to go to bills until he finds another one. We keep starting over and never getting any closer to this goal because of his lapses in work. All I can think of doing is finding ways to save more money.

What the hell am I doing? What should I do, what can I even do? Should I be doing something more to help with his job? Should I not be putting myself through this anymore? I feel hopeless.",06Jul2018,0

244,"Throwaway account. For context, I'm 16.

A few weeks back, there was a big concert in my area. My mom is part of a Facebook group for fans of this band, the page having over 40,000 members. About a week before the concert, she posted on it saying anyone going to the concert was welcome to stay at our house for the night, against my Dad and I saying we were uncomfortable having strangers staying the night in our  house. 3 people replied saying they'd come. 2 showed up after the concert with no problems. We chilled out with them and they were super chill, one of them working in the field I hope to go into I talked with them a bit.  The third person is where things get sketchy. Before the concert started, she had texted my Mom offering her free drugs, not sure what. My Mom turned them down. That was the first red flag.

 Anyways, it was midnight at my house, 2 hours after the concert had ended. My house is 20 minutes away from where it was. The third person had been texting my Mom for a while at this point saying she couldn't find our house but was still looking. My house is in a suburban neighborhood. If you have a phone, you can find it. My mom told her she would leave the front door unlocked for her for when she found it, and that she was going to sleep. Second red flag.

Next morning, we woke up. No sign of the third person having been there, the other two had left and made up their beds and left a nice thank you note. My Mom had gotten a text from the third person saying she had been driving around our neighborhood but couldn't find our house. She said not to worry, because she ""found a place to stay."" Around 10:30, I heard my Mom yelling down from upstairs after she had showered, yelling ""Where the fuck did all of my underwear go?"". It soon became apparent that every single pair of her underwear was no where to be found. Somehow things didn't click yet, even with this being the third red flag. You should see where this is going. 

Over the past few weeks, we've had instances of missing food. Most notable of these instances was there being a box of 10 brownies. My brother eating 1, my Dad eating 2, and my Mom eating 1. (I don't eat any of these things I'm about to mention, I'm vegan) The other 6 brownies were no where to be seen, sparking an argument among them of who wasn't fessing up to eating the rest of the brownies. There have been 4 more memorable instances of things like this, only with chocolate things, happening in the past few weeks. We all assumed someone was counting what they ate correctly. This should have been a fourth red flag. 

Yesterday and this morning is when this all came full circle to me. Yesterday, all of my Moms missing underwear apparently turned up in her dresser, which was super sketchy. This morning, I woke up to the sounds of my Dad working on our roof. It was 9:00. My Dad had left for work at 7:30. As soon as I realized the time, all of this just clicked in my head. **I believe the third person has been living in our attic for the past few weeks.** 

What are your thoughts? Am I just paranoid, or is there good reason for me to believe this? Should I compile all of this evidence and show it to my parents, so they can realize this also? I leave for a week on Sunday, and I couldn't be happier to not have to be in this house. ",06Jul2018,1
245,"Hi everyone!

So I'm 16 and my parents divorced a long while ago, so I live with my mom. My grandma lives with us and I love her so much but we constantly fight and there's always some kind of issue. I know that I'm not a perfect child either, but there's just certain things that she does that make me so upset.

First of all, I'm still treated like a little kid. I understand that she raised me and she can't get used to the fact that I'm older, but I have no chance to be independent at all. She always hovers over me and has to know what I'm doing at all times. When I sit down to eat she asks me whether I want certain foods nonstop. I can't have any silence while eating because it's constantly ""do you want more salad? Do you want more cheese?"" Then after poiltely declining for the 20th time I start getting frustrated and then she gets really upset when I snap at her and I feel terrible too.

I also have absolutely no privacy in the house. I tell her that I can clean my own room, but while I'm at school she cleans it for me and then says that I'm lazy because I never clean my room. I love painting and art, so in the unfinished basement I have a small studio-like space set up and it's naturally very messy because there's paint everywhere. She bugs me to clean the space because the mess ""annoys her"" even though really no one but me even goes in the basement. When I tell her that, she always says that it's her house so she can have things the way she wants them to be. 

She also never listens to me if I tell her that I don't like something. Every day when I come home from school, literally as soon as I step over the doorstep she starts firing away a load of questions like ""did you eat at school? Did you get any tests back? What did you do at school today?"" I've told her many times, calmly, that I'm tired when I come home because social interaction drains all my energy,  I don't want to talk to anyone as soon as I get home, but as soon as I have some time to relax and unwind I'll come downstairs and tell her everything. She never listens to me though, and every day it's the exact same story and I just get so upset and frustrated that I'm voicing my concerns nicely but no one seems to hear me or care.

I know that she does these things because she loves me and cares for me so much but I really don't know what to do because she never seems to listen to what I have to say. Sometimes I get so frustrated that I yell at her and then I immediately regret it because I see how much it hurts her but I just can't control myself at that point. I'd really appreciate any advice you can give me because I'm just so lost and upset all the time. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this (sorry I know it's a lot) ❤

TL,DR: I live with my grandma and she doesn't give me any sort of personal space, independence, or privacy. She doesn't listen when I voice my concerns and that results in me getting upset and yelling, which in turn upsets her. I have no idea what to do and how to resolve this.",06Jul2018,1

249,"TLDR at bottom.

I live in a pretty big house with a couple roommates, and unfortunately over time I've realized one of them seems to have a complete lack of regard for anyone else's stuff.

Before they moved in there was an untold replace what you use policy at the house.  If one of us wanted another of my other roommates sodas, beer, poptart, etc we just took it and the next time we went to the store we'd buy another pack.  Maybe have one or two from that pack, but always save enough to replace what we took, usually with a little extra.

Then new roommate moves in, and just uses everything in the house without replacing.  So the untold policy became a told policy.  Then we had to upgrade the policy to replace the stuff you used with the same thing, and not the cheapest off brand you can buy.  Then we had to bring up not using all of what you bought as a replacement before the person who originally bought it got to use any.  Then we moved on to the ""just use your own shit"" rule.

He has also broken several items of mine ranging from $100-300 just due to sheer lack of self awareness, and not paying attention to his environment.  

Their have been issues with using electronics I have downstairs as well.  I have a set of speakers I like to keep hooked up to an Echo for spotify usage.  The chord to the Echo was constantly being used as a phone charger for them and their friends, and after addressing the issue the chord disappeared completely.  I have also been unable to use my speakers without resetting them every time because they will never desync from them.  I also have an older, but still nice, TV downstairs.  I spent a lot of money on the TV a few years back, but unfortunately the speakers have been losing quality lately due to the roommate blasting the volume constantly.  I've addressed this and the other usage of my stuff multiple times, and nothing has been done.

Finally I said enough.  I set new, somewhat strict boundaries, for the usage of my property, and informed everyone that if it's not followed I will be moving all my shit to my room or the basement for storage.  However, due to past boundaries constantly being pushed or ignored I doubt that will happen.  I feel like I need to address his lack of regard for other people's stuff instead of just setting new boundaries.  I don't know how to go about that tactfully though.  At the end of the day I still have to live with this person for a few more months.  So I can't just tell them to fuck off.  How do I address this properly .

TLDR:  Roommate seems to have a complete lack of respect for other people's property.  Constantly pushes boundaries, breaks things, uses stuff without asking, etc. I feel like I need to address the behavior and not just set new rules for my shit, but still have to live with them.",06Jul2018,1

Well I’ve been noticing at work she’s been ending her treatments way too early, like I’m talking 5, 10 mins early. And I’m not the only one who notices. All the other massage therapists notice too. So the other day, when it was just her and I in the break room, I casually mentioned to her “Hey, I’ve noticed you’re ending your treatments early. I just wanted to make sure that you’re going to the top of the hour.”  Was very kind, and very non confrontational about it. And then, she clapped back at me. “They wanted to end their treatments early.” She said. And while we were in the middle of this convo, another coworker comes into the back room. 


Fast forward to yesterday. I get pulled into the office at work — no one wants to be pulled into the office. Anyways, this girl had told my boss that I was rude, snippy, and waited until everyone was in the backroom to tell have that convo with her. Which was not true at all. So I got in trouble. Even after I tried to say my side of the story, that didn’t matter. She still took the new girls side. Even when I brought up the whole, ending the treatments early. “When a client complains about it, then we’ll deal with it” she said. 



The coworker who walked in during that convo offered to vouch for me, but I said no. None of us even like this new girl — she has no filter, is nosey, and is now a tattletale. Think “annoying childhood friend” meme. (To sun her up.)


I’m down right offended. I was doing my job, and got in trouble for doing so. This isn’t the first time boss lady hasn’t taken my side. I’ve had the occasional difficult client,  dealt with it the best way I can, all while being my pleasant self, but my word isn’t good enough against someone else’s.



So, should I call my boss out on it? Or let it slide?

259,"So last summer I got caught on a DUI, that I got off of mainly because I had a sympathetic judge. I had to pay thousands of dollars in lawyer fees, and had my license revoked. 

The state DMV sent me a notice in the mail after 6 months, informing me that I can get my license reinstated if I pay $100 at the county courthouse. I did that, and the lady at the accounts receivable counter typed and said that I would have to wait 48 hours for the reinstatement process to be completed. 

More than 48 hours passed, it was a week before I heard anything. A day later, and I get a call from the DMV informing me that my reinstatement process has been “obstructed” due to my CDL license which wasn’t up for reinstatement for an entire year later. I asked why they didn’t say anything earlier, and the lady replies “we just assumed you wanted to wait it out for your CDL” then she later admits that my regular “class O” license has been up for reinstatement for 2 months now. 

I asked the lady how stupid her and her workers could be, and I followed up by demanding my regular drivers license, which is the license up for reinstatement. I’m not a conspiracy theorist, or anything, but it’s a tad bit odd that the DMV made me restart the entire reinstatement process, and threw in the fact that I had to retake a driver’s test. Got all that done and had to wait on the license to be mailed in, it took two weeks.

So I checked the state’s DMV search registry for my name, and my name came back as: 

Name: u/KingSpilly 
Age: old enough (not comfortable showing my age)
DoB: old enough 
License status: Active (meaning it’s no longer suspended) 

So, during this time frame, I had work to do, which involves driving, I was taking a rural highway to get to my destination and ran into a traffic stop with the state DoT (I had a trailer, so they had every reason to pull me over). They asked for my license when I got pulled over, I explained that I’ve just been reinstated, expecting a simple “don’t do it again”, instead the officer went to his computer after telling him who I was. 

He goes back to his police truck, and types away at the computer, and comes back a while later, and tells me that I have a suspended license yet. I got a citation, and was required to appear in court. 

Before appearing in court, I call the DMV asking why I was told I’m still driving on a suspended license. The lady on the other end just goes “oh.. yea.. our computers have been crashing, and we haven’t relayed that information anywhere else. If you refer to the DMV’s search bar, you’ll find your license status, and that’s official.” 

I show up to court, and I was told by the state prosecutor that I’m facing 3-6 months in jail, and fines. I tried to plead my case, but the prosecutor just replied in a snobby manner “this isn’t the time to do this! We just want to know how you’ll plea”, so I looked at her, and said “makes no sense for me to plea guilty on your screw up, so ‘not guilty’”. 

I immediately turned around and went to my attorney’s office, by the time of my court appearance, I had since gotten my actual drivers license back. I talked to my attorney, and explained everything, he wanted to see the documentation relevant to my license reinstatement, all the proof that the state messed up on their end is there. 

Fast forward to today, I talked with my attorney ahead of the court date, and he said that I’m only looking at anywhere between $100-$200 for a fine. The attorney informed me that the prosecutors are tossing the case, but want to still tag me with a “failure to provide identification”, which I don’t need a court date for unless I challenge. The officer who pulled me over was present, and ran me off the infraction, and went through the bells and whistles of a regular traffic stop. The officer highlighted the optional court date, all I said was “see your ass there”, and checked the box. Clearly not thinking, as I was livid about this whole situation. The officer replies “please watch the language, sir” I just replied “free-fucking-speech”. The officer just states “ok you’ll have to leave, because you’re getting disorderly”. 

 I got to thinking later on, I’ve been ran around the ringer with this entire reinstatement process, and I’m essentially paying for the state’s screw up. I have half a notion to challenge this fine. I’ve given way to much money away to the state than I’d like. Either that, or I could just rest them by formally stating that I’m not going to comply with the state. 

I’m so mad about this deal, I’m so tired of having to “roll with the punches”. I don’t know what to do. Maybe I’ll move to a different state.

He was only supposed to be gone for one week, but ended up adding another week onto it. Which is like okay dude I get it, shit came up and it was out of his control. But I'm not getting paid to watch his dog, although his dog is very sweet. Then once he got his dog back he said he had to leave again in like a month so if we wanted to we could watch him, my mom agreed WITHOUT asking if I would do it. Because she is not the one who takes care of said dog, she's at work. I'm at home all day taking care of the dog. And I'm honestly not even in a position to say no because she never gives me a chance to. If I even grieve about it a little bit she looks at me like I'm some evil monster for not wanting to take care of someone else's dog 24 hours a day, WITHOUT a choice. 
The day that we're supposed to get the dog he never tells us when hes going to drop him off he just shows up. So anything I have planned to do that day I can't ever do because I'm sitting around waiting for him to show up.

264,"So, for background, I've been dealing with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks for about a year and a half, constantly. I'm the type who keeps everything in, but I never really knew it until a meltdown in my last year of high school that led to a major - extremely unpleasant - self discovery: I was not okay.

I had a lot of struggles growing up, which not many people know about, but it didn't matter, because I was genuinely fine - I didn't let it affect me. Little did I know I had more issues than I could count, and they all fell on me at once.

Due to a terrible event that happened around that time, and after a failed attempt to hurt myself, I thought, ""things could be worse. I was fine for 17 years, I'll be fine again."" And I was - until my third year of university when everything came back full force and led to a series of unfortunate events in many different aspects of my life.

I've been working with my doctors to remedy this for over a year now, and I thought I was just getting back on track with a new medication. But then Daisy died.

Spoiler alert: one of my biggest issues is trying to be good enough, but constantly feeling like I'm failing, and hurting everyone around me in the process. Yay!

So, some woman found a squirrel and put it in a bag. She approached me at around 10pm at night and said she was going to leave the squirrel outside in the bag if no one would take it. I don't know who she thought would take it at 10pm, but I ended up taking her. She was a baby who was found in the road, so I had to feed her formula at first. I took her outside and tried to teach her how to climb trees - not that she needed it, because it's just in her and she took to it easily. Finally, it was time to let her go. It was kind of difficult, but I felt like I had done my job.

That was until 2 days later, when she came back. I had put out some food for her to eat, but there are other squirrels around too, and when she found me I took her inside to eat and drink some water, which she took happily. I decided the wild might not be the best place for her anymore. She might not make it, so I bought her a really big cage and put really big branches in it for climbing, and I started feeding her the appropriate solid foods (a lot of research went into all of this).

She made my condition a bit better, and she took to my dog really well, they even played a bit when Daisy had the energy - she was ridiculously energetic but then had big pauses of lazy. She woke up in the middle of the night multiple times and struggled to get out of her cage, which is when I would just let her out and she would snuggle into my neck and sleep and we would all get up when we were ready.

Yesterday morning I tried to wake her up, but she was cold. She was sprawled out and I don't know what happened, but I broke out into terribly obnoxious sobs for about an hour. I couldn't touch her, I had to get my mother to deal with it, so I just sat in the bathroom and waiting, sobbing.

I don't know how to cope with this strangely large hole left behind, and the loop in my head saying, ""she died in her cage alone,"" ""you couldn't help her,"" ""she loved you and you weren't there.""

I have random moments of crying and shaking uncontrollably - kinda like now, though it's less random. I don't know how to cope with this and I don't really have time to - I have school (yes, summer school) and two jobs, currently. Missing these things just gives me more anxiety and pushes me down further, so I just went along with my life yesterday and today, hiding in the bathrooms when I had a moment to have a mental breakdown. Thankfully, no one noticed - it's a lost art that I have mastered.

If anyone has advice on how I should deal with things right now it would probably help, because I'm at a loss.

tl;dr I have a lot of issues, found a squirrel, Daisy, tried to take care of her and failed.",06Jul2018,3
265,"Hello there!
I don’t often post on reddit but here goes nothing, right?
I think I may have some kind of eating disorder, but I have no idea how to identify it. 
Here is a bit about me first:
- I’m a 20 year old female 
- I am an identical twin and was born very slender 

Basically, for the last seven or eight months now I’ve been having a really bad problem. I’m not sure how it evolved, but basically after having fallen sick I developed this really bad fear of throwing up. Originally it was just because I often got heart burn after taking my medication, but the fear grew. I stopped smoking cigarettes (probably for the better, hey?) and stopped drinking alcohol completely due to this irrational fear, but it’s only gotten worse. 
At one point, I was so worried about throwing up that I didn’t eat. I was worried that anything I ate might be a cause for throwing off. This resulted in me eating - no joke - a couple of chips or a slice of bread a day.  To me, the grumbling of my stomach was a good thing because it meant I had nothing to throw up. Obviously this diet caused ALOT of weight loss, and so I went from being slender to looking anorexic. No hate for anyone suffering from anorexia - it is a real problem and I can’t imagine how hard it would be for anyone going through it. But, yeah. I am certain this isn’t anorexia, but given my thin state I am constantly asked about it regardless. 
I’ll admit I’ve gotten a little better over the past few months. I’ve been eating a little more, however I only ever eat one meal a day still (dinner) because I worry that I’ll get too full otherwise. 
Please help me out here! I’d appreciate advice, feedback, the works. If you have any ideas on where else I might be able to post this that would be greatly appreciated too. 
Take care everyone xx

266,"My sister in law (24) and I have known each other for 7 years. We have been off an on with friendships ranging from not speaking to good friends. I am 99% sure she is bipolar or has borderline personality disorder, but is undiagnosed and doesn’t want to get help.

I’m not going to write a novel but her issues go beyond mental illness and there is no excusing the things she has done. 

- stolen money 
- never paid $600 back to me from December 2017. 
- cheated on husband 
- spent all of husbands paychecks while she refused to work 
- wants a divorce from husband because she has found a guy who will “provide”’for her 
- had affair with married man prior to being married
- has had sex for money 
- has said very hateful things to me, and others (truly despicable things, and I am not a very sensitive person) 
- causes many problems for everyone around her
- constant negativity 
- constant lies 
- flips things to make herself seem like a victim 
- drug use (Roxie’s. She also smokes weed, which isn’t a big deal but she will blow her last dollar on weed)
- sold drugs 
- constantly talks badly about people behind their back, myself included 
- I could list more and more, but we’ll stop here. And I’m sure there is a lot more that I don’t even know. 

A common theme is obviously money. She is very obsessed with money and spends it like I’ve never seen before. 5+ credit cards, loans, etc. She is very reckless and impulsive with money, but also insanely greedy, at the same time won’t get a job. 

My problem is, recently she has done things that I just can’t get past. She has really ruined her soon to be ex husbands life. He is a good man and she has totally manipulated and emotionally abused him, she even got physical a few times. My husband and I witnessed it with our own eyes. She would say things like “you guys don’t know how stupid he really is” right in front of him. I am not friends with people like her and I have often made excuses because of the relation. But I’m done. My husband is also done, but has been over it and mainly just staying out of the drama for awhile. She thinks she’s a good person and we are all pieces of shit. 

Her parents are divorced and only her father is still somewhat on her “side” if you will. He is also a Narcissist so we figure that it’s easier for him to be like that because he just doesn’t want to hear the full truth about her because it would reflect negatively on him. 

She has always been like this but as we have gotten older it’s becoming worse and just more unacceptable because we aren’t teenagers anymore. Someone has always bailed her out of her messes and covered up for her so she’s never had to properly deal with consequences. It’s so frustrating to watch. 

Last week she cussed me out on the phone because I told her what she was doing to her husband is wrong. I was trying to help her because I have been around for many mistakes she has made before, which she admits are mistakes. She said absolutely horrible things to me and it really upset me. She told me to fuck off, I’m a shit friend, she doesn’t want me in her life, leave her alone, and hung up on me. I’ve decided I am done with her. I absolutely do not want her in my life from here on out. 

My question is- What would you do? Would you stick through this and try and support her? Or would you detach yourself from this person who is constant drama and negativity? And most importantly, how do you detach yourself from an in-law? I’ve never known anyone who behaves like this. 
-we live in the same town and spend time with family often.

I realize this was mostly a vent session but just let me know if you’ve been in a similar spot, or anything you see from an outsiders perspective because all of it makes me sick and hurts my head when I think about it all. 

TL;DR:

My sister in law is a pretty awful person and after 7 years of dealing with it I just want to be done with her. How do you distance/detach yourself from a person like her? It has taken an emotional toll on me and I realized if I cut her out of my life I will be happier. ",06Jul2018,2

272,"First of all, thank you to everyone for reading and considering my situation.

Short version: 

- Indian nationality, holds a 3-year Bachelor's degree in psychology
- Looking for a Master's degree in Psychology (non-specialized, Clinical Psychology or Applied Psychology) in Europe
- taught in English
- maximum of 8000€ tuition fees but even that number might be out of our league
- (ideally accepts applications for the Summer semester as well since we are most likely too late for a start in October)
- is an above-average but not outstanding student

Long version:

My friend is of Indian nationality and comes from a strict, conservative cultural background. She is not allowed to travel or do pretty much anything on her own. She is to be forcefully married to a stranger in some years, sooner if she stays in India. 
If she does not oblige, her health or even her life is threatened by her family. She can't leave because in her family's culture, obeying her parents is one of the most important duties in the world.

After months of convincing, her parents softened up to the idea of her studying in Europe as long as they don't have to pay extra money and as long as she knows someone near her location to help her out (which she does). 

I am a German citizen and met this outstanding person while travelling in India. She is a bright, cheerful person, a free thinker and a fighter, but also loyal to her family (so requesting asylum is out of the question unfortunately), partly because she has never been to another country and doesn't feel safe ""betraying"" her parents.

Studying in Europe would mean some years of respite from the constant supervision, threats and pressure coming from her family but might also mean that she can start a life here and leave the social injustices of her home behind. It has been her biggest dream for many years.

After doing a metric ton of reading over the past months, we gathered a lot of information but came upon some struggles, namely that the assumed costs of studying in EU (I told her it was free or cheap) are vastly higher for non-EU students, namely ~15000€ rather than 2000€ to study in the Netherlands, for example. 

We have looked into other universities like Oslo, Norway or Bergamo, Italy but the application procedure is very complicated and they only accept applications for the Winter semester. Since we missed the deadline for the 2018/2019 year, waiting another year could mean that she has to marry and won't be allowed to leave the country anymore. 

A loan would be impossible for her to pay back incase she has to go back to India and work there, so that is not an option either.

So what we are looking for: 
1. Universities with psychology Master's programmes in English that accept applications for the 2018/2019 year OR for the 2019 Summer semester
2. Programmes without tuition fees.
3. Ways to reduce the tuition fees (discounts or qualifying for the tuition fees that EU-citizens pay 
4. find suitable scholarships (again, she is not a top5-10% student which reduces our chances)

Thank you very much for your time and your consideration, hopefully we will be able to find some advice on how to make our dream happen. ",06Jul2018,1
273,"Long story short, they’ve been together for about 5 or 6 years and my dads girlfriend is always up my sisters crack about everything and anything. It’s pretty typical evil step mother behavior, in my opinion.

The thing is though, they’re not married and I honestly feel like she’s stepping TOO far over boundaries and I honestly think it’s gone to the point where it’s emotionally damaging.

I’ll explain, a few years ago my sister actually accused my moms bf of abusing her because the dads girlfriend pushed her so far into explaining why she was “sad.” My sister was 6, and was just having a bad day. According to everyone involved the guy never hit my sister, the situation where she described couldn’t have happened. My sister later admitted to me privately it’s because my dads girlfriend kept accusing her of being upset and threatened to ground her if she didn’t tell her why she was upset. So she concocted a story where he beat her. It broke her up pretty bad. 

Later, my mom asked me to put wash out pink hair dye in my sisters hair. She didn’t ask my dad but when he found out he shrugged it off. She’s 11, it was barely noticeable and washed out. He didn’t care. Dads girlfriend brought my sister to a hair salon and had it chemically stripped from her hair and grounded her. It wasn’t even her place.

Lastly, and most recently my mom bought a phone for my sister, still 11. My dads gf didn’t like it, stole it then said it got lost. She actually broke it. Now just a few days ago my sister bought her own phone to contact my parents (and let’s be honest it was probably for some silly sense of entitlement) and my mom was going to monitor it and my dads girlfriend again took it from her. When my other sister, a 17 year old, told another person about the incident the dads gf texted her telling her to mind her own business and if she continues to talk about it with others she’s going to smash the phone.

Now, this kinda just seems like simple shitty step mother behavior, I don’t know I’ve never had one before but my sister shows suicidal tendencies and problems with control. My dads gf micromanages her whole life, and she isn’t even allowed to express her feelings without being attacked and dissected. My dads a drunk and while he doesn’t outright let his gf do it to my sisters she’s also really abusive to him and will threaten to leave him if he pisses her off (she’s 30, he’s like 56)

I really wanna call the cops on her just to scare her, because I hate what she’s doing to my sisters. My older sister who’s 17 has a really cold personality from undergoing the same treatment, and she’s currently in an abusive relationship. My younger sister is much more sensitive and delicate minded than my 17 year old so I’m really scared for her.

TLDR: My dads gf thinks she has more authority over my sister than even my own mother and is ruthlessly controlling every aspect of her life. She’s suicidal and always on an emotional edge and she’s only 11. I want to call the cops but I don’t know what to do.",06Jul2018,2

I've known about the move for some time now, but every time I turn my head I'm blindsided by how much closer the move-in date is. My worst fear is going to bed the night before and having it ""hit me,"" then turning into a shaky, sensitive mope of a human being for the next year while I adjust to my new situation. On the other hand, I don't want to brood too much on the upcoming change and have it ruin the time I have left. What kind of \*strategies\* can I use to cope?

Hey there! My name's Liam, I'm 17 and I live in Sweden, my life is great. I have two fantastic (divorced) parents, amazing, friendly and supportive friends and I'm studying at a senior high that was nominated to be the best highschool in Sweden. And all of this is lovely and I'm so thankfull for everything I have and the opportunities this gives me, however.  


Ever since summer break started, I've lost touch with what I used to find interesting, I'm a gamer at heart but playing games hasn't really done much for me the past few months. Hasn't been enjoyable, and I've tried doing other stuff. I bought a guitar only to give that up with sore fingers a few weeks afterwards, I've tried going out with friends but that only led to me feeling exhausted the day after with no want to do it again.   
It just feels like whatever I do, or used to do and enjoy has gotten the soul sucked out of it, and I'm really struggling to find new interests or revive that spark that used to make me happy in my previous ones. Any advice?

281,"My girlfriend is serving and floor managing at a very successful restaurant. She absolutely loves the staff she works with and the job is very rewarding for her. I am thrilled for her. She has taken her fair share of time and trouble to get where she is at in life and it is finally her time to shine. I am so proud of her for her fight and strength.
I recently got a job as an animal control dispatcher. The job can be really tough but it can also be incredibly rewarding for me. It isn't what I want to do forever, but with this job I have the opportunity to work anywhere in the humane society. My only issue with the job is that I don't make enough money to save anything and I'm trying to buy myself a car. Between fixing my currently schedule to allow for another job and actually finding another job I'm struggling. The stress of it all is starting to seep into other parts of my life.
My girlfriend talks about work all the time and how much fun she has and how much money she makes. I'm glad that she's excited about it and wants to share but it's hard to hear how much she makes every night while I'm struggling with my own income. It's also frustrating because I feel like I can't share my work stories with her because a lot of times they're stories about how animals are being mistreated and it's understandably hard for her to listen to, but that's beside the point, I'm just venting now.
How can I politely ask her to stop sharing with me how much money she makes? Hearing that she brings home anywhere from $100 to $250 a night when she serves while I'm making just over minimum wage to listen to the cruel ignorance of people is hard to say the least. I'm becoming slightly bitter toward her and I know that's not healthy.",06Jul2018,1
282,"So I was sitting at a bar with my friends catching up and what not because we all lead pretty busy lifestyles and we only really meet up once every month or so. I was asked if I was going to the wedding, and I responded with who's wedding and if everybody else got an invite. My friends were in shock, and a bit perturbed by the situation after they had found out that I wasn't invited to the wedding. Honestly, I won't lie, I was really upset, and I didn't know what to make of the whole situation. We are from the same friend group of a long time. This said friends wedding is coming up in the next few weeks, and I got a call yesterday by that friend who was 'sincerely apologetic' that he forgot to include my name is the list for the wedding and that it was an honest mistake. He later proceeded to tell me that I will have a seat at the wedding and that he would love if I could make it. It took the mediation of another friend for said friend to 'realize' that I wasn't invited, and honestly, I never asked that friend to mention it to him that I never got an invitation. I would have been okay with it if it was just never brought up instead, but now I am stuck in this self-respect dilemma, and I am wondering if I should even make an appearance at the wedding because it is not hard at all to send an invitation out to a friend if you really would like them there on your special day. The size of this friend group is around 10 people, made up of people of all ages. 

I need some advice on what I should do since it took another friends interjection for said friend to call me and invite me a week before the wedding, when everybody else in the group received a formal invitation months ago. I really am having a hard time figuring out if the 'invitation' call was sincere, or something out of guilt or pity. Help me out guys!",06Jul2018,2
283,"Hi all, first time posting here x

So brief background info-
My ex-girlfriend and I were together for about  three years, from when I was 17 until just 20 y/o. We broke up in February this year as I wasn’t happy, I work away a lot, she was busy at university, I’m in the Navy so there was distance, I wasn’t treated too well near the end and ultimately at the end I wasn’t happy. We did have a great relationship while it lasted though. The breakup was pretty rough, she threw my stuff at me and kicked me out instantly, we didn’t speak for weeks and then we caught up and spoke about the breakup as we both wanted some closure. During this time she’d ask for me back, text regularly and ask to sort things out but I didn’t have any of it, she even messaged me on Valentine’s Day saying “happy valentines baby” when we weren’t together.

But then as the weeks went by we started becoming a bit friendlier to each other and would laugh about arguments and dumb stuff we did in our past relationship and things were sound.

Then about the beginning of May we had a call where we talked about what we’ve been up to and caught up. She was really emphasising that we be good friends again which I was kind of ok with.

But then the call went a bit weird, we spoke about dates we’ve been on with other people, sex with other people and about our past sex life. This conversation eventually rolled into us planning on having sex again, she was coming back to town for the weekend.

I was completely ok with this at the time but what she said has messed me up for the past couple months now and today was the first time I told someone, a friend at work.

She told me that when we sleep together I’ll have to be careful as she might freak out because she slept with this guy in the army based near where she studies and after a couple times he went rough and started punching her and smashing her head. She told me she had a swollen black eye, concussion and a split lip but was ok.

I couldn’t believe it, I was so angry, tried to moved on but I couldn’t, all week at work it was in my mind. I rung her mid week and told her that the hook up for the weekend was off. That was the last time I spoke to her.

Just after that week I met a girl and we’ve been dating ever since and she’s really nice and we have so much chemistry. I’m really happy with where I am, I’m seeing my friends so much more, work is going great and home life is good to.

But I still can’t get out this image of that guy fucking and beating my ex girlfriend, it makes my blood boil and my heart beats like a drum. I feel like I want to scream and cry, it’s an absolute rollercoaster of emotions and I don’t know what to do. I don’t love her anymore and I absolutely would never get back with her, but I can’t help but be angry about someone I used to care about so much and it’s really eating me up.

I don’t know what to do, I don’t know wether to talk to her but I don’t know where I’d start with what to say. Could anyone give me any advice or  an opinion? Do I talk to her? It’s been so long.

I just want to stop feeling this way.

Thank you",06Jul2018,1
284,"I (30/f) just quit my job after 4 years because I could no longer work comfortably at the company where I filed a sexual harassment report against my supervisor (50/m) 1 year ago. I'll try to keep it as short as possible. \*spoiler: I didn't keep it short!!!! 

I'm in the scientific research industry, and connected with my ex-supervisor because we shared similar research interested. I was able to do my master's at this company under his advisement (2 years), and they immediately employed me afterward. Roughly 1 year after I started as an employee, my boss asked me if I wanted to go to this really cool international conference in a country that's doing things in our field that have not been done here in the US. Of course I said yes! 

So, we went with another co-worker (who traveled separately and arrived 1 day after us), he made advances towards me the first night, embarrassed me in front of colleagues the remainder of the trip, and then the grand finale - took secret pictures of me. I later found out about the secret pictures because he accidentally showed them to my co-worker while showing her pictures of the trip. She was convinced he didn't mean to show her because he immediately turned red, look ashamed and swiped it away. 

I never intended on confronting him about his other inappropriate behavior during the conference because I loved my job, and the drama was not worth it and straight-up denying his advances in the beginning should have sent a clear message that I wasn't going to deal with his crap and WILL stand up for myself. I didn't want to, and I had ZERO to gain from filing a sexual harassment report on him (still don't!). So, fast forward to 1 week after we get back, and the co-worker finally tells me what she saw on his phone. 

Two days later, after I collected my thoughts, I confronted him in his office about the everything. I wrote everything down and went through it play-by-play for him. Then, I told him that I wasn't interested in going to *his* supervisor (which is what I was supposed to do according to the employee handbook) because I didn't want to jeopardize his job or position with the company. All I was interested in was that he stopped his inappropriate behavior and treat me in a professional manner. And, of course I wanted him to delete all the pictures. Obviously, all the pictures were all deleted already by the time I confronted him. He denied everything and proceeded to cry. Next day, he tells me he reported himself to HR and the supervisor. They file a report, and we worked together awkwardly ever after.

Okay - promise I'm almost done here. A couple weeks later, his wife comes into our lab where I've NEVER seen here because she works at the local medical university with bigger labs and better equipment. She says she's in to use one of our machines for a few days. Now, this is a woman that was also on my thesis committee, who was very friendly, kind and helpful to me during my time at the university. In the three days she was there, she made zero eye contact with me, and didn't speak to me at all. I knew that she knew something was up, but I didn't know what. Did he lie to her because he had to fess up in case he got fired? Did he tell her the truth and she is super embarrassed? If she was embarrassed, why did she come in at all? So, fast forward to this past March 2018 when I attended a conference to present my research, and my supervisor and his wife are there. She treats me the same, and he is aware that my presence makes her uncomfortable, yet he still tries to interact with me. I counted a total of 5 times he tried to interact with me that day, and one of those times she stood next to him and glared at him before he said, ""What? I had to support her; no one's looking at her poster.""  

Now, to make things less confusing, I saved this for last. Before I started working at the company, he and the other PI I mentioned had an affair together. I found out shortly after the sexual harassment was reported, but I didn't tell anyone. Two months ago, the president of the company and HR found out about their relationship and did nothing about it. Between that and how uncomfortable it is still working under the creep supervisor, I put in my two weeks notice a month ago. I'm moving forward and found a better paying job that I start on Monday, but I can't shake the feeling that his wife hates me and that bridge is burnt. I KNOW she doesn't know the whole truth. She definitely doesn't know he had an affair with another woman who he still works with, and at best, she knows a half-truth about my sexual harassment report. I say that if I were her, I would want to know and that's how I justify telling her everything in person. Another part of me, realizes that she could deep down inside know, but having been with him for 20+ years, she's probably in denial and doesn't want her life torn apart. Also, I know he sucks, but I can't help by try to see the good in people and don't want to wreck his life anymore than I already have either. Any advice would be appreciated. 

Optional addendum: The co-worker who had an affair with him went crazy after being dumped by bosscreep because bosscreep got married to his 20+ year partner DURING his affair with co-worker. THEN co-worker decides to spiteful get engaged to her long time friend and colleague, a widower 20 years her senior who looks JUST like bosscreep. I've often thought about telling the poor widower that his fiance sucks because she never told the guy about bosscreep, but I definitely know that's not my place at all. Just a crazy part of the story. 

Thanks for reading!

TL;DR Had to file a sexual harassment report against boss who was inappropriate with me and also had an affair with my co-worker; quit the job 1 year after because it was too unbearable to continue working under him; now that I'm not there anymore, I want to tell his wife what he's been up to because I know for sure she doesn't know. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks! ",06Jul2018,1
285,"Hello everybody!
I have a special situation in my sex life. I like to have sex and to try new things. My girlfriend, who i love a lot, has almost no interest in Sex and is pretty ""fragile""(this might also be only my point of view). This lead to my problem, that i don't want to try out kinky stuff with her, since i love her and cant imagine doing this things with her. So my dilemma is: should i just find someone who also wants to try different Sex related stuff and don't tell my girlfriend (I know that this is actually Not right) or just, lets say, be frustrated. I m also feared, that if i don't try everything out now, i will regret it when i m older and will try to fullfill my wishes later on, so that my Family would break apart.

290,"Alright, this has been an interesting, complicated journey, and I’m going to try to be as succinct as possible. 

I’ll start off with some background info first. Basically, I started working at an animal hospital  in August 2017. That’s when I met Macaila (not her real name). At first, we didn’t talk much, but as time went on, we started being somewhat flirty at work. I wasn’t sure if she was single or not, but was also too busy with work and personal stuff to find out. Around thanksgiving, a sign up sheet for the work Xmas party was posted and everyone was encouraged to bring a date. She signed up as a +1 and I later overheard her talking to another coworker that she’s on/off with the guy she’s bringing, so he’s kind of her bf. Since on/off relationships don’t last, I figured I could see if I had a chance. 

So, after the Xmas party, which she ended up not attending due to falling ill, I brought her a drink from Starbucks cause she had mentioned wanting to try to like coffee. From there, things picked up. We started messaging each other on FB, trying to learn more about each other, and we were both basically writing novels with our replies. This is when I started to have legitimate feelings for her. We then met up for a couple of drinks and had a good time, she also mentioned how her last bf was controlling. A few days after our date, she broke her ankle and that basically put everything on pause. We’d still message occasionally, but she never wanted to hang out. Plus, I was taking 17 hours of science classes, so I was getting destroyed by school. 

Once her leg finally healed (sometime in March 2018), she was down and excited to hang out. I got us tickets to some old anime film that was being shown in theaters in mid-April cause she loves Ghibli films and she was too excited for that. A couple of weeks before we saw the movie, we met up to smoke at her place. While I still kick myself for not making any moves, we had a good time. A few days after this, I called her and told her how I felt since I kept kicking myself for not making a move. Then, she said she had feelings for me too, but wasn’t ready to get into anything because of her last relationship. Little did I know her ex was basically stalking her. Anyways, we still went to the movie, even after she turned me down, and again, we had an awesome time. 

Unfortunately, I think shortly after we went to the movie, her ex started stalking her even more. A few days after going to the movie, She had said how excited she was for me to come back full-time once my semester ended cause she feels like I make her sane. When I was back full-time, it didn’t seem like she was really excited. She was bitchier than usual and didn’t really talk to me much, but still sent me a snap every couple of days. Then near the end of May, she deleted her social media accounts and I soon learned from a coworker that this was because her ex hacked into her accounts, although I kind of already figured this out. 

Anyways, due to being in quite a lot of debt and hoping to go to vet school in a year, I realized I needed to leave my job at Northridge (not the actual name of the animal hospital) since I gained plenty of experience and so I could get a job that actually pays decent and knock out as much debt as possible. When I told her I was leaving, she was sad and wish I wouldn’t leave. A couple of days later, she went to lunch with a coworker, Katie, who we are both close to. Later after lunch, Katie told me about how Macaila hates that I’m leaving because she likes me and thinks we’d be good together, but she doesn’t want to get me involved with her stalker ex. Katie also said that Macaila is so scared of her ex and too afraid to go to the cops cause he is blackmailing her. So a few days later, after seeing that Macaila had been obviously crying, I told her knew what was up because I was able to connect the dots. And later that night, I sent her a text saying I’m willing to help her by any means necessary and that having help is always good even when you don’t think it is. She ignored this text, and then my last few days at Northridge were quite awkward. 

So, this finally brings us to the main point of this post. Last weekend, about two weeks after I quit  Northridge, I got a friend request from her ex on both Facebook and Snapchat. I figured out who her ex was months ago and that was just by mere chance on FB. Nevertheless, I also received a text from Macaila that same night, which just said “Hey.”  I didn’t see any of this until the next morning. When I saw all this, I sent a text to Macaila and let her know her ex tried to add me. But when I sent the message, it was green, instead of the usual iMessage blue. After not hearing from her for a couple of days, I started to think that her ex hacked into her phone, sent me a text, and when I didn’t reply fast enough, he decided to just block me hoping Macaila would never find out. I’m thinking he also hacked into her FB account and read our messages, cause that’s the only way I can think he found out my SC username, which is how he added me on SC. 

Ignoring his FB friend request, I decided to accept his SC request to see if he would do anything. Within an hour of adding him, he asked me if I still work at Northridge. I played dumb and said, “Nope. And how do you know I worked at Northridge.” Like a day later, he replied, “I hear you have a thing for Macaila. I work in the Kennel.” Before I could send a reply saying yeah I’m into her, he deleted his SC. Obviously, this guy is a fucking idiot for thinking he could actually make me believe he works in the kennel.

So now, I’m not entirely sure what to do. I’m a bit pissed off that this guy is trying to look into me and that he has likely read all of my texts and FB messages to Macaila. Part of me wants to send him a message on FB to answer his question about my feelings for Macaila and mention that I don’t see why the fuck it would matter to him and if I want to pursue her, then only she or I will stop me from trying to be with her. Though Macaila didn’t want to get me involved, her ex decided to get me somewhat involved, and I know I could put an end to this cause I ain’t afraid of this dumbass pussy. However, another part of me thinks that maybe I should just wash my hands of the situation and move on. So Reddit, what do you think I should do?

I find her clothes in our washer/dryer, food in our fridge, she's there throughout the day when he and I are not, free to come and go as she pleases. At what point do I have grounds to make this an issue and demand she cough up for rent? I know he will argue that she's not inconveniencing me,and she ""cleans"" the kitchen from time to time, but I am paying for her to have amenities.

293,"So I realized my mother has left me with severe life ruining social anxiety. 

I grew up not being able to speak to her about anything, because she would always interpret what I was saying in the worst possible way. At the time I had extremely hard time trying to put words together due to autism, so basically when ever I spoke with her she'd get upset with me. And when she got upset she could hardly be reasoned with. I couldn't talk with my own mother in fear she would basically misinterpret what I said and then criticize me on something I didn't actually say. 

This has made my relationship with my friend more difficult, because I'd often become so stressed that I would say something wrong that I make people uncomfortable. This has ruined most if not all of my job interviews, and has made me jobless so I live on welfare. And often when I'm in a group I can hardly get myself to speak. I'm seeing a counselor currently, but I need more coping mechanisms for this. I want to be able to have a job so I'm not living on scraps, and so horribly lonely.

After Elle failed to answer the email inquiry I sent them, I decided to try logging in to website. To sign in, you need the user's email and the account number, which is printed on the magazine. I decided to try using my email to log in just for the heck of it, and IT LOGGED IN. Turns out this stranger not only signed up using my address, but he also used my EMAIL address! This isn't some random mistaken address like I thought earlier! Some guy named Tobias Deanne signed up for a 4 year subscription of Elle using my address AND email, and possible paid with my credit card as well!(you have make advance payment for Elle subscription).

301,"I'm 20 years old and I have a younger sister, who is 9 years younger than I am. For a long time, I've been pretty close with her and my twin brother, spending a lot of time together.

I went off to uni like 2 years ago and only see her like once a year. Last year, we were pretty tight and she actually cried when I left.

She never comes to hang out with me and my brother and when she does, she isn't too interested as she used to be. When I say, let's hang out, she says 'sure' but continues to use her phone. I'm little concerned as there are days now when we don't interact much. I mean, if we saw her everyday, I wouldn't mind much, but it's been like a year since I last saw her. When she comes home from school, she just goes straight to her phone.  I mean, I know she's growing up and to be fair, I do ask her a lot if the stuff she watches is appropriate, which I understand can annoy her(but protective brother).

303,"Hi everyone! I’m trying to wrap my head around my current situation and would appreciate any and all feedback. Thanks in advance!

I am thinking about leaving my job. I make a base salary of almost $100k USD, plus a bonus of up to 15% annually. I’m married and my wife makes about $60k. We’re doing well financially, but haven’t saved as much as we should have over the last few years (lots of travel, nice restaurants, etc.). We have zero debt, a cash cushion of about $10k, and a good-but-not-great retirement setup. We’re in our mid-30s and don’t have kids, fwiw.

I have a very good professional reputation and a nationwide network. A competitor of my current company is in the process of trying to poach me to work in a comparable role. I would say I’m even regarded as one of the top emerging talents in my industry on a national level (I’ve been a featured presenter at numerous high-profile events, quoted in influential trade publications, etc.).

I own a small business that I run on the side essentially as a hobby. It takes up too much of my time and hasn’t yet become profitable. It’s a niche product and I don’t know whether it will ever do much more than break even. It could theoretically grow into a profitable venture that generates $2-3k per month for me in income, but that’s probably at least a year off.

I’m thinking about quitting my current job, declining the impending offer from the competitor, and taking a much lower-prestige position that will only pay around $45k with meager benefits (basically just health/dental insurance). However, unlike my current job, this one would be low-stress and require zero extra hours - it’s the kind of job that shuts off completely when you clock out. You see, even though my performance looks great on paper, I really struggle to keep up at work. I’m stressed all the time, putting in extra hours on weekends and holidays to keep my head above water.

My plan is to take a low-stress year, try to coax my small startup into a more robust enterprise, work on writing a book, and prepare for a 6-month road trip in late 2019. I plan to get rid of my smartphone and reprioritize my health (I’ve gained 20 pounds over the last few years). My wife is on board. If things don’t work out, I can always look for a job that returns me to my present trajectory.

Honestly, all I really want to do is write and travel. I don’t want to climb the corporate ladder. However, I keep feeling like it’s idiotic to get off the path I’m on. I know most people would trade for my situation in a heartbeat. I have a strong desire to bet on my creative talents (writing, entrepreneurship), but to do so I’d have to willfully torch my safety net.

305,"Hey everyone!

I’m on mobile, so sorry for any formatting issues. 

I’ve recently been in the throes of an all out mailing fiasco, and at this point, I have no clue what to do. 

In March of this year, I was offered and accepted a teaching position at a private school in China. The process to get a visa is kind of ridiculous (anyone who has done this can vouch for me on that one), and it’s exacerbated by the fact that the Chinese Embassy doesn’t accept mail correspondence. 

To get a work permit (the document needed to apply for a visa), I had to get a number of documents authenticated. Because of my state of residence (TN), the Embassy in DC has jurisdiction. “Authentication” to the Chinese government means the document must be notarized, signed by the Secretary of State, signed by the US Department of State, and then authenticated at the Chinese Embassy. 

In order to avoid having to go to DC, I planned to have a friend take my documents to be embassy as my agent (which is allowed). This is where it gets a little weird. 

My friend (let’s call her Kate) is a student at American, and she is house sitting for an international student friend (let’s call her Jane) who is back in China for the summer. Kate did not know the proper address for mailing, and she has been simply addressing  things to Jane, and this hasn’t been a problem. 

So I addressed my package to Jane, and paid FedEx to overnight my package. It was apparently delivered and signed for on May 25. Kate checked the mailbox on the 26th, and the package was not there. I contacted the apartment complex, and I spoke to the manager who confirmed she signed for the package, and she told me they did not have it. 

I repeatedly called and nothing ever came of it. I eventually had to cut my losses and fly to DC myself after getting new documents to handle their authentications in person. 

I visited the apartment complex and spoke to a different manager, and it was still lost. I was encouraged to file a claim with Fedex because the complex maintains that they never received the package. 

I filed an official claim, and was eventually denied because they spoke with the driver and tracked the package with GPS and confirmed it was “correctly” delivered to the apartment complex. 

Now I’m at a loss for what to do. FedEx says that they have no liability, and the apartment complex is saying they have no responsibility either. I’m out $40 shipping, $120 in documents, and $45 in a money order that was in the package. This doesn’t include the flight to DC or the cost to get a new background check and get them through the process expedited. 

What do I do?

Tl;dr My package was delivered to an apartment complex, who insists the package is missing, and Fedex can’t do anything since the package is at the apartment complex somewhere. ",06Jul2018,2

308,"I’ve come to this sub reddit because I’ve found myself in a very complicated situation. I’m in love with one of my best friends. Me and her have been friends for almost 4 years now. We dated very briefly when we first met and it didn’t really work out but we’ve remained friends ever since. I ended up moving on and finding a girlfriend for a while and she also found a guy and everything was fine. We were happy for each other. Last Summer we found ourselves both single again (both going through pretty rough break ups) and we started spending almost every day together going on runs, going to the beach, watching movies, it was good. However, the more time I spent with her the more I started noticing things about her that I really like, not just her beauty but her great personality. That only went on for so long  until I reached my breaking point and told her how I felt. It was then that I found out that she had already been secretly seeing a rebound guy. I was heartbroken for awhile but agreed to keep being friends. Still spending every day together. Summer went on, her fling ended and on the last night before she left for college I tried to kiss her and she swerved it. I was so embarrassed I just told her good luck and drove home where I proceeded to drink away my sadness which lead to me drunk texting her ranting about how she lead me on. We didn’t talk for a long time after that because some of the things I said really hurt her. The next time I saw her was for a Halloween weekend she came to visit me and some friends the wounds were still quite fresh though. We ended up having a talk with each other where I apologized and she told me how hurt she was hearing the things I said come from her best friend. By the end of the night had made amends. Now here we are this Summer and it feels like history is repeating itself. We go on runs together everyday and at the beginning of the Summer it was just that but it’s progressively become more. We’ve been hanging out a lot again and I’m finding myself falling for her again. I can’t help myself I just love spending time with her. Anytime I’m able to make her smile I just feel a sensation like no other you know? Like nothing else in the world matters just making her happy. This brings us to the matter at hand. It’s painful as hell to be around her but after hurting her last year and as much as I like her I want to be as good a friend as possible and make her as happy as I can but all the while I know I’m not being honest with her or myself holding out hopes that one day she’ll realize how good we’d be together. I’ve been pretty damn depressed about it since the Summer began and every time we leave each other I find myself wondering when I can see her next. Should I just hold out until we have to part ways again for college? Should I be honest with her? I’m afraid this is going to be a re-occurring conundrum every time her and I reunite until the day she finds good guy and my heart shatters.

309,"Blah blah blah mobile blah blah bad formatting, sorry. Also throwaway. &lt;3

So my mom has always been my rock. Was always there for me, always did things for me, all that. GREAT mom, albeit overprotective. Like we have (had?) a great relationship. 

But my dad. Dear lord my dad. Growing up he was always very mean to me. As soon as my sister was born it seems (when I was 5), he didnt want anything to do with me. Told me endlessly to shut up, stop doing this, stop breathing so loud, go away, stop everything. Never showed any interest in me or what I liked or anything I did. Never went to any of my games, teacher conferences, anything. My mom was functionally a single mom with him lurking in the basement. He said little girls were to be seen and not heard. He was also mean to my sister but not nearly as bad. I'm not talking about ""kids are annoying sometimes mean"". I'm talking from the time I was 5, to about the age of 19 (when he was kicked out), he was AWFUL. I'll provide more examples if anyone cares.

When I graduated, he pouted the whole time because I invited his sister and mom. I felt obligated to, and he ruined my graduation because of it. Kept his sunglasses and hat on the whole time, which was embarrassing.

When I was headed to prom, he stayed downstairs the whole time, and decided he didnt want to see me off. 

When I got into my current relationship, he said he didnt care to meet him because ""he was only going to leave you anyway"" (we are still together and has only met him 4 or 5 times very briefly, after 7 YEARS.)

I have a TON more. I made a list with 45 bulletpoints of bullshit that he did to me.
The list goes on and on. 

But the main thing is that hes an alcoholic. He was always drunk when he was here, and when he got kicked out, it only got worse. I was ELATED when my mom finally kicked him out, and the following 2 years were the best of my life. The suicidal feeling I had because of the worthlessness he made me feel disappeared. (When I was 13, I was suicidal and wanted counseling because my dad made me so miserable. She said over her dead body, because it gets put on a record. This is important later.) I was never happier. He was drunk in a camper and as miserable as he made me, and I was okay with it. 

My mom was happy too. We were going to sell that house and move. My dad wouldnt know where we were. My mom would get a boyfriend eventually, who called me and my sister ""lovlies"" or something like that. and grilled out when I came to visit them. 


But a month ago, almost to the day, something changed. My dad mentioned going to rehab, and my mom did a 180. Dont get me wrong, if he went to rehab and shaped up, there would for sure another chance. 

So my mom and my dad started ""talking things out"". My mom blamed how he treated me on herself, saying she didnt give him enough attention, and he took it out on me. They talk for hours everyday, and she goes to see him at his camper. For awhile she said they were only talking things out and weren't close to any sort of relationship, but turns out she was lying because of something I had accidentally seen. They've been sleeping together, after a month of reconnecting.

When my mom told me they MIGHT eventually work it out, she said 2 things needed to happen. She said that one, he would have to stop drinking. And two, he would have to fix his relationship with me. Last week, we got into an argument, and I asked if he'd stopped drinking. She said no, and that he probably would always drink. Then I asked if he had fixed things with me in the month they had  been together, she said I was too stubborn and couldn't let things go, so it would never happen.  She then said maybe I should get some counseling because I needed to get over it. She said that I was going to make her lonely and miserable for the rest of her life, because I couldn't forgive him.

I dont know what to do. My mom has never ever been like this to me. Ever. Shes never been manipulative and lied to me. I dont know what to do and I dont understand what's going on.

So shes just going to do it anyway, even though he isn't going to rehab, and doesnt care about me. The only apology I ever got was ""I'm sorry I didnt know how to raise girls, but I provided for you"". He didnt have a job for a combined 10 years of my 21 year life. My mom provided for me. And took care of me.

I just dont know what to do",06Jul2018,1

318,"So I'm a bookseller, have been for about two years now. I know the ins and outs of the book world pretty well, which is surprisingly more complicated than a lot of people would expect. 

To no one's surprise, when I give birthday gifts its usually a book. I like to tailor the book to the person receiving it because its fun to read about a character that you can relate to. It can go two ways. They either love the book and cherish it, or they absolutely hate it and hate the character that reminds me of them.

The person I'm buying a birthday gift for is a ***very*** dear friend. I love him to pieces. He is 20, openly gay but has experience with women, deals with anxiety, is a huge ball of light and positive energy, and sadly he lost his mother to suicide at a young age. So the book I'm thinking about is called ***More Happy Than Not*** by Adam Silvera. Basically, a young man grieves after his father's suicide. His girlfriend is out of town, and he finds himself hanging around the new guy which his friend's aren't happy about. He ends up with feelings for the new guy and has to navigate how to go about that, and even considers a memory alteration therapy to forget about his feelings.

The book is written by an LGBT author (and has a wide LGBT audience) so I know it doesn't take a homophobic turn. What I'm worried about is that this book could open up all the scars he's had to heal. Sometimes that can be a good thing, to find someone who writes your truth and your struggle and knows what you've been through without knowing **you.** It could be comforting.

But I don't want to give him a book that could also send him down an emotional spiral and ultimately damage him. 

This book absolutely reflects him and his struggles he's been through, but I'm unsure if I should get it. It'd kind of feel like showing up to his birthday party with a mirror and a scrapbook full of his worst pictures.",06Jul2018,1

She knows he has a girlfriend but she doesn't seem to really care. The reason it bothers me so much is because there is a kid involved on her end and hes been around for about two years now. He lives in her moms house with her and her kid. 
I guess I'm not sure if I should do anything and if so how do I get in contact with her? Neither of them have social media and I dont have his girlfriends number or have any aquanteces with her.

My bf of 3,5 years told me he is unsure whether he loves me anymore. We had a long discussion (3 day long to be exact) and we agreed to give us another go. Altho I felt heartbroken and expressed my will to continue our relationship, I did not push him but rather wanted to know why he was feeling this way. He said he felt unburdened after our talks and we both felt like we covered everything and really went in deep. Days went by and he started saying how he now again feels strongly for me and feels like he must've been in such a confused state back then, and how he now feels very sure of us. I asked him not to say these things for feeling guilty or wanting to please me, and he confirmed that he would not do that to me. We even took some time apart while visiting our parents, just to miss each other. And when we did meet, he said to have missed me, and repeatedly told me that he loves me. 


Now still, I come home everyday unsure of his love, feeling that heartburn and uncertainty. Even more so as my parents seem to think that I'm being foolish for believing him. 


So my question is, should I trust him? I feel by doubting his feelings I might sabotage our recovery myself, and yet I can't shake this awful feeling of doubt and heartbreak. I love him, but I'm now more careful than ever

He is 23 years old now, he is from Paraguay and lives in Spain with his mother and a disabled sister a bit younger than him. 

The thing is that his mother is racist (wont let him have friends from here) and classist, so not being able to study something at university is not an option. After failing this year again, his mom bought a plane ticket to send him back to paraguay.

I'd say its because of my autism, but I'm not sure what counts as autism or not, and I'm an honorable person that doesn't like to use excuses; so maybe it has nothing to do with me having autism at all and I'm just a jerk.

Things got really bad for me.

My jerk toxic ex-online friend told me ""Hey, you remember your ex-girlfriend [idk what to call her here, I'll just call her ""Spongebob Squarepants"" to hide her identity]? Well she got in contact with me recently, and I told her that you drink beer and to stay the HELL away from you.""

So I messaged her on tumblr saying she doesn't have to respond to me but it'd be nice if she did on my birthday a few years ago. She did and I was so happy. I thought she wouldn't want to talk to me and that she didn't like me because things ended badly in the past.

So we were really really close friends on Tumblr. I asked her if I could write a doujin about Past Spongebob Squarepants and Past Me, and not show anyone except for her and it'd be optional for her to look at it, and she said that she was honored that I asked her first before making it and that I could.

I kept writing a LOT to her. I just wanted to be her skype or discord friend, since my ex-online toxic friend is her instant messenger buddy himself. Eventually she said there was too much to read and its hard to get to it all which is perfectly fine and natural.

Then on Twitter she started blocking me, when she made a tweet about her Discord and saying she's adding Discord friends and I kept asking her in twitter direct messages if she would add me on Discord. I went completly crazy insane at that point, asking her to please add me as a casual Discord friend. I thought we were really, REALLY close friends, so I messaged three of her twitter friends that I never talk to saying ""Hi random stranger, HOW CAN I GET CLOSER TO Spongebob Squarepants I NEEEEED to be closer to Spongebob Squarepants MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF, I really want to be her casual Discord friend, I am osbessed with it, pleaaaaase tell me how I can get closer to Spongebob Squarepants"" and her friends blocked me. I wish they didn't block me at the time, cuz I wanted to get to know them better the next day, since they're a friend of my close friend: Spongebob Squarepants.

I kept messaging her and sending her videos of myself and sent her a video of me hurting myself, and she kept blocking me. I wasn't sure why.

Then, I gambled. Maybe it was because she was waiting for the doujin about Past Spongebob Squarepants and Past Me that I asked her about, two years beforehand from this happening, on tumblr?

I asked her literally many times in the tumblr messages if a doujin means something sexual, saying I really hope it doesn't, but I watched an episode of the anime Gintama called ""How to hide your porn mags"" and it seemed like there were doujins in it, and I was getting confused. I asked a discord server what a doujin means, and one person said it means ""amateur porno story"" and someone else said a doujin means ""a hentai."" (I have a screenshot of them telling me that too.)

So I FORCED myself to watch a random porno on a porn site. I clicked on a random porn video and well I can't say what it is but it was a nasty, violant, abusive horrible video where a lady was crying and all this bad stuff was happening.

I wrote her a weird creepy violant sex story, telling her its based on the random porno I watched and that it scarred me for LIFE watching it but I FORCED myself to watch a porno to write the sex story about her and,

She posted a screenshot of it on Twitter.

She made fun of me saying to please not post it publicly and that it'd be out of context.

She didn't include the part of the message where I said that I HATED writing her the sex story about her, but I FORCED myself to watch a porno to write it for her even though I don't like sexual stuff and I absolutely hated writing that story that scarred me for life.

And there's a lot of screenshots on her twitter I found out recently, of private messages that I sent her on Tumblr.

Dude you don't understand maybe (or maybe you do, I shouldn't assume things) how bad this makes me feel. Now on her Public twitter account, there's out of context screenshots of private messages that I sent her on Tumblr, and she wrote a LOT on her twitter that I'm a stalker.

If she told me that she thought I was a stalker and wanted me to leave her alone forever earlier, I never would have done anything that I did. I wish she talked to me about her feelings instead of her twitter. She was literally posting screenshots of private messages I sent her on Tumblr that she never responded to, and she wrote the response on her twitter post (back when it was private and I couldn't view it at all.)

Now her Twitter is public, and because every time I vent about her without even mentioning her identity, her friends message me asking me to take it down so it feels like I'm being constantly stalked by her and her friends; I checked her twitter once it became public to see if there was anything doxxing about me (and honestly cuz I missed her but after seeing the screenshots I now accept that she hates me.) and that's when, two weeks ago, I saw the screenshots about me that she posted a year and two months ago.

Now people think I'm a creepy weirdo perverted stalker. I stopped messaging her a year and two months ago, when she finally told me how much I was bothering her. I wish she just told me that I was bothering her that much earlier, instead of posting screenshots of my private messages onto her twitter.

I vented about this on reddit before, and she posted on her twitter within twenty minutes that I went through her twitter and warning her friends to look out for me, and her girlfriend messaged me telling me that I'm the bad guy and a horrible person and that she wishes that I was dead and that she hates me and that they're both crying because of me. So I took down the reddit post.

But now I keep crying every single day and I can't eat at all and I can't sleep good or do fun stuff anymore because I am completly depressed about this.

I wish that she would just take down the doxxing tweets about me that have screenshots of the private messages that I sent her..

328,"Long story short I had a septorhinoplasty to fix how I breathe and to fix the crookedness of my nose. I told the doctor I want subtlety and that I really didnt want him to touch the tip. He agreed and sadly my doctor DID touch the tip and removed my cartilage I begged him to keep. 

I’m very sad that I don’t have the part of my nose I love anymore. I also look very strange. My nose looks abnormal and empty(?) and he made it much shorter and pointing too high. What a mess. I’m a mess mentally and my confidence is so low. I hate how it looks. So I’m considering a revision in the future. 

Revision rhinoplasty is a lot more complicated than primary rhinoplasty, so if I want to find someone to fix it right, it’s tough. My current surgeon isn’t qualified for it and I don’t trust him anymore. Revisions can involve rib cartilage to rebuild the nose. I found a doctor in London who might be able to help but so many things I’m seeing about revisions include the nose shrinking and rib grafts possibly warping. Although I’ve seen some revisions where the grafts were completely fine!

Is it worth taking the risk? Or do you think I’ll risk looking even less like myself or risk warping complications? Should I at least consult with the London doctor to see what he says he’d do? Please give me your opinions. Thank you!",06Jul2018,0
330,"Hello everyone, I have a story to share that is slightly long, and I apologize in advance. Recently, the two longest lasting friendships I have ever developed ended, and it is eating away at me. I’ve spoken to my mom, brother, and therapist about this, and none of their advice has remedied my pain. Thank you for taking the time to read this, let alone offer your help. 

Let me begin with some background about myself: I’m 18 years old, a recent high school graduate, and will be starting college in the fall. Throughout high school, I suffered from severe depression and anxiety. I had difficulty making friends, was completely dissatisfied with my life, and was very overweight. I’m so grateful to be doing much better now, having begun taking medication, exercising, and seeing a therapist.

All that being said, I developed these particular friendships far before my adolescent troubles. I met-let’s call him Mike- when I was 4. I’ve know my second friend who backed stabbed me-Will, let’s say- since I was 7. Through elementary and middle school we three were a close group, as I was pretty tom-boyish growing up. We all ended up going to different high schools, but we did not let that hinder our friendship. We often went to parties together on the weekends and hung out extensively over the summer. Will was my first kiss and I was his. Before senior year, we also became sexually involved, but never romantically. 

The three of us often dreamt of taking a road trip together before we went our separate ways to college. Coincidently, Will and I will be attending the same state school, but Mike is heading to the east coast. As senior year began to wind down, I grew excited to spend my last summer before college with them and, hopefully, take the trip we had relentlessly dreamt of.

Well, Mike and Will are taking that trip, but not with me, with a different girl, Kim let’s say, who went to high school with Mike. I had always been friendly with her when I would see her at parties and around town, but I was unaware of her apparent closeness with Mike and Will. I had texted Mike to ask what he was doing this summer, and  he very nonchalantly responded “going on a three week hiking trip with Kim and Will.” My first overwhelming emotion was confusion; why was I not invited on the trip? So I asked Mike just that, and he replied it would be best if I met in person with him and Will to “lay everything out on the table.” I won’t lie, I became irate at the notion of having to have what was seemingly a meeting with my friends of over a decade to discuss why I was not invited. I did not want to be an object of discussion, so I called Mike and asked him to explain his reasoning to me over the phone. The moment I began speaking he was on the defensive, claiming he found my refusal to meet with him and Will offensive and unkind. He told me I wasn’t invited because I was not “physically or mentally fit enough,” nor were we good enough friends for him to consider inviting me. I called Will as well, and he gave me the same, albeit in my opinion, fallacious response.

In the least braggadocios way possible, let me guarantee you that I am the most physically fit out of Will, Mike, and Kim. I overcame obesity in high school, and currently have a healthy BMI, exercise 6 times a week, and am training for a triathlon. Mike and Will see very little sunlight or physical activity (which is ok of course, all people’s lifestyles are valid), and Kim is a bit heavy herself. I also overcame my depression and anxiety, which brought me very close to suicidemultiple times, so I do not believe I am lacking in mental fortitude. 

I was even further shocked that they claimed we had not been friends over the past years! It was as if they had told me the earth was flat: to deny our friendship was to deny the truth. I went back and found hundreds of messages and texts between us creating plans, inviting each other to parties, and texts that simply illustrated the complexity and vastness of our friendship, something that only comes from truly knowing one another. I sent them sceeenshots of these illustrative messages and they ignored me. About a week later, I messaged somewhat of an apology, stating how we didn’t have to be friends, but I wanted to bury the hatchet. No response. Soon thereafter I message just Will, since we will be attending the same college, that I wanted to clear the air between us so we could both begin school with a fresh start. No response. I texted Will again about a month thereafter about how important it was to me to begin college with no hard feelings, and, surprise surprise, he did not respond.

Well, Mike, Will, and Kim just returned from their three week rendezvous in the Colorado Rockies, and I am still very much hurt. I am immensely saddened that I lost two of my closest friends in such a harsh and emotionally tumultuous way. I am also overwhelmed with guilt: I cannot help but feel as if I must have done something wrong. This whole episode is bringing about some of my worse symptoms of depression, and I am struggling to enjoy my summer with the thought of my lost friendships constantly nagging at the back of my mind.

So, am I being over dramatic, and should I just get over it? Did I do something wrong that I just cannot see? Or, are Mike and Will fake friends who inexplicably betrayed me? 

Thank you so much for your help, it means everything.",06Jul2018,1

332,"About a year ago at school, I apparently got into a fight with some douche because he took my phone. Let's call him Richard. He really did beat the crap out of me that day after school, and I wished that it never happened, and that was one of the most terrifying moments in my life and it traumatized me. Thats what took me to train in MMA. Theres this MMA gym near my home and it is rated as one of the best MMA gyms in the city that puts an strong emphasis on discipline and self-defense. MMA has really changed me on who I was. I was an asshole back in those days and was really doing bad on my grades. The dojo has taught me some respect and discipline, and I felt like I became a nicer and better person than before. I got into my first tournament two months ago, and it was really fun because it reflected my training and results from MMA. I have a strong interest in MMA and plan to keep training in the future.

Richard found out that I've been training for a year since the fight. He is so pissed off because he thought that I started training MMA so I could beat him up again in the future. I have no intention of beating anyone up, and I would never use MMA as an advantage to hurt someone else, as that it what my instructor taught me. Everyone at school knows about the fight 1 year ago and they are willing to see me fight Richard again to seek ""vengeance"" or something. I don't want to fight anyone, but this situation I'm having right now is putting a lot of pressure in me. The guy Richard is posting shit about me on the media as if he's trying to get me to fight him in the beginning of school. Fortunately, I have summer break so I have a lot to think about this.

337,"So my boyfriend of two years is leaving in a few weeks for a coding bootcamp in a different state. It lasts for three months, M-F, 2 hours away.

I'm in nursing school in our home state, and will graduate with my bachelors in two years. My bf says he will propose to me towards the end of this year and beginning of the next one. 

Boyfriends program will last three months, and the recuriter/admissions guy convinced my boyfriend that he would probably end up with a job in the other state because they have a special deal with another company and will pay him well.

338,"I tried posting on r/relationships but they took it down.

This might be a really long post, so bear with me. Also I'm in the middle of all the insanity as I type, so any advice as to what I could do immediately is greatly appreciated.

I'd like to note that my family is American Chinese- My sisters and I were born in the States while my parents were born in Vietnam. Let's call my \[22F\] younger sister Cindy \[16F\], my older sister Emily \[25F\], my mum Mary \[53F\], and my dad Dave \[54M\]. Cindy has a boyfriend, let's call him Chad \[18M\]. For some background information, Emily and I are close and Dave has chronic depression. Back when my parents immigrated to the States from Vietnam, they got married here and had me and Emily. We were dirt poor, living paycheck-to-paycheck. My parents struggled to have relatives watch over us while both working and going to school, so it was chaotic. When we were being naughty, Emily and I would be physically punished, ranging from breaking hangers on us to having our hands smacked until they were blue. Neither of us consider it child abuse (we feel that most of the punishments were reasonable for our actions), and we both still love our parents dearly to this day- we both understand that they grew up in an environment where physical punishment was normal. Fast-forward a few years, we were finally financially stable and moved into a house and my parents had Cindy. She was never physically punished, only scolded at whenever she did something wrong. Even just as kids, Emily and I kind of noticed that Cindy was pretty spoiled. She never got the treatment that Emily and I got, so there were times when I slapped (not hard at all) Cindy when she did something wrong. (I'm not saying what I did was right, although I was only a child and I thought it was unfair at the time) I'm saying this because Cindy has hated my guts since the beginning of time and thinks I ruined her childhood and that I abused her. She doesn't remember the times I took care of her and played with her, because she only thinks about the two times I slapped her.

I'll give two instances of my family falling apart, one that happened a month ago and one that is happening right now:

We went on a family vacation/road trip that involved a seven hour car ride. I drove halfway there and my dad drove the other half, and by the time we reached the motel we were exhausted. Cindy brought Chad, so it was them, me, and my parents. (Emily didn't come) The room had two full size beds, so the plan was me and Mary on one bed, Cindy and Dave on the other bed, and Chad on a twin size makeshift bed, right next to Cindy. We were all getting ready for bed, when Cindy was sitting up in bed, not wanting to lie down. Dave confronted her and asked why she's not lying down, and she responded with, ""I'm not sleeping until I get to sleep on the same bed as Chad"". Dave said no and that she's too young to do that, so she said she wasn't going to sleep then. I was incredibly tired, so I remarked that I wanted to sleep and proceeded to turn off the lights. Cindy said, ""Why are you being such a spoiled princess?"" Mind you, my parents and I spent seven hours in the car hearing Cindy flirt with Chad the entire way, so I was furious (Chad wasn't even supposed to come in the first place, as it was a family vacation). She went on about how I always get what I want, but when she wants one simple thing, such as sleeping in the same bed as Chad, she can't get it. She said, ""That *thing* \[me\] belongs to sleep on that small bed, not Chad"". She basically threw a fit about how I wasn't supposed to be there and that it was supposed to be a double date with my parents and Chad. She ended up being able to sleep with Chad. During this whole tantrum, my parents were delirious since they were exhausted and even kept saying, ""Alright we're packing up our bags and driving seven hours back home right now"" at 1AM. The rest of the vacation was awful, and now my parents don't ever want to do a family vacation again.

The day before yesterday, Cindy was playing games the entire day with Chad and started doing her homework at 2AM. Cindy is taking summer classes, and I'll also note that Chad comes over EVERY SINGLE DAY (I have to drive him back and forth to his house and ours), whenever she's not in class. Cindy usually does that; spending the whole day playing with Chad and doing homework late at night. So yesterday, Mary had enough, and confronted Cindy about it. After a heated argument, Mary proceeded to slap Cindy, but Cindy retaliated by using pepper spray. I wasn't there to see it happen, but according the Mary, Cindy almost stabbed her (Chad held her back) then she called CPS on Mary.

Now my family is in pieces and Mary wants to divorce with Dave and sell the house. She told me today that she wants to destroy what she created (the family). Then, just now, Cindy was yelling at Dave when he asked if she could speak with him, and wanted the whole neighbourhood to know. I really don't know what to do and I'm crying as I type. Any help would be great. (Also Emily has been gone the entire time, since she's in Air Force training) I have been recommending family therapy for the past X years, but my parents are too traditional and don't think it will help. They won't comply with it, and I'm sure Cindy wouldn't either.

TLDR: My younger sister pepper sprayed and almost stabbed my mum, now my mum wants to divorce with my dad and destroy the family. My sister doesn't give a horse's ass about the family, called CPS and reported ""abuse"", and intends to live on her own. ",06Jul2018,2

The whole thing lasted more or less a year. We had a close bond, but eventually he started disrespecting my boundaries, would embarrass me in public, and even hit me a few times. I know I should’ve left right when the red flags started showing, but I was immature and I was in love with the idea of him. A little more than a year ago, he sexually assaulted me. He didn’t rape me but he forced himself on me and threatened me if I didn’t comply. After that, I stopped talking to him, but I tried to push that experience away. A few months later, he reached out to me and apologized for treating me badly and asked if we could be friends. I just wanted to pretend that situation didn’t happen, so I accepted his apology but I never hung out with him again. Fast forward to last fall, I saw him in person for the first time since the assault. I tried to avoid him, but he approached me in a friendly way, and after that, he started messaging me on social media. At this point, I had realized what he did to me was not okay, and I didn’t want to talk to him anymore. I cut off contact with him, but it was easy since he was going to school in another state. I found peace with the situation and was able to move on but recently, he falsely told his girlfriend that he cheated on her with me (this never happened). His girlfriend and her friends began threatening me, and this just put back all my progress. My main problem is that he’s back for the summer, and he works at the local arcade. All year, my friends and I have been going there and I really enjoy it, but now that he’s back, I’m terrified to go because he’s always working. I know this sounds silly, but I had been earning a lot of tickets at this arcade, and I’m really close to a big prize that I want to get, and my friends want to go to the arcade too, so I want to be able to go to that arcade without being scared of him. I want to know maybe some ways I could boost my self assurance, and convince myself to be less afraid? Please don’t tell me to file a police report, I can’t do that. ",06Jul2018,1

358,"Hi. M/23. 

I am conflicted and could use some wisdom. I have a great job and have been dating a girl for just over a year now. Recently I have gotten restless with life. I am in a routine and I hate it. All of my friends only ever want to sit at a bar on the weekends and my girlfriend is great about me dragging her to do new things with me. 

I just feel like in life and in my relationship something is missing. I love this girl, we have hardly any drama, we get along with each other’s family/friends. Everything is good. But I can’t shake the feeling that something is missing and I am scared the longer it goes on that thing will never show up. 

With life, I just feel like there is more to life besides my routine of work, workout, watch tv/relax at night on weekdays and go to the city and drink with friends on weekends. My entire family has never moved more then 30mins from where they grew up and aren’t the most supportive people about me moving. I currently live at home still to pay off loans and I have told my parents I am apartment hunting, to which they advise me against it and I need to save more money. 

I have found a role within my company that I would be a good fit in, in Austin Tx. And I am scared to pursue it. Idk what will happen with the Gf and I know it will put a strain on my relationship with my family, but something inside me is telling me I need something new/more out of life and if not now while I have nothing really holding me back, then when?

I could really use some insight from the older crowd who might be parents with kids in my situation or if you were in my situation and moved/didn’t move I’d love to hear about it. Anything helps, I’ll answer any questions. Thanks in advance! ",06Jul2018,1
359,"Some context:

I am on the top floor of an apartment building. It’s fairly newish (constructed around 2010). It’s run by a company and is part of a community. Rent is on the upper end of the local averages for the size and amenities. 

So I don’t know my neighbors. They are fairly new. It’s a couple that have four young kids from what I assume to be from previous relationships. They’re pretty quiet overall especially considering the young ages of the kids.

But here’s the thing. When the kids aren’t at home, the couple smoke weed... and it must be a lot because the smell is fairly intense by my common wall. I hate the smell and since it’s by my wash room and closet, I’m worried the smell is attaching to my clothing.

That being said, it’s their home, and I believe what a person does in their own home is their business (as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone else like domestic abuse etc.).  A person’s home is where they should be able to kick back and relax. 

And even if I say anything, what can they do? Also, it’s awkward as hell to bring up, right? And I guess it’s a chance it’s a downstairs neighbor, and I wouldn’t want to offend them by my assumption.

Any thoughts on if there is anything I can do or if I should just put up with it? Is there a cheap air filter thing I can put up in that area of my apt?",06Jul2018,2

hello there,

So I know the term “bullied” is something that mainly younger people use, but I don’t know what other term to use in this particular situation. 

I [22f] was friends with this one dude [21m] who is also an international student. We were quite close and I used to help him with almost everything when he first arrived here because he had no English, no friends, and no idea about the society or culture here. So I offered a helping hand and we eventually became good friends. However, last summer, things changed. I had 3 deaths in the family within the space of 2 weeks which was unreal. It was such an impossible time in my life that I barely socialised or studied or went to work. 

I became so anti-social that I didn’t see this guy for weeks, and he took it personally. I ran into him after like 1 month and I explained the situation and he was very understanding. However, I had no idea about what he had been doing during that time. It seems that he had been going around saying he wasn’t interested in being my friend, that I had done nothing for him and that I was an irrelevant person in his life. I was like okay, whatever. It’s obvious that he jumped to conclusion just because I hadn’t been in contact with him, but that’s okay. 

Over time, a lot of people had come up to me, telling me that he had been spreading rumours and talking bad about me. When I confronted him about this, he denied any wrongdoing. 3 times after that, people had come to tell me the same thing, and on three further occasions I confronted him, and he still denied it, this time there was proof (WhatsApp and text messages). I tried to talk to him about it but he dismissed any wrongdoing again. But I lost it when he went to one of my closest friends and told him I was a bad person and I should be trusted. So I told him there and then, I wasn’t interested in continuing this friendship. After helping him with so many things, money, shelter, food, literally everything, including defending him when people would verbally abuse him and almost want to fight with him. 

Fast forward 7 months, I hadn’t spoken to him or said anything within this period. I was going on about my life and my uni work and so on. Yet, I had lost so many friends, one of my colleagues at work started “bullying” me and just taking the piss out of me at work. I had no idea why all of this was happening. No one would even say hi (we live in a very very small city, everyone knows each other). I got depressed, I felt I was alone. I couldn’t go to work or even go out because people were looking at me bad. It got to the point where I started having anxiety attacks, I couldn’t eat, to the point that I’m now on medication for depression and anxiety, and seeing a shrink about this too. All because I found out that he had gone around telling people that not only was I a bad person, but I was dealing drugs to young people and I slept around and so on. I confronted him again? But this time he told me to my face, shouting verbal abuse in front of people, telling me that I’m a bad person, I should be allowed to be in society and that I endanger people by dealing drugs and sleeping around. 

I know it doesn’t sound so bad, but because it’s such a small city, and I have so many family members, these rumours reached almost everyone I knew. It was embarrassing. No one wanted to hear my side of the story. This situation not only affected my personal life, but my professional work life. I have no one to talk to about this. One of my neighbours saw me in complete distress about this, and said I could potentially seek legal advice. Could this be a form of harassment? The dude isn’t even from here. He’s only here to study but while he’s enjoying life, he’s making mine miserable right now. Is there anything I can do legally? Or is this classed as just something I need to deal with personally with him.. could anyone help out with some advice? 

Tl;dr? - I think I’m being harassed by his international student whom I used to be friends with.. he’s spreading vicious rumours about me which is now not only affecting my personal life, but my professional life and also my mental health to the point that I’m not on meds for depression and anxiety and I’m having to see a shrink.. I can’t do this anymore. I need to know, can I take legal action against him in any way whatsoever?

Sex has dwindled down to 0 since she started being medicated in May. I stuck through it because I love her and I understand what she's going through is a lot harder than abstaining from sex.

Well she's gotten worse in the last month. We have been living together for one year now, and we talked with her family about it a lot. Her dad suggested she move back in with him and focus on recovery for a year, which is what we ended up doing. I moved back to my parent's place (way too far to visit) since I didn't want to live with her parents.

I barely hear from her anymore, I have to reach out more and more to talk to her. It's getting exhausting and at this point I'm at the end of my rope. Her depression is only worsening and it's becoming more of a burden to have to keep worrying about her. I really love this girl and I know she is the one - as long as she can make it through this. I need to know how to best help her or when I need to just pull away from her because I don't want to let her drag me into depression. At what point do I say I can't handle it anymore?

395,"Beyond the obvious ""you're a f\*\*king idiot"", let's move on to how this all came to be.  


I'm a lonely guy. I have at times in the past paid for escorts to take the edge off of that loneliness from time to time, and at one point 2 months ago one I saw ended up being super easy to talk to, attractive, and though I paid her only for the hour she ended up staying all night talking among other things. She told me she had a boyfriend in the states (I am in Canada) and she was going to move down to see him the following week. She said he knew she was doing this, and while I had mixed feelings about that, we decided we wanted to see each other again afterward on a non-escort/client level.

 I was uncomfortable with her having a boyfriend, even a long distance one, but I was lonely. She eventually told me all about the situation and it sounded bad. She had met him online through Facebook, had only met him once two months prior for about a week, and was going to move down there into a house that they hadn't even settled on yet. The whole thing sounded awfully planned. I told her she should have more concrete plans, because what would happen if she ended up breaking up with him, or not getting the place, or any other hundreds of factors. I didn't want to try to sway her to stay; after all it was her choice. But as we talked over the next few days it become clear we had a connection of some sort. She said she didn't have that connection with him. So she broke it off with him and decided to stay here, and I offered her a place to stay since she had given her notice at her old one. She said she stopped escorting.

She ended up moving in with me and although there have been tons of red flags, I ignored them. It's been almost two months, and she has been looking for work intermittently but hasn't found anything. I am at a point where we don't talk a lot or do much together, and while she seems to be job hunting but goes out for an interview at a place 30-40 minutes away and comes back 4-5 hours later, with any number of reasons.

The kicker is that she has several serious behavioral disorders, a previous major drug addiction problem, a pet cat who is also with us, and seemingly no money. If I try to make her leave she could break down crying, blame me for the whole thing, flip out and try to kill me in my sleep, or any mix of the three.

I know I fucked up, but I have absolutely no idea how to go about fixing this so that it doesn't basically make her homeless, but still gets her gone.
