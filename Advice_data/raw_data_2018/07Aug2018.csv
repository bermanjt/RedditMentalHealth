0,"I have been at my job since April. When I got on the floor and out of training I had to sit next to this guy who seemed nice at first. He's 40 years old. Within a few days he started asking me very personal questions, my bra size and even how many men had I been with . I felt uncomfortable so I went to HR. As soon as I went in the HR rep knew who I was talking about and said there was an open investigation. Over the next few weeks I heard more girls were coming forward with screenshots of disturbing messages he was sending.  Someone even did research on him and found he had multiple assault charges. I usually keep to myself so it was all overheard information. One went in to HR this morning after he told her she had a nice ass. Hes now back on the floor. What could be preventing HR from disciplining him? After finding out about the assaults I definitely do not feel safe at work anymore. ",07Aug2018,62

7,"Hello.

I (15m) have been dealing with emotional abuse from my mother for longer than I can remember. I have vivid memories of physical and verbal abuse from about six years old to present day. I‚Äôm going to list a few events that stand out.

6 years old‚Äî Told me exactly: ‚ÄúMy marriage is falling apart because of you,‚Äù while I was visibly upset from her yelling at me. She claims she has no recollection of this. 

13 years old‚Äî I had realized I was gay and began cutting myself after ‚Äòpraying the gay away‚Äô didn‚Äôt help. She found out through a panicked friend (I don‚Äôt hold anything against that friend, she had no idea what she was doing and we still hang out frequently) and confronted me about it. I told her to leave me alone one night and she yelled quite angrily for me to ‚Äúshow me your arms‚Äù which I responded to by crying and sitting on the bed. She asked me several times what was wrong and I finally told her and she stared at me, looking pretty pissed, and asked me the usual questions, ‚ÄúDo you look at (male I know) and think they‚Äôre hot?‚Äù and shit like that and out of self-protection. She claimed that I was fine and that I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it. She forced me into therapy and I lied to my therapist claiming that school was stressing me out and that‚Äôs why I cut myself. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. From that point on I lived in constant fear, my father outwardly expressing homicidal opinions towards homosexuality. I‚Äôve considered suicide multiple times. A few months after I came out, I was sent to a private Christian school, where I was bullied heavily from day one. I was pushed, called faggot, typical stuff. The school intervened, but big surprise! Nothing happened. Starting my freshmen year I switched to public school because my mother realized that Christian school wasn‚Äôt the right pick. I stayed involved with the church‚Äôs youth group. 

(It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that we‚Äôve had several fights ending in physical violence that aren‚Äôt worth individually listing, but they‚Äôre enough to piss me off to this day) 

At the new school, I had my group of friends and was kind of just existing. I made good grades and had my interests (which I was sometimes mocked for) and it was about as shitty as you‚Äôd expect American high school to be. 

In January of this year, I was getting ready for school and headed out the door and my mom threw a spiral notebook at me, and I pushed it down in self defense, and she began hitting me so I punched her clear across the face. Not enough to leave a bruise, but enough for her to get the message that I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for her bullshit. She called the police, but then went and got in the car. She had faked calling the cops to give me an anxiety attack. 

When I turned fifteen earlier this year, I went to the DMV and got my learner‚Äôs. She posted a fucking front and back picture of it to Facebook, which is very specifically told her NOT to do. She‚Äôs always been bad about posting personal information to social media, but holy hot fucking dog, posting my full name, birthday, and social security number to Facebook crossed so many fucking lines. I‚Äôve told her to ask for my consent to post pictures of me, but it‚Äôs not like she pays any attention to my wants/needs.

In February I went on a trip to Tennessee with our church youth group, and met a few people I liked. Only about one of them actually treats me with respect. The rest are annoyed by me. I was too naive to see it at first. This only made my feelings of being lonely and trapped worse. Whenever I go out to dinner with this group of kids, I wind up sitting alone. It seems like nobody I know shares my interests and actually cared about me. My moms side of the family treats me like shit and talks shit behind my back about my interests (theatre, mostly).

She‚Äôs sending me back to the school where all of those people go in a few days. 

I fucking hate her. I need advice. 

To clarify:

Staying at a friends house or finding a shelter is not one of my options. She‚Äôd lock me in my room every day until I die if I did either of those if my dad hadn‚Äôt shot me yet. ",07Aug2018,1

I am starting my sophomore year of high school later this month, in light of this I was planning on quitting to focus on school, but before I turned in my two weeks notice I got a promotion, kind of. What this entails is that I don‚Äôt get a raise but instead an opportunity to acquire quarterly bonuses. These bonuses are based off of The attendance of quarterly belt promotions, so every student that attends earns me an one extra dollar. We typically have anywhere between 40-100 students per promotion. I still want to earn money but don‚Äôt want my school life to suffer due to work burnout.

11,"
Two years ago an ex friend and I had a falling out. When the first bit of tension was apparent I did what I could to try and fix things before it grew into something more. The initial talk I wanted to have with her didn‚Äôt happen because she was avoiding me. I honestly had no idea why and I wanted to figure out what the misunderstanding was about. Few weeks later I find out she‚Äôs spreading rumors and talking down on my relationship to her bf who‚Äôs ironically the brother of my bf. 

She has the audacity to play victim and turn the script on me saying that I was the one being fake and playing victim. Two years I‚Äôve  tried making the effort while she kept avoiding me ‚Äî she had me questioning myself and my morals, making me think I was actually a bad person.

The reason I even tried for 2 years was simply because I‚Äôm socially inept. I deal with social anxiety and when there‚Äôs a chance to make new friends I try my damn hardest to be that one friend who‚Äôs reliable and supportive.

Few months ago we had the chance to talk, and I wanted an explanation for the rumors about my relationship and why she cut me off with no warning whatsoever. During our reconnection, which I thought was going well, she didn‚Äôt have much to say so I assumed everything was copacetic. I asked if she wanted to say anything else about the issue or if she wanted me to know anything else so that there were no more misunderstandings, she said no. Few days later, she goes back to being distant and is still currently like this. 

I don‚Äôt know what happened. I‚Äôm at a loss. I don‚Äôt know if I said something wrong during our conversation and I don‚Äôt know what to do. At this point, I don‚Äôt even know what advice I‚Äôm asking for anymore. I‚Äôve been through a lot those past 2 years. Work was stressful and hectic, I got blamed for shit I didn‚Äôt do and got fired. I was dealing with a toxic family member at home ‚Äî older brother to be exact ‚Äî who threatened my well-being. I lived with my bf at the time and since this girl was dating the brother, I was essentially kicked out and I had to put myself back in the toxicity at home. I just.. I don‚Äôt know anymore. I‚Äôve been depressed the past few years because of all this unnecessary stress and now I‚Äôm just rambling. Sorry for the long post. ",07Aug2018,1

13,"Trying to figure something out and I have no idea who to ask. 
I feel like my fiancee has stopped caring about me, but I'm not sure how to find out for sure. She barely talks to me, does anything with me or even asks if I want to do anything or if I'm okay. But she has no problem going to the bar with her friends whenever they ask even if it's on 0 notice. She normally only talks to me if I ask her something or of she wants something. Never to spark a conversation or anything. It's been this way for a little over a year now and I never thought anything of it until recently. 
And her mom doesnt help at all either. Her mom is always mocking me and saying shit behind my back. It bothers me a lot, but I tell myself I'm here for my fiancee not her mother so I just try to ignore it. And I also think she's just an asshole, and she has no balls because she'll never say something to my face. I'll always hear what I did that her mom didnt like from my fiancee. 

Can anyone give me advice on what to do? Ice been told to move out, but I cant find an apartment and my parents dont live anywhere near me so I cant do that.

Also, if anyone would be interested in talking to me through pm's that would be greatly appreciated. I mostly just need a listener who can help out on occasion.

14,"Two years ago I was in a very toxic relationship with a girl, we were both very mean to each other and we would insult us awfully all the time. When I finally finished the relationship because I realized it was making me become a very violent person until the point that sometimes I wanted to slap her she became very bittersweet and started spreading rumors about me with our old classmates using our chats as a proof and saying that she just insulted me back for ""self-defence"", but I never touched her or hurt her physically, that was the reason I broke up with her, because I didn't want to hurt her.

Yesterday an old classmate from my last school texted me to tell me that I'd better be trembling right now because my ex wants to take revenge, and since I'll be turning 18 in four months I'm afraid she'll use those chats against me, I'm terrified she wants to screw my life over stupid pointless 16 year old teenagers. I'm from Spain, I'm a man and the law will believe her no matter what the context is, no matter if she insulted me and mistreated me too.

I'm scared to death. I want to delete all my social medias and dissapear from the world forever. I'm crying right now. I don't know if she still has those old messages, I bet she does. I just remembered when a friend got his FB account banned for posting an offensive meme in a popular group that all his messages got deleted in our personal chat, will it happen if I delete my account?

15,"I‚Äôll try to make this as to the point as possible. 

I‚Äôm currently dealing with a very hard breakup and have been severely depressed, on the verge of killing myself. 

I‚Äôve expressed this to my family and that I think I need some help, but they don‚Äôt seem to be taking it to seriously.

Tomorrow I‚Äôm supposed to leave for a mini vacation with my mom. First it was to get my mind off the breakup, and then she changed it to being my birthday present that‚Äôs next month. Whatever.

Then she decided to invite my brother as well. I was a little nervous about it because he can be a little volatile at times, but I figured it would be ok since we will be out having fun.

Well, today we are planning all the stuff we are going to do and he randomly has one of his melt downs over asking to get something out of the car. It was completely insane, and my mom and I did our best to calm him down. 

He was screaming at me calling me a bitch and no wonder my boyfriend left me, etc etc.

When my brother leaves the room my mom comes back and instead of saying something like ‚Äúwow, that was crazy. Sorry that happened‚Äù she said ‚Äúyou really need to look at your part in this‚Äù

My part was that I asked him to help me get the stuff out of the car. Not in a rude way at all. 

My mom has always babies my brother a lot. 

Anyways, that went on for some time, I even got my dad involved asking for help because I‚Äôm really not feeling good and don‚Äôt even know how to deal with this.

It basically ended with ‚Äúlet‚Äôs talk about this later‚Äù.

I can‚Äôt control the way anyone else acts or responds, but I‚Äôm feeling pretty shitty at this point.

I broke down and was saying that I just need some peace, I‚Äôm on the verge of killing myself and I don‚Äôt want to, and I just need some peace.

So we go and start planning our trip again. I‚Äôm still not feeling well and my mom starts asking ‚Äúdo you need to go take a bath, do you need to go sit in your room, do you need to go do something else?‚Äù So I kinda laugh and say ‚Äúyou want me to get away from you‚Äù and she just says ‚Äúyeah.‚Äù

So I start crying and go take a bath. 

I come downstairs after and I asked her if she thought that was ok to say to me.

We have cameras in the house and my mom and dad say they pulled it up and that I said to her ‚Äúget the fuck away from me!‚Äù.

I asked them to pull it back up because I knew I didn‚Äôt say that and they basically keep going back and forth about how I‚Äôm too emotional today and I need to take a look at myself. Basically I‚Äôm feeling like they keep telling me how wrong and awful I am.

They pull it back up and it said what I thought it said, not ‚Äúget the fuck away from me‚Äù.

So I start asking why they lied to me and why is it so hard for anyone to say sorry or be nice to me. Why does everyone keep telling me all day how wrong I am? They say they didn‚Äôt lie and again start saying about how I said ‚Äúget the fuck away from me‚Äù. I just start laughing and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwe just watched it on the camera!‚Äù.

They say they don‚Äôt know what to do for me. I tell them I would just like an apology and for everyone to be a little nicer with me. And that I opened up and was making myself vulnerable and can they please just hear me and realize I‚Äôm going through a hard time right now. 

My mom has nothing left to say to me and my dad goes outside.

Now I‚Äôm sitting in my bed completely pissed. We were supposed to be planning this trip from some stress reduction for me. I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôm going or what is going on. I feel terrible right now.

Sorry this is a crazy mess, I basically just brain dumped.

What do I do with this?

17,"I met a girl some months ago  through a common friend. We got along fine and the next day she started following me on Ig. I followed her back and we stroke a conversation instantly. Eventually I asked her out and she said yes. The date went on splendidly, we had a beer and realized we had many things in common, we spent the entire night talking and making out. 
Pretty much the best date I had in my life.
After that we kept on texting on Ig but with great intervals between the texts, after some days the conversion slowly faded till she didn't respond a text of mine that was asking some casual questions like how was her job and such.
Some weeks after I saw her making out with another dude in a concert by pure chance and when I got back home I was so drunk and disappointed that I figured that the best I could do would be to stop following her on Ig so as to ""delete her"" from my life.
As soon as I woke up the next morning I realized the stupidity of my reaction. I reflected on how ridiculous it was to feel jealous when you only dated once with that person and that I had pretty much burned that bridge.
Some days ago she texted me again casually and we stroke a conversation like the good old days. I learned to take things easy now and not to rise my expectations too much, just enjoy the moment. We agreed on meeting up again soon but I think it's kind of weird to text so much and not to  follow the other person, besides she could figure out and realize I'm a weirdo that doesn't know how to handle casual relationships.
Anyways, I just want some advice on how can I follow her on Ig again (she has a private account so she has to accept my request) without her knowing that I unfollowed her becouse I was drunk and took things too seriously.

I smoke pretty regularly legally as I have a medical marijuana card due to my chronic migraines. I don't need to smoke anymore if this hinders my ability to get this job.

22,"Hey, Reddit. Sorry if there are a lot of posts like this, but this was the first place that came to mind.

I turned eighteen in May. As I got a summer job that prefers to pay through direct deposit, I opened up a bank account. I've had it for two months or so. Today, my dad asked me to give him access so he could see my deposits and withdrawals and make sure I'm managing my money well. I tried to sort of brush it off without saying no outright because I'm scared of him getting mad by saying that giving someone access to my bank account feels weird. He said ""Well first off, I'm not anyone"" and then said he wants to make sure I'm ""on the up and up"", and then left it there. He's probably going to bring it up again, though.

Is this a reasonable request? He also wants me to download an app called Life360 on my phone that tracks the location of everyone in a group who's downloaded it. I've had the app for years (and expressed my discomfort, but he got mad whenever I pushed the issue too far), but I recently switched phones and hadn't gotten around to downloading it. 

I don't know how to feel about this. I mean, I'm still living in his house before college, on the family phone plan, and it's my mom's credit card on our shared Amazon account. Plus, my family is paying my tuition - I'm getting a massive grant from my school, so it's \~$8500 a year and it's money that my grandmother gave my parents specifically to pay for my college, but still.

He and his girlfriend have been together most of the time we've been friends. There were never any issues.

The last time I visited his house, his girlfriend, had come home early from work to surprise him, unknown to both of us. When we came in I excused myself to use the washroom since it had been a long walk there. As I started to walk up the stairs she called down ""[Horsejack's friend]?"" and I looked up to see her standing there totally naked.

Immediately I looked away and said ""Sorry! [Friend] didn't say you were home!"" and she said it was alright, she had just been startled and grabbed a robe to cover up.

I apologized again when I left, she said it was fine but was a little irritated at my friend for not mentioning he was having company. She smiled and was her normal pleasant self as we said goodbye.

As for my friend, he thought the incident was funny. I think I know him well enough to say he wasn't bothered. And if he was, 1) it's kind of dumb because I couldn't have avoided the situation and 2) he is upfront enough that he would have mentioned it straight away.

But it remains, that's the only thing that is different about our friendship. Is it crazy to think she might have asked him not to hang out with me anymore? And if yes, what can I do?",07Aug2018,3
25,"So I was not really ""fat"", but I was chubby as a kid. I was teased from elementary school to high school. I was sent secret admirer notes as a joke, I was made fun of to the point that I drove myself into several eating disorders.

I am a size 2 now and I became ""so much more attractive"". I even modeled for a few companies, but quit modeling for personal reasons. I've been quite lean for about 7 years now (18-25).

Most of the time she‚Äôs wrong and clearly just pretending to know who or what I‚Äôm talking about, but it‚Äôs starting to get a bit... grating. 

Tonight I sent her a video of a guy doing something that looked funny - basically he was inserting  those expanding ear plugs and using one arm to pull his ear up while inserting the ear plug with the other. 

Before I‚Äôd said what he was doing, she launched into a speech,

‚ÄúDo you know what he‚Äôs doing here? Well, I had a friend who‚Äôs aunt was from Kenya, and she said that little boys do this to measure their age - if they can reach their ear with their hand then they‚Äôre old enough‚Äù (old enough for what I have no idea)

The entire story made no sense! It was clear she‚Äôd made it up. I said no, he‚Äôs inserting ear plugs, I‚Äôm not sure what that story you‚Äôve just told me is about. She then hung up, I don‚Äôt know why. 

To be honest, I‚Äôm finding it a bit weird and sometimes it‚Äôs annoying. She never seems to want to just say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù and her stories just don‚Äôt make any sense. She told me she knew a singer once, and when I bought up the singer months later she said ‚Äúwho‚Äôs that?‚Äù. It‚Äôs mad. 

Why would someone do this? What is behind this sort of constant needing to know/pretend you know about every subject? ",07Aug2018,1
29,I‚Äôm trying to get out of this toxic relationship. I posted a few weeks ago. I got out of a relationship full of deceit and lying and cheating. I have evidence for some things but others are clues that I put together. My ex keeps trying to reconcile. I know he is a manipulator and he knows how to make me feel good. I‚Äôm really trying to remember how miserable it was and how much the lying hurt but at the same time my brain has glorified the good times we had. I‚Äôm trying to get a therapist but it‚Äôs taking sometime. I really need some advice how to deal with this. We go through this every weekend. He texts me and we have an emotional walk down the memory lane and I tell him I can‚Äôt trust him anymore and we can‚Äôt do this anymore and he promises not to get in touch with me but then boom he appears again. He is not aware of all the lies I know about. I am holding on to more things I know so he can‚Äôt take those away from me by making an excuse. I am in this weird place between reality and facade. Any advice will be welcome at this point. This is affecting my work which I absolutely love in normal circumstances. ,07Aug2018,0
30,"Long story short my mother passed away June 3rd from Cancer. I was with her in hospice until her final breath and sat in an empty hospital room when they took her body to the crematory. My mother was 59... I've been having massive amounts of problems with dealing with this since as you can imagine. 

I keep thinking... I'm not even 30 and have to live the rest of my life without my best friend.  She'll never get to see my children grow up and as strong as I'm trying to be I feel utterly lost. Usually in situations where I feel stress she's the person I'd talk to. On top of that I haven't talked to my father in a month because whenever I do it feels like it just happened again... I know I should be supporting him right now and I'm afraid to even pick up the phone because of the emotions it'll bring about. 

I know everyone grieves differently but I feel like I'm doing this all wrong, I have no experience with the death of someone so close and I'm starting to wonder if I should seek counseling or therapy.

33,"I‚Äôm not sure I should go into detail about my friend or not. By the way, this has nothing to do with my last post, I just figured while I‚Äôm here I might as well ask right?

Our friendship started a while ago maybe 2 years, I forgot how we started being friends which is why I say ‚Äúa while ago‚Äù, anyways, we met in science class, it was me her and another girl that transferred out of the school later in small friend group.

Later in the year (quite close to final testing) a new girl came into the school who was in my science class, once this girl came in she began to talk to her more than me and caused much drama which I‚Äôm happy I chose not to be a part of. Then final testing went fine and summer began.

However over summer me and my original best friend (the girl I met in science class I will call girlA) started talking a lot more, however a bit through the summer she just kinda stopped. I didn‚Äôt really know why but I was fine with it. Summer ends.

The next year me and girlA had a couple classes together, she fell into this hole of drama with (the girl who got transferred in I will call girlB) once more, she wasn‚Äôt really paying attention in class and started to fall behind.. I felt bad for her, genuinely I did but I didn‚Äôt know what to do. 

We had math class together and she asked for my help, I was the ‚Äúbigger person‚Äù and after much ignorance from her helped her with her math. Then pretty much everyday while I was doing homework I would get a snap (or text if you don‚Äôt know what that is) basically saying she was crying because she was so confused in math and felt super dumb because she didn‚Äôt know the material. I wanted to tell her that sad truth, that it was her own fault, but I felt that was too harsh because she was consistently sad about it, I thought she was depressed basically.

But everyday I‚Äôd walk into class and she‚Äôs be talking about something new. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to think. After a lot of ‚Äúneglect ion‚Äù from her I wanted to go talk to her, but I just couldn‚Äôt do it.

After about 1 and a half months of basically doing her homework, I said something, finally. I told her that she was just falling further behind in her classes by asking me for help and that, come time for finals, she would struggle, and maybe fail at this rate. She had advanced classes (hard classes that were a year above your grade level) and I suggested maybe moving to a lower level to save her grades.

She then lashed out at me and I was very shocked and baffled by this, I said I was sorry and I just didn‚Äôt want her to be even more sad about a situation she could get out of. And that‚Äôs when she stopped asking me for answers.

I will summarize the end quickly because this is too long and no one really cares. 
Come finals we were taking the test, the test is broken up into 2 sessions so day one I was quite confident with my performance. Then at home I got a call from her while I was watching YouTube, she was crying and telling me that she didn‚Äôt know any of the answers and it was my fault. I told her, you‚Äôre probably just a little confused and you probably did just fine. Come day two, I know she told everyone that it was my fault, that‚Äôs just the kind of person she was, she always told people my secrets, but I kept hers because I didn‚Äôt even have anyone to tell them too to be honest üò•, honestly I don‚Äôt know why I am friends with her, I was thinking.

After Session 2 ended I was super happy about it being over and soon enough, summer began again (it is summer right now for me) we kinda talk a little bit, sometimes I start a conversation but she ends it real quick. And then I get a VERY RANDOM call, she was crying again, telling me she got a 3/5 on the final which I believe is a 70 or so? She asked me what I got and I just didn‚Äôt want her to be sad, I just told her to calm down and she yelled at me, you don‚Äôt understand, no one ever wants to talk to me, I feel so dumb and now I can‚Äôt get into the special math class with you! I was confused but she explained it to me and it made a little sense, what I didn‚Äôt understand why she said no one wanted to talk to her, I tried all the time and got nothing but maybe that was different. 

And now here I am writing about the call I just got from her and giving unnecessary information. I just need to know if she‚Äôs worth keeping, I‚Äôm in a place right now where I don‚Äôt know if I could survive without her i school. I wouldn‚Äôt know where to sit at lunch as dumb as it sounds, my 3 other friends sit with large groups and it would just be so awful to get those spiteful looks from girls I‚Äôve never spoken too. I really survive knowing that once I‚Äôm done with that day, the next will come, and then the one after that, I‚Äôm sorry if you read his far, I know I‚Äôm probably going to get hate because I sound petty and dramatic and dumb, and I agree I am.
I should just drop her but I can‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt know how or what i would do, I doubt this will effect me long term so I‚Äôm not too worried about it, I don‚Äôt cry EVERY night and it‚Äôs not even that bad. It gets better (I hope) cheers to the future...

34,"2018 honda civic lx cvt. Brand new only 13 miles on it. I'm freaking out. Tomorrow I'm going with the boss to the DMV to get the car title, I need to get insurance on the car tonight. I already have a car that I own and it's perfectly fine, I have Geico for insurance on that one. I really think I'm going to sell the new car, the car I have now will last me minimum 3 years, it's never let me down. So, I've come to ask for advice. 

What fine print do I need to pay attention to when receiving the car tomorrow? I was told that the car has been paid in full and taxes have been taken care of.

How do I go about selling the car for the most amount of return?

I have to have this new car insured to receive the car title tomorrow, what is the cheapest way to go about that since I won't be keeping the car very long?

35,"Okay so I'm like the worst at picking up romantic social cues and such so some input would help....Context: I work with this guy (we're both interns) and we we're acquaintances going toward friends. And then he did somethings where I don't know if it's just him being friendly or more (I'm friends with quite a few guys so I don't want to misconstrue his intentions). So here are the three major things that happened/I've noticed:

1. I left my phone on my desk while I was in a meeting and he took it to take some silly selfies with it and text himself so he got my number. I told him that was a little creepy and he said ""I could have been less creepy in getting your number/attention"" (I know this sounds super creepy and maybe a red flag but if you knew him it would be. He's really nice and I kinda thought it was funny)
2. He keeps coming around my desk to talk for an extended period of time. He'll sit on my desk distracting me from work. He even asked me if one of my guy friends was my boyfriend.
3. He Snapchatted me asking when I was leaving work to make sure I hadn't left without saying goodbye.

36,"TL&amp;DR: husband wants cat. I‚Äôm scared of cats. He says I have 6 weeks to be okay with it. We‚Äôre getting one regardless.  I can‚Äôt do it. I am willing to pack my bags and move to my moms over this. He knows my fears. 


**Backstory**

I am extremely scared of cats. I grew up on a farm. I have been around animals all my life. I was scared of dogs. But I recently got a dog. I am in freaking love. I have gotten so much better with dogs. I have always been queasy around animals but not horses or cows or chickens. Your basic farm animals. I grew up with dogs. Didn‚Äôt touch them. But since I‚Äôve had bolt. I rock him to sleep. I love that dog to death. I love him. 

I have always been scared of cats. My husband says well you used to be scared of dogs and  you baby bolt. He said I have six weeks to get over it. His friend‚Äôs cat just had kittens. 

*What happened today that made fully know I can‚Äôt do this**

*I thought maybe I could. But I saw that cat today*

Well today my kids saw a cat at my house. Wandering around outside. My oldest is one of those kids who would pick up a stray animal off the road and take care of it. She‚Äôs ten. She went and fed it milk. She walked it around to find the owner in our neighborhood. She got mad at me because I said leave it out side and rushed each time to close the door. 


**The Problem**


So here‚Äôs my problem. I have gotten better with dogs. I like be my dog. Will pet other dogs now. I never got sick to my stomach or felt a sense of fear in my legs when ever I saw a dog. I saw that cat on my back porch today. I got sick to my stomach. I felt the fear in my legs. I can‚Äôt do it and be comfortable in my home. I have gotten better with bolt. I just can‚Äôt do a cat. So my husband and kids say I have 6 weeks. I have told them I can‚Äôt. I have decided if he gets the cat he cares nothing for how I feel. 

**My Plan**

I have decided to move out to my moms until the cat is gone and get a tarantula. He scared of spiders. I will get one to him and show him how I feel with a spider. He is worse with spiders than I am with cats. He runs jumps screams when a spider is around. 


**Am I an asshole??**


Am I being an asshole about the cat? How do I get over this?  He wants the kids to have lots of animals. Okay let‚Äôs do a fish. I am done after bolt. I can‚Äôt do any other animals. Just thinking of them makes my stomach sick. I can‚Äôt. 


**The Questions**


My questions: 
1. How do I help him to understand I am terrified of a cat. He knows this. That cat today made me so sick when it was outside and the door was closed I could see it though. I know irrational fear.
2. Am I being an asshole and should just get over my fear. 
3. I‚Äôm really packing my bags if he brings home a cat. I‚Äôll stay at my moms if need be. This is only if I can‚Äôt get over it or he doesn‚Äôt understand my problem.  Not really gonna get a tarantula. I could never bring myself to touch it. 


**Basic TLDR**


TL&amp;DR: husband wants cat. I‚Äôm scared of cats. He says I have 6 weeks to be okay with it. We‚Äôre getting one regardless.  I can‚Äôt do it. I am willing to pack my bags and move to my moms over this. He knows my fears.

61,"{Warning: Dark}

This is obviously a throwaway account because I don‚Äôt want my friends or family knowing about this as I‚Äôve kept this to myself since it happened and I‚Äôve come to Reddit because I‚Äôve seen Reddit five people good advice in the past.
If this isn‚Äôt the appropriate subreddit please let me know..

I was 8 years old and like any youngster I was on my laptop a lot. Very innocent and wanted to meet new people and didn‚Äôt go outside a lot so thought a chat room was innocent and went into one. 
I had been on them for a few weeks and knew to avoid guys being creeps and most guys stayed away because I did in fact have my username as my age and it was a webcam one too..

I got a pm from someone who claimed to be a mod and told me to be careful and I said i was ok. (This is person is important later)
Days go by and a user pops up saying someone in the chat room has put a nasty virus on my computer and the threats were getting higher, being an 8 year old this scared the shit out of me. I immediately asked the stranger what I was supposed to do. He gave me his msn messenger email and we spoke on there. His name was Jason. 
Jason told me he worked for the FBI. (I know right?) He told me a lot of hackers had my information and the only way to get the threats down was to skype with them so they ignore me and the threats disappear and when the threats reached 0, Jason would be able to track down their IP and arrest them..

I get sent the first username to add on skype and at first it was just talking and Jason was updating me on the threats going down and when it hit 0 the guy I was talking with on skype went offline as if in fact his internet was cut out and tracked down and arrested.. this made me believe everything Jason claimed to be saying about the hackers. 
Jason kept sending usernames to me and the convos were innocent at first then it got very dark.
One guy asked me to take my shirt off and I messaged Jason in a new tab on my laptop but he told me he can‚Äôt tell me what they ask me to do and scolded me for telling him I felt uncomfortable. He told me to do whatever they told me to do so the threats would go down. I told Jason I was gonna just go off the laptop and I was threatened that if I did then my internet would turn off and I would be tracked and arrested and that I wouldn‚Äôt be released until 18.  That was a lot of years. 
Being 8.. I listened to him. I had to sit in my room naked doing sexual things to myself and so stuff and dress in my school uniform for these guys. I felt so sick. 
Every time the threat level went down which Jason told me when it hit 0 the user I was on skype with would go offline as this meant their IP was tracked and they would be arrested for hacking. This made me keep believing and I was terrified of my family finding out because if I didn‚Äôt do this then the ‚ÄúFBI‚Äù would come to my house and arrest me. 
I went back into the chat room after days of doing this and the mod that messaged me to be careful popped up and said ‚Äúyou working for Jason?‚Äù And I said yes and she replied ‚Äúme too.‚Äù I told her I was feeling uncomfortable and she told me not to worry about it. 
I continued to do the skype calls and asked Jason when it would stop and he agreed that I‚Äôd do one more and I could quit.
I get the username and go on and I really wanted this to stop so was already past my breaking point. The guy asked me to do more explicit things than what I‚Äôd been asked to do before. 
I was told to touch myself and lay in my room in the webcam camera naked and find objects to use. I was told to orgasm and I had no idea what that meant and I couldn‚Äôt even do it as the guy told me how and still couldn‚Äôt. 
I got up into the pm section and asked the guy to just put the threat level down so I could leave which bear in mind they were supposed to know nothing about a threat level and I was bait to get them to put the level down so they could be ‚Äútracked and arrested‚Äù. The guy laughed and said ‚ÄúJason is fucking stupid, do as I say. The threats are never going down‚Äù.
I asked him this because it was taking longer than usual and I was crying and didn‚Äôt want this anymore. 
I signed out of my account and turned off my laptop for days...
I still have not logged into the actual email account (Not msn because nobody uses that anymore) but the actual mail outlook of things. I‚Äôm too terrified.
I know now that I was obviously tricked brutally into something more.
I want advice on what I should do.

64,"This past week, my wife and I learned of kind of a wild party that a few of our friends went to that we evidently weren't invited to.  Some of our friends evidently were part of a weed-fueled sex party that we learned about after the fact, and it really messed with our self confidence and emotions afterwards.

We both feel like we're a little jealous of our friends who get to have adventures like that, probably mostly because we were each other's first and only.  While that provided a lot of good things in each of our lives, it also left us out of a lot of other life experiences.  Getting ourselves into sexual adventures outside of the same old marriage sex is something we never experienced.  

While that stability and familiarity is something we both appreciate dearly, we both lament the fact that we never got to experience other adventures.  We've tried to expand and find some adventures in that area, but have had absolutely zero luck.  To hear of friends finding it almost effortlessly made us feel really bummed out and was a huge hit to our self esteem and confidence.

Another aspect of this is that my wife and I are kind of in the position where we're the oldest of our friends circle and have been a little more established for a while.  Our group tends to look to us for support and answers, which is a role we don't mind and actually value a great deal.  But the flip side of that is that there seems to be this notion that we're old, lame, or boring in some cases.  Whenever we cut loose, that group sometimes seems to not like it or appreciate it.  We're not really that old just yet, we'd still like to do some wild things and make some dumb decisions before we really are.

Not that we'd necessarily want to be invited to this weed fueled sex party that we missed out on, that would be a little awkward because of the age difference and because we value some of the friends involved in that tremendously, to the point where we wouldn't want to dare risk any awkwardness after the fact.  But still, a thought, or at least a complimentary invite would have been nice.  Like I said, we'd at least not like to be thought of as so lame that we wouldn't enjoy something like that.

What can we do about this?  We've both been bummed out over the past week since we learned about that party we weren't at.  Not only because of the adventures we're missing out with a particular thing like that, but also because of the metaphor it presents in us being perceived as old and lame, or maybe even actually being old and lame.  Anyone have any ideas or suggestions?",07Aug2018,0
65,"I recently applied for a Traffic Coordinator position at a TV station and was offered an interview. I went and it honestly was the best interview I ever had. I've been in the industry for 6 years (smaller stations though), so I have a good grasp on the job and the skills to do it. We even spent some of the time joking around, talking about aliens and our fear of birds. I felt comfortable like I was speaking to an old friend. At the end, she told me they will be interviewing for a couple of weeks then do callbacks for the 2nd interview, then a third and finally a decision. She made it clear it will be a VERY slow process.

A little back story, she and I became really close friends a few years back and I thought she was gonna be one of those ""friends for life"" i trusted her and figured we would always be there for each other. But suddenly about over a year ago she ghosted me and blocked me on all social media, and blocked my calls and texts. About a month of her ghosting me with no explanation goes by and I get a message from someone I dont know of a screenshot. In it was a fb post from her saying really REALLY horrible things about me. (All completely untrue.) I think from what i remember she tried to say i was also trying to get with her ex's which was also 100% false. 

I was totally hurt. And it really affected me mentally too as I haven't even tried to look for lasting friendships. 

Now today, I wake up to a message from her. Over a year later. And all the message said was ""sorry for being such a piece of shit to you"".
I'm probably still trying to process it. I've read the message and she can see that.
What do I do...I'm really conflicted...

69,"Hi there.
I'm 15 yo straight girl. I'm saying straight just to be clear.
Sorry for my English, but there's no way I wrote this somewhere people could recognize me.
Also, this is probably be just another sobbing teen crap. You've been warned. 
I'm in some weird obsession. I've hear people talking about  ""cloded mind"" and darkness, but what I feel is just invisible barrier which affects my imaginery, memory, the way I can think, write, speak. My memory is one huge fog. I love my language, but now.. I just can't write.. I kinda ""like"" teacher. It may be since spring 2k17, dunno. First like 3 months I didn't admit it to myself, but then things get more.. intense. I began to miss her to that point that I were feeling totaly down when it wasn't her class. But when it was, things weren't much better. I'm completely asocial human and I always felt huge anxiety when she was around.. I mean, I couldn't speak, could't move naturally, I wasn't even able to look at her so I was just staring down at my desk, notebook, hands or whatever for 45 minutes straight. (Well, I was sitting in the first desk so..) Sometimes I was shaking a little. 
I found a reason to live in .. her? Maybe. And basicly, when she wasn't around, I ""was not very well"", but those 45 minutes almost every day were like a starterpack to hell.
(If I didn't sound like a complete creep yet, this is probably gonna kill it.)
Once she smiled at me. I was supposed to smile back and say, I dunno, ""Good mornign, xxx"", like a normal human, but all I did was looking aways and trying not to start choking and redness, fall and stuff.
I have no idea what she though of me in that moment, seriously.
She must be disgusted of me or sth in general, but for me it obviously is not a reason to not fall for her more. 
She is stuck in my head. I constantly think of her. I'm embarassed to do thing even when there's no single human being in 25 kms, becaude it feels like she could see me from my head.
Sometimes, when I read posts on forums in my language, I look up other profiles and find myself checking their ages and trying to figure out if it could be her profile and then search for some clues. (Even though it's impossible..)  I'm obviously not proud of that, just being honest.
I know it's messed up and there's no way anyone I know is gonna find out.
I have a one simple question. What is this? 
How do I get rid of it?
You'd probably tell me to stop seeing her, right.. Well, that's impossible at least for next 4 years unless I kill myself or something.
We had (and probably will have) classes with her 5 days a week and now  there's (hopefully really really small) chance she's gonna be our house class teacher or how is that called. Yeah, and 100% sure that she's going with us for the ""skiing class"" (also don't know how is it called in English) in the winter. FOR A WEEK. FUCK. When I had to say one word to her, my voice just broke, okay?
So I'm asking on the internet - what to do, what to do?
I've been googling for some stories similiar to mine, but found absolutely nothing. Every obsession story is about crazy stalkery or manipualtive persons.. I have a selfreflexion.. yet. :D
You can tell me how stupid I am, you may laught at me. But don't think it' gonna hurt me somehow, I say this to myself too.. So if you don't wanna actually help, you better save your time..

Our family dog Daisy is a female Jack Russell and she's 10 years old. I don't think she's really aggressive, but she does kill small animals like chipmunks, squirrels, and she got one of my hamsters a few years back. She gets jealous because shes a spoiled dog but she gets along with the cat that lives outside (well I say he lives here but hes not around all the time... He just eats outside and comes and goes). 

My kitty Neko is two years old and hes a strictly inside cat. My bf lived with his mom and he lived on a busy highway so we chose to keep him inside so he wouldnt get hit by a car. He's neutered, and hes pretty chill but he loves to play with his string toy and he sleeps a good bit. Id say hes a typical cat and hes a pretty big boy (10 or 12 lbs). He's been around two dogs (a pitbull and a bloodhound) and was a little skittish at first but i think it had more to do with the dog's size than anything.

78,"March of 2018, I started having panic attacks and severe stomach aches at school. When I walked to school one morning, I broke down in tears but tried to keep myself together so I wouldn't run back home and anger my mom. I sat in math class for about a half hour before having to go to the nurses. I was cold but hot, dizzy, and my stomach was in knots. The nurse let me home and that was the last time I went to school my junior year. While going to multiple doctors and trying different medications, my mom and I were trying to get the school to approve me for home bound (you're enrolled with the school, but a teacher comes to your house select days and teaches you/gives you tests). They wouldn't approve me for my mental health (depression, anxiety, &amp; PTSD), but finally approved me for my physical illness (IBS-D). I then had to submit paperwork about why I missed around twenty-two days of school before I was on home bound. Everything got cleared, I passed my junior year and now I will be a senior. Over this summer, I found out I also have gastritis and a hiatal hernia in my stomach.

However, the school didn't do something they weren't supposed to do and now i have to go to court for truancy. My mom called the school and they said they couldn't reverse a court order, and so tomorrow my mom is calling court to talk to them. We know 99% we'll probably have to go, which scares me a little bit. I know that I didn't do anything wrong, I was sick and went through surgery over the summer and have about four doctors I see regularly, but going to court gives me anxiety (even when I'm on medication for my anxiety, lol). I usually freeze up and stutter in front of people of higher power, even teachers, I feel like the judge will make me cry just by talking to me. I have confidence in myself and again, know I didn't do anything wrong, but I'm scared they'll try to send me to jail or my mom. I don't want to be clammy and for the judge to see me as weak or dishonest. Does anyone have advice on how to reduce anxiety in this situation?

82,"Hello all,

I don't know where else to go with this. I've always had trouble with money going to college. I went to community college for two years and now have my associate's degree in Engineering. My entire time in this area, I have felt disconnected from my life. On my way to class, my mind drifts and I focus on how much I want to leave this area rather than stay and be elsewhere rather than continue staying in my hometown.

Through duel enrollment, I got involved in a military style program at my local university. Here in the US this program is called ROTC, where you learn how to become an officer for your branch of service while earning your bachelor's degree. I have been offered a three year tuition scholarship to go to this local university. The catch is that I would have to become an Army Officer upon graduation and would remain in that position for up to 8 years.

I feel like I should be super grateful for this scholarship, but I am not. I have worked hard during my time in school to stand out to my professors as well as my instructors in the military program but I am feeling more and more like this path is not the path for me. Time is feeling like it has been flying by over the last two years, and I feel as though I haven't grown at all.

Should I accept this scholarship, I feel as though I'd be too unmotivated to do a good job in the position that they want to give me. I'd feel unmotivated in my classes. More than anything, I wanted to get out of my hometown after my time at community college so that I could have a change of scenery. I feel as though  I am living in a box, and it is really starting to take a toll. Lately I've been waking up later, sitting around, and just not feeling my usual confident, driven self. I don't want to do poorly in a program that I don't want to be in at a school I never wanted to go to in the first place.

My plan is to join the air force as an enlisted man instead. From what I have researched online, I could come in at a higher rank due to my associates degree. I could leave my hometown, and after some time in the air force gain the financial help that I need in order to attend another, more prestigious university. I don't feel as though I fit in with the peers at the university at all. I don't like being there. Also, the air force also has jobs that I am more interested in. Being in the army doesn't feel as though it would be a good fit for me.

Am I ungrateful and selfish, or does what I am saying make sense? Please help. My brain tells me to stay, but something is pushing me and telling me ""go"". I'm afraid. Thank you very much for your help.",07Aug2018,1

84,"So I went to a senior graduation party at the end of the year that one of my students invited me to. I dropped off a congratulations/thank you card and was talking to her about her future college plans. While that convo was going on, her aunt walked up, and I knew her! She works in the same subject as I do and I've seen her at conferences. Some of my mentor teachers are great friends with her and her husband. I've also worked with some of her former students and they're all true professionals. The student I came to see went off to greet someone else, and her aunt and I started talking about my job, as it was right at the end of my first year. It turns out she went to this district in the 70s, and the person before the person I took over with was her teacher. That senior teacher retired about 4 years ago after 40 years. As the conversation went on, she alluded to inappropriate relationships that this former teacher had with students while she was in school. When I say that she alluded, there really wasn't a lot of wriggle room. She didn't say ""he touched me inappropriately"" or something like that, but she did say that when he was younger he was ""friendly"" as she put it with the students. He had apparently fooled around with her and had a longer relationship with her sister. This came as a shock to me because this teacher is seen as one of the best that ever taught in the district. At the time, I wrote this off. At the time, this teacher was retired and gone and I had no evidence beyond this lady's claim. Well, first teacher day was yesterday, and it turns out one of the other teachers is on maternity leave and the teacher in question is back as a sub.

Should I report what I heard to my administration? My worry is two-fold if this man does something:

1) The person that told me could come out and say that they let me know and I did nothing.

2) More than that, I would personally feel horrible if something happened and I did not report it, even if she didn't say she had told me about it.

On the other hand, it is not provable, at this point. I have a high respect for the person that told me, but I cannot prove it. The allegedly offending teacher is a pillar of the community. I don't even know *how* I would go about getting this out without it coming back to me. My principals either think extremely highly of him or they were his students back in the day. This might sound really fucked up, but, even if it were provably 100% true, I still think many members of the community would be upset with me about raising it. It's a highly conservative community.

He would hold me when I would brake down, listen to me even when it sounded nuts. I have a lot of issues from the past that have damaged my mental state pretty badly and I get into a lot of trouble because of this, but I'm working on it. I met him in math class and we clicked...i had a huge crush on him and made my move when we knew each other better and I was open about what I was going through...he let me be myself and let go...it was amazing, he even told me things that were sometimes hard to hear but honest. Things took a turn when we kissed and then more...like I said I'm pretty messed up...so sometimes I fight over small things....he got a bit aggressive with me and I told him off, we got into a huge fight and after talking things out for 2 hours he promised me we'd work to make it through this. The next day he broke up with me...in the pouring rain and said that our relationship wasn't healthy and I regrettably chewed him out...i said some pretty nasty things out of anger I wish I could take back but I can't....i miss him...i want to make things up even if we're just friends....i just miss him I know it's my fault....what do I do?

88,"So I‚Äôve been killing random ants in my dorm and have no idea where they‚Äôre coming from. I have killed one just about everywhere (most on the wall by my window and computer, two on my laptops, two near my dresser). There is no food laying around &amp; I take out the trash often. 

Now, I did take a ceiling lamp from my friend &amp; if I remember correctly, it probably is around the time the ants showed up but I don‚Äôt think its it because I cleaned it well. 

I‚Äôve hand-cleaned the floors &amp; every two days I go around my room &amp; douse the place with lemon &amp; peppermint essential oil to try to ward off the ants. 

Its nowhere near an infestation, i think I‚Äôve killed about 10, but it is annoying &amp; once I killed one by the bed near my wall and my laptop, I knew it was a problem

91,"I recently picked up a new job in a factory where I have to admit-- I'm the only white, female. My job is largely Hispanic people, many who know little english--except this one dude who happens to be a black American. This dude thinks that he means well and is 'helping me out' but he puts me in an uncomfortable position. He loudly complains about the Hispanics saying they make me work to death and I genuinely do NOT feel this way-- they are all so nice. Feed me food when I forget mine, always work equally as hard as me, if not harder. He will complain about them in front of them and they KNOW enough to probably understand. He spouts on about shit, but really I just think he doesn't like the work and finds them an easy target to blame for the higher ups being shitty. When The day progresses, he starts yelling at me about trivial stuff. ""Never leave this broom around
!!!"" I literally left the broom to return in a second-he gets annoying. He's not my boss by any means and I think in his head he thinks he's doing me real favors. Really he's the one coworker I have a problem with. I was having a slight struggle with one machine but was working through it... it was my first time on the machine...He bops along, out of nowhere.""Why didn't you tell me?"" I was just thinking ""go away. Youre not the boss.""He made a minor situation a huge problem and practically told everyone I couldn't do this one part of the work.  ""Why didn't you tell anyone you can't handle this?!"" Honestly, I didn't even feel that way, like my face was just getting red dude, back off. So then he makes this huge scene about it, in front of the boss and acts like he's doing me a favor. I just don't trust him. assume he acts like he's doing me favors. Belittling me in front of the boss assuming I can't do something and coming in out of nowhere ISN'T a favor. I also know from previous factory jobs, if a boss thinks you can't complete the work, you have all of 5 seconds to prove that you can--or they politely shuffle you out of there. He also tries to me me finish every machine his way. It's just line work and everyone else there kind of figures out which way works for them. As long as the product gets out the same, it's no problems, but this guy tries to make me do everything the best way he sees fit, which makes me want to scream. You're not the boss dude!!! Like I understand him though because in his mind he's being really nice (probably though... idk) but I just need him to stop all of his b.s.

94,"I've had this friend for awhile, and lately we have grown apart (live in different cities, different career stage etc.). No big. However, she still feels somewhat entitled to me in a sense. 

Over the past few weeks I have tried to initiate a get together between us, and this comes after she quit her job. She quit because she felt like it wasn't right for her, not because she thought she'd be fired or anything like that. However, this has been a HUGE change for her. It turned her life upside down and caused money troubles. More than she expected. BUT she did tell me multiple times she made the right choice and she was happy with it, and she felt liberated and motivated. I have asked her how she was throughout this process and so on, but didn't call her. 

Yesterday she called me telling me that she felt as if I was unsupportive throughout this whole ordeal, and that her other friends had been much more attentive-- calling her, consistent texts etc. She said I wasn't as good of a friend as she thought, I was disrespectful and self-absorbed, and I should've called her and been more attentive through this difficult point of her life. She sent a slew of rants and accusations, saying I didn't care about her or her life and if I did-- I would've behaved like her other friends.

This isn't the first time this type of thing has happened, and honestly... I'm fed up. It seems toxic to me, and needy even. I did ask her how she was and to be honest, with the way she was speaking, she seemed fine. How can she expect me to think otherwise while she is telling me how happy she is? It is like something went off, she became unhappy and projected it on me. We are adults, and I don't think I should be guilted because I didn't call her or give her the same amount of attention as some of her other friends. We aren't as close anymore anyway, so I don't know why she'd feel entitled to be fawning over her constantly. It doesn't mean I don't care about her well being. 

Am I being unreasonable here? This behaviour is nothing new, and I tried explaining my side but her attitude has remained the same and she has gone silent on me. Is this type of adult friendship a waste of time?",07Aug2018,1

96,"Hey all! I have a chance to do a TEDTalk in the next few months and need help narrowing down my ideas to the most interesting one.

Heres my short list (I included a little context alongside the topic)

**If you're under 18... go start a business**

I started a business when I was 17 and this talk would be about what I learned and the value of doing it as a young person.

**I'm a catastrophic thinker**

I have anxiety and wanted to give a sort of self-deprecating talk about how catastrophic thinkers look at situations, how it's exacerbated by adolescence, how a non-catastrophic thinker can help them, how my catastrophic thinking has helped me.

**Generation Pressure**

This talk would try to contextualize the difference in the pressures kids face today versus other generations and how even though every generation faces pressures, today's kid's futures are under a spotlight that when coupled with social media, is burning them alive.

**Student Engagement**

Haven't thought this one through as much but I know I could talk for hours about engaging kids in their education and school community (I've been doing this for 5+ years)

**How to be an adult... when you legally aren't one**

A talk aimed at teens who are seeking to start becoming independent but don't know what that even looks like. I would talk about the things you can start doing (buying your own stuff, getting drivers licence, coffee with a mentor etc)


Let me know if you like any of these ideas or think they can be tweaked. If you have any other ideas for what a teen could do for a TEDTalk please share!

I think that I should take an online SAT course, however I don't know where to start when finding one. I'm thinking about studying In an Asia country because I don't want live in the US, but since I have US citizenship it might be easier to study there. My main concern is student loans.

I‚Äôve always had a small crush on her since I first met her all those years ago and I never told her and she‚Äôs always had feelings for me too. But the thing is they have been off and on feelings. One of us would go date someone or Vice versa. And while we were dating people we wouldn‚Äôt talk as much as we use to. I did this mainly. But, over the pass almost two years now we have been very close. We both went through break ups as the same time and we were there for each other. We were The closers we‚Äôve ever been.

She helped me move into my apartment and we made spaghetti together(I know it seems so simple but it was the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever done. Time stopped in that moment) we watched movies and talked about a lot of stuff. she stayed the night and we slept in the same bed together. No contact was made but we talked all night and then finally right before I fail asleep I asked ‚Äúwhy we never dated‚Äù she said ‚Äúwe were always dating someone else‚Äù then I passed out. A few weeks go by and now my feels are out the roof and I wanna tell her I love her and I do this.

104,"First time poster- please let me know if this is the right thread for this. Sorry about the length. TLDR at the bottom. 

I've had depression for about 4 years now, but it only really came to light last year after I attempted suicide (I ended up getting cold feet, woke up my roommates, spent a week in the hospital, the whole shebang).

Since then, I've gotten on medication that only sort of works, and I've tried a few therapists that I haven't really 'clicked' with. Besides that, I think I'm doing okay. I'll be the first to admit that I don't talk about my problems and I haven't really been putting my life together as quickly as I would like, but I am trying. All told I think I'm doing as well as can be expected: I hold down two part-time jobs, live with roommates, and I'm doing just fine with day-to-day activities (cooking, cleaning, showering, taking care of my pet, etc.) 

I had a heart-to-heart with my best friend/roommate a few weeks ago about the whole thing. She and my other friends were worried that I wasn't talking to them about my depression, and they were suspicious that I wasn't actually doing as well as I said I was. We talked about what they could do to help me moving forward (helping my find a better therapist was the main thing). My friend admitted that she'd been talking to my dad about the whole thing behind my back.

I understand that it came from a loving place, and that my friends/parents are only trying to help. But it all really boils down to the fact that they don't believe me when I say I'm doing okay and just taking my recovery at my own pace. It was upsetting to know that my parents would go to my friends to try and get information out of them about me, but even more upsetting that my friends would give it to them. But again, I know if comes from a caring place so I bit my tongue. I have no right to be upset about it, considering what I put them all through. 

Here's the thing, though: Recently they (read: my friends/roommates and parents) decided among themselves that moving back home would be what's 'best for me'. This just so happens to coincide with the expiration of our lease. My best friend had plenty of opportunity to talk to me about this, but instead let my father be the bearer of bad news. Which he did by bursting into tears out of the blue and begging me to come home. I felt like I couldn't say no, especially because I'd have nowhere else to go if my roommates were in agreement with my parents. My bff/roommate only mentioned this after the fact, in an I-know-you-know-what-this-is-about kind of talk. She went on and on about how she just wants me to be happy, and kept asking me how I felt about the whole thing (after it had already been decided, mind you). I dodged the question because it seems like what I want doesn't matter at this point. 

I feel like I'm being ungrateful. Moving back home isn't the worst thing in the world. My parents are great and supportive, albeit a little bit overbearing. My problem is how this whole thing happened. I feel completely infantilized by the fact that my friends and parents would go behind my back and make this decision for me, without even asking what I wanted or what I felt was healthiest for me. It's humiliating to be 30 years old and to be moving back in with my parents when I'm perfectly capable of supporting myself. And I feel like this was all done because they all know that I'm a doormat and that I wouldn't fight them on it. It feels like an overreaction, but I'm seriously considering ending my friendship with my best friend over this. I feel like I can't trust her now, and I can't have a healthy relationship with somebody who believes that my choices should be made for me just because I'm sick. 

Truth be told, I feel like it's healthier for me to have independence and privacy. I'm afraid that if I move back home I'm going to regress and it will make matters so much worse. I don't want to become dependent on my parents just because they coddle me. And I'm certain they will smother me while trying to help, and that's the absolute last thing that I need. At this point I don't know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.

107,"I've been dating this girl for four months. She was from a different country, we started texting thanks to a FB Marvel Fan Group and I really really liked her because it was nice to finally know a girl as into comics and movies as I was. I've never seen pictures of her until then because she didn't post them but one day a friend tagged her in a groupal picture. I was horrified when I was expecting a nice girl I just saw a bunch of children. 

I confronted her and she invented a lot of excuses until she finally told me the turth. She was 14. I was 18. I was so horrified and grossed out. I inmediately broke up with her and spent almost an hour explaining her why it was wrong an adult dating a child, why it was dangerous that she accepted to date an adult and why she could have put herself in danger if I was a child molester or worse. She apologized and I told her I didn't want to have any contact with her anymore. She accepted. We never talked or known anything about each other since then.

I know I won't to jail for this, we never sent any kind of sexual content, nudes or whatever. The worst thing we've sent each other is ""I love you"" and ""you're the love of my life"" and that crap. Maybe I finally did the right at the end when I broke up with her. But it still bothers me.

She was a minor, a child, an inmature girl. It was wrong. It was gross. What if I emotionally hurt her sending her love messages? What if I hurt her when I gave her that definitely not nice talk when I broke up with her? If I had a 14 years old daughter and I found out a 18 man sends her romantic stuff, even if it's non sexual, I'd beat the shit out of him for being a creep. Even if he ""didn't know"", doing shitty stuff not knowing when you're an adult is not okay. But guess what, that man was me. And it's been two years after that and I still haven't get over it. 

I feel ashamed of myself when I think about it, I cringe when I think of the poems I used to write for her. I haven't dated since then because I honestly didn't feel to do it anymore. 

But I like a girl now, she's in college with me and we're both almost the same age, she'll be 21 soon but it doesn't really matter because I'm 20. She's wonderful, smart, mature, funny and we have a lot of chemistry toguether. But I'm afraid, I feel unworthy, like a monster dating an angel. My friends are encouraging me to do it and I really want to but I'm... terrified, I think she would feel grossed out of me if she knew.

What should I do? I've never talked about this with anyone. Thank you.",07Aug2018,1

109,"Greetings! I wanted the objective opinion of others regarding my situation. So I was recently accepted into the Graduate school of my choice. I decided to quit my job as a middle school teacher to devote time to my goals. I only taught for one year, and mostly hated it. In addition to school, I am writing a book, and starting a business with a few other investors. I also secured part-time work in my field of study. I'm in a very unique financial situation where I was able to save half of my net income and lowered my monthly bills to less than $450/month. And due to my family situation, I will not have to pay rent for at least a year. Im very happy with my decisions so far, as I am living out my top goals simutanouelsly. However, my partner of 3 years does not support my decision to quit teaching. Although my partner was made aware of my intentions for almost 6 months prior, I did not make the final decision with him. His biggest issues are that we wont be able to save for our future if I dont have a steady fulltime income; and a lack of benefits. He is also in grad school and maintains his fulltime job, among other professional responsbilities. He believes that l am running away from being an adult and the attached responsibility. I certainly understand his concerns and believe they are valid. However, I took the teaching job at his strong request and pushed through the academic year. Our philosophies on work and fulfilment within a career are very different. So my question is, am I being impractical and inconsiderate of his needs in the relationship (and falling short of being an adult in general)? Or is he being a little controlling and unsupportive? Fyi we do not live together. Also, we will financially help each other out (in times of need) but we pay for own bills and expenses, separately. ",07Aug2018,1

So on Saturday  I said to J, ‚ÄúHey what days are you going to the fair?‚Äù (it ran through friday-monday) and he said ‚ÄúMaybe sunday and definitely monday‚Äù so i said ‚Äúcool i‚Äôm going on sunday, if you come you should definitely come on a ride or 2 with me‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúfor sure‚Äù so then sunday comes around and i‚Äôm with a group of girls and he sends me a picture on snapchat of the fair so i said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre here?‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyup‚Äù and i‚Äôm like ‚Äúcome on, let‚Äôs go on the pirate ship!‚Äù (if you don‚Äôt know what it is, search up sea-ray ride on youtube) and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go on the spin out instead‚Äù (again, search it up on youtube if you don‚Äôt know what it is) so i‚Äôm like ‚Äúsure yea, i‚Äôm a little scared of that one though, i‚Äôm by the zipper, come meet me there and we‚Äôll walk there together‚Äù and so i‚Äôm talking with my friends and he comes up behind me and puts my hand on my head (he‚Äôs nearly 6ft, i‚Äôm 5‚Äô2), i‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh hi!‚Äù and he chuckled because I got startled and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúhi‚Äù we start walking and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh yea, my sisters here too‚Äù and i look behind me and i‚Äôm like ‚Äúhi!‚Äù and she smiled and said hi right. So we get to the ride and for some reason where he sat there was only one other seat open, the other two had the thing that keeps you in down. He sister sat somewhere else and the ride starts, he‚Äôs laughing at me because I‚Äôm freaking out and saying ‚Äúdude this is a lot!‚Äù and i‚Äôm also trying to hold my glasses to my face. We get off and his mom calls him and he looks at his sister and goes ‚Äúoh shit, i forgot to text her when we got here‚Äù so I excused myself and walked to find my friends, about an hour later we find each other again and go on the sea ray, it‚Äôs starting to get slightly dark so kids are filing out and so the operator is starting to make the ship go up higher. we get on and I swear I saw his sister give him a look that said ‚Äúsit closer to her!‚Äù so we get up into the air and i‚Äôm coming off my seat because i‚Äôm small and i‚Äôm freaking out once again and he looks at me and just laughs. You know those pictures where they‚Äôre like ‚Äúi wish someone would look at me the way ____ looks at ___‚Äù I caught him looking at me that way. (my heart melts writing this) we get off, my cousin calls me wondering where i am, so his sister starts to walk off and he gives me a sorry look and catches up. So later on it‚Äôs like 10:30, pitch black except for the fair lights and yenno i‚Äôm sorta scared (i‚Äôm scared of the dark, he knows) and so he finds me sitting at a bench and says, ‚Äúhey what are doing alone‚Äù and i‚Äôm like ‚Äúi can‚Äôt find my people‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwell, neither can i‚Äù so we‚Äôre walking and i see this super cute dog, so i‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh my god that dog is so cute!‚Äù and he like smiles at me and says ‚Äúyea it‚Äôs cute‚Äù so i find my friends and i wave and he waves back. So when i got home I texted him this.  http://imgur.com/xgTmEyt

111,"To say the least, I chase the past way too much. I usually find myself never living in the moment. Well, last year I slowly fell in love. It was odd. I'm usually so indecisive about things to the point of this being unlikely. The girl I liked fit all of my criteria. However, she had a boyfriend. She soon became unhappy and I was there for her the whole way. Her boyfriend broke up with her months after we met, it was December, we had a lock-in program at our college. During these hours, this girl (who I'll refer to as G), confessed everything to me. I felt like the luckiest man alive. I had a smile on my face the entire night. I held her in my arms, I've never felt better. One thing came to another. The holidays were over, there was drama in my friend group, and I was being confronted by all kinds of people. I slowly began to ignore G, but she still had feelings. Every now and then I'd feel guilty and call her. My closest friend at the time, T, would often encourage me to ignore her texts and calls. In February we all went to a basketball game. I was basically obligated to spend time with G. I spent the overwhelming majority of this event with T and a man I slowly got to know, H. The three of us were having a blast. Our seats just so happened to be by my ex. She was with this scumbag of a guy which I despised in every way. People told me G was looking for me all throughout the game. I probably spent 10 minutes with her throughout the 6 hours of us being there. I kept asking her if she was mad which she would respond with ""no"" and silence. I got home very late and we talked on the phone until 2 A.M. She frequently said we could talk about anything. I told her I missed my ex girlfriend. In reality, I don't think this was true. I think I was bored. G would get nervous by the affection I'd give her so I basically gave up. She sobbed on the phone. I promised that we'd still be friends but in reality I blocked her on every form of media. The final months of that school year I made poor decisions and several rumours came about. Some were true. Most weren't. I was sitting in my dorm listening to a song with her name in it. I felt horrible. I apologized over text because I was hours away. She forgave me, (this was months later). I made an impulsive decision to join the college's band program because it's how we met, this was her final year. She's with her old boyfriend again, just like last year. He went as far as telling G not to speak to me outside of band. Yikes... we went out to eat after a performance a couple days ago. We cruised around before I went home and we vented to eachother. She used the expression ""I feel like last year us happening again. We both feel the same."" During this, I indirectly said I was interested in getting back together, she said she wanted to get close. So here's where I come to reddit. What the hell do I do? She leaves college in May. I honestly believe that I still love her. I constantly feel her slipping away. Thank you.",07Aug2018,0

When I was 8 I would dream about marrying my dream girl and she is exactly what I pictured.

When my acceptance package showed up it felt like a slap in the face, like I had no say in my own future. 
Since last fall nothing has felt right, even though I've done my best to make the most of it. I joined and ended up quitting two clubs, I changed my major twice, and I've struggled to make friends since most of my graduating class went to this same university, so they're all in basically the same cliques, and people made friends in the dorms fairly quickly. 
None of this feels worth it, but I know I'd be going completely against my mothers goals for me if I try to drop out. I don't want to disappoint her, but I feel like I'm completely wasting my time here. I had legitimate opportunities to travel to other countries, and even had an internship at a company I really respect lined up with just my high school diploma, and had to turn it all down for something I never had a say in.

122,"Posted this on r/mentalhealth but i figured it wouldnt hurt to post here as well.
Recently, I went to a free counselling service in my area. Upon the consultation, they referred me to an early psychosis prevention centre at a local mental hospital. Since I'm underage, they required that I have a parent with me while there. I tried to tell my mom about the situation and how I wanted her to go with me, but instead she fired back at me telling me that I just had to deal with it, that I was making my situation a bigger issue than it really was, and how she was disappointed that I went to a counsellor instead of going to her. Granted, I understand why she'd be upset, but my mom has had bad experiences with mental health (her brother struggles with quite a few illnesses) and I was afraid that she would make my situation worse. I know she cares for me, but I think she's shocked that Im suddenly requesting help because to my family, I act like a ""normal"" person. She believes that the counsellor I went to was unreliable and that Im overreacting. She also thinks that, since I don't know where my anxiety and fearfulness stems from, I do not have issues (Im part of a nuclear family that has no issues whatsoever).

131,"For this story, I will call said girl ""C"". I had vaguely known her throughout the school year, however after getting paired together for physical education, we were forced to get to know each other better. Every class we talked about a variety of topics, many times her giving me homophobic/racist comments (I'm gay and in the closet; she doesn't know this, we are from a very republican part of Texas) and she would also talk about how she was joining the school musical. Weeks passed with her getting, ""closer"" tome. She would start putting her arm around my waist as we talked outside of the locker rooms, many times me visibly flinching. 

C then started talking about this girl a year above of us, starring as the lead in the musical (We'll go with R). She would say strange things about R, how she would love to \*insert very graphic/sexual things here\* R. They got gradually stranger, but every time she would INSIST that she ""wasn't one of those fags"". C started tagging R in many posts on her Instagram stories, with things like ""#womancrushwednesday!"" and send her messages like ""I wish we were better friends ;)"". Around this point, she was also getting more clingy towards me. On accounts from some of my friends, she would do things like grab my backpack and one of my friends that I was talking to, yank them back, and start a conversation with me. 

After the play, she would **continue** to talk to me about R, saying more explicit things. Then came the time of my big choir showcase (R also happened to be in the choir above me, also performing). I have a great time, R performs great, and then. C sends me videos. They are close ups on me of all my performances, along with videos of R with, suggestive, emojis all over them. The Monday after my performance, C comes into the math class we have together exclaiming that someone told R about her crush on her (She had almost told half the school and basically everyone in the musical). After vigorously questioning me for almost half of our class, she showed me some of the texts from R which included texts like ""Sorry if i lead you on, but I don't like the girls. The way you talk to me creeps me out."" C then quickly responded that she **never** had a crush on her and wouldn't know who on earth would spread rumors like that about her. R then responded with a gif of the fairy godmother from Cinderella that said ""Bippity Boppity Back the fuck up"", proceeded to tell her **all the people that told her**, then swiftly blocked her. 

That night C was texting me how ""She wouldn't want rumors that she was a fag being spread when she was running for president later in life (???)"" I told her that no one at our school really cares about someone being LGBT (My school is surprisingly OK with it, there are many LGBT couples despite our parents.) and gave a couple as an example, one of which is a very good friend of mine, and one of the only people that knows I'm gay. C then went on to **insult her** and say ""I hate how flamboyant she is."" I finally decided to stick up for myself because I had had enough of her saying things like. I told her many of my friends are LGBT and I really don't appreciate the way she talks about. She sent me a half-assed apology featuring many *lovely* phrases like ""I just can't get behind their fag lifestyle"". At this point I stopped responding to every message she sent, and since the end of the year was a couple days later, I blocked her on every social media possible. 

Now that a new school year is in coming, I don't know what I'm going to do if she comes to me again.

132,"Hi, so I (guy, 26 years) am having this problem:

Four years ago my  best friend (a guy) met this girl an they became friends and I could see she had feelings for him since day 1. At first I don't like her, then I get to know her and like her, and then I start to *really* *like* her. She gives hints to my friend of her feelings but he tells her he's just not that into her. Ever since then they're friends with benefits.

I can tell she only likes me as a friend, so all I ever ask her is ""you don't like *me* like I like *you,* right?"" she says ""Correct"". Fair enough, she's been after my friend for 2 years by this time; I don't fight hopeless batttles. Eventually all the friends in the circle come to know what happened, it's not a secret. I keep some distance from them to begin the healing process.

I begin to meet new people, make new friends. I've never been a ladies man but I do go on a few dates, though things never develop into a relationship. At the same time I finish college, and I start to work to pay my certification exam (I'm not from America so the whole ""Finish college"" deal is different) after a year of working I pay it and  get my diploma with no problems, then I keep working and change jobs a couple times. So all the healing and post-college life keeps me busy from dwelling on the whole deal. This girl and me stay as friends and I get to know her better than when I was crushing, we finally talk like pals.

This year I scored a decent job with good befeits, hours and pay, but I have to move into the outback. No problem, I come back to visit on weekends. It's all looking fine and dandy. I get a few weeks off work for summer break so I come back to spend time in my home-town, the problem begins when I start to spend time with this girl; those feelings I thought ended start to surface again.

I feel very confused. Is it normal to relapse into a crush?cI want to keep on dating but... Am I trying to drive out a fire with another fire? to get a new crush so I can get over her?

I wish I could take my feelings, put them on a metal box an throw it into the sea. But it's never that easy, right?

Thanks a lot for taking the time to read this and also for any advice you might have.",07Aug2018,1

134,"I came to the realization that I rationalize shitty things people do/have done to me. And I have been for a long time (like my entire life). It's not really even for empathy, it's more a coping mechanism. For instance, my ex did some pretty awful things. And I just kind of forgave him and rationalized it instead of emotionally realizing what happened was really fucked up and then finding a way to forgiveness. 

How do you stop rationalizing so much and instead emotionally recognize things (of course with empathy still when applicable) and then forgive from there? ",07Aug2018,1

136,"I apologize: VERY LONG POST
I'm a 19 year old guy and have a cousin (female) of the same age. My cousin has always been the favorite in the family, and our grandma and extended family have made this clear, although never explicitly stated. Since early childhood, I was told to be more like my cousin. My cousin has always been a fantastic student and she attends a very elite university. She has participated in sports and seems to be good at whatever she does. While I'm critisized for not having a girlfriend (I'm shy), her lack of boyfriend is excused as her focusing on her goals. Her father, my uncle, had always openly bragged about her achievements and has continuously spoiled her by flaunting wealth. Recently, he bought my cousin a very expensive car, adding to the lavish gifts he has provided for his daughter. I don't mind the car,  but this was clearly a public move to spite myself and my parents after we had a falling out with his family. I'm a good student and has also been successful in athletics (more so than her) but this constant comparisons and favoritism has been getting to me. After this most recent (clearly public) move by my uncle, I've had a breakdown. I realize that my cousin will always be a step ahead of me and her father will continue to hold it over my head. My parents have always told me to ignore her obnoxious father, but I can't seem to do it anymore. My extended family worships her like a goddess and I can't break this favoritism.
What should I do to break out of my cousin's shadow?",07Aug2018,1

I‚Äôm fine with that for now (still a bummer) but the effects of that are that we are quite unlikely to see each other out of school. I don‚Äôt know about other people but if you only see each other at school, that sounds like a massive blow.

139,"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child. I was put on drugs and preformed well in school. However, I was a little underweight and had issues sleeping. So, I (or rather my mom made me) stop taking the drugs.

I used to do almost nothing but read. O souls stay up at night using my game boy as a light when my parents took away my flashlight. 

I haven‚Äôt read a single book cover to cover since I stopped my medication. The closest I can muster is audiobooks while playing video games. I miss half the story when I do that.

Now I‚Äôm in college. I‚Äôm pretty certain I may have another undiagnosed mental disorder, as well. However, I have refused to get and assistance from my college. I only got 1 C that last two years, and have a 3.5 gpa, despite never doing the readings and quarter-assing my papers.

However, I am trying to become a writer. Because of my disabilities I have mentioned as well as others, every single one of my dreams is completely unnecessarily to me. I have become overweight and stagnant.

The only dream I have left is to become a storyteller, but that requires more conscientiousness than I can muster. I hate myself because I can‚Äôt work hard enough to get any worldbuilding done. I will get 200 words into a short story and never finish it. Despite trying to write for over a year now I have gotten nowhere.

I have brought up my difficulties to my parents but my mom won‚Äôt support me getting medication, and she controls my entire life.

I don‚Äôt want to ask for help with these problems. I have grow up with a silver spoons in my mouth. I‚Äôve never hurt for money. I‚Äôm smart so I have never had to study. I‚Äôve never had to work for anything, until now. It doesn‚Äôt feel fair for me to get help if I of all people can‚Äôt help himself.

I can‚Äôt live if I can‚Äôt fulfill a dream, or a goal. I have no purpose. If I have no reason to live, then I don‚Äôt think I will be able to.

My mom works 2 jobs to support his lifestyle and when she comes home is forced to either dote on him, do his dishes/laundry or ride an exercise bike (she is fine with her weight, he wants her to be thinner). She is always exhausted and has no time to even talk to me. You would think that living a pampered life of sleeping, eating out and drinking without any responsibilities would make a person blissful, but somehow my dad manages to throw massive tantrums **all day long**. My mom enables him in these fits, she always has and will. All of my dad's rage is now directed at my mom and I behind closed doors, while he maintains a charming, well-adjusted persona to his many friends. He has also become territorial about my mom, if I am trying to spend time with her or talk to her, he will pull her away to do something for him. I imagine that he is suffering from depression paired with some personality disorder that I am unfit to diagnose. He will not change his behavior and lifestyle, he will never need to as long as my mom takes care of him. I feel completely alone and without a real family that cares about me. I still love both of my parents, but they are no longer interested in me and see me only as a burden or a thing that can help them when needed.

(Definitely aren‚Äôt each others firsts or anything). Everything was going great until she started to think I wanted more than just her. There are a few things I did that made her feel this way. #1 Before we started dating I had a threesome with two girls - she knew this going into the relationship, but as time went on it bugged her more and more. #2 I watched porn a few times in the first 6 months of the relationship. After the second time she told me she didn‚Äôt like it, I stopped and completely saw her side. I didn‚Äôt really understand the damage I was doing until I realized what I was actually doing. #3 I paused when she asked if I wanted her or a threesome - I am a very logical thinker, so when asked I was thinking about every scenario possible. I understand I made a mistake by pausing, but I did say her it just took longer than it should have. These three things happened about a year ago. She tried to get through it, but she couldn‚Äôt get through any of it. I tried to be even more romantic and do literally anything for her. I write her stories, songs, take her out, surprise her with trips, literally try to do anything to make her happy, but it‚Äôs all short lived.

156,"So I (19f) just quit the part time job I've had for the last year, and I'm starting my second year of university in September. Why I quit is irrelevant but now I'm looking for a new job and am torn between if I should work part time while doing 3-4 classes a semester, or not work and do 6 classes (a full load) every semester. The pros of working are that I could still maintain a steady income (even if it's small). The only stuff that I really pay for is car insurance ($150), gas (about $40 every 10-14 days), and my phone bill (about $60). On the other hand, if I'm only doing university with a full course load, I could finish maybe 2-3 semesters earlier. I also really enjoy volunteering with kids or other youth but can't find a job in that so it would be nice to volunteer more! I'm taking out gov't student loans regardless of if I'm working or not and the loan always comes out to way more than I need for one semester.

During the last 4 days my dad has gotten aggressive with me in public for: 

1.) being shocked at his use of the n-word LOUDLY during dinner at a restaurant within earshot of a black family and their children!!! :-0 
he was *apparently* intending to make a point against racism, but his outburst and use of the word still left me in shock and when i told him to please not use that word in my presence and esp in public he got really angry at ME  and said he did not like me ‚Äúcalling him out‚Äù like that. also refused to concede that his use of the word esp in public place, despite his ‚Äúintentions‚Äù was completely inappropriate.

2. the next day at another restraunt my dad was given large pieces of cooked onion on a taco he had ordered with no onion. instead of picking them off or politely informing the staff, he picked up the taco and threw it across the room onto the floor/wall and cursed really loudly and yelled abt restraunt staff in front of all the other diners and did not seem to understand that his actions were really over the top and embarrassing for his family. again he became somewhat hostile at me for exclaiming ‚ÄúDAD! omg please stop!‚Äù after he threw his food across the room.

3. tonight after dinner my sister dropped her dog (loveable cute sweetie pie golden teenager/puppy) off at parents house while she goes out of town for a wedding. immediately after she leaves, my dad starts slapping the dogs face with his hand and a dish towel to get the dog riled up to play tug of war (already kinda aggro). PS it is 10 pm and HE made decision to get the puppy hyped up in the first place even the he was originally laying in floor being a good boy. within minutes the pups tooth literally grazes my dads hand during tug of war game and my dads attitude shifts 180 degrees and he yells at dog that he will beat the dog if it ‚Äúbites‚Äù him. at this point i step in to try to distract my dad because i can see this is going downhill fast and i obv can not stand by and allow this dog to get beaten for literally nothing so i take dog outside. 

dad also comes outside and waters plants. dog and i are going back inside and dad steps in front and starts this weird gate keeping thing he does with his dogs when going back in the house where he yells and gets really angry and sometimes beats his dogs if they try to rush the door. so he tried to do that to my sisters dog who is 100+ pounds but the dog has no idea of this routine/expectation so he tries to go past and my dad literally grabs him by his lower back skin and drags him back out the door yelling at the dog. it was honestly awful. i said ‚Äúdad! please stop you are hurting the puppy! it‚Äôs just a baby and he doesn‚Äôt know!‚Äù and my dad turned on me and started yelling at me all crazy and idk something snapped and i told him he needed to work on his aggression and i would not stand by and allow him to scream at me! i am a grown woman and deserve the same respect he would give another adult. 

wtf do i do. if this were a friend or anyone other than my dad i would walk away and never look back because three things i cannot fucking handle are 1.racism 2.animal cruelty and 3. grown men screaming at women.

162,"I apologize in advance for a scatterbrained post - I'm still a bit shaken up. I'll try to give as much background as possible. This happened in the US. Sorry in advance for the long post. I'm omitting most identifying references to maintain my safety. Also - not my primary account, again safety concerns.

I accepted a job with a Home Health Agency as their Administrator a month ago. The following are verbal agreements. We never had any formal documentation on my offer letter because I didn't stay long enough to obtain them. The terms of employment were as such that I earn my license to be the Home Health Administrator in 90 days. I only worked for them for 7 business days before I quit. I quit because I realized in that time that the owner is doing a lot of illegal things. 

1) Patient negligence - The agency is not providing the appropriate care for the patients as they are supposed to - not providing medications as prescribed. And since they're still using paper charts, the nurses simply write in that medications were given even if they weren't. These include anticonvulsants, antihypertensive drugs, etc etc, for MULTIPLE patients. And this has been apparently going on for some time. And I just discovered this last night.

2) Employee Rights - The agency forbade Employee A from being my friend outside of work. The owner of the agency went so far to grab the phone from Employee A and demand I cease all communication to her. Later, I get a message from Employee A saying along the lines of ""hey, that wasn't me...that was the owner."" Later, she requested I stop communication with her as it's adding stress to her life. And so I did. 

3) My Paycheck - The agency refuses to pay me for my 7 days of work. I filed a case with the Department of Labor in my state who won't get involved until August 8th. I believe the Agency has until then to pay me for my work. Furthermore, agency alleges that I retain company documentation (which I do not) as a basis for not giving me the paycheck. The documentation in question is publicly available information that anyone can obtain from their local state offices. The Department of Labor rep who I talked with confirms even if I had it, she still needs to pay me. But I do not - and I invited them to search my apartment with police supervision. I suspect Employee A will not get paid for her work or receive her last few paychecks either.

4) Other Employees - The agency has made it a habit of not paying employees whenever they saw fit. For example, someone called the office asking about the discrepancy of the work hours vs reimbursed hours during one of the days I worked. Apparently, since the agency didn't get paid, they didn't pay the employee. In this case, the paycheck was regarding early July, and the Agency didn't get paid for the patient in January. Apparently, the agency also has the employees sign a waiver that says the employee forfeits that reimbursement if the agency isn't paid. They also force them to sign a waiver to forfeit their overtime benefits. If you don't sign, you don't get hired. There were two other employees (whose full names/contact info I don't know) who were fired and re-hired because they complained about their paycheck and subsequently backed down.

5) Equal Opportunity Employment - during my 7 days, I interviewed and worked to hire countless employees; easily well over 50 employees. The agency owner rejected most of my recommendations for various reasons - one guy had a thick African accent, another lady wasn't pretty enough, another was an ex drug abuser who had been sober over 10 years and so on and so forth. They wanted me to hire others instead - small and petite women because women work better with other women. And Asian women are smart and beautiful and so they can be the face of the company. Also this woman has to be married so that there would be no interoffice romances.

6) Items 2 through 5 happened a few weeks ago and I have since quit. Last night, Employee A called me. Being the nice person I am, I picked up. Immediately, she said she was going to quit. She asked me various ethical and moral questions on what she should do next - namely everything concerning Item #1. I was unaware of that until just last night. I recommended she document appropriately and ensure the patients are getting the right medications and why the errors happened. She did so and she quit earlier today.

Now for the shocking part...

After Employee A quit this morning, she called me to talk things out and feel more at ease. On our call, I asked her if she knew about a place, which she confirmed she knew. I texted her the address to meet at for brunch, just in case. We're discussing her life and how she feels so much better. All of a sudden, the agency owner shows up in the middle of our brunch (Of note, Employee A and I realized later that when I texted the address, I didn't text her personal number. Instead, I had texted the work number.). The owner threatens to hunt us down. Beyond that the owner will ensure that we will never work in this state ever again in a restaurant full of people. Apparently, the owner is well connected. The owner kept repeating - Do you know who I am? The owner alleges that we were in contact this whole time. The allegations continue to me working to dismantle the agency by remaining in touch with Employee A - which is FALSE. Then they ask why I'm retaliating and that I'll never get paid because I didn't do any work. And that I'm a liar and am withholding company documents - again FALSE. I then asked the owner to leave saying we're a couple of friends who are getting brunch and that the owner was intruding. The owner angrily leaves saying just you finish you brunch, I'm going to wait outside for you. At this point, I was incredibly threatened and so I called cops right away. When they showed up, the owner was indeed still waiting. The cops talked to the owner, then talked to me. Apparently, since this is all a civil matter, they weren't able to do much beyond making sure he left the parking lot. They had a shooting to contend with and they simply left. My friend, Employee A wanted to give witness testimony of everything but the cops simply got her info and said they'll be in touch if they need it. They recommended that I get a harassment restraining order to help with the situation - primarily because the owner didn't say I'm going to kill you, instead saying I'm going to hunt you down in a restaurant full of people.

Since then, I drove straight home and have been too scared to leave my residence. As the owner was my previous employer, the owner has all my personal and sensitive information - copies of ID and Social. 

I'm a very strong and resilient person. I have never been in a situation like this before and I've lived and worked in some pretty crazy places. Despite that right now, I'm scared. I'm scared for the patients who will potentially die because of neglect. I'm scared for the employees who don't get their right paycheck. I'm scared for the physical safety of both myself and Employee A. Please help, what do I do? What are my next steps? I'm completely lost and scatterbrained right now. 

tl;dr - I accepted a job a month ago and quit 7 days later due to multiple ethical, moral, and legal concerns. Since my last day, another employee quit as well. Over brunch, we were confronted by the owner of the agency, in person, making threats on our safety in a restaurant full of people. I called the cops who said I should file for a harassment restraining order after arriving there. I'm scared and have no idea what to do next.

167,"‚ÄúOne who seeks, shall find,‚Äù is what I really want to avoid here. I‚Äôm all too familiar with the kind of person who reads about a mental illness and then diagnoses themselves with it not long after. I‚Äôd hate to become one of those fucking emo teenagers who reads Google symptom lists and says ‚ÄúMm yes I have that‚Äù to one of the most relatable human emotions ever. In fact, for a long time I hadn‚Äôt taken mental illnesses, disorders, or a lot of psychiatry for that matter very seriously. Considering all the online gimmicky tests and how easily people could diagnose themselves I always saw it as the #relatable of the medical world. I always thought that unless something was physically wrong with the person (like the chemical imbalance in clinical depression) it was merely the person‚Äôs outlook or attitude that was the problem and they only needed to lighten up or something like that. After all, it was so easy for me to do, mostly. But then I couldn‚Äôt really speak for myself when for several years I‚Äôd entered into multiple depressive states, have tried to commit suicide, and have self-harmed. 

I recently found out more about bipolar disorder/manic depression. I had always thought it was just someone who switched moods abnormally frequently, but after going through the symptoms list I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like the past four years of my life were just read aloud. Of course, what with many mental disorders having to deal with emotions most people have, I‚Äôd felt this before, but not to this extent. The symptoms tab on the first Google result has me down to a tee, even the weight loss/gain. I have two concerns though:
-Honestly, what are the chances I have this disorder. After living like this for a while, I never even thought of it as a disorder. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if I was just relating to the description like most people do.
-The Wikipedia page on this is much more extreme, talking about the positive states/mania being so extreme that they interfere with work, and psychosis and hallucinations. None of these things have happened to me, nor have I noticed my ‚Äúmania‚Äù interfering with work to the extent which Wikipedia implies (I can see it affecting my work ethic and goals but nothing to the point where I‚Äôm jittering around when writing with a pencil).

I can see how it‚Äôs possible though. In the same sense of ‚Äúwhat are the chances I have it,‚Äù what are the chances I don‚Äôt?
-My mother has severe anxiety, and both Google and Wikipedia mention genetics being involved.
-I can see how the environment I grew up in could breed a bipolar disorder. For as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve been consistently stressed and socially isolated, but when I do get to spend time with friends, I tend to go, for lack of a better word, apeshit. Also regarding my environment, I‚Äôve always had an iffy relationship with my parents. I‚Äôm an only child, and they‚Äôre the only people who have always been there in my life. They don‚Äôt beat or sexually harass me or anything, I see that they love me and at the end of the day, I love them back. But most of the time, they break the monotony of any lonely stages I might be going through by berating me. They can be the only two people I see for weeks or months at a time and through most of it I‚Äôm met with discontent and disappointment. I wouldn‚Äôt go so far as to call it verbal or emotional abuse, but shit cuts deep.

But I digress. **TL;DR** I don‚Äôt have a car or anything, nor do I even know how to ‚Äúsee a doctor‚Äù or something like that, I‚Äôm really only ever concerned with my yearly physicals (which happened about two weeks ago, so can‚Äôt bring that up there for a while). I don‚Äôt want to bring this up with my parents because I don‚Äôt want them worrying about me. But rather than just sit here speculating I want a definitive answer already from someone reliable, anyone have any advice?

168,"I am worried that I may be addicted to making money. 

I am a college student, (though it is the summer for about two more weeks). I have very low expense compared to my income, plenty of savings (about 30,000 in cash and $20,000 in investments)). I think that I am addicted to making money. 

I am frugal with my earnings and don‚Äôt make money to spend and flash, I don‚Äôt participate in consumerism, and I save about 70% of what I make and invest it. 

This same post could be me bragging about myself but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm doing. I actually I feel like for one reason or another I can‚Äôt just ‚Äúchill. ‚Äú

Currently I work part time at a clothing store , I drive lyft, and I am working on a website/blog that I hope will make me profit a few years down the road. I also have money from various streams of income that are too complicated to bother explaining but in all total about $18k a year in addition to the part time and lyft driving. 

I am very financially literate and spend my spare time reading and educating myself on anything finance related, whether that is stocks, possible business ventures, investing strategies, or information on taxes. In fact, I am actually double majoring in finance and economics and hope to work as a financial analyst/risk management after graduating. 

Despite being very financially comfortable, I still get up at 5 AM to drive lyft from 6-9, usually work from like 10-5 at the clothing store, drive lyft again from the second I walk out of the door until about 8. A few night a week I work out from about 830 to 930. If I don‚Äôt work out I‚Äôll work on my website until I fall asleep to wake up and do the same thing. I‚Äôm essentially putting in 14+ hour work days on the regular. And it‚Äôs for no reason, I have zero financial anxiety but just can‚Äôt stop making as much money as possible. The only thing that can seem to stop me is spending time with my girlfriend. 

The thing is, is that I‚Äôm not unhappy or anxious, it‚Äôs like making money is a hobby and a borderline passion for me. It‚Äôs like trying to maximize a high score for a gamer. A gamer will grind on his game day in and day out, watching videos when he isn‚Äôt playing to see if he can pick up something new, when he isn‚Äôt playing or watching videos, he is thinking of ways that he can be better, or planning his next few days on the sticks. A gamer isn‚Äôt trying to get anything out of being good at the game except simply being good at the game and beat his previous high score. 

That is how I feel about money. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how I can make more money. And it‚Äôs not even to buy stuff. Literally whenever I am driving or it is slow at the clothing store, or even cooking or in the shower, I‚Äôll brainstorm assets that I can purchase or just think constantly about openings that I could possibly start a business in or skills that I could invest in myself to make more money. 

I know any type of addiction is not good. I am worried I could grow into one of those greedy, money-hungry types if I‚Äôm not careful, but I‚Äôm really really really hoping that my actions now will just set me up to relax and just live off of the great attention i paid to money in my younger years.

Now, after giving all that up to work and save, I've recently quit my job to try and live again. Although, nothing has made me happy. And it's been that way for some time now.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

A colleague was talking to me on the office floor this morning, and made a joke along the lines of ""saying gingers is ok but the anagram of it isn't in the US"" I think the most racist part is not just referencing the term unnecessarily, but that he thinks it's only bad in the US (we're not US based). We were sitting approximately 2 meters from two new graduates who are both black dudes, making his comment potentially directly offensive as well as generally offensive.

Issue is, he has Aspergers, pretty severe. He's great at his job, it's very technical and he is a natural. He's also very kind and a nice guy when he can be (e.g. I mentioned information is beautiful being a great website the other day, he brought in his copy of the book for me to borrow without me asking).

My parents are middle eastern/Anatolian and therefore are very strict. In that culture it is normal for parents to hit children and yell at them. But I hate it. I hate it when my mom hits me, when she tells me I ruin her life, make her life difficult and unhappy, when she calls me selfish, lazy and says I do nothing. I get perfect grades, do the dishes, do extracurriculars, cook for her. Even though I go to parties I don‚Äôt drink or smoke. But nothing is enough. When she hits me it‚Äôs when she‚Äôs mad. But it‚Äôs no abuse because it leaves no marks and it‚Äôs just things like slapping, or a slight kick or pulling my hair or ear. It doesn‚Äôt leave me in pain but I hate it. I get even more angry.

199,"So last year it was an ""edge lord"" but I stopped doing that. To be honest this year I started high school Yr 9 to be exact, and I met a really nice group of friends. I got along really close with them because we liked the same genre but they`re starting to get on my nerves with how ""depressed they are"" I`m not trying to say I think they don`t have it, but they constantly say how they wanna die or some other stuff on how their life sucks. I care about them I really do! But I`ve started feeling really irritated on how they`ve been acting. Like if I get upset I sometimes scratch myself, it's not bad I just get really angry. While doing it I started noticing them doing it for no reason. One of them talks about how sad she is and the other talks about how her sisters call her names. I once showed one of them a meme. (Basically hard to swallow pills, with the pills showing being sad for an hour doesn`t make you depressed) And the girl says what if you`ve been depressed since you were 11 yrs old? I`m really tired of it and I tend to snap at them everytime they show how depressed they are. I`m trying to fix it but at times I don`t even want to talk to them... Please help",07Aug2018,1
200,"So I‚Äôm currently in my second year of community college and I‚Äôm expecting to transfer within the next school year. But because of family problems, long story short, I feel like if I stay longer at home I won‚Äôt be able to focus on my studies completely. I just want to get rid of feeling angry, stressed out, or sad almost ever week. Then today I had this crazy idea that I should apply to be in the Navy. Not only do I get some ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù for myself (I think...) but I would also be away from my family (or hoping to be...?)

So my question is if I should go through with it. Would I be able to get my education done while being in the Navy? Honestly, the main thing that is stopping me from doing so is because of my two younger siblings. And the fear of the classes I‚Äôve taken not being transferable.

Early Next month I would have worked in the restaurant for a year and feel that it is high time I get a raise. I have picked up more responsibilities in the restaurant like closing and counting the tills at the end of a night and am happy to take on more responsibilities (opening, social media marketing, shift manager, ect). I know alot of the people I work woth get about 13 euro and hour and I'd like the same.

There is a huge turnover in the restraunt that I work at with approx 6 employees on the cashier's and serving tables ect. Me and 2 others are the only ones who have stayed around since I staryed and it seems like I am becoming more of a senior in that workplace as I have worked in that specific restaurant longer then half of the currently employees and know abit more on how things work around there 

I already have a bachelor degree (not related to hospitality) but I don't know if that could be used as a negotiation lever. 

Currently I think I'll ask my manager for a meeting and use the current reason why I believe I deserve a raise

1. Worked there for a year.
2. Picked up more responsibilities
3. Happy to take on more responsibilities.

I had an affair with a woman from work and it didn‚Äôt end well. She cheated on her boyfriend with me and he also works where we do. She is 22, I am 28. 

Since it didn‚Äôt end well, she told me if I try to talk to her or her boyfriend about anything non-work related then she would file for harassment against me. Okay no problem! Since then it has been 100% business conversations. 

I found out through a coworker that she is pregnant. The coworker doesn‚Äôt know about the affair, but he asked if I knew about it because he knew she and I were really close. I know it‚Äôs mine because she and her boyfriend don‚Äôt have sex. That‚Äôs why she was with me. The last time she and I had sex (every time was unprotected) was on June 19th. She has now, for the past three weeks, been throwing up every day and decided to take a test. 

She and I have pre-discussed that if she would ever get pregnant that she would get an abortion. I am not afraid she will try to have the baby. But her boyfriend has no idea about our affair and if he knew she was pregnant then that would ruin them. Her parents can‚Äôt know, she doesn‚Äôt have many close friends to turn to.

230,"I had a blog years ago. It lasted about five years, hundreds of posts, but is now done since 2013, no updates. I still watch the traffic sometimes though.

Anyway, I‚Äôve seen some really weird visitor behavior lately. 

There‚Äôs a visitor (has appeared with a few different IPs from a few different cities all close-ish to each other, but clearly the same based on computer/OS stats and the pattern of pages visited repeatedly) who started visiting about a month ago. 

The first few visits were ‚Äúnormal‚Äù inasmuch as they spent several minutes on one post, followed a link out, came back, went to another post, etc, seeming to be exploring the blog following a thematic trail of posts in my archive, went into the comments sometimes. Was pretty typical behavior for a reader based on what I‚Äôve seen over the years.

Then they started visiting a couple months ago several times, a few days apart, with the same two posts (always getting there via unknown keywords on google). I thought maybe they really like those two posts and are continuing to mull them over or use them for research.

But now starting like a month ago it‚Äôs been almost every day, at random times of day (but never, like, 3am; within waking hours)...they appear and stay for about two seconds, go to the other post, and leave. Always just those same two posts.

I‚Äôd think it was some sort of robot automatic behavior, except it isn‚Äôt quite daily (usually daily, but sometimes will skip a day or two), and the order in which the two posts are visited is sometimes different (usually the pattern I‚Äôve seen is ABBAABBA where the second page visited on the last visit becomes the first visited on the next visit; but then occasionally ABABAB will happen).

This seems like odd behavior. I‚Äôd assume some sort of bot or webcrawler but can anyone explain the logic of this behavior? Why only those two posts after the first couple times? Why the sometimes changing IP/location (there‚Äôs a main one it usually is but like once a week it will be somewhere else, a few different alternates)? Why were the first few visits long but now they‚Äôre only a few seconds?

232,"So, I kind of need to provide the whole picture before I ask my question... so I apologize for the wall of text.

My first job outside of retail was working as an HR/Payroll administrator for a small company. I worked there for 3 years, then I got a corporate job that I thought was going to be more tech-related (my degree was in technology). Turns out it wasn't really what I expected and was monotonous data entry that wasn't for me - I quit after a year. Then I worked as an Office Manager at a college because I didn't know what to do with myself but the college working environment sounded nice, it kept me busy, and I took classes for free.

\*\*I have to make a note that this is where I started considering a graduate program that sounds exactly what I'd enjoy doing for a living (UX research &amp; design). This is also where my SO and I decided we are moving across the country after years of debate, with our move estimated in July 2019. Also, the graduate program is conveniently offered at the state university we are moving close to.\*\*

After a year, I was offered my HR/Payroll position back at the small company for very competitive pay that the college couldn't come close to - so I took it. The downside is it's hourly pay and I don't really have PTO. Now, 5 months later, the college wants me to come back and fill an open position they think my skills are a great match for (student outreach coordinator)... again, for competitive pay (roughly 5k more than I make now and salary). They also are aware I am moving in a year so that's obviously not a concern.

From an experience perspective in relation to my desired graduate program, neither position is a match. From a pay and benefit perspective, the college job is great. My coworkers at the college were much better than my current HR/Payroll job. **But I don't want this to make a smudge on my resume/CV**. I'm concerned that bouncing around the jobs will make me look like a flaky person, and maybe I am being flaky. Maybe I should try to just negotiate for more pay and salary at my current job?

233,"About 2 weeks ago I made a joke directed at a girl(let‚Äôs call Sarah) in my friendship group. It was about how her teeth were terrible before she got braces. The way I saw it; her teeth were horrible but they  look great now so why would it offended her, it‚Äôs in the past. She didn‚Äôt see it like that. My best friend came to Sarah‚Äôs defence and told me to apologise. It took me about 20 minutes because I‚Äôm not the best at that kinda stuff. Throughout the 20 minutes she got on my nerves so I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm apologising. Stop getting angry at me. Also fuck you‚Äù the ‚Äòfuck you‚Äô on the end isn‚Äôt abnormal for me. I tell my friends that jokingly when ever they offer advice to me. I still take their advice at the end. She called me crying. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. She‚Äôd been so nice to me.

The next day, I‚Äôm telling her about my money problems and I say ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt care, but I appreciate you listening‚Äù. Most people I talk to about my issues just listen, rarely do they care. It was too genuine for her to care. Once again, she called me crying. 


I saw her the next day, she ignored me the entire day. I decide I‚Äôll write a letter because I find that easier to do when apologising or talking about my feelings. She thanks me for it indirectly and things go back to how they were.

Later that week we went to a gathering and I got drunk. I said somethings and did somethings that scared her and Sarah. Just grabbed her by the arm aggressively, nothing outside the law.

237,"I need advice on how to politely decline help without hurting someone's feelings. Shortly after my second kid was born, my mom started coming over 1-2 days per week to help us out. My husband works several nights per week and, at that time, we really needed/appreciated the help. After I returned to work and baby #2 started daycare, my mom would still come by once a week to help pick up the kids, fix dinner, help put the kids to bed, etc. I have a disability which prevents me from driving so it was very helpful to have her around to lighten the burden a bit on nights when my husband was at work. I've been really, really appreciative of all she's done to help us out. Now baby #2 isn't a baby anymore and will be turning two soon. Husband's work schedule still sucks, but it feels normal to us now and we've adapted reasonably well. I'm comfortable transferring my kids on public transit and ride-share services. Despite my disability, the kids and I are pretty self-sufficient. My problem is: I don't know how to tell my mom to back off. She's the kind of person who loves to be busy and helping others. I know it means a lot to her to be involved with her grandkids (and the kids absolutely love her). But I need some space! The evenings when my mom comes by have become so stressful to me. The kids get all hyped up and I feel like, despite having the extra help, I can't get anything done at home. She's always trying to help out by cleaning up the house, reorganizing cabinets, etc. - which, again, is so, so nice of her, but I kinda just want control over my own home again. I feel so guilty because I know how lucky we are to have her and I can appreciate her desire to make our lives easier, but I feel like I'm reaching a point where I dread the days she comes over because I just want to be left alone to parent my kids and run my household in peace. I'm worried it would break her heart if I asked her to cut down the days she comes over. I've tried a few times just casually saying, ""You know, if you ever wanted to take a week off here and there, it's really no big deal,"" but she just responds, ""Oh, it's no problem at all."" Any advice on how to handle this tactfully?",07Aug2018,1
238,"A little backstory: 

My dad grew up in a very poor and crime ridden area with very little money to make ends meet. When he was an early teen my grandfather committed suicide and he and his siblings found him. It has most certainly caused incredibly large amounts of emotional trauma for him that he never seriously addressed and simply buried underneath the surface. He worked very hard and got into really good schools, managing to escape his past. He landed an amazing job after he met my mom, had 3 kids and settled down and was going to be rich. Sadly his company was dissolved and he was laid off when the economy collapsed in 2009 ish. Since then he was unable to land a stable career in that field and was forced to shift paths entirely. But he never really found reliable income and my mom was forced to take the majority of our family support. I am almost certain this event is what slowly broke him, and led him to start selling and using again. 

Now for the problem:

A couple of days ago my younger sister sent me photographs from my moms phone of pills and other drugs she found along with screenshots from my dads phone showing deals gone wrong and him starting trouble with people related to substance abuse. 

My mom has decided recently to leave him and it is only now surfacing that this was the straw that broke the camels back. My father had hidden this from us since we were younger and refuses to open up to anyone. I‚Äôve never seen him cry and he‚Äôs been extremely confrontational when my mom has tried to help him clean up his act. 

She hopes them separating will be a wake up call for him but I am seriously worried about his mental state. My mom is as well but she has fought with him over this long enough and deserves to be in a happy relationship. I am contemplating confronting my dad about this because I am his oldest son and I feel as though it may mean more coming from me, but I‚Äôve never done anything like this before and I know I‚Äôm walking on eggshells. What should I say to him? Should I say anything to him? I was planning to talk with my mom and other siblings [20M] [18F] before I took action. ",07Aug2018,1

246,"Background:  I got stung in four separate spots on my legs last Tuesday - across my left ankle looks kind of like a scrape, above the left knee is miscellaneous pock mark looking spots, the upper back part of my left leg has an egg-sized welt, and there are tentacle marks just above the back of my right knee. I got through the initial pain that day, and all was well - until Sunday evening. The marks started itching pretty badly, and I couldn't sleep well despite trying everything I could think of to stop the itching.

What I've done:  I tried aloe vera gel, calamine lotion, hydrocortisone cream, benadryl, meat tenderizer, vinegar, cold showers, hot showers... none of it helped. I went to see a doctor yesterday morning, and they gave me a steroid shot and prescribed steroid pills (prednisone), a steroid cream (acetonide USP 0.1%), and antibiotics because they were worried about bacterial infection. I've also taken some Aleve last night and this morning, in case it could help with the swelling, but I'm not sure if it's doing anything. It may have helped a bit, but I am still maddeningly itchy.

What worked:  The only relief I've found is if I keep freezer packs on them, but that's only for as long as they stay cold and applied.

248,"I had a crush on a girl at my class, she was pretty in my eyes, both physically and behavoir. I deemed her as an exhibit or a painting, something that I'll only see and dream about but never quite touch.

About about a week ago, something happened- something that I could only fantasize and dream about. The girl pm'ed me opening up a conversation between me and her and it lasted up for about an hour. This was in chat.

The next day, I have noticed something different about her. She tends to talk to beside me to maybe approach me somehow? But we still have never had a conversation in personal. I was really feeling like I was infatuated at that time, like I would think about her most of the day. But I saw this as a bad thing because how can I approach and get to be friends with her if I'll be too focused thinking about if she'll like me, it will become unnatural then awkward.

On the day after that, we had a special guest that was going to have a talk so we had to sit in the our auditorium. I sat directly behind her with my friend. Sometime in the talk, while she was looking, I tricked my friend into looking at my OK sign (index and thumb forming a circle, all other fingers straight up) - a generic ""made you look"" joke. And then she did it to me. Then again when we were exiting the auditorium. I was still very much infatuated at that time, I wanted to get to know her more, but everytime I have the oppurtunity- I waste it. I really wanted to talk to her but my self critic had other plans.

Throughout the week she kept doing that to me again and again, ok signs after ok signs, even going across the room just to do that. She even sent me a picture with her doing that. But I still havent talked to her yet. At this point I was really feeling like trash, I keep wasting oppurtunities.

Now fast forward to today. I feel like something clicked and now I criticize her looks her behaviours. I feel like shes not that beautiful anymore and it feels like I'm going crazy. What happened? I loathe her now, just like with every girl I know. I don't understand how you transition from liking someone to loathing them. What do I do? How do I accept her flaws and see it as her beauty?

I (f25) have always been a sweet tooth and a big eater, even tough my weight is quite normal.

I'm staying at my parent's house at the other side of the country for a couple of days for holidays before starting a new job. 

Tonight I woke up in the middle of the night because I was thirsty. Instead of drinking something I went to the kitchen opened the fridge and took the box of cookies with me, which I opened earlier in the evening. I ate 2 cookies in bed and fell asleep again. Later in the night apparently I woke up again and eat more cookies. Then, I remember waking up at 6am and finishing the last piece and falling asleep again (so in sum, I ate about 9 cookies in bed)

When I woke up in the morning, finding the empfty cookie box beside me I couldn't believe what happened and barely remembered the night. Also, usually, I am quite precise when it comes to sleeping time and brushing teeth etc. 

I don't know but this actions concerns me. Am I overreacting?  Has anything like that happened to you before?

""Hi, my name is Sarah and I'm calling as an employment specialist. Can you hear me okay?""

""Yes hello, I would like to please request that I am taken off of your calling list.""

267,"I have social anxiety and I'm socially awkward. However, I'm trying to become more social. I've been trying to come out of my shell a bit. However my father is being VERY critical on how I interact with people.

Like I've been trying to purchase items on my own. I would always have other people do it for me because I would be too afraid to interact with the cashier. Recently I was out with my father, and I purchased some clothes. When I got to the checkout counter, I smiled and said ""hi"" to the cashier. She said ""hello"". I didn't say anything else. She rang my purchases up, bagged them, and told me ""Have a nice day"" and I told her ""Thank you, you too"". My father was observing me. He told me, ""You need to loosen up a bit. Next time speak up. Speak like you have some nuts. And also try to make small talk sometimes, don't be so quiet.""

Even though I was nervous, I thought I handled that interaction well. And I don't think it matters whether or not I spark up a conversation with a cashier. They're there to do their job, not to be your best buddy. I didn't feel the need to say anything else. And I think a forced conversation is worse than none.

Another time my father and I were out getting some sausages from a sausage stand. The guys at the stand were talking to me and they asked me, ""How old are you?"" I told them, ""18"". They asked me, ""Are you in school?"" I told them, ""Yes."" They then asked me, ""What school?"" At first I didn't hear them, so there was a slight pause. I said, ""I'm sorry?"" My father in a mean tone said, ""He asked what school you go to."" I told him ""I go to such and such university."" And that was it.

My father told me, ""You didn't handle that interaction that well."" He told my brother about it and my brother said, ""Yeah, you're growing up to be a man. You don't want to be awkward."" I mean dang, if I didn't hear the guy what am I supposed to do? I think I did the right thing by saying, ""I'm sorry?"" so the guy could repeat himself.

And lastly, my father and I were out shopping once and I ran into a guy I went to high school with. He goes, ""What's up such and such."" I go ""Hey such and such."" He then asked ""How you been?"" I said ""Pretty good how about you?"" he goes, ""Good."" My father told me ""You should've gave him some dap (a bro handshake). Next time when another dude acknowledges you like that give them some dap. You're growing up to be a man. That interaction was kind of awkward.""

I didn't find it awkward at all. I was never friends with this person in school. However we were cool and always cordial. That's why I just chose to say what's up to him and really nothing more than that. If it was someone who I really liked or talked to pretty often, then perhaps I would've made more intimate contact.

But yeah I'm trying to work on becoming more social, but my father is giving me a hard time. It seems like no matter what, he ALWAYS finds something I did wrong in an interaction.

tl;dr: I'm trying to become more social. I have social anxiety. I'm trying to interact with people more, but my father is giving me a hard time. He is overly critical on how I interact with people. In all my interactions, my father always has something negative to say. He never says anything positive. I mean my interactions may not be perfect, but can you at least cut me some slack for trying? It's making me upset because I feel like I can't do anything right. What do you guys think?",07Aug2018,1

   I M18 grew up in a very religious home with very conservative parents, so anything out of the ordinary was considered wrong.

272,"Ok so, This all started last week, I got a call while I was at work that a GOOD friend of mine's boyfriend had gone through her apartment and tore it up head to toe. It was a literal wreck. Because of this, her landlord had filed an eviction that very same day. She was hysterical. I left work early, came over, calmed her down, and started bagging up all of her belongings and stuffed them all in my truck. It was an awful breakup, we even went to the police station to file a report/restraining order. The relationship was horrible: physical fights, screaming, cheating...you name it basically. She gave everything to a guy that manipulated her. I was so happy when she was finally out of it.

Being the kind-hearted person that I am, I offered for her to stay at my place for a week or so until she can get back on her feet. I've always had a soft spot for this girl, she has been through a lot in her life and has generally been a very good friend to me but at the same time, ALWAYS attracts drama. She is very good at telling me what I want to hear...manipulative even. She just can't help herself, and to make matters worse I found out yesterday she is STILL in contact with the boyfriend that did it...and THATS the final straw for me. To compound, she is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and has not been taking her medicine for quite some time..so the mood changes on a dime. 

It's a fucking mess. One second we'll be just sitting down watching TV eating dinner, everything's fine, then BAM after a couple drinks (I like to have a glass of wine every night before I sleep) or one bad text and I'm headed to bed, she'll go straight to her phone to find someone to pick her to go to the bar or god knows where. It's like clockwork. There's only a few hours a day I can actually get a point across to her.

It's causing me anxiety as well because my roommate absolutely despises the situation and can't stand her. I don't blame him. It's his place too. I feel horrible about it..but at the same time seem to keep fueling it as well. I can't help myself. I've never been in this position before so I keep doing things for her because I want so badly for her to give herself a chance to get her life back. But that has all been for naught, she isn't taking any of it seriously.

I work a good, stable 9-5 job, I can't afford to have someone like that around me because it's been affecting my life. I need advice on how to approach someone like this and tell them they need to leave without them freaking out and potentially causing harm to my place. I have her mom's phone number and I am seriously considering reaching out to her to have her come take her things back home.

I'm feel stuck and don't really know how to handle this. I did not want to get caught up in this nightmare. If anyone has dealt with a similar situation I would love to hear how it played out. I just need advice. Fuck",07Aug2018,2

274,"About 6 months ago my girlfriend and I moved into this awesome new apartment in a very convenient location.  It's a really nice 2 bedroom, setup like a townhouse so the bedrooms are on the upper floor with the living and kitchen areas downstairs.

At first glance it was perfect, but as we started to settle more, we really we have REALLY shitty neighbors.  The first warning sign was their dog.  They constantly would let their dog run around off leash in a shared courtyard (it's an un-fenced courtyard with a playground and about 10 apartments all have patios facing into it).  Unfortunately, we have a dog too, so we'd be taking her out back and all the sudden, and without looking, they'd let their dog out who would bolt right up to us and start barking and spazzing out at our dog.  

We complained numerous times to the landlord who said he had spoken to them and did nothing, so finally we got so fed up we called animal control, who called and gave them a warning (we had video evidence of the dog issue).

Since then we haven't had any direct issues, but we've taken note of a couple of things.  The apartment is more like a clown car than an actual apartment, with a seemingly neverending flow of people coming in and out of there.  I feel like I see a new face every week.  On top of that, some of their guests act... erratically.  For example, my girlfriend was letting our dog out back a little past midnight, and this woman comes RUNNING at the dog.  She sees my girlfriend, says ""oh, sorry"" and then ducks into that apartment through the patio door.  On a different occasion, I had to call the cops on a guy who was acting like he was on drugs and dangerous.  It was 1am, he was out front of our complex (right outside the door that leads to their apartment), and he starts flailing around, talking to himself, walking in between cars and looking in windows.  I finally called the police but he was ""gone"" by the time they showed up.  I am 90% sure he just went inside to that apartment.

Well, on Friday morning last week, my girlfriend takes our dog out for the morning and sees what looks like a big puddle of cheese and broccoli soup dumped just outside of our patio door.  She spots the pan about 10 feet away, under a bush outside of another neighbors house.  

I've told the landlord and he said ""I'll reach out and ask if it's theirs.""  Yeah, lot of good that will do.  I honestly don't know how to deal with these people, and I'm sick of having to worry about stupid shit like this.

What really infuriates me is that we very nearly didn't have them as neighbors.  There were two identical units available at the same time, and we picked this one more or less by chance.  We could have just as easily picked the other, and not had to deal with these jerks.

Any advice?  I've had crappy roommates and neighbors before, but this is on a whole new level....",07Aug2018,0

276,"[This post explains the bulk of why I feel this way.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/812dfp/my_mother_is_not_a_blessing_shes_an_atrocity/?st=JKJC3W3B&amp;sh=8ec74993). To TL;DR this, my family situation was always fucked, my mother never treated me well at all. I just constantly felt like I wasn't good enough. I never felt comfortable around her, and since per my family situation I lived with her, I preferred being alone all the time. I just don't like my mother at all, I hate her, I want her to die. She's been nothing but pain.

I look around and it looks like socializing is just so easy to do, I may have high functioning autism but still, socializing still just difficult as all hell. I hate having to study this as if it was calculus, which came more natural to me than social stuff.

My teachers throughout school were the only people I truly felt close to, even if I acted out most in elementary school. By middle school I did so less, and just completely repressed how I felt. Eventually in high school life had its changes and I just felt the massive downward spiral again.

My cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. I also feel a much stronger connection to than my mom and stepdad. That's just a testament to how they treat me as opposed to my mom and stepdad, they feel more like family than mom, and especially more than stepdad. Unlike my mom, my cousins never eluded to the fact that my birth was a mistake, and rubbed that in on me. Unlike my stepdad, they never hated me for being an atheist, threatened to throw me out of the car if I were gay. I'm not gay, thankfully, because obviously my stepdad would have treated me much worse than he already does. I know it seems petty to worry about, but stuff like that still just upsets me, like a direct notion of ""I do not love you unconditionally"".

The worst part is, my mother has never been told of how I feel about all this. She never created any environment where I could express myself without fear of being hit, yelled at, anything. And because of how frequent this was the case she treated me like this, I kept holding on to the few moments she'd act like she loved me at all. These were so rre of moments I didn't dare try making them happen less often. My grandfather doesn't know this, my aunts, no one. And as it seems, I'm the only one in my mom's family who feels like this. My cousins, they clearly love their mom, their dad, they have much healthier environments than I. They get to visit friends much more frequently, I stay at home too scared to ask my mom to do these things, she rarely allowed it anyways. Stuff like this has been driving me to try killing myself since 2015. I plan on getting a therapist via my university since such services are offered. However they still need my insurance info, which is provided by my mother's job. That's about the closest thing to love I feel like I'll ever experience.

I currently live with my dad and stepmom who have a much better environment, but still there is this internal struggle going about.
I know I need therapy. If me using my insurance info with my university ever gets word to my mom, what do I even do or say?
She's made charades since our fight in January where I finally left her house (it's in the post linked in the start of the post) as though she wants to patch things up. She of course doesn't know that I just hate her. I damn near killed myself the night of our fight, and countless others even before then. Every time I take the train to work, I get the strong urge to go to the station near the bridge and just jump,

As one can gather from this, I just feel worthless, like no one xares about me, like no one will ever love me at all, especially women in particular...
where do I even start?

TL;DR
Abused by my mom for my whole life and she doesn't know I view it as such. I was never comfortable around her, but gave the illusion that I was so she wouldn't abuse me further. I'm using her insurance coverage she has on me to get a therapist. I'm not sure how health insurance works, but I have a feeling that me getting a therapist, even if my uni's is free, may get word to our provider, thus my mom.

Not sure how / if to tell her how I truly feel about her, that our relationship was never good, and in the foreseeable future never will be. This also has caused problems with my self worth, many suicidal thoughts and attempts.",07Aug2018,0

278,"So I'm 18 now, and my parents have been divorced since I was 1. I have lived with my mom since then, and very rarely seen my father. Back in junior high I developed a habit of skipping class, once it got so bad I managed to con my way out of 10 days in a row.

This drove my mother crazy, she's always been quite nice and calm with me but this episode could've given her an aneurysm. Repeatedly whenever I would lie about school she would go on screaming rants about how I was ""just like my father"" and why he was so terrible. I guess she was trying to frighten me? And later, when I had been skipping for a while, she got home one day, grabbed my iPod and a hammer, and went straight to the balcony.

I've talked to a few friends about this and they were pretty shocked, but to me it's just what I've grown up with. Although now I am thinking more about my past I start to worry. Would you say this counts as emotional abuse / manipulation? That's just been a common diagnosis among my friends so I wanted a second opinion.

283,"Hi there, 

I'm in Ontario, Canada, and I have graduated from a reasonably esteemed university with a Bachelor of Arts in History and English with a fairly high GPA. Unfortunately, mine is a 5 year program, not a 4 year program, as I am also obtaining a Bachelor of Education (concurrently). However, despite it being ""concurrent"", it's more complicated than that. The program is 5 years long, and each year (1-3) I paid an extra 2000$ in tuition, spent a month doing a teaching placement, and took an extra full year course toward my B.Ed. In year 4, I graduate with my B.A., and I am expected to return for year 5, an 8 month stint of placements and in-class education courses, at which point (April 2019) I will graduate with my B.Ed. 

Now I'm stuck though, because I really don't want to finish my B.Ed. I love teaching, I'm good at it, and I'm passionate, but the job market in Ontario is absolutely TERRIBLE. I can't leave the province because my girlfriend doesn't want to move and obtaining a job here is not going to happen for a long, long time. So instead, I'm going to following my second love: marketing. I'm a good writer, a good arguer, I like to describe and encourage (as many teachers do) and I've always loved the idea of a career in marketing. So now I have basically two choices and I was hoping some of you nice redditors could help me decide:

OPTION 1) Spend 8 more months at university finishing my bachelor of education, graduate, then go to college for a graduate certificate in marketing, putting me into the job market in 2020 with a B.A., a B.Ed, and a College Diploma. This option gives me three degrees, but would a B.Ed be helpful on my resume? Would it just be another degree so a bit more education? Could I swing an education degree as providing useful skills for marketing (like communication, explaining complex ideas in a simple manner, writing, presentations, etc.?) It would also give me an alternate career path in the future, and let me travel and teach abroad if I wished to.

OPTION 2) Drop out of my B.Ed. Now. Apply for college. Now. Start college for a graduate certificate in marketing next month, putting me into the job marketing in 2019 with a B.A. and a college diploma.  I have a B.A. now, but I have already spent 6 grand toward my B.Ed over the last 4 years, and spent 4 months of placement time and completed 24 units toward it. If I leave university now, I won't have to spend another 22, 000$ (including living expenses) on a second degree, but I'll lose the 6 grand I already put toward it and all the time I put toward it - if I drop out, I'm done, I'm not allowed to come back and finish it. I also have a lease signed in my current university town until this April so I'd be on the hook to pay 7 months of rent still, even if I left. 

So reddit, can you help me? Of course if degrees were free and grew from the soil I'd definitely take the B.Ed, can't hurt, but they're not and its going to cost me 22, 000$ to finish it. Is it worth it to stay in school 8 more months, spend 22K more, and get the B.Ed then go to marketing school? Or is it better to just cut my losses, lose the money and time I've already put into the B.Ed, pay the 3500$ for my lease that I've already signed, and go start in marketing school next month? I'm really struggling to make this big, life altering decision so any help would be awesome!

**TL;DR: Finishing a B.Ed this year. Already sunk 6000$ and a fair bit of time into it, but it will take 8 more months and 22, 000$ more to complete, and I'm 100% going to marketing school after. Should I stick it out and finish my B.Ed then go to marketing school and end up with a B.A., a B.Ed, and a College diploma in marketing? Or should I cut my losses, drop out of Teacher's College, pay my way out of my lease in the university town I live, and go to marketing school now, but without getting a B.Ed?**",07Aug2018,1

293,"First post here, I guess I've officially reached the point of asking people on the internet which direction I should be taking my life major life decision.

I'll try to keep it brief. 

I'm 23 years old, I just recently (May 2018) graduated a small community college which a degree in Commercial Electrical Systems.
I went into this program with almost no knowledge about what being an electrician entails. I had a lot of family who encouraged me into going into that specific major. 
I knew after the first semester of school that it wasn't for me. There is certain things about it I enjoy, but more that I don't enjoy that outweighs it. I told myself I would finish my degree, because I didn't want to drop out. Sure enough I finished, and I have been working in the field for about a year and a half now (was working part time during school).

I feel like I have given it a fair shot, but I am very unhappy with my job. I come home everyday dreaming about what I could do instead. 
I've learned a lot about myself in the last year, and I've recently began trading stocks. Almost all the money from my paycheck goes into investing.
I've been considering a career switch to something business related, finance perhaps, or even real estate.
I fortunately still live with my parents, and they understand that I don't like my chosen career in electrical. They are supportive of me trying something different. 

I guess I just don't know what to do from here. I feel TERRIBLE that I wasted two years getting a degree in a career field I don't even like. 
Part of me is fearful that if I get another degree, in business or something of that nature, the same thing might happen again. I've been looking into potential jobs business related and almost all of them want a bachelor's degree.
I feel like I'm running out of time to make something happen.
My end goal is to have a career which I can advance in, and actually ENJOY working.

Part of me wants to take the risk and start a business, because this would be my best opportunity to do so, but I don't know where to start.

What should I do? 
 
Go back to college? 
Start a business?
To to find an internship without prior education? (Very doubtful)

294,"Context: I'm a socially awkward penguin and have really low self-esteem. Most of the time, I think I do such a shitty job on things that I feel should be second nature to me by now (e.g. writing, carrying on smooth-flowing conversations, etc.). I've been thinking of applying to graduate schools for more than a year now but I always think I'm not ready. I'm just not at the level I believe I should be to get accepted for graduate school so I set my application aside. ""I'll probably just get rejected if I apply now"" is what I always think. 

Anyway, I graduated three years ago from a communication course, with a major in science communication. From where I'm from, the highest grade is a 1 and the lowest is a 5.  My GWA was 1.93. After graduating, I immediately worked in the government (under the department of S&amp;T). Communicating the benefits of science and helping grassroots communities with it was something I really enjoyed. However, I figured having research experience would help me with my grad school applications so I resigned and transferred to a university. I'm a research assistant and I've presented a few papers in some conferences. 

I'm interested in taking a masters degree on international relations, international development, global affairs, cultural studies, or something along those lines.

295,"Last year, my sister was diagnosed with an aggressive and rare form of breast cancer. Shortly after her diagnosis, her boyfriend proposed (I had only met him twice prior to this). She is now finishing up her treatment and will be getting married this September at which time she will be in remission. Through this whole experience, I really learned so much more about the type of people she and her fiance¬¥ are and the type of love they have for each other. It is truly remarkable. I want to use this as a focal point of my MOH speech because I have so much to say about it, but I also realize there is so much more to her life and theirs together than cancer. Is is tasteful to talk so much about it?  


As an added layer to this dynamic, my sister was previously married so this will be my second MOH speech for her in 8 years. We were also not very close growing up and we really only became close within the past 5 years or so (I still harbored a lot of resentments and trauma from past experiences surrounding her that required me to go to therapy as an adult). Given all of this, I'm sort of struggling with limited material and the material that I do have is really profound but also highly sensitive. Of note, everyone in attendance at the wedding knows about her cancer and she will not be wearing a wig at the ceremony.

I  am now unemployed, disabled, and trying to figure out how I am going to  provide for myself in the future. I compose music and am decent with  sound design.

While I can walk and talk,  go on a small hike or float in a lake to relax my back, the pain and  fatigue keep me limited to what I can do.

This is why I feel sound design and songwriting to be an option for potential income.

I  would like to write theme songs for businesses, videos, blogs, youtube  channels, products, personal theme songs, audio books, commercials.

Who  on here would be willing to give me a chance to earn some income this  way? If not, where should I go and who should I contact?

I'd say my humor is situational, something happens I think of something witty and blurt it out with no further thought. I usually get a laugh with my jokes but it seems like:
a.) No one takes me seriously 
b.) People think I'm dumb
 
I understand how people dont take me seriously but why do people think I'm dumb? Isn't wit a positive trait? Do people take themselves too seriously? Do I take myself too lightly?

307,"I'm not sure that this is the right place to ask this, but I feel it's worth a shot.

Also this will sort of be all over the place but I need to get it out of my head.

1. My husband(M30) and I(F28), are desperate for a fresh start in our life. We currently live with his parents and are having some difficulty finding a place to rent within our tight budget. Our financial situation isn't great for many reasons, and husband is the only one working at this time. (I could, but choose not to, and husband doesn't want me to. See 4.)

2. We know that we are unhappy in our town/state. I've been here my whole life and husband has ended up here several times as a ""safety net"". 

3. My mother has always made me feel like I could never move out of state because she would miss me too much/its not safe to be away from family/I'm the only kid of hers that gives a shit/etc...

4. And now, my husband and I have a 4 month old. I stay home with the baby due to the cost of daycare and lack of consistent and reliable babysitters. Now we can't just get up and go do anything without a plan. And now the guilt about leaving the state gets laid on extra thick.

So here are my real questions:
Is it right or ""okay"" for my mom to tell me I should stay in one place?

Is it possible for my husband and I to start over, even with a baby in tow?

How do we figure out where we want to go?

Should we just give up any and all hopes and dreams we may still have and keep looking for a place to live where we currently are?

I'll be happy to clarify anything in the comments and am so grateful for any and all words of encouragement and criticism. I'll take it all. Stories, advice, cautions. Whatever.

308,"Hey everyone. I am a 23 year old guy who has just graduated from a very good technical university as an engineer. In order to get my profession, I need one last proficiency certificate I must obtain and for that, I got back home and began studying for my last exam. I have a 9 year old little sister. Because she still sleeps with my mother, she doesn't use her room so my family gave me her room until I get the certificate. This morning, my sister came in to the room while I was lying on the bed and watching something on YouTube. She is stubborn and I believe she takes this trait from my dad - anyway, she told me to get out of the room. Since I don't like her way of expressing that she needs to stay alone to play with her toys, I refused and she complained about me to mom and dad. Now we are four persons in a room trying to fix a trash problem with words from each heads. Dad got mad and demanded me to get out. This got me even more angry and refused again. Out of nowhere, dad threw something to me and jumped on me with a flying chest. While I was trying to defend myself, I hit him and nailed his face. Mom panicked and desperately tried to break up the fight. Dad and I grappled a little and I threw him away before punching him in the face uncontrollably in rage. 

Mom yelled at both of us. Everything happened in front of my sister and she cried so much. Mom is very angry. I got out of home. I don't know what will happen when time for me to return home hits.

309,"Okay so this is going to sound pretty ironic, considering I'm asking this on the internet, but I want to reduce the amount of time I spend idling on the web and to be more productive.

About two months ago I moved into a new house at university. And lo and behold the broadband company delayed the installation of out router by about two weeks, so we were internetless for a while, bar our phones. That two weeks, in the end, felt amazing. Not easy at first, but by the end I'm sure I was feeling more productive (I actually read more books than I have in probably the last two years) and generally more happy than I ever have (but maybe I'm exaggerating, bare with me). 

Anyway we got the router and I said to myself that I was going to keep up this good thing. Aaaaaaaaaaand I fucked up. I started watching youtube with the luxury of my laptop and unlimited data (I hadn't cut Youtube out before, I'd just watched it on my phone and hence watched less due to the data limit), next thing I was wasting more and more time and started watching a lot more other distractions (you can infer what I mean).

So, how do I get back on that original track? The issue is I keep telling myself ""I need my laptop"" because I've got an intensive course that requires a lot of research, but I feel I'm more likely just making excuses to goof about and not work. I know it's dumb but what should I do?",07Aug2018,1

He does not financially support us like he should with child support, he has been suffering with alcoholism and drug abuse. 

Recently my parents have come to the point where they are yelling at me and just outright assaulting me verbally and making me feel like nothing. They tell me ""we cant afford to feed you or your daughter anymore. Get out. We are tired of you, you are useless. You do nothing around here, you cant even drive, your fucking psychotic get out, etc."" 

I feed us.. We have separate meals from them and I do not ask them to provide anything for us. I have purchased everything she has needed and have taken care of her.

318,"Three years ago, I moved to a new province (Canada) as a fresh graduate. My girlfriend was doing her Masters and would be a couple years, so I figured I'd spread my wings a little bit, move to a new city, and find a job. It took a while, and the money I had saved working construction the last couple summers was starting to get pretty low. I was going to have to move back home to Ontario soon. I finally got a bite for a job, but the salary was lower than I wanted. With fear of losing the opportunity, I accepted. The job was to work as an construction estimator for a subcontractor (not a general contractor).

Fast forward two years, and I've moved back to Ontario because my girlfriend got a job in the Toronto area. Because I was pretty valued at the company I was with, they wanted me to stay on. I told them I could give them three months (to help train a new employee and hand off the projects I played a role in), but I required a pay raise (\~15% raise). This new pay puts me around what a person with a year or two experience in construction would make in the GTA. All parties were under the understanding that at three months, I would start to seek employment in Toronto.  After the three months had passed, my bosses reached out to me and I told them I started my search (my thought was to give them a headstart to find my replacement...something they had not started in the three months). They asked why I didn't want to stay, and I said it was because I felt unfulfilled in my position. I wanted to be out in the field, eventually working up to managing projects. They promised me up and down that they planned to put me in a position to do so. The majority of me knew they were telling me what I wanted to hear, but part of me wanted it to be true. So, for the last nine months, I've been working out of my apartment. 

I didn't enjoy this job before I moved because I found it incredibly boring and unfulfilling. It's even worse now. So, I'm starting to give up on this ""promised"" promotion they've been dangling before me and I'm putting out resumes again. The thing is, when I applied to places six months ago, I only received one call, and that was to tell me I was underqualified for the position I applied to, but would like to interview me for an ""inferior"" position. This rattle me a little bit. In the construction industry, experience in a subtrade isn't valued very highly. Essentially, when I get a new position, the three years experience I have won't be considered. With that, I will be treated as a new graduate, and my wage will likely reflect that inexperience. I'm 27 and looking to take a step forward, not backward. I feel like I'm so much more capable than my resume would suggest because I accepted a position three years ago that didn't set me up well for future prospects (albeit, still providing valuable experience). My financial position right now isn't great, so a pay decrease will definitely be tough, especially if it's what I can expect to make as a new graduate.

Further, I feel I'm a very creative person who thrives in that environment. But because my parents wanted me to pursue something ""more reliable"", I was pushed into a career I don't feel pushes me. My job just stresses me out and rarely feels rewarding.

All that being said, I'm seeking advice on a few things:

\- Should I notify my current employer that I am starting my job search again?

\- Should I seek to increase my salary in my current position and hope the promotion eventually comes to fruition?

\- Because my experience is viewed as limited, what can I do to ensure that I still get a comfortable salary in a new position?

\- Is it worth it to do a complete 180 and go back to school or invest all my time and money into something that I enjoy (but may not pan out)? Or should I just keep chugging along and look for happiness in the hours outside of work--which will be easier to do with more money?

Sorry for the long explanation, but it helps provide context.

319,"So I‚Äôm not sure where to start.  I guess I‚Äôll start by saying that my father and I have never been close.  I kind of think he got married and had kids because it‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat you‚Äôre supposed to do.‚Äù He can be a nice guy but has an explosive  temper.  He and my mom we‚Äôre always on and off again and when I was about 16 they called it quits for good and filed for divorce.  

After my parents filed for divorce my dad quit his job, moved in with my grandparents, and pretty much just hung out for the next 30 years until my grandparents passed away.  He had a few jobs here and there, but nothing ever lasted more than a few months.  My grandparents never put any pressure on him to hold a steady job or pay rent.  They even gave him an allowance  and bought him a car (on three occasions) so he could get around. 

My dads whole game plan was to get social security and inherit my grandparents house. After my grandparents passed away my uncles (dads two younger brothers) decided to sell the house and split the money between all three of them.  I just found out recently that between the sale of the house and some investments my grandparents had, my dad and uncles each inherited about $300k.

That was in 2015.  I found out 2 weeks ago that my dad spent all of his money, can no longer afford his rent, and racked up $3000 in credit card debit on eating out out and cigarettes.  He reached out to my wife and me asking us for help.  I told him I would help him go over his finances and maybe pay a bill or two, except for the credit card.  

I gave him a week to get all his bills together so we could go over everything and see where he could cut back.  He didn‚Äôt do it.  He just came over with his monthly expenses scribbled down on a piece of paper.  My wife also took the time to get him a list of low income apartments in the area.  We told him to call around and see if there was anything available or to at least try and get on a few waiting list.  He didn‚Äôt do that either. 

I just talked to him this morning and I don‚Äôt know what to do.  It‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt care.  As soon as I tried to explain that we are trying to help him but that he has to put in the work he just cut the conversation short and hung up.  

I have a lot of resentment towards him.  After he left us, my mom had to go on welfare to make ends meet.  He never called for birthdays or just to check in and see how things were going.  My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 (she‚Äôs fine now by the way!), but when he got the inheritance he never said a word.  Never asked if we needed help with medical bills or anything else for that matter.  Now that he needs financial help he knows exactly where to find me.  I know he wants me to just say ‚Äúokay, here‚Äôs the $730 dollars you need to make rent and pay your credit card bill.‚Äù But I don‚Äôt want to just give him a handout.  He‚Äôll just come back the following month and begin to expect it.  Aside from that we can‚Äôt afford an extra $730 a month.  

My wife and I are trying to pay off our debt and start a family.  I want to help him by teaching him to be self sufficient, but he doesn‚Äôt want to put in the work.  Aside from that it boggles my mind that he was able to blow through $300k in three years and have nothing to show for it.  That money along with his social security should have been enough for him to live comfortably for the rest of his life.  He could have even used the money to buy a house...

I'm thinking about moving out, mainly because I feel like a 16 year old. If I were to keep living here, I wouldn't be able to have sex. Problem is, It would set me back a while (I would probably be a server or bartender) and would have to pay for my school (no idea how).

329,"I am a 17 yo male who has a credit card with my parents account. I don't earn my own money. 

I was out shopping when a homeless man approached me asking for some money. I told him I carried no cash but then he suggested that I get him a gift card using my credit card. I agreed. 

So I got him a card for Macy's as he said he needed clothes. I figured clothes were necessary because it makes one presentable, so he could get a job. 

The Macy's was in a mall, so I figured it'd be expensive. I put $300 in it so he could get an outfit at least. 

Then I got him an American Express gift card for food and other stuff. I put $50 in it. If he's conservative, it will last him a while. 

The reason I did this was because I was in a rush to get somewhere. I probably should have confirmed this with my parents as this is their money and not mine. 

Also, he claimed he lost everything in Hurricane Harvey. I live in Texas, about 300 miles from Harvey. There's not much homeless people in my part of town (he's like maybe the 3rd I've seen here in my life). 

I gave him gift cards hoping he wouldn't spend the money on drugs or alcohol. He smelled like cigarettes, so I don't know. 

I've never been in this situation before, but I figured that if I left knowing that I could have helped someone but I didn't, I wouldn't know how I would feel about myself afterward. If I got scammed, I guess it is a learning experience. But I didn't even do much, because it's not even my own money. ",07Aug2018,0

My friend recently also had a panic attack when he was near his dad, who is the one who expects a lot out of him. My friend ended up in the ER, which has no physical explanation. I talked with them and said I feel like it could be stress related and brought on by being around the dad.

My friend, knowing I would meet his dad last weekend, came clean to me about all of this. Told me if I didn't go along with the lie he would be disowned, and possibly have his dad come after him.

336,"My suspicions started a month and a half ago, but I didn‚Äôt have enough proof to really act on anything. We‚Äôve been dating for 4 years before this, and I was actually ready to start proposing to her before I became suspicious. I was in the process of diamond shopping for an engagement ring, but tabled that. 

Just to clarify, she lives mainly with me, but has her own apartment, so she‚Äôs back and forth a lot. She doesn‚Äôt really like her roommates, so we aren‚Äôt around there ever. 

It started with my girlfriend just not really paying much attention to me because she started playing on her phone all the time. She kept telling me she was just ‚Äúsnapchatting friends‚Äù. There‚Äôs definitely something more than just that, looking back now. 

She‚Äôs usually driving my car around due to her Dodge Durango always having problems. There was one night where she asked if she could have the keys to my car, and I asked why, she just said she wanted to go out with some girlfriends of hers. I asked if I could tag along, and she said ‚Äúno it‚Äôs a ‚Äògirl‚Äôs night‚Äô‚Äù. 

Well turns out, an acquaintance who recognized us as a couple saw her being social with her friends, BUT they had their boyfriends too. She was also with a guy who the other girls and their boyfriends. I asked my girlfriend about this and she got really defensive about it. She said that the guy was ‚Äúnew, and wanted someone to show him around town‚Äù 

That‚Äôs conflicting with what my source told me, this person said that he saw the two touching hands, and hugging. 

I pressed her on this, I told her she has every right to have boy friends, as in a guy who‚Äôs a friend, however she can only commit to one boyfriend. We worked this out, and it was almost smooth sailing for a while. I nearly resumed diamond hunting for her, and then she asked for my car keys again, just recently. 

I asked her what she was up to, and she said she was only craving some late night drive thru. Stupid me, I asked if she could bring me back something, and she just says ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see‚Äù. I got up and just casually said that I‚Äôd like to go too. She just says, ‚Äúno, babe, I had a rough day, I need alone time.‚Äù 

I was understanding at first, then it kind of dawned on me that something is up. I messaged the informant mentioned earlier, and I asked him to describe the guy my girlfriend was with. The guy was slightly more muscular than me, maybe an inch taller (described as maybe touching 6‚Äô2‚Äù), and he has short length black hair. 

I filled in a friend of mine what‚Äôs happening, and he understood, and wanted to help me out, despite the time of night. I opened up Snapchat, and saw that my girlfriend had her location thing on, and her location was around a grocery store. 

I gave my friends the directions, and sure enough, my car was there. We circled past it to confirm, and we saw the matching description of the guy she was with. What‚Äôs worse, is the guy was driving MY car! 

I bailed out of my friend‚Äôs car, and I went to the driver side door, my girlfriend recognized me right away, and told me to ‚Äúget lost‚Äù. After a while of talking over one another while the two were still in the car, I reached in and unlocked the car. I opened to door and I lunges in to unlatch the driver‚Äôs seatbelt. 

I pulled the guy out of the car, and rolled all the windows up, and started the car. I then told my girlfriend, who‚Äôs at this point an ex to also get out of the car. She got pissy and told me that I can‚Äôt just do what I did. I reminded her I have every right to do this. Then told her to get an Uber. 

I told my friend he could leave if he wants, and he does, I was about to pull out of the parking lot, and my ex screams at me ‚Äúwhat the fuck are we supposed to do!?‚Äù I repeated that she can get an Uber or walk. She then started screaming about how she still needs to get her stuff. I told her she can come back for her stuff, but it‚Äôs not going to be tonight (the night this happened, not here and now)

So fast forward to just the other day, she comes for her stuff, and as insult to injury brings her side-dick that was driving my car that night. She was packing all her belongings, and while she was going room to room, her toy started to puff his chest to look bigger and serious. He started to crowd up to me, and every time I would step back, he would just keep following me. 

I told my ex to call off her moron, and she just yells ‚Äúfuck no, he‚Äôs for my protection from you, jerk!‚Äù I told the side-dick to take a step back, and he right away says ‚Äúyou embarrassed me and her last night, you‚Äôre lucky I don‚Äôt swing at you.‚Äù

Keeping an eye over my shoulder, I try going to my room, and let my guard down for a second. He grabs me and tells me ‚Äúnot to go in there‚Äù. I told him to fuck himself. He gets right up to me, and shoved me into my bed. Soft landing, but at that point I got back up, and grabbed my licensed concealed handgun from my waist band. 

Not even pointing it at anyone, I right away show him my license to carry. He changed emotions on a dime, and starts getting nervous declaring ‚Äúcome on man, I was just messing around, were pals!‚Äù 

I told him to go be pals with someone else, preferably outside. The ex-was all sorts of pissed off about the altercation, and then directly confronts me, and tells me that I need to give the Rolex she gifted me last year back. I told her no, I wasn‚Äôt going to do it. She then cries ‚ÄúI promised Jason that he can have the watch!‚Äù In a sobbing sort of way. 

I made it known that I didn‚Äôt really care about what she promised, and that she needed to leave, she tried getting defiant, and then I told her that it‚Äôs my property, and have no problem calling cops on her, because she‚Äôs now trespassing. She heeded the warning, and left. 

I follow her outside where her side-dick was waiting, and before they both get into their own vehicles, he yells at me ‚Äúmaybe someday you‚Äôll be a real man and fight with your fists! I‚Äôm trained in MMA, so come down to the gym where I can beat you to a pulp on a waiver!‚Äù 

Now, with the entire situation here, I‚Äôm basically legal, with the only concern being that I used force to remove him from my car. It‚Äôs not illegal, but it could send me on the litigation merry-go-round. 

What should I do with this whole situation? And am I being heartless for not being that sad with the whole situation that occurred? Surprisingly I haven‚Äôt even hit the whiskey, nor will I in this case, because she‚Äôs not even worth that in my opinion.

I don't like rushing things and I was looking for a relationship not someone to sleep with, I feel like she understood that. At the time she was fwb with another dude but I didn't care to much.

350,"I'm changing my life in order to make things better. I'm going back to college (I'm 28) in a few weeks. I changed my diet and started exercising. I finally started taking anxiety medication, which has been wonderful so far. I stopped blaming the world for my problems and started accepting personal responsibility. 

But I have a best friend, someone I've known for half my life, who is also battling depression. He's been on disability for 7 years. He blames his mom for his circumstances (""if she was smarter then I wouldn't have ended up like this""), he blames white people for his circumstances (""I wish I could have everything handed to me""), and when you try to give him advice his automatic response is ""Yeah, that's so easy to say."" But you'd better believe he's ready to criticize your life choices whenever you want to vent our your own frustrations. 

I get it. Depression sucks. It brings out the worst in people. I've *been* him and I've blamed everything and everyone for many years. But it's pointless. He seems to think he's not the writer of his own story. He's physically healthy and has been for 4 years, but he stays on disability because he's too scared to get back out there. He's gotten job interviews and actual jobs, but he quits after the first day because he doesn't like working with people (a trait he's had long before he went on disability). He recently passed all the interviews for a multinational tech company and was told he'd receive a start date when his position opened up. He proceeded to badger the hiring managers because he wanted to start work ASAP, so they offered him another position at another location (which was further from his home), but he turned it down because he didn't want to take the bus. He told the managers that they should give him more money so he can Uber. 

Yeah. They basically told him to fuck off after that. 

So now he's depressed and hopeless again. He calls me 2-3 times a day to complain. He doesn't want therapy (""It doesn't work""). He doesn't want medication. He doesn't want to work out. He doesn't want to do anything that is uncomfortable. And honestly? I'm getting sick of him. I'm very close to telling him to fuck off because I don't really care anymore. 

I've got my own problems. And he's so self-involved that it doesn't matter to him that I've got my own things going on. He still expects me to be available to listen to him say the same shit he's been saying for 7 years. 

Am I wrong for ending a friendship with someone who is obviously in a lot of pain? Is it wrong to lose empathy for someone who refuses to help himself? Am I fucked up for wanting friends who actively take steps to change themselves? And if I end the friendship, what's the best way to go about it? ",07Aug2018,1
351,"Hey guys,

My parents got divorced a couple years ago. It was quite a peaceful divorce, even though my Mum had been unfaithful and ended up getting with the guy she was with. My Dad has been dating a woman on his side, too.

I started University last year and the fees for the year were ¬£9,250 plus food and housing, so quite a substantial amount. My brother started University in Canada two years ago and the fees are a little higher.

We are extremely fortunate that our parents agreed to pay for both of our educations and living costs. My brother has a job but he spends a lot more than I do on going out and other things.

My Mom pays for my brother and my Dad pays for me. I thought it was quite fair, to be honest. But recently my Mom has been complaining to me, and even criticizing me for not being on her side.

She keeps on asking me how much exactly my Dad spends on me. She tells me I don‚Äôt know the whole story, and that I‚Äôm judging really unfairly.

Due to medical circumstances, I failed my first year of Uni and was granted a free resit, which was really good news. My Dad will still have to pay for the remaining three years of my studies (or perhaps I‚Äôll get a student loan for the last year), but he does get a year where he‚Äôs off the hook for the ¬£9,250.

My Mum is thinking about asking my Dad to contribute to my brother‚Äôs costs, which I don‚Äôt believe to be fair. I‚Äôm not sure if my logic is flawed. She hasn‚Äôt been very nice to me, because even though I tried to stay out of the argument, she kept on going on about it, and I shared my honest opinion.

Final piece of background : my Dad owns a small company so he isn‚Äôt struggling too much. My Mum recently took a year off work with very minimal pay in order to keep living with the new person she‚Äôs dating (she had a fixed term contract overseas which ended a year before the guy could come back with her). She just started working again for the Foreign Affairs Ministry and is earning a fair salary, nothing amazing, but still decent. Both of my parents bought sort of expensive properties by themselves in Paris a few months ago, and my Mum also complains about how my Dad‚Äôs place is so much bigger. Considering he is moving into his new place with his girlfriend and my Mum‚Äôs place is only going to be for herself, I once again can‚Äôt agree that it is unfair.

Could anyone give me some advice on how to calm down my Mum? Do you think there is truly something unfair going on here or should I stand my ground?

356,"I‚Äôm a 16 year old teen that is about to go into junior year of high school.  Ever since I was younger, I‚Äôve always felt different from most people.  I have friends but it‚Äôs not like my social life thrives.  I just don‚Äôt connect with many people I guess.  

When I was younger my main (and really only hobby) was basketball.  I wasn‚Äôt really friends with any of my teammates but it was still really fun.  Then as I got in middle school, I just drifted away from basketball because I didn‚Äôt make the team twice in a row and I kind of just lost interest.  After that, I started playing video games a lot and I actually got addicted to them.  I suppose I was just filling a void.  Luckily my parents took the games away from me for a while so now I‚Äôm over the addiction and I can play them without getting addicted.

After I stopped playing video games, I suddenly got really motivated to work hard and be successful.  This motivation started a little over a year ago.  I started reading a little bit and watching videos, searching for meaning to my life.  It got to the point where I was practically obsessed with finding some magical answer to everything.  My yearlong depression began at sometime during that period.

The whole next school year, I would have the motivation to do the work one night, then just completely crumble the next.  Somehow, with all of the cramming and procrastinating, I still got good grades.  Even though I still got the grades I wanted, it was absolute hell.  I told my parents about my depression when school was almost over.

This summer, my depression has gotten way worse.  I now don‚Äôt have the motivation to do anything.  Not even showering or brushing my teeth.  Sometimes I push myself to do it, others I don‚Äôt.  I hate this life.  My mind is constantly all over the place and it‚Äôs constantly firing.  I overthink everything.  I did start seeing a counselor and I was prescribed antidepressants by a doctor so maybe that will help.

Can anyone relate to feeling different/smart like me and give me some advice?  I‚Äôm just so lost right now and don‚Äôt know what to do.

I‚Äôve tried using success as a motivation but it‚Äôs not working with my depression.  Maybe my life values have just changed.  I also have school in 2 days and I have tons of summer work to do so I just hate this so much.  What can I do?

I realized that I couldn‚Äôt have that sort of full college experience for someone with my life, so my first thought was to cut out room and board. All the colleges in my state are over an hour away, so that‚Äôs out of the question. I don‚Äôt think I can get an apartment either, since I still don‚Äôt have a license nor a job. So my next thought was to cut out tuition. In america, people can join the national guard and get free in-state tuition. If I were to do that, I could use whatever financial aide I get next year to pay for the dorm and live on campus. There‚Äôs one other option, and that‚Äôs to take the year off, get my license, and work, then use that money to get an apartment and do school part-time, but I‚Äôm not sure how that‚Äôd affect my degree.

So r/advice, I was wondering what I should do. Work part-time and live in an apartment, or join the national guard and live in a dorm after. Thanks in advance.",07Aug2018,1

360,"My acquaintances (one college friend and his wife) are having trouble conceiving. They're good people, and love each other deeply. They had a miscarriage recently, after having been trying for about a year. I've thought about being a surrogate before but have never had a child. I was wondering if it would seem rude or insensitive to reach out and offer sensitively to my friend, just to let him know that they have the option if they ever wanted to utilize it in the future, and I would do it so that they don't have to pay for a surrogate. 

I don't want to reach out to the wife because I would be afraid of making her feel inadequate or seem insensitive, and she's already suffering. I know I should probably just not say anything. Would anybody have appreciated this, or thought it was hurtful? Just hoping to gain some clarity to make a decision. I have great intentions, but for some reason I miss social common sense and don't know what would be ""right"" in some situations. I blame being drastically sheltered and isolated growing up.

Would this seem weird, or helpful? Hurtful or kind?",07Aug2018,3
362,"Iv spoken to my neighbour about it and she dosent see the issue, she says they are just children, we have tried talking to the parent who got aggressive, this boy asks my daughter to take of her pull-ups and show him her self and uses very sexualised word and comments towards her.

363,"Before I start the story, I live in a very rural part of New Jersey, where people have been known to make ‚Äúclubs‚Äù that resemble and act like the KKK and this story isn‚Äôt made up, I seriously don‚Äôt know what to do. This isn‚Äôt going to be the longest story either because I don‚Äôt want to reveal to many details about where I live and etc...

So, this story starts about a week ago and I just started my run in the woods right behind my house and about 30 seconds in, I noticed that the tree house in the woods had fallen sometime in the night, I decided to check it out because I had spent a good time of my childhood with my friends in it, and it was upsetting seeing it down. But, once I got there and upon closer inspection, I noticed it was cut down and not had just fallen naturally. (This is where it gets to starts to get weird.)

Off to the side of the treehouse I saw a massive cleared out area. (It looked like someone had spent a while clearly it.) and in the dead center of the cleared area was a about a 5 foot tall cross that was burnt and only a barley standing. And was very freaked and did not know what to do. I ended my run and just went directly home.

I just chose to ignore it and not let it bother me. But, eventually I started running in the woods again but I was totally avoiding and area with the fallen down tree house, because frankly I was scared to go near there. But, eventually, my curiosity was peaked and I decided to go back there to check it out. Keep in mind, I had not told anyone about what I had seen. I went backed armed with a knife just Incase things got dicey, and it gave me piece of mind. I went to the cleared area to find another cross burned and it also looked like someone had raked in the woods in the cleared out area.

This happened two days ago and my question is, what do I do? Should I contact a state trooper I know to see if he can do anything to help? This is very close to my house and I feel like I should say something someone but I really don‚Äôt know.

365,"Hi guys, I need some advice on how to handle a situation involving (admittedly not thaaat much) money and my former apartment. I may just be out of luck and truthfully it's frustrating that this is irking me so much anyway... but here we are. Anyway, I moved out of my last apartment about 10 days ago. Things had gotten a bit hostile with 2/5 of my roommates (that is a long story in and of itself, but the gist is that two friends who moved into that apartment in the last several months had very little respect for the other roommates, to the point where they told us that because they'd decorated the downstairs area it was their space and essentially not for us to use and had loud, unannounced parties on multiple occasions), so I was glad to go. 

Here's the issue: prior to my moving out, my landlord told me that if I filled my  room with a new person, he'd give me a $100 finder's fee. $100 is not make-or-break-my-life kind of money, but it sounded good, mostly in relation to helping with moving expenses. So I started the search for someone without alerting my roommates. I know that may sound odd and even inconsiderate, but that was very much the way that house worked. Multiple people had moved in and out during my year there without any of the other roommates' knowledge, and that was always fine with everyone else. It was not really a place where the roommates hung out a lot. Everyone rented their rooms separately (meaning that we did not rent the apartment itself as a group) and had their own room with a bathroom inside of it. Because of this, there were not a lot of instances where we'd run into each other. One of the two roommates had issues with who I mentioned prior even moved in before her friend and had that friend move in a few months later when one of the rooms opened. She didn't mention this to any of us and her friend was just moved in when I got back from being away for Christmas . Again, I know it's odd but just kinda the way things were around there.

Back to the finder's fee: I started showing some people the place about a week before I was to move out. At one point, one of the two roommates ran into us while I was showing the place and seemed fine with it. After all, she'd done the same thing at one point. Despite the fact that we'd gotten in arguments before and had never really properly resolved them, it was fairly cordial when we ran into each other (which was a rare instance itself by the end of my time at that place as I'd really started to mostly stay in my room when I was even home). Anyway, one person who saw the place liked it and wanted to apply, so I connected him with my landlord to go through the process. All was going well until I received a text the next night from the roommate who I'd run into. She told me that she didn't think that person would be a good fit (he'd mentioned that he was allergic to dogs and her text stated that she conveniently wanted to get a dog within the next 2 weeks) and that she wanted to choose someone herself since I was moving out so it didn't really even matter to me. I told her that even though that's true, the reason I wanted to find someone was because our landlord was offering me a finder's fee, and after some back and forth she agreed to let me keep that as long as she could fill the room. I told the landlord as much and perhaps naively assumed all would be fine.

So here we are now. It's been over a week since I've moved out and I've checked in with my landlord multiple times about the finder's fee and haven't heard back. I'm not even sure someone has been chosen for the room yet because I haven't heard from my landlord or my other former roommate who still lives there. My landlord has even ignored my emails about the status of the room/fee and brought up me sending my keys back, which I did yesterday. I don't know why it irks me so much but I am really struggling like a weirdo to let it go. I guess part of it is that this girl caused so much drama and stress while I was living with her and the fact that she might have gotten her way about yet another thing that I'd already had under control prior to her intervening just bugs me. I was also counting on that money, even though again I know it's probably not really enough to justify my anxiety about this. 

I guess I'm asking for advice on how to make this ""right"". Is there a tactful way to bring this up to my landlord again without sounding like a crazy person? I did have the momentary thought that I could ""withhold"" the utilities that I owe for July as soon as they're requested of me by my roommates, but I know that's not right or fair and not something I'd ever be comfortable doing anyway. It's not really the girl's issue at this point because it's not like the money was coming from her to begin with. I don't want to talk to her anyway, but she inadvertently caused it and I just want to fix it so I can be done with it all and move on from that place.",07Aug2018,1

367,"I'm 20 years old, male. I was born and live in Brazil; I went to a decent HS and finished it without any major accomplishments but also with no huge incidents; I went to college right after, and entered an Admin course due to lack of anything I was interested in.

For 6 months, I was only studying and doing quite well at college. The course was annoying and boring, but I still managed to take some sort of enjoyment out of it. However, in July of 2016, my father wanted me to go work for him in his company. I thought about it and I tried to say ""no, I don't want to divide my time so much""; tl,dr: he didn't like it one bit. The next week, following that was an extended session of ""the talk"" where they were trying to convince me to work. Eventually, I gave in, and went to work in the place I've been working in until now.

For the first semester, I tried to manage college and work, but it was taking a lot out of me. In January 2017, I took less subjects in college to better manage it, but once again I did badly. For a year, until January 2018, I've tried my best but to no avail until I gave up.

I took classes in January, but didn't study for any of them; and in June, I just didn't take any (effectively making me not a student anymore). Also in January, I had a big fight with my family due to something that happened at my job that bled into my personal life (and I really don't want to talk about that, sorry).

For the past 8 months, I've tried, but I can't. I know I have to, and I beat myself over it, but I can't focus on anything. I see a lot of people passionate about things they want to do, and I honestly want to do something with my life, but I simply don't have anything I want to do.

I enjoy games, so I thought I'd stream, and I have been - as a hobby. I don't plan on becoming big or making this my profession, specially because I've seen what happens if you let this cloud your vision to the point where you give up everything for a mirage.

I bought drawing material, about two months ago, saying I'd pay an online course and learn. I still have a half-finished sketch of a character that has been a WIP for 50 days now.

Last week I thought: ""I know three languages, maybe I'll go back to a private course and learn Japanese"". I called the course, told them I'd go last Saturday but didn't go (although the reason was because my grandma went to the doctor).

Today, I went with my mother's boyfriend to fetch my grandfather's car (that was in the mechanic). It should be mentioned that I don't like driving, and I've expressed this distaste for it before. Everything was going well until something went wrong with my grandpa's car and the bf went back to the mechanic (I was driving the car with which we went there, that's why we needed two drivers). We were just about 5 minutes away from the mechanic and I thought: ""Ok, let's stay around here and he comes back here walking and we go back with him driving"". However, what I didn't factor in would be that the street I was at would get really packed and I HAD to move out of the place I was to allow the cars around to pass.

I did move, no biggie, and parked another 5 minutes on foot away from the mechanic and thought about calling the bf to say ""hey, mate, I was waiting for you but had to move, wait for me in the mechanic and I""ll get you"". However, I didn't have any mobile data and the number I had was an old one. Logically, I thought about calling my mother, to which she answered with ""where are you? Go pick him up, he's there"".

Then, I go back to the mechanic and where is him? My mother calls me again and says he was already home. Thing is, I'm not a good driver and everything scares me when I'm driving; at this point, I'm just sitting in the mechanic for a second, trying to call my mother (to no avail) and catching my breath. After about 5-10 minutes, I'm going home. When I get home, a fight ensues, because I took too long.

Let's just say that my grandmother isn't the most gentle person. In fact, she's quite hostile for my tastes. Take me almost panicking from having to drive around and someone berating you for making a blunder and I just exploded. I raised my voice, which made my mother raise her voice and my grandmother raise her voice and it somehow went from ""you took too long to get here"" to ""you're not doing anything with your life"".

I'll omit the contents of the fight (because you can probably think up a script for it and it would be 80% accurate). And, to be honest, they're right. I'm fucking lazy and I don't have anything to strive for. I don't want to do anything because I don't have anything I want to do. If it were an issue of ""I don't want to do this because I don't like putting in the effort"" I'd slap myself into action, but that's just not the case.

I don't have any career I want to pursue, I don't have anything I want to make. All I want is to have a bit of money in the end of the month to pay my bills and have some spending money; and I already have it because of my job, which I say I really hate, but to be honest, I only hate what happened in January.

I just don't know, really. It's clear that I can work towards something if it's integral to a job or if it's some sort of responsibility I took on, because I am still in my job (although I'm currently ""enjoying"" my vacation), and if I sit down to do some freelance job, I finish it.

At this point I'm just rambling, there is a lot more I'd like to say, but I feel that this is already too much and that this post is bordering self-hatred at this point.

Tl;dr: I don't know have anything I legitimately enjoy doing or want to do and thus I just stopped caring for my future; now I am just wallowing in self hatred, send help.",07Aug2018,1

379,"I have the most childish dilemma, but I'm too close to it, so I really need advice on how I should handle it. The 'it,' refers to my Psychology experiment that I'm doing with a group: Katie, Ursula and Troy (not their real names.) 

The background work needed for this experiment to happen was supposed to be done during the summer vacation and yet there are only 9 days left of it and none of the people in my group have done anything. I've had to truly bring out my bitch side to make them do anything at all and it's never anything significant. Two of them are also blatantly ignoring me, which doesn't help. 

My dilemma is then: I need to write a script for the video I'm filming for the experiment (Where, again, I had to take initiative as no one else was willing,) but that's the ONLY background work needed. Which means I'll be doing all the work on my own. And, obviously, I don't want that. I feel like they don't deserve to have a relaxing summer when they're ruining my own. I'm beyond stressed about this because I have two other projects, an essay and five books to do/read, so I don't have a lot of time to do much of anything. 

I was thinking of doing it all on my own and then telling the teacher, but I'm pretty much 99% sure it won't affect them in any way, seeing as the next part is the experiment (the actual fun part,) and then we split to do our individual analyses and get graded separately. Maybe she'll lower their grade, but I doubt it. Also; I don't want to be a doormat and do it all for them. 

My second option was to just tell them to do it and say that, if they don't, I'm not filming the video (and they need me to do it because the person that will be in it is my mom.)

I also gave her a time-off form last week correctly stating I start on the 20th, as a reminder.

384,"Hello Reddit. I need some advice on a work situation. I recently got promoted to chef. 3 other colleagues applied but I  was the only one who got the job even though 3 places where available. My chef deemed the other candidates not suitable for the job. 2 of them took it relatively well. They calmed down after a couple of weeks. 1, let's call him C, had some more issues but I had the impression we got along rather well lately, let's say he settled. 

Today, I was called into the big chefs office and she told me to explain the argument C and I had had some weeks ago. I  don't recall an argument and told big chef so. Apparently it was about some administration we all have to do, C didn't do his and another colleague took his because he was busy, and gave it to other colleagues to finish. This is a normal situation, C was doing some other administration, no problem there. I told the other colleagues that I  understand that she wants to help him but everybody has to pull his weight. No issues. 

But, here is the thing, the other college told C I told her we had some complaints about his functioning and that I was going to test C. Now that is just very untrue. 

Luckely, big chef was calmly listening to my story and told me we will have a conversation with the 3 of us (C, big chef, me)Thursday to talk it over. 

I find myself very nervous about his conversation. I feel like the trust I worked for with C and the 'I am your chef'- acceptance efforts are lost and I am worried about our work relationship. Even if I can convince him that that situation did not at all go that way, I  feel like he might take the word of his long time colleague and friend and I don't really know what to do now. 

Any advice?

385,"I'm 15 years old. I'm a boy. I've been bullied my whole life. It's like I'm always a target for bullies. I get picked on by guys and girls. People make fun of me, they've physically harmed me, etc. I told teachers about the bullying, and they've done nothing. I honestly think teachers don't care. I told the school, and still nothing was done.

I told my parents. We tried changing schools, but the bullying never stops.

A lot of the people who bully me started out as acquaintances, then they begin to show their true colors. Other people who bully me are people who are just mean. I'm bullied by people who I don't even know. It's like they hate me for no reason. It's like why do you hate me? I don't even know you.

I'm a very nice person that doesn't like drama or conflict. I treat everyone with respect. I'm not a confrontational person. I have a hard time standing up for myself. I'm also very shy and socially awkward.

390,"My entire life I was raised in a tight knit religion. It is the ""God loves you"" and ""Ask God and He will help you"" type of stuff. I believed it fully. 

After the last few years I have finally realized, God doesn't care. Some of the stuff I've dealt with and the hypocrisy I've seen, God doesn't care about any of it.  

I believe the doctrine I've been taught, it makes sense, I've personally seen the good results people have when they apply it. Is that what it means when they say God will bless me? If I strive to be a good person like Jesus was, help the poor and be kind to everyone, I'll be happy?

I've tried the best I can and I don't get any of that. So what's up? Why do I get punished while I see others blessed for being awful people? Why does the guy who yells at people get privileges? Why does the girl who got raped get punished? The only logical conclusion is that God doesn't care. 

I have literally nobody in my life I can talk about this with. No one will understand and they'll scold me for doubting God's love. I have no doubt God exists, and since he exists I should know Him and follow Him. And by definition, if God hates us we deserve His hate. If God wants me to suffer then I should suffer.

398,"I live in a big city in the south. When I was a kid, I lived in the Pacific Northwest. Then my family moved down south to be close to *their* families (all of whom live in a city that's about 3 hours from where I live now).  I love everything about the PNW - the weather, the nature, the vibe - everything seems much slower and more relaxed there. My fondest childhood memories are playing in snow in the winter, riding bikes in the summer, and generally enjoying 4 distinct seasons. As an adult, I've gone back many times, (3-4 times a year), just to breathe the air and get away for a bit, and every time I go I discover more things I like. But living in a big city provides 2 major things - jobs, and a small support system (the mother- and father-in-law moved here a year ago to be closer to us and our 3-year-old daughter).  

My wife and I talk about moving constantly. We are financially stable, with what amounts to 3 incomes (I have a job where I work from home, which allows me to work for my parents' company as well, and it's basically two full incomes. Plus my wife works a full time job and makes as much as I do in one job.) My wife's commute is awful and we feel like we're sort of stuck in the rat race, and it's killing us. We live in a terribly expensive house in an expensive neighborhood, and in order to live here, we have to make ridiculous amounts of money that mean ridiculous amounts of work. Plus, having a child changed a lot of things about how I see the world, my priorities and what sort of values I want to model for and instill in her. The idea of just picking up and starting over...downshifting, if you will...is really attractive.

In order to move I would have to drop one full-time job, and my wife would have to drop hers. We don't really know if there's work for her where we're going, so it's basically cutting to 1/3 of our income. On the other hand, we would buy a home that is half of what we have now, but it would mostly be paid for by the equity in this one. Obviously, this would also mean leaving parents that we know moved here for the express purpose of helping with our daughter, (despite us and other members of the family warning them that we may not live here forever). Up there, we'd have no support structure should things go poorly. 

Most people (especially those in middle age) don't really embrace change well, and I've become one of them. I'm afraid of lots of things - that a move might be harder than we expect; that we might not like the location as much as we think; that we might find it boring; that winters will be unbearable; that we don't make use of the natural amenities (down here we're ""inside people,"" but it's also unbearably hot for much of the year). It would be awful to find out your dream life is a sham - You move 3000 miles away and waste thousands of dollars only to find out ""Shit - I'm still ME."" It's a reasonable fear.  

**So anyway, in this situation - What do you do? Do you sit around dreaming of it and worry that you'll regret doing it and then eventually regret NOT doing it? Or throw caution to the wind and make the change?**

(NOTE: If it's not clear from the posts, we are extremely fortunate people, and we are grateful for the life we have. I recognize having these options is something many others don't have, and I don't want it to sound like I think our lives are terrible the way they are or that we take what we have for granted. That is not the case. It's just that we've both had careers long enough to recognize that living this life isn't necessarily all it's cracked up to be. We (society) tend to think rich people live completely carefree, but the fact is most of them are really working too hard to actually enjoy much of it.)",07Aug2018,1
399,"My estranged parent called me yesterday and said that somebody sent them and their spouse a link to my reddit account, which was well established, and contained thousands and thousands of posts.  This person highlighted one solitary post I made about said parent, which was unflattering and caused a marital dispute.  

My parent said that this is not the first email they received; they have been receiving emails for several years with links to all of my public, private, and even anonymous internet accounts.  

My own spouse doesn't even know my login information, screen names, etc.  Not because they're secret; my spouse knows what I do online, but I keep my stuff closely guarded.  I am careful not to cross contaminate, even accidentally.  

My parent has seen dirty pictures, videos, knows when I have asked for legal advice, personal advice, knows intimate details of my marriage, secrets about myself and others close to me, all pieced together from probably a dozen websites over the course of years.  None of it was from 'public' sites like Facebook or Instagram where I use my real name.  It was all from other places.  I used alternate email addresses to make most of my online profiles.  I used different screen names for each website.

I am currently in a nasty custody battle.  I don't think my ex spouse has any of this information, but I do not know.  I am quite sure it would have come to light by now if so.

My parent was very angry at the unflattering thing said, and the after affects, and threatened myself, my spouse, and our small children, all over the phone.  Threatened to make up lies about me and call CPS, threatened to fund my ex's custody battle, contact my spouse's workplace with photos and secrets, threatened bodily harm.  Parent said my life would be in ruins.  My parent said if I do even one more thing- make a post, contact other family members, respond to the situation at all, we would be decimated.  My parent has a lot of power and money and I have neither.  Parent has a history of violence and revenge.  I'm shaking even writing this post.

I erased every profile of me that ever existed that I could think of.  Other than that, I don't know what to do.  Someone has done a lot of work, and for what?  If it isn't my ex, then it must be a friend or acquaintance.  People I have met in recent years do not know my parents, and probably don't even know my family name since I had it changed.   I want to erase as much of my online life as possible and prevent this from happening again.

West Virginia is a choice because the cost of living is dramatically lower than north jerseys, while still being somewhat close to PA and NJ.

Indiana is a big choice because I have a good friend who lives there, and he would allow me to stay rent free at his house.

419,"To start off, a year or two ago she used to be pretty good/okay with her behavior and even comes to me for advice about a lot of things. She had worries about getting into school so I'd give her some advice about picking the right kind of people to make friends for the rest of her life and that she doesn't have to be the most popular person there.

It wasn't until early this year I see a suicide hotline on her board and I ask her about it. She says it's for her friend who is suicidal and she wants to keep it there just in case he ""relapses"". I started noticing that she has pictures of her friend on her phone, and she would talk to him a lot. He's going to become a huge sphere of influence on her as you'll soon learn. She wouldn't tell me but I figured out it's her new boyfriend. I told her to be careful with those types of people because from my experience it'll start to affect you too. A few months later, I notice more numbers on her board about self harm, self help, and suicide hotlines. I ask her what that's for and she said it's for her. She reveals she's been depressed for a while now. I try to get her to tell me but she tells me that she's not ready to talk. In fact, she learned she can use that on me to block herself off and get away from talking about it.

One day, my mom got very upset and started crying after arguing with my sister saying that my sister's been giving her a nasty attitude, being disrespectful, and all she does is spend all night chatting with that boy. She tells me my sister's telling that boy all these stories about the bad things my mom does, which is completely untrue. I don't know how she got that info or fabricated it so she can act like a tortured little soul. She even wanted my mom to take her to a therapist for her depression. I suspect that she's acting this way because her hormones are out of control and she doesn't have anyone to keep her in check and she's just going through a phase. The other half of me worries that she really might be suicidal so I can't brush that off and I have to take that seriously.

Fast forward to an entire summer of this bullshit. I was being very patient and concerned, but now my patience has run thin. I helped my mom drive them both to the new high school so she can register because we moved, but she had this attitude the entire time. We ask her questions and she can't hear it because of her headphones. All she does is stick her nose on her phone the entire time either chatting or on Instagram. The only times she looks up is if she has figure out which direction she's walking.

We're at the restaurant and we ask what she wants. She didn't hear us because of her earbuds and at this point I'm very annoyed and told her to leave one off. While we're waiting for food, I notice she's firing away on her IG chat. I usually respect her privacy but I decide to read what she's typing, and she says shit like ""I'm gonna start cutting myself again"" ""I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do."" Now I've lost my patience, so I grab her phone and call her out on it. What she's talking about, what she's typing. I used tease her like that and she would freak out, but this time I'm mad and I get her to tell me what it is. She realizes I'm being serious and she starts crying while holding on to her phone desperately, and my mom is across the table and she's backing me up. I told her I'll take away her phone if she continues to act this way and she freaks out. She's causing a scene so I drag her out and I get her to tell me what her deal is this whole entire time.

It took a bit but she reveals that one of her problems is that our mom is toxic. I ask her how, and she says ""for example one time when I was 10 we had an argument and I was crying and she told me to shut up because she had to sleep early for work."" She even says stuff about her boy being the only one that cares about her, and she even called the suicide hotline and all they told her was ""it'll get better"" and that's all she wants to hear. I break down all her points and why she's got it all wrong, why we as a family care about her and why she's going down a dark hole. I ask if she wants things to improve or not, and since she said she did, I told her that she has to make the appropriate steps to change.

 I'm starting to suspect that she's not really having a mental health breakdown, she just wants attention and for people to enable her bad attitude by giving her what she wants to hear, so I had to give her some tough love talk and give her a reality check.

The next morning they had to re-register cuz we didn't have time the previous day, and she was 2 hours late because she had trouble getting up because she was videochatting all night with her boy. I'm contemplating on confiscating her phone and then her computer one by one, because now I'm starting to be convinced that she's out of control and getting away with so much because she hasn't been given boundaries or punishment.

Is it right to do that? To get her away from talking to him? I was very rebellious when I was a teenager and seeing her go through that shit and being out of control is extremely hard to watch.

**TL;DR: My teen sister is acting like a tortured little soul and I don't know if it's right to let it ride until she grows out of that phase or it's not a phase and she needs help and I don't know how.**",07Aug2018,1

My girlfriend was sleeping over for that day and the next morning before she leaves my so called ""friend"" tried to force himself upon her. He begged and begged and he kept touching her all over she kept saying no and kept trying to pull his hands away but he wouldnt stop. And when she finally got out of his grasp  she ran for the door trying to leave but  he grabbed her and brought her close and forced a kiss. She started to freak out and finally was able to get out of the house. She told me about this when it happened. The friend also told me about it, saying that they maked out the weekend before.

422,"Ok so a while back my friend got a boyfriend but they were off and on at first because they weren't sure if they ""liked"" each other (we're all 16 ish for reference).  We had issues with her going off and never talking to her old friends but we still did stuff as a big group including the boyfriend, so it was fine.  I figured we could all be buds even if I was kinda third wheeling and it was all good.

Then, they got together in a more serious relationship.. And my friend literally has not made any attempt to contact or make plans with me at all in over a month.  Everytime I confront her about it she admits she's doing it and says she's sorry but doesnt change.  I'm trying not to be clingy but we've been close friends since grade school.. I didn't think asking to hang out every now and then was too much to ask for.  I also feel like the only reason she was inviting me before was so it wouldn't be awkward with her bf alone.. so now that she's dropped me the second she got someone else I feel kind of taken advantage of.

She always makes excuses as to why she can't hang out with her friends but will hang out with her bf the next day or even the same day.  She goes on about how she's allowed to hang out with her boyfriend if she wants to, and I'm not saying she can't, but maybe don't just entirely forget about us?

We've had at least five arguments about this already and although I want to fight for this friendship since we've had it so long I feel like I'm the only one contributing.  Should I drop her, try to work it out, or any other options??",07Aug2018,5

424,"I've spent the day researching climate change, I have never been so pessimistic about the humanity's existential situation. Even if climate change were somehow magically reversed there is the ever-looming threat of nuclear destruction, antibiotic resistant bacteria, an asteroid not to mention the well-known fact of the eventual heat death of the universe.

I live a miserable life with a chronic illness and bouts of severe depression/anxiety, but I keep going because there's always hope for the future right? The singularity, the chance to live forever in a sci-fi utopia? No, now all I see is the planet burning itself to a crisp, that's where we're heading. 

I've been doing better recently, eating a near-flawless diet, taking my supplements and perhaps even beginning to get some exercise. But what the hell am I even working for? I'm 24, I've worked my whole life only on music, I'll be returning in 2019 to finish my composition degree. I just couldn't care less about music, there's no demand for any more musicians, I've completely lost interest in composing through depression and a general hatred of the musical environment. I'm not qualified for anything else either, and it's so hard to get anything done with the chronic illness/mental health problems, so I have to do keep doing this.

How the hell am I supposed to keep working on music? It feels like the most pointless waste of time in the world. Doing anything is pointless, there's no point having a family and kids when I know we're all going to be burning to death soon.",07Aug2018,0

A lot of people that I have hurt in high school with mean jokes or said something that made me look like an asshole have forgive me and accept me in their lives again since time has past and heal wounds but I still feel guilty I guess karma kicking in.

426,"Hey reddit!   

I am in a quandary. Simple question: If the job interview goes well this Thursday, do I accept the job?  
 Back story: I have two daughters (aged 21 months and 9) we do not take our children to daycare, my mother watches them (we pay her) while I am in class. I go to class this coming semester Tuesday and Thursday‚Äôs from 9am to 12:30p. Monday and Wednesday‚Äôs from 1:30p to 3:30p. My husband currently is the primary financial supporter. His hours range during the week from 8a-5p and sometimes 11a ‚Äì 9p. I am working toward my bachelor‚Äôs in Psych and graduate this coming Spring 2019. Afterward, my plan is to attend graduate school. (to obtain an LPC, PHD, or School Psych degree).  
 The job I applied for is an occasional part time job as a mental health worker at an adolescent psychiatric hospital the hours are overnight weekends only from 11p to 7a.  
 This way my husband would be home with the girls and we do not have to take them to childcare etc.

My reasons are many  
 ‚Äì 1) we are working on paying off debt  
  \- 2) we need a new car (my husband‚Äôs is old and becoming unreliable)  
  \- 3) we are attempting to save money to build are house and hoping to have enough in the next year and a half when our lease ends where we are currently residing.  
  \- 4) the experience will be beneficial to me as this is the field I will be going into

**Any insight, opinions, or experience would be appreciated!**   
My mother thinks that it would be too hard on me etc. I cannot figure out if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. The only potential risk I see is me being a little tired on the weekends.  ",07Aug2018,1

I feel like every time a situation arises where she asks way too much of me, instead of standing my ground I always do what she pleases because I tell myself that she would do the same for me. Except time and time again I am left frustrated and disappointed over her selfishness when she won‚Äôt lift a FINGER for me when i‚Äôm always out here going the extra mile for her and trying to meet all of her needs. But for some reason, despite constantly being let down by her, I always give in to her demands instead of declining her wishes like she does each time with me. The most annoying part is the stuff she expects of me to do for is her over the top and HUGE and anything i‚Äôve ever asked of her is so minuscule in comparison yet she can‚Äôt be bothered to go out of her way for people. Today, after doing an exhausting a lot for her last night, she has once again disappointed me with her selfishness. Believe it or not, but this is the maybe 1,000 time of me feeling stupid for doing all this shit for her when she does nothing for me. I‚Äôve snapped. I‚Äôm so over it.

I really want today to be the last time I go through this bullshit but I think apart of me feels morally obligated to please her needs? Like yes, I can stand my ground and finally stop this but I think it‚Äôs gone on for so long because part of me feels like just because she is selfish doesn‚Äôt mean I have to bitterly stoop down to her level. I‚Äôm just at such unbelievable conflict with this because yes I want to just be the bigger person and help her despite her not giving a shit about me but I actually get really fucking hurt every single time she disappoints me. I guess I have this image of her in my mind that‚Äôs really not who she is so when she never fails to show me how selfish she is I am always so shocked and sometimes moved to fucking tears of anger, sadness, and disbelief. I want so badly to be able to stick up for myself and vocalize when I am not comfortable doing things or when she is asking way too much of me. I feel like choosing the high road always ends in me getting hurt, and I am so tired of letting her have so much control over my emotions. How do I stop myself from feeling so guilty? It doesn‚Äôt help that she guilt trips the fuck out of me whenever I rarely try to opt out but I think i need to stop expecting her to be as kind as me? Am I in the wrong here? Is it not right to expect her to help me as much as she makes me help her? I really just need an outsiders perspective on what to do here. ",07Aug2018,2

Today. At 8pm. I told him I cant because I have food poisoning which is true. I told him Friday works and he wanted my address before the Friday. Which strikes me as odd. I may be overthinking it, I can be pretty paranoid. Heres the conversation:

Buyer: Hi, I‚Äôm wondering if this is still available?
Buyer: I just have a question, does this cat Yona shed?
Me: Hello! Yes she's still available and she does not shed too much, she's a short hair with one coat so that helps. When it was just her we never really had to clean up any hair except for her cat bed every few months. We also found she does not need brushing either, she's pretty low maintenance in terms of grooming.
Buyer: I like that, can I see her today?
Buyer: Around 8pm?
Me:Unfortunately not I have a spot of food poisoning. Would Friday be alright? Thats my day off.
Buyer: I think Friday should work.
Buyer: Is Yona requires anything, is she a healthy cat
Buyer: And is she trained to go to a cat litter?
Me: No she doesnt require anything other than a good home. We took car of all her medical issues when we first received her. And she is litter trained
Buyer: I like her. And I live along, so i would love some company. My only problem was, that's she doesn't shed to much, cause my son got an asthma, and sometimes it could affect
Me:Oh I see. In that case my only concern is if your son came to see Yona he may have a reaction to our OTHER 2 cats. They are long hair Cymric breeds. 
Me: They will be put away for the visit, of course but I don't know the extent of his sensibilities
Buyer: It's not a heavy asthma. I just dont want her all over the house, that's all. 
Buyer:And I cant take him with me, he lives with his mom
Buyer: I just had him on long weekend, in 2 weeks I gonna take him again
Me: Oh I see. Fair enough! I look forward to your visit then :)

I learned from students last semester that even if you get someone to take notes for you, not being in class for even one day can really screw you up, especially when it comes to the labs. I don't really have time in my schedule to catch up so I'm scared about falling behind.

Part of me feels like it's not entirely my fault because I did provide 2 documents with the correct dates so I shouldn't feel bad about going to school. But, I still wrote that post-it that was ultimately used to make my schedule and I also feel like I have an obligation to work as a result.

442,"*Context*

I normally don't mind with who my gf is hanging with. For almost 5 years (we're both of each others ""first serious relationship"" - starting when we were 17, and she was my first kiss).

I'd realistically consider her 'out of my league' - looks wise, I can admit that. But in terms of confidence / personality I think I make up for it (so I'm told from my other female friends).

She just finished her first year of university and she has a close group of friends: Her, 2 girls, 1 guy who's gay, and 1 guy who's not.  She says she views the non gay guy like a brother. They always hang out together (because the whole group lives in the same halls). 

Sometimes, they hang out together (just them 2) - she always tells me when he's over (when I ask her what she's doing), sometimes late at night and they watch tv shows together.

*Scenario*

The guy slept with one of the girls when half the friendship group went on holiday. It was a 1 of thing, he took her virginity. But now he still 'hangs with my gf' like her usually does.

Like I don't know If I'm being overprotective but I just find it really weird that he's like slept with someone in his close friends group when they were all away (He did tell the rest of the group), but I mean that's his core group and he slept with one of his closest friends.

Yes, she was single but I mean if he doesn't find that weird (sleeping with a close friend) how do I know he won't try something with my GF (maybe even unintentionally) since they drink as a group together ofc and go clubbing. What happens if they both come back clubbing and do stuff.

Like I 100% trust her, but it's him.

The annoying thing is as well is that I'm in architecture school. My whole course (and course friendship group) is 50/50 boy:girl ratio, so I obviously hang with girls and they're close friends too. ",07Aug2018,1
443,"So basically here‚Äôs the scenario, 
A girl from work takes the same bus I do and gets off the same stop I do, but we take off to opposite ends of the road. Never really see her at work because we work at different areas.  And its always a rush to get on the bus so no time there.  The bus takes an hour to get to our stop but I don‚Äôt want to sit next to her on the bus might come off as a creep ya know. 
We have made eye contact a few times so she knows I exist haha. 
The problem is that the only time I am in talking distance from her is when we are about to get off at the stop and even that‚Äôs a like a half a minute. 

So does anyone know how or when to start talking to her? Or even what to say?

450,"My fiance and I recently moved in to a new apartment, and for the most part, we love it. The one consistently frustrating thing, though, is that we have a reserved parking spot (the cost is included in our rent) and people keep parking in it. There are several businesses in the same building and the public parking starts right next to our spot, so I think some people aren't paying attention and most of them just don't care.

Part of what's so annoying is that all of the apartment spots have the apartment number painted on them, and the sign that says ""resident parking only; violators will be towed"" is RIGHT IN FRONT of our spot. Now, I know people make mistakes, but it's gotten to the point where there's a 50% chance that somebody will be in our spot every time my fiance leaves. Some of the people are repeat offenders, ie, we've noticed the same car parked in our spot multiple times. And we're frustrated. As nice as we are and as much as we want to give people the benefit of the doubt, we're at the point of ""FUCK IT, TOW 'EM.""

But people park there after 4:30pm, at which point our management office is already closed and we cannot get them to tow people. We've tried calling and they tell us they cannot tow after hours. In the meantime, my fiance comes back at 6pm or later and is absolutely furious.

So what can we do? We've tried going in to the businesses and saying, ""Hey, if your license plate is so-and-so and your car is such-and-such, you have to move,"" but people just blink at us.

I'm thankful for what I have and I don't believe I'm a control freak; I'd just like to try bettering my life, not just settling for what I have.

However, despite my efforts, I just can't seem to find a viable approach. Situations like tuition, social life, and trying to choose useful classes are my main enemies.

Parts of these are out of my control (I can't change the university's regulations, can't change courses that are offered, can't magically summon the ideal friend, etc.), but I feel like I should still try, that there should still be things that I *can* do.

This frustration often hops back and forth between being anger and or sadness.

I'm not sure what I can do to restore my calm mindset.

456,"A bit of background: after receiving phd in cs from a prestigious uni and with a few others started an independent research group. Monetary and reputation wise Everything has been going pretty well. However last week we've concluded that our major project is ... not going going to live up to expectations to say the least.

Basically while we've had successful smaller researches this was the project we dedicated the most time to and expectations on it were pretty high. Having wasted years with very high opportunity cost not only for myself but the whole group has made me feel very down. I've lost confidence in being able to choose future projects (I was mainly responsible for decision making in the group) and have avoided going to the lab past 2 days (physical presence is optional but beneficial). I feel very guilty over my previous over-confidence.

(fortunately financially or reputation wise this won't affect us negatively since we've kept it under wraps and main sources are minor projects anyways, its mainly opportunity cost)

At this point I am even considering quitting and joining a research group at a large company (big four have some good research going on), or outright quitting and taking an year off (I have mult passive income sources so I am not dependent on salary)

We went on a date and met on OKC, in real life when she saw me and wasn't quite impressed with who I was she said something akin to ""We can work on you"". So I told her I think we would work better as friends because i'm not looking for someone to work on me and make me fit the role as their ideal mate. 

We have a few weeks of good fun and I see her at least twice a month schedule permitting. We're texting all the time and really enjoy one another as friends. 

About a week ago she met my current girlfriend at an event where we all hung out and things seemingly were okay but since then she's been more needy than usual. Nothing happened on that day but now when I go a few hours without texting her I get ""???"" texts and the other day when I was hanging out with my girlfriend she texts me ""So I guess you're ignoring me now huh?"". This was after about 2 hours with no response to a question. 

So I tried to lay it out flat to her that when i'm with my girlfriend she is the one who gets my attention. I don't text or look at my phone because i'm with who I want to be with. Furthermore to that I took the time to tell her that lately she has been extra needy, if something was going on to tell me, and she retorted telling me that I was projecting my feelings and trying to make her seem like a crybaby when that wasn't my intention at all.

My dad isn't doing horribly, but he also has multiple health issues. The palliative care nurse I spoke to said most likely, if he has a stroke or heart attack, they won't be able to bring him back.

I could stay with my parents for the foreseeable future, but who knows how long that might be? The doctors said 6 months to 1 year, but what if he lives longer? How long would my husband and I be separated for?

Both me and my husband could move in with my parents, but that would leave our house empty. I know I could stop the mail, but would we just shut off other services while we were gone?

My friend T has a really small business reselling jewelry for some years now. 
Me and T used to be best friends back in middle school.
I'm  I used to sleep at her house when stuff would get really bad at home and lost the track of how many times her house was my happy place. 
I had a great relationship with her family as well. 

On my last teen years we used to make plans to go out, but it ended on me being stood up both times. 

We connected again in college years, and she was so excited to show me her new past time business of reselling chinese earrings and chokers. 

At first I even spend a considerable amount of money in her stuff, because it was kinda cute and I loved to reconnect with her.  She really meant a lot for me. This encounters would always end on empty promises of seeing each other just to hang out at parties. 

The last time I was there to check the new stuff she got, her mother made a scene about how much time had passed since I didn't went there for see the new collection.

I was leaving a really bad depression momentum, and wasn't leaving my house for much. My mother had passed away. 

When confrontaded on ""WHY YOU DIDN'T CAME TO SEE THE NEWS THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS"", I cried.

That moment I realized how much they did not care about chatting or checking up on me. They just saw me as a regular client. 

I bought something simple and cheap, feeling that I owed this because of the invite to ""chat"".

Left her place knowing I would never come back to buy anything from her. 

Cut to nowadays, I still receive standard ""Come  see what's new at my shop"" and today I got another invite to a bazaar. Let's call it the ""Carter's Barzaar"" 

The Carter's girls are wealthy girls from here, that promote this kinda event, and now she has a stand selling her stuff there. She invited to one of these before and I gave some lame excuse.

Today she invited me to another one of those, I politely asked who where these girls and she said: they are my best friends and I consider them to be my sisters.

Ouch. 

Now, she keeps sending me these invites to bazaars I have no intention on going. 

How to politely respond that I'm not interested? I still remember dearly the good days with her and we have friends in common.
