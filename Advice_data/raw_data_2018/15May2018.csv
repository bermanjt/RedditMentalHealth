0,Ive taken 25mg of setroline once and have barely eaten in 3 days because of nausea and loss of appetite. It's made my anxiety so much worse and I want to get it out of my body as quickly as possible. ,15May2018,1
1,"So, I've had this cyberstalker. He really wasn't a cyberstalker until I cut ties with him. I did this because social media was causing my mental state so much trouble that I thought it would be good to cut ties. Anyway, after doing that, two people who i'm not going to mention to hide their identity, which one of them was the cyberstalker, kept begging be to friend them again. I've said no, yet they kept asking. I started blocking them, but sure enough, they'd find my profile elsewhere. The reason I don't want to friend them besides my mental state is due to a bad experience with them. I just want them to leave me alone. Should I just say no again? Or keep blocking them?
TL;DR: I have a cyberstalker who keeps following me, what should I do?",15May2018,1

4,"I was already working part time, me and one other guy do the same job and we were both getting 7 shifts every 2 weeks.

I had Friday and the weekend off, and on Friday my boss changed my schedule. She made it so now I have 6 shifts and he has 8 \(he has worked there 2 years longer than me\).

Now, on 7 shifts every 2 weeks, I could barely afford my bills and I was just trying to hang on for a few more months because both of us were told there was a chance we'd both be made full time later this summer \(we weren't told that by our boss, we are the only 2 part time workers there and that's just what our coworkers were saying\). on 6 shifts, I kinda have to choose between paying rent, paying for my car, or eating.

How do I approach my boss about this?

I was going to talk to her today but decided to wait for tomorrow because the only thing I could think to say was ""If I'm only working 3 days a week, I'll only do that for as long as it takes me to find a new job.""",15May2018,1
5,"I am stuck in a really difficult and very fast moving situation. I graduated high school little over a year ago and have achieved completely nothing. I have no idea what I want to do or what I can honestly enjoy. I've been unemployed for little over 80% of my time out of high school, only holding a job at a bank for about 4 months tell I got fired because I couldn't learn my new job fast enough(I was assigned a new position I had no experience in and given less than a week to learn it, they were probably trying to get rid of me as fast as possible, go figure). Last year I had a plan to go to college for computer science, which would open the doors for a lot of jobs that could make me a sizable income and then I could plan a lot of stuff from there. A lot of my plans involve money and different brackets of money. The problem with going to college is I am very bad at math, very demotivated to improve it, and would get completely destroyed by college, especially STEM mathematics. I know a lot of people in computer science, this is not me being negative, this is me being 100% realistic, I will not be able to pass it no matter how hard I try. I know this because I have tried discrete mathematics and calculus courses on EDX, couldn't do a single one. Because I lack almost six years of background math knowledge. I also don't have a lot of money so going to college can fuck a lot of things up if I get out and suddenly hear, ""mm...sorry...we need someone with more experience...mmmm.."" and then bam, same situation, but $40-60k of debt that somehow has to be paid. 

I also have really lost interest in computers and computer science. I have to absolutely slug through any course or book I am reading on it. Theres nothing I am more sick of, but am stuck in because nothing else makes a livable source of income unless you go into trade or something. 

I had a plan to start my own business, but that relied on another, very well known company and the API change screwed me completely over throwing that idea out. Also theres a ton of competition I didn't know about and it would be hard for me, someone with a basic knowledge of computer programming, to compete against. I also had an idea for a web course but I am running into issues with motivation and strength in the knowledge I have. 

I have looked all over for what I can do. Six months later, nothing is happening, nothing is going forward, nothing looks hopeful. Every corner I turn I look like I am completely fucked. Bills pile up from different stuff, I lose more money, I have no more money to bring in. I am stuck in limbo, where I am surrounded by computers I no longer want to be around, with a feeling of wanting to completely disconnect from the entire world, but instead having to be around more of them if I want any money period, with my hopelessness and depression getting so bad I can't remember things nearly as well as I used to and I can't think of a single reason to go on. 

What would you do in my situation? ",15May2018,1

8,"Tl:dr: I've made a lot of mistakes this year academically, I'm really behind, I'm scared of meeting with this advisor because of her aggressive nature, my inability to understand her, and generally facing all the mistakes I made in one year at once.


Context: I transferred Universities freshman year (graphic design -&gt; environmental economics) this department is really small and tight knit, I have this advisor for a lot of my classes, I know she knows I've been not showing up to classes and I've blown off generous opportunities to finish courses that I failed. I also know she knows I've chosen courses really poorly this year (picking classes gives me a great deal of anxiety so I put it off and forget about it until there's nothing useful left). Freshman year I was a pretty good student and I was really excited to be getting into a major I actually was interested in. When I got to this University I went through a nasty break up (which resulted in months of on and off again abuse) , was left with absolutely no friends, I ended up pretty depressed and just avoided all people and all of my problems as much as I could sophomore year, I couldn't find work that summer and I just kinda did nothing for a year. The start of junior year was supposed to be a bounce back for me, I found some supportive friends and thought I had gotten my shit together and I just ended up reverting back to my unhealthy coping mechanisms from the previous year at the first sign of trouble. I was doing great the first half of first semester, then I got sick and missed a major assignment, playing catch up completely derailed me and I missed 3 of my final exams, ive still been to scared to check my grades for any of my courses last semester. This semester I did the same thing, this time with only one class but I know I did pretty poorly. 

My advisor is Romanian (super thick accent) and Ive got auditory processing disorder (sometimes I can hear words and not comprehend their meaning entirely), I'm also absolutely horrified of meeting with her, the last time we met I got nothing done because I was too anxious to think clearly and just agreed with everything she said. She also got pretty animated about my class selection the previous semester and it was really overwhelming and i just wanna get through this and get back to a place where I feel like I'm on track to get somewhere and feel like I'm in control again. If you read this whole book thanks for sticking around, all advice is appreciated

13,"The college that I am applying to (Tx) has an optional essay to submit with your application if you are a transfer student, which I am. The essay prompt states that the purpose is to inform the admissions committee of any information an applicant may want the committee to consider that is pertinent to the applicants past/ or educational history. The prompt says 500-750 words. 

I moved out when I was 18 (am 24 now) and now I have put school on pause for a year.

15,"Hey Reddit. I am qualified to teach English in China according to all of the governmental standards: Diploma, TESOL cert., 2 Years of experience, ETC. It seems like these days the scam rate online for hiring foreign teachers is extremely high. I don't want to be emailing out my personal and sensitive documents like candy to all of these random job offerings/postings. I have managed to track down some seemingly reputable schools. I am also doing my best to avoid recruiters. 

Advice needed:

 1\) are there any 100&amp;#37; reputable schools/institutions that I could feel safe about doing the application process, sending over my documents?

2\) Also, I am highly considering obtaining a tourist visa so that I can legally enter China and try to get in person interviews, so I can meet the staff, check out the school, etc. I would not sign any contract unless I could have them sponsor a Z visa and Foreign Residence Permit, so that I am not working illegally.  Is this a viable option or would it make things more difficult, trying to get a Z visa within the country? I've read online to never entrust my physical passport to anybody while abroad, but I've also read that a prospective employer may need to hold onto to the passport during the visa process. I have mixed feelings about this.

If there are any redditors out there who currently work for or have worked for a reputable, legal and fair English teaching institute, please throw me some advice. This process seems a little daunting.

16,"Let me first explain to you my current situation. I am currently in an average university in a LEDC. It is not the worst university in the region  but it's it's neither the best, it's tuition however, is affordable. My father works a decent paying job that's enough to afford my family's rent, needs, some wants, and my brother and I's tuition. He is turning 60 this year and is looking to retire within the coming years. We have no savings, but own 3 small properties that bring in enough disposable income for my parents to live off after retirement. 

I have done everything I can academically, maintaining a 4.0 throughout school and my time in university. This was enough to gain me admission to a top tier university abroad. Continuing my studies there would aid me tremendously in seeking employment after graduation, given employment opportunities where I live are sparse. I also feel it's important to mention: if I graduate from my current university, I will have to commit to 3 years of compulsory military service. This will obviously set me back quite abit. 

My question is, would it be fair to ask my parents to sell 1/3 properties and invest that in my education? This will of course mean retirement will be quite less comfortable, but I hope that a better education could help me in providing them with more than this property could have ever provided in passive income.

27,"A little backstory- My girlfriend of 2.5 years just finished grad school and is interviewing in a city about 17 hours from where we live. Obviously she would still need to get an offer/accept it, but I'm trying to think ahead.  It's not where either of us particularly want to end up for good, but it'd be a great opportunity for her. I already have a career started here in our town, but could potentially transfer to that city. What I'm taking into consideration here is that my family has always been close. My mother has macular degeneration, so eventually she could be legally blind. It came up this weekend that we could be moving, and my mom totally freaked out and had a meltdown. The thought of me moving so far away with her eye condition scares her beyond belief in case something happens/she needs me. I've never had a tougher decision. The outcomes that I've thought of are: 1)I move with my girlfriend and my family is disgusted with me for leaving after knowing how much it would hurt my mom. 2)I don't move and I could lose my girlfriend. 3) I don't move and my girlfriend decides not to accept (if she gets the offer of course) and then I just held her back from a great job.

28,"Hey everyone!

I'm going to apologize ahead of time for how long this post may be. I'll try to do my best with consolidating everything.

I'm 25 years old and I'm struggling to make up my mind of what to do with my life career wise.

When I started college I picked Graphic Design as my major as I like design and being creative \(as a child I constantly carried a notebook with me and wrote short stories\). But after about a year and a half of college I started to find myself not liking graphic design. I wasn't interested in print design and found the client designer relationship frustrating after speaking with people in the industry. 

Around this time Interstellar and Imitation Game came out and I became enamored by engineers and what they have and could accomplish, and began to see the design thinking that goes into engineering. I began researching careers that combined design and engineering, and came across Industrial Design. I felt that this could be a career I enjoyed, but saw how expensive this degree could become. Not only that but upon researching and talking to a couple people in the field \(two family members are mechanical engineers\) I found job prospects for this career aren't very common, so I decided not to pursue. 

I found Web Development next, and saw how much job prospects they have and how you can combine design and technology to impact the world. After going through Codecademy and Team Treehouse, I decided to take the plunge and do a coding bootcamp. I finished the front\-end section of the bootcamp, but paused the program after that as I grew uninterested in it and felt as though my passion wasn't there anymore. I even tried building a better foundation through CS50, but I ended up stopping at Week 5 because I just wasn't interested anymore and found myself day dreaming through the lectures.

Last but not least I found UX/UI Design. A career that isn't too technical like web development \(which I didn't care for much\) and has design without the print design. Plus what you design makes a difference in peoples lives. So I taught myself Sketch and read up on best UX/UI practices, and built two projects that showed my process and finished design. I didn't even receive a call back after applying almost everywhere in my area, not to mention UX only seems to be popular in New York and San Francisco so job prospects are slim and competition is strong with no degree.

I've tried applying to IT Help Desk Support jobs \(around 30\) just to get my foot in the door of tech and have only gotten two callbacks and ended up with no job. 

I just feel as though I've wasted so much time following these different avenues and have come up with nothing. The job I'm working in right now \(nurse assistant\) isn't for me at all. It's not a good feeling to be 25 and really have nothing to show for it. I was hoping to be in a good place by the end of the year with at least an internship in a particular field but that doesn't seem like its going to happen when I can't even figure out what to pursue.

31,"I’ll preface this by saying I have pretty significant social anxiety. Talking to new people and being in unfamiliar situations is extremely hard for me and whenever I have the spotlight or pressure on me I get so nervous I shake. So things like this aren’t easy for me

My first day was a 4 hour shift learning the register at the front counter. It seemed harmless at first as I was getting assistance, and then dinner time came. felt like I was going to have a mental breakdown right there in the restaurant. 

You see while I do good in school, I feel like it’s mainly because I study so much, and many things are hard for me to learn and understand. I was basically left to fend for myself with some points another worker would be able to assist me. I fucked up *so* many orders, and there were several times I left customers waiting while I would reset the order, order the wrong item, or would go full idiot and forget how to swipe a cred card through the machine. At one point some old man asked for a Dave’s single, thinking he wanted the combo and not the single burger, I put it in and he became angry and walked out when I read the total as $8. I tried to be calm but my awkwardness just made it all seem terrible. I couldn’t remember anything and it probably made my coworkers so pissed off. I really have never felt so much pressure in my entire life.

I don’t know how I’m going to survive in the real world. I walked home practically crying and talked to my mom on the phone about how awful it was, and I’m *eighteen* fucking years old. And now I have to go right back into hell tomorrow and relive this experience with barely any help.

36,"To start, I have insanely low self esteem, zero confidence, hate the way I look etc. I’m pretty sure I have intense depression. I’m assuming all of this is the reason for my problem. I’m seeing a therapist and have gone for 7 sessions over the last few months. 

Over the last 6 months to a year, my annoyance for people at work had got out of hand. I have an amazing work place with amazing benefits and ample opportunity. Most of the people I work with are extremely smart. 

I find faults in everyone all of the time. I find 90% of the people on my team to be extremely annoying. I find I notice every little thing that people aren’t doing correctly. I get a lot of satisfaction from other people bitching to me about someone. I want people to fail. I totally get that my thoughts about people are bad, but when it comes down to fact, I don’t think I’m incorrect about a majority of the things I think. X person DOES do X wrong, and no one seems to notice, and if they do notice they don’t care. X person also talks to much, explains things poorly, gets very little work done. 

I find my days at work exhausting because I am putting up such a front. Most people think X and I get along amazingly, even X thinks so, but I really cannot stand her. I spend all night thinking about how much I can’t stand her and what I’m going to do about it. I fake it so much at work and try so hard to be nice to people and not show how annoyed I am. I think I do a pretty good job, but maybe not, and either way it is exhausting as fuck. 

I also think everyone at work hates me, aside from a few people. I constantly think my bosses hate me, I over worry about every little thing they say and do. I have to hype myself up to ask them questions sometimes, and if they don’t act happy about answering it can absolutely ruin my day. I almost cry at my desk out of exhaustion from pretending to like people I don’t like, asking my very busy bosses questions, and doing a good job. 

I simultaneously think I’m superior and inferior at the same time, and it’s fucking exhausting.

38,"So I was with one girl who am i am close friends with ( i guess u could call it fwb if u want but whatever, it is what it is ) and two close guy friends of mine

we had been pre drinking before going out, and called a uber to go to a bar. pretty standard stuff till one of my close friends who was sitting in the passenger seat of the car, started reaching his hand back and just resting it on the girls thigh(she was sitting in the middle, i was on her left). she was holding my hand before this happened, out of his sight and we both just looked at each other sort of confused. he then continued to start grabbing my hand OVER her thigh and laughing.

 At this point i was slightly annoyed(but clueless) because from my perspective he was just being weird and way too touchy for my taste with this girl i was with. we all eventually arrived and got out of the uber, i was acting normally and so was she but something was off. He kept apologizing but wouldn't say what he thought he had done. he told us to come have a smoke with him and while this was happening he picked the girl up and started whispering something to her. she later told me that he told her that he was bi and THOUGHT I WAS SEXY. 

this is a guy who has a girlfriend and who i have been hanging out with very frequently for the past 6 months. I have no issue with his sexuality, I really couldn't care less. but the way he went about things that night rubbed me the wrong way. 

do you guys think im right to be uncomfortable and sort of annoyed? 
how would you move forward with the friendship? ",15May2018,1

My problem is: I’m infamous in my community for holding a four-year mutual grudge with the (terrible) administration. I can’t give the typical “these were the best years of my life :)” speech because it’s obvious I’ll be lying and also because my chronic Teen Angst Rebellion means I’ll probably spontaneously combust if I try.

42,"I'm so lost with what to do with this situation that I'm in desperate need of advice or guidance and I appreciate everyone's thoughts and advice &lt;3

I'm an introvert. I keep to myself most of the time and keep things bottled up, so when I finally react to something it's because I've finally exploded. 

I've been working for the same company for six years now and as of recent I've had to share a room with one of my co-workers and it's been a nightmare.

She's the daughter-in-law of the owner of the office, so nobody holds her accountable for her actions because they're careful about not upsetting the owner and then she goes home and her husband doesn't call her out on her shit either, so it's gotten to her head that's it okay to be a crappy person and get away with it.

Unfortunately, it seems like the only person who knows her true colors is me. Everyone thinks she's charming but they don't really know how much of a terrible person she truly is. 

She doesn't proactively do anything to be better instead she stalks people on their social media and judges them. She goes around the office and sparks conversations just to come back to talk bad about them to me. She calls our clients stupid which I think is ridiculous. Clients don't know what they're doing which is why they hire us. She's unprofessional. I've had to ask her for help on things and she'll reply with ""google it"" in a arrogant manner OR when once I tried to do something by myself and then I made a mistake, so I asked her how to fix it and she replied with ""I don't know because I don't make mistakes."" She'll come to the office often with her mood swings and she'll take it out me. She even has disrespected my family. She was ""nice"" enough to bring me a washer and dryer to my house when I needed them just to turn around and tell me my whole family was short and question me why my brother was taller than everyone. I found it extremely hurtful especially when I let her into the intimacy of my home. She's always competing with me. I bought myself and others healthy snacks in the morning. Co-workers came into my office to tell me how good they were and then she proceeded on trying to find how much calories they had just to prove to me they weren't healthy enough. It's not like she cares about what she eats.. she has a whole drawer full of candy and junk. She did it on purpose just to compete with me and prove me wrong. She's selfish. The office is freezing and instead of taking into consideration that she has someone new in the room she replies with ""put on a sweater"" in a nose in the air type of response.

I've finally had enough and decided she's really not my friend and that I should stop being hurt with her behavior, so I decided to treat her just like a co-worker and not engage in conversations with her if I don't need to or spend time with her outside of the office. 

She's definitely felt the cold shoulder from me and now she's going around the office saying that I'm mean and that no one else who has shared an office with her has had an issue with her before (they have all been men NOT women) now I'm the bad guy and it's pissing me off. ",15May2018,1
43,"Hi all, I've got a little emotional problem I guess that I just want some advice on.

So, I went through a pretty rough breakup about two months before prom and with my friends all having plans lined up I knew that I needed a backup plan. I asked a sophomore that I really didn't know and she said yes, we ended up having a great time.

However we also made out and went back to her place after prom where we fiddled around to say the least. I felt ashamed for the most part because I'm a senior and I'm leaving for college in a few months and I really shouldn't of done that but oh well I thought it was just a one time thing. Turns out that it wasn't a one time thing, I found myself hanging out with her more and more for a solid month after. 

As much as I hate to admit it, I guess I did grow some feelings toward her. About a week ago she stopped talking to me a lot and I realized that she was seeing someone else, oh well I thought to myself, shes two grades below me and I'm gonna be gone so what did I expect. 

This whole past week I've been trying my hardest to ignore her but she always messages me with shit like ""don't break the streak"" and ""so are you never gonna talk to me again because I care about you"" and the other day she even said I love you which really pissed me off.

Now I’m waiting for the end of summer and the arrival of my child and I just... don’t feel like any other person would. I’m not excited or thrilled. I’ve been so down and upset throughout this entire pregnancy that I feel like there’s something wrong with me. 

I start doubting myself and my ability to be a good mother to my child. I want them happy... I don’t want them to have a sad mom growing up.

The father and I aren’t married. We live together with his newly engaged brother and their child. It’s a cramped living arrangement. Sometimes I dream about just packing my things and moving back to where I came from and raising the child on my own.

I seem to either not care at all or care way too much about people. For example, I've been talking to this girl for a bit and we seem to be really hitting it off. We were going to go out tonight but she basically ghosted/cancelled. I'm pretty bummed out. It really bothers me that I care and i'm letting this ruin my entire night.

When I see them happy - it makes me feel sad. And I can't figure out why. I can't even say for sure that it's sadness I feel - it's just an overwhelming depressing emotion.

Three of the most vivid situations I have in my head that make me feel sad:

    When my parents came to visit me while I was away at college, we ate out at a restaurant. My mom decided to buy a chocolate chip cookie and got really excited about one piece of the cookie that had a lot of chocolate chips. She said ""oooh I'm going to take a bite here, this looks so good and chocolatey."" I felt so sad when she said that and I still feel sad when I think back on it.

    I invited my dad up to my city to see an NBA game with me. He kept thanking me and telling me what a good time he had with me. I felt so guilty/bad/sad every time he told me that. I don't know why.

    Most recently - my dad texted me ""Mom was very happy you called yesterday [it was mother's day]. She would not stop talking about it. You are a good son."" And that text got me so down, I had to sit in a park and journal.

Why do these instances make me feel so sad?

57,"I went to the dentist about 4 months ago and had some dental work done and my part of the bill was $520. I ended up having to go back about 4 more times over the next couple of months to have the work adjusted over and over. During those 2 months I was in horrible pain ever day. I had to take Ibuprofen every 3 hours just to keep the pain away. 

Now that the pain has finally went away I am very unhappy with the work that they did. I had several cavities filled and a couple of my front teeth have these ridges that I can feel with my fingernail. They already ground these down several times during those 2 months to smooth them out but the ridges keep coming back. Once, another filling I've had for several years randomly cracked and they drilled it out and refilled the cavity while never once informing me that it would cost me anything, let alone $120 extra. They just said ""oh this one is cracked, done worry we'll fix it."" 

I am extremely dissatisfied with the work that I had done and I know some of it will have to be fixed. I wouldn't let then near my mouth again if they were the last dental practice on Earth. I have refused to pay my bill so far just because I've been in pain and so unhappy with the results. I'm assuming the fillings on my front teeth will have to be redone and my $1000 limit for the year on my dental insurance is already gone until next year, preventing me from having it done by somebody else soon. 

Do I have any chance of negotiating my bill down. I just can't stand the thought of paying them the full amount for terrible work, especially since I'm going to have to pay somebody else to work on my teeth to fix their mistakes. Do I have any legal recourse that won't cost a lot of money? I don't want to take them to court, and it's not a large amount of money that I wouldn't want to.

59,"For the last 5 years, on and off for some time, I have been working the dish pit at any local small restaurant. Sometimes as a fry cook. What started as a mean to help put some cash away for post-secondary school has turned into a deep hole of continuous monotony. Over those 5 or so years, I have taken some time off (months) to go back to school, only to be dragged back into the work force due to the cost of education here in the US.


Notwithstanding the fact that I am over 21 years old doing a job that is essentially a 'kids job' for minimum wage, living pay-check to pay-check. Saving up what I can to pay off rent, food, and student debt.


I would lack honesty here if I failed to mention that fleeting moments of anger, the desire to just call it quits, never came over me. While I get that the industry that I currently work in is stressful (as I do work it near weekly,) the constant stress and the low pay with little-to-know possible escape is beginning to eat at me.  I want something better for myself! The problem is, I can't seem to figure out how to get out!


Living and working in a small town has is perks; job prospects is *not* one of them! The fact that the only jobs that I can attain are those that are either:

1.) In the food industry, specifically back-of-house work
2.) Jobs that entail little cash incentives or other benefits for betterment or advancement.


I get it. I am not as valuable to society as someone who has a degree. However; that does not restrict me from ever bettering myself. The fact that I still have a job in a stressful industry to be indicative of my capacity to deliver and being reliable. Yet, I still cannot for the life of me get a better job in my home town.


I could go around town with my resume, applying to *any* position that is not dish-washing; however, since I work the week days, that limits my window for interviews as well as trying out for positions other than back of house work. I could simply leave town and move, but to where? This also assumes that I have the capital to do so!


Instead of just wining and bitching about ""oh, poor me and my shit life!"" I actually just want to get a better job so I can save up for school, go back to school, *AND* actually move on with my life. If I am interested in doing a job, I know I poses the capacity to learn the tricks-of-the-trade and the will to do it. Do I want to trade the dish pit for working behind the bar as a barback/porter for some extra tips while learning how to be a bartender/server? You bet! How about a poker/blackjack dealer? Absolutely! Super waiter &amp; host for your breakfast bar? I'm your guy! Just show me how it is done and I can do it. The skills I learned in the kitchen may not be how to make a killer creme' brule, but rather how to manage stress when your chef is screaming at you,  how to balance things when there are more dirty dishes than guests waiting outside, and oh...you still have morning deliveries to do before lunch rush, and after that you have to help your sous chef with prep work as well before dinner rush.


Make no mistake, I can do the job. The problem is that I need a new direction in my life. I just don't know how to do about it. Has anyone had a similar situation in life? What can I do to get myself into a better job this year even if it is a min job with tips like bar backing and serving. Should I move out of my home town? Face my fears of the unknown and brace whatever challenge comes to me? What would you recommend I do to get out of this 'rut' I am in?",15May2018,1

65,"I (39yo) have a daughter (12yo) from my marriage (over 14 years) which ended in a shitshow. She's more my clone than my daughter. I started a relationship with a guy (34yo) who wasn't that attractive at first, but became more attractive when I saw how he interacts with my daughter. 

We started a relationship, 1.5 years now. From the very beginning I told him I don't want any more children of my own. He said he was fine with that. I told him I didn't think he could give up something as important as having a child with his DNA. He said we could foster or adopt, which I am 100% on board with. 

About a month ago his brother committed suicide (26yo). His response to the tragedy is, ""I want a baby boy NOW, and I want to name him after my brother...let's get pregnant ASAP."" Whereas my response to the tragedy is, ""There are so many people/children who are depressed who need help. I want to help them and care for them."" And NOT to intentionally bring another life into the f'd up world.

I truly don't think anything can change my mind. I never wanted children because my childhood sucked. I tried several times with my ex and had numerous miscarriages, and my daughter. After she was born I didn't want any more children, but tried for my husband's sake and had more miscarriages. I was the youngest of 2 siblings, my brother was/is always the favorite. I suffer from depression and was suicidal for a very very very long time. 

I am happy with what I have and now want to use my life to make others better. I want to travel, without restraint, to help women and children in impoverished countries. I have my legacy, my daughter. I have taught her to avoid the same mistakes I made, and she is wicked smart. It's true that if anything happened to her I would not be able to live on. My ex used to say that because of this we, ""need a replacement,"" in order to encourage me to have more children. But I am good with what I have, keeping her safe, and content with living one day closer to the end of my time here.

Should I just end the relationship? I don't think he could ever truly stop wanting a child of his own. And honestly, the age difference is nothing compared to the life experience difference between he and I. I often feel like he is my second child because of his lack of exposure to life.

Today, the girl wanted to use them again, I kept telling her to use the cheap markers. Ann got annoyed, and I let her use them as long as the markers were capped.

This isn’t like an established rule but we both do it. If I’m the one that’s busy and can’t text, then I have to text her after I’m done. If she’s the one that’s busy, she texts me after she’s done. Like on Monday and Wednesday, I’m home the whole day while she’s at school so she’s the one that has to text me once school ends

Anyway things have been weird lately between us, we’ve been fighting. 

Today I didn’t get a text from her the whole day, and I text her around 6 asking if she’s alive and she’s just like “ya” so I don’t reply. Later we facetime and I ask her what time she got home, she tells me from 2:30 to 6:00 she was home. And that whole time she didn’t text me once. The problem here is that she ALWAYS does. We always talk and FaceTime as soon as I get home. Literally always. So if something that happens literally everyday changes, obviously I’m going to say something

I tell her “so you were home for 3 and a half hours and didn’t text me once?” And we got into an argument and she tried making me look crazy for expecting her to be the one to text me when she got home. Even though that’s just what we do everyday. The thing is everytime we fight, she doesn’t text me after school and we have this same argument everytime

When I don’t text her after I get home when I’ve been busy the whole day, she says the same shit to me “you’re the one that supposed to text after youre not busy”

Then during the argument she says “I’m getting deja vu to when we were dating, you’re a control freak”

That just pissed me off and I left. I’m not the one that even started this fucking rule that we have to text after we aren’t busy anymore. She didn’t either, it’s just something we both do. She’s the one that makes dumb little rules like “we arent allowed to leave eachother on read” and stuff like that, then she calls me a control freak for wondering why she didn’t text me when she ALWAYS does

75,"I am on a Throwaway account for reasons.
So I am in a relationship with a person we will refer to as ST.
I am worried my relationship is turning abusive and I don't know what to do about it.  If my phone gets a notification ST informs me I have one and asks what it is about. There was one occasion they went through my phone but found nothing obviously. St is constantly asking me who I am texting and asking why. St gets upset if I try to go hang out with friends without ST. ST generally is just jealous of anything even just watching TV can make ST get frustrated. ST loses there mind when I ask permission to play video games, and always shuts down the idea even if included. 

The problem is I don't know what to do, and I feel so lonely with and without ST. I struggle to address these issues and when I build the courage to ST promptly gets upset and makes me feel guilty thus I have to console them. ",15May2018,1

77," He is not an insane guy, he can actually be quite a cool dad sometimes. He often takes me out to dinner or for coffee, he buys me expensive stuff too. It's just  that you can tell I'm not the son he wants me to be. At home, he would often get mad at me for  basically existing, calling me an idiot and complaining about how I do everything wrong. He has a habit of permanently  changing the rules to more strict ones when he is mad (For example, since I was a child I tended to get out of shower with a towel and change when I got to my room. Recently he told me it wasn't a normal thing to do and scolded me again. It is a change in my habits, so I keep forgetting to bring in clothes to the bathroom and he gets angrier.) I pretty much try to hide from him in fear of getting grounded on the spot if he is angry, but he keeps barging into my room and scolding me again. When he is mad at my siblings, he generally uses a plural pronoun when lecturing to include me too. And then he goes to take me out and treat me nicely so I can't be sure if he is abusing me or not. I have told him I was feeling down for no reason sometimes and overthink (I don't want to call it depression but I am taking medication) and he is refusing to aknowledge that it is happening. He also doesn't like me sympathising with Jews and the West so much and tells me not to me an enemy of my own nation. 

My mom is also crazy. She told me she'd kick me out if I wasn't a Muslim and guilt trips me to pray. She is prone to throwing fits and is one of the people that try to protect ""family values"". Hell, she just got mad  at me because I swear when I am with friends and she doesn't want  me watching movies with sexual or violent content- I am almost 17. I'd probably get kicked out if they knew I was into dudes. I am not sure how would it affect me but seeing how close I am to my mom (We often cuddle and I think I am closer to her than normal.)

78,"Hello reddit readers,
I’m a 23 year old who lives in the states. My parents have been really controlling. I’m currently enrolled in a summer class at university. They demanded me to show them my schedule, even though I was the one that paid for the class.
They need to know where I am at all times, and they’re trying to force me to go on vacation with them to our home country, which is a place I do not want to go. They know I don’t want to go, but they’re insisting that since I live over their roof that I need to abide by their rules. It’s getting out of hand.
I’ve thought countless times on moving out, but moving out before getting married is taboo in our culture, so I don’t know how to approach this. 
I’ve shared my location with them during winter semester, and they’d continuously call me if I go get food outside of campus, or if I stop at the supermarket to buy snacks. It’s overwhelming and I already suffer with depression and anxiety.
How do I approach this situation? Do I move out and be disowned by my family? Because it’s at a point where I’m being verbally abused by my mother every day, and it’s taking a toll on my day to day life.
I apologize that this is long, but it would be nice to get insight from people who have been through something similar or know how to handle a situation like this.

86,"Sorry if this is lengthy. Just a brief history, met this girl a few years ago, she was dating someone at the time. Few months later, I found out she broke up with her bf cuz he cheated and a friend told me that she liked me, but I never made a move because we were coworkers and had become friends. For the past few years we’ve hung out in group settings, and text/Snapchat everyday. She started dating her ex again. A few days ago, she started acting different, like extra friendly to me and I think she may have broken up with her bf. Keep in mind I know I’m an over thinker and get anxiety and I’m not the most experienced person with women. 

So she almost begged me to hang out a couple days ago, along with a mutual friend(but is her best friend). She then wanted to hang out again today, and go see avengers. We used to only hang out maybe once every 2-3 weeks. So sitting in the theater, and our friend leaves for a few minutes during the movie. I can’t explain it, but I felt a connection and thought that I should kiss her. I felt like she kept looking over at me. Being the wuss that I am, I decided not to do anything. After the movie ended, she kind of hurried into our friends car(they drove together), and when our friend asked if we wanted to hangout she got real quiet and could tell she didn’t want me to come with them. I might be crazy, but I think she might have wanted me to kiss her and was mad I didn’t, but either way she definitely seemed upset one way or another. 

My question, should I ask her if I did something wrong? Or should I ask our friend if she said I did anything to upset her(who’s her best friend)? Should I just wait till tomorrow to see if she says anything and if not ask her? What do I do?

Tl;dr I think I might have made crush/friend mad about something, and need advice how to approach it",15May2018,2
87,"So, Things have been a little strange with my SIL and me for a while now.
I feel as she has this undisclosed dislike or jealousy over me.  I really don't like using the word jealousy but I can't help it when it comes to her.  I'll give you guys a brief examples of how our relationship has been and what has drawn the line in the sand between the both of us.

My SIL and I have always for the most part gotten along.  She's more the dominant in the relationship as to where I let her do most of the talking and advice giving because she feels she's always right.  She's always telling me not to trust any women including girlfriends or best friends and in times has put her husband (my husband's twin brother) in situations with women to see how he reacts.  Although her and I are complete opposites with our lifestyles, I still managed to show her love and have her always be part of my life.  And, I do have to say my hubs has never been a fan of hers since the day they first met, but is still very nice and cordial with her and has never changed anything in my relationship with her. I listen to my husband's prior experiences with her but have no comment as I've never really had problems with my SIL. 

My SIL, is more the hitting the gym every day (which has a great bod!!!) Pool parties and night clubs every weekend while the hubby works.  I'm more the yoga/spinning with my bestie, focused on getting my jewelry business going and weekends fishing with the hubs or doing any outdoor things like concerts, golfing and hanging with the fam etc.. Or like she likes to call me, the more family person.

So, here's the where I noticed that some things have changed… I was really cool with my husband's brother. (his twin that is) He's a very nice guy, we've had great conversations but about a little over a year now, I've noticed him avoid me.  Not sure as to why because I only see him when we have family dinners.  I noticed him not greeting me with a kiss on the cheek any longer and practically ignoring my existence when I speak at the table.  It has even become obvious to my husband, where he has heard me ask his brother a question, and his brother completely ignores me and starts talking to someone else at the table. 

Not sure why this is happening, but I really feel it has to do with my SIL.  I do recall two incidents that make me believe that she doesn't like him talking to me.  One… we were at the dinner table a while back and we were all discussing a subject and her husband, and I were talking and agreeing with the topic and she gave him this really dirty look, like why are you agreeing with her kind of look.  The other incident was another dinner occasion when I wanted to get a PowerAde and her husband said I'm not going to finish mine, you can have it.  I thought she was going to punch him.  Her demeanor changed and she started acting dry with him at the table… and theres many more but just those two really made me feel uncomfortable.  

I'm not a friendly girl with her guy so I don't understand, in fact I'm always with my husband or like she says to me that "" I spend way too much time with him, and I shouldn't lose myself over a man"". But I can't help it when we love each other's company.  So I try to show her that I love spending time with my hubs but I can also have fun and hang with the girls!  So about 6 months or so ago we made plans to have a sisters afternoon!  We met up at her favorite bar AS and we had lunch/ drinks!  We had a great afternoon!  I felt like I wanted to open up more to her and tell her a part of my life although I was a bit hesitant;  I don't know what it is but how she speaks about other people and the conflicts she's always in makes me want to be closed with her.  I just feel like it's a soap opera with all the drama she constantly has in her life.  So I'm trying my best in opening up to her because I would like to be closer to her, I mean… she's my SIL and I would like for us to all get along, do things together and just be happy.  So I decided to open up by letting her know that my husband and I have been working on having a baby!  I told her we felt it was the right time for us and that well be making them auntie/uncle soon, god willing.  Her response was… girrl, are you sure you're ready for that? That she's happy for us!  She then said that she has way too much to do in traveling before bringing a child to the world.  That I am the more family kind and she sees how were both ready.  She also joked on how she barely has time to take care of the pet lizard her brother gave her.  But when she's ready to have a baby she knows shell get pregnant on the first try.

So my response was, ""well I know one day when you're ready, you'll make a great mommy"".  We went ahead and left it at that, had a great afternoon.

A few weeks later, she calls me to see how I'm doing and also asking me how's the baby making going, I'm like good, I was very transparent with her on what was going on.  I had a bit of complications at the gynecologist.  I found out I had a polyps in my uterus that I had to get them removed etc.…
It was a success, they were removed and I had to wait a few weeks before continuing our conceiving process.  Throughout this time my SIL had been super attentive with texts and phone calls wanting to know if I was pregnant and how things are.  I didn't think much of it so I was super open.  A couple of months after I invited her to a jewelry trunk show I was hosting.  It was a great time and once again she asked me how it was all going and if I was pregnant already.  I was like no, you'll definitely be one of the first to know, I responded.  She then said that she wanted to have a baby one day but she wants me to have mine first.  I was very weirded out by the whole conversation.  I felt like ok, theres no competition here.  I left it like that because I didn't understand why this is now always a topic of conversation with us.

So about 2 months after my trunk show she sent me a text saying she has something to tell me and that it wasn't a bad thing. I was like no worries, call me or text me whatever you want and she left it like that with no response.  A few days after that, my husband and I decided to drive down to the keys with friends and on our way back my husband's mother call us on facetime with my SIL and the entire family to let us know that she's pregnant.  My husband and I were In shock, I feel maybe it could have been the way it was delivered but I still feel very weird about her now.  I did text her to congratulate her and that I was very excited for her and her response was Thank you!  Yes girl, now you guys are next!!! And I pretty much have left everything the way it is. 

I'm kind of sadden on how things were handled, I really don't know how to be with her moving forward.  Please let me know what you guys think and If you have any advice?  Thank you guys.

91,"Evening guys. 

Really in need some job and life advice. Getting tunnel vision with life and need input.

Six years ago I decided to stop being unhappy with life and working my 9-5 college job and chase after a college degree. I worked full time throughout this to get the bills paid and stay afloat, and it was really hard to do with several life changing bumps know the road, but glad to say I recently graduated university with my bachelor's of science in a environmental and geospatial degree with zero dollars in school debt. 

The issue is: I had a friend recommend me for a job I wasn't too terribly interested in. It has some relation to my major, but isn't exactly what I want for my career- I'd basically be doing permitting and requests. I received my first interview out of college a week ago, and my first offer today- which I told the company I needed a couple days to think on and they were somewhat rude about and gave me until tomorrow to give them an answer on accepting the job. The company is 45 minutes from me, and in a part of a large city that traffic is extremely congested and I'd have a rough commute. The company interviewed me and they said I'm great at interviewing and a heck of a candidate, but they want to start me at a pay rate that is much lower than I'm seeking (29k a year before taxes- classmates have told me to not go below 35-40k as well as professors.) This is also a contract to hire job, so there's no for sure guarantee that I would be with the company when all is said and done after the six month period and I want to land somewhere where I can build with a company, not leave after six months.

So with all this said, I'm not really feeling confident in this job and thinking I can get a better job and have been applying every chance I get. I've got it right in front of me, and this would get my foot in the door, but it's not the career I want. Location isn't ideal, job only slightly deals with my major but not exactly what I want, something is just nudging me telling me I can do better, pay isn't too good and something is telling me I'd be unhappy. What do I do here? Is turning my first job offer down a bad thing?  ",15May2018,1
92,"Just got hired at Walgreens as a Pharmacy Tech. Have barely been working two weeks and have basically just been training this entire time.

Had been pestering this laboratory for a year because I wanted to be hired as an entry-level chemist (I have a degree in Chemistry and have had very little luck finding a job). This laboratory in particular specializes in exactly the area that I would like to go into. Seriously, this is my dream job. I have an interview on Friday. I already took an entry test which got me the interview half an hour after I took it. I think they are really interested in me and that I have a high chance of getting it.

I am getting unnerving anxiety however about having to tell Walgreens that I am getting a new job and will no longer be able to work there. I signed a pharmacy tech “log” today that made me realize they haven’t had a new pharmacy tech in two years. This is not a job that turns quickly. I have a feeling they are going to be very unhappy.

What do I do? I don’t want to say anything before the interview for fear of jeopardizing what I already have, and I don’t want to put the cart before the horse in case I don’t end up getting the job. However, I’m not sure how long this new job would give me in order to be able to give Walgreens ample notice. How do I lessen the blow?

98,"I've noticed this in some people just in general, but I'm going to specifically talk about my mom and my sister because they are the cases I have to deal with on a daily basis.

I'd first like to explain that I'm in no way trying to belittle them or be disrespectful. I love my family, try to spend as much time as possible with them, and hope they enjoy the lives they live.
But these situations that they put me in makes me just want to leave. 
I have two sisters but I'll be only talking about the one closest to me (I'm the youngest, she's the middle child). I've always been fairly close with her, but in the last 2-3 years she's gotten increasingly short-tempered, selfish, and overall oblivious of all of this. 

This is where the question comes in.

They're the type to constantly be saying things along the lines of, ""I'm so [nice, caring etc.]"", ""I give so much"", ""We can't be mean people"" etc.

My sister is the one to always bring up how she is constantly 'helping' people when all she does is ask for favors and occasionally buy little presents for the parents or something. And then every time you make a comment, all hell breaks loose and she's talkin shit for like half an hour. So naturally I just don't say anything and go about my day. But when these two individuals are ignored, they crave attention and I always notice them either talking to me nonstop or just trying to grab my attention anyway they can (shouting, poking etc). 

I'm not a violent person, and I just don't let things get to me usually, but this honestly gets me a little irritated because if I did the same thing this stupid gal would have her panties in a bunch.

I want to end it here, but one more example. My mom was in my room about 5 minutes ago and I was watching a Bob Ross episode cause, well Bob Ross is dope. He had an owl with him and she just went off on how ""He's like her"" because he likes animals and she likes animals. 
You could say that... but my mom is weird in the way that it's on and off. One hour she'll be super ""I love nature, omg the world is so bizarre"" and the next she'll have the few birds she has locked up for days where I have to say something each time to take them out. 

I just don't really know what to do because my ""live my life around their annoyance"" isn't working out too too well...
Any opinions are appreciated, thanks guys",15May2018,0

107,"A person that I met 10 months ago online and at one point called my best friend changed a lot in last 3 months. In those months, we started talking a lot less. Whenever I tried to start a conversation, I would be met with short answers that just screamed ""please go away"". When I would confront them about it, they would apologize, put some effort in talking for a little bit and go back to old habits of short answers.

That only changed for a short while when one of their neighbours passed away. I tried to do my best to help them out. However, when I was in a similar situation with one of my friends passing away a month after, I was met what I can best describe a pat on the back and being told that it will pass. And that's it. Any effort I put in to communicate with them since then was met, again, with short answers.

At this point i don't know if I should end the friendship. Because this person isn't the same person that I met and called my best friend. And if will, should I confront them about it or just move on and say nothing?",15May2018,1
108,"So I've(25) been dating this girl (23) since March, talking to her since early February. She has severe anxiety that she has been working past for years. Everything has been abaolitely perfect. I've been through a few serious relationships and for once, nothing has gone wrong. From likes and dislikes to day-to-day and meeting family and friends.. All of it clicks so much more than anything I've experienced. And that includes a three year, moved in, and engaged relationship I had end this time last year.

We live about 100 miles apart, but her family is here while she's in college and we've seen each other for at least 2 days every two weeks. Last weekend I got to go visit her town for 4 days and everything went right. Until I put my foot in my mouth once too much and triggered her anxiety to the point of disassociation.

 I also made some comments sporadically about loving the town and wishing I could leave the city and poof up there which were taken as me wanting to move there and in with her now or very, very soon.

So the next week (last week) was near silence until we spoke about it and she said she didn't want to throw things away over a bad weekend and I would get another chance.

Then it got quiet again. One word responses and lulls in the conversation that went out awkwardly long. I wanted to give her space but it seems like she stewed in her thoughts.

I asked her if it seemed our spark had dimmed a bit and she said yes. I said I was like 90% sure it seemed like she didn't want to be with me anymore And she agreed and said she didn't feel the same way, then set her status on Facebook to single. She wasn't cold or mean or anything like that, but it was done.

Advice I've been given is to give it a few days before saying anything, and then to try to show her how much she means to me. My thought is making the three and a half hour drive on my own for the first time and ASKING if she would like to talk on the way for closure.

Does this seem like a wise course of action? I don't want to bring gifts because I don't want her to even unconciously think I'm trying to 'buy' her back. And I don't want to just show up on her doorstep or wait where she works because stalking is real and seeming clingy was one of the issues that lead to this.

109,"I've messed up. I can admit that much and its a good place to start because I know my mistakes now and how to avoid them.

Just some background, I am a student who gets a tri-yearly student loan installment and I'm also working a part time job.

I had moved out from my ex back in December due to a major fight, however we made amends in February due and moved back in together. Mistake number 1. This endeavour cost me about 2k, and as a student, I can't afford that loss.

Now, the fighting has resumed, she's been slandering me to her friends and family and leaving the apartment in a literal mess. I need to move out again, but I cannot afford it nor do I know if I will be able to until September.

I have maybe a thousand dollars to my name right now.  If i liquidate all my ""luxury stuff"" like my gaming PC and old textbooks, throw another thousand on top. 

 I need $250 easily for the movers, damage deposit, and first months rent (1 bedroom is about 750/mth around here).  Throw 200 on that for utilities, I scratch bare minimum.

I know that in the long run I can afford it, my loan grants me so much living allowance and rent money in September, but in the short term I do not have the cash.  If need be I can nab a second job come the fall, but I'm wondering...

A) Does anyone have recommendations on how to deal with this type of situation? I haven't been in town long so I don't really have any friends I could room with in the meantime.

B) Are there options for students stuck in financial crisis, ideally for a Canadian?

Some of the things I read seemed eerily similar to some of the afflictions I go through every single day. I just wanted to come onto here to get some other opinions, as I am only fifteen years old and can sensationalize things to myself sometimes.

* My extreme fear of rejection. Whether doing something as simple as asking a teacher a question or another student for a pencil, I often freeze up. It can take a whole two minutes or so before I can actually do the thing I wanted to do, or just find an excuse to back out of it.
* This goes with my fear of rejection, but I have a lot of trouble talking to new people. Unless I have another friend in the class with me, I find myself unable to socialize with anyone else. On the occasion I do have a friend with me, I am able to be myself without much trouble.
* I have a really hard time making eye contact with people. I didn't actually read this anywhere as being a sign, but I feel like it could have something to do with it.

A lot of the things on this list were just noticed at the beginning of the school year \(mid\-August\). So, is this just a normal teenage thing that I'm going through or is it something more? Thanks to anyone who helps, and anyone who read all the way through.",15May2018,2

113,"I work at a big box store and have been since August of last year, as a part time cashier. Over the last few months, I’ve been trying to get out of my current department and out to the sales floor but it seemed like they didn’t want to take my requests to relocate seriously until my boyfriend accepted a leadership position in my department which was great. Now they’ve basically been forced to move me elsewhere, but here’s where the disappointments begin.

I need full time. I’ve been asking for full time since I started. I’ve applied to dozens of full time positions but I haven’t had any luck getting any of them. After applying to yet another full time position last week, I was basically told today that I needed to apply to the part time of the same job designation because they believed the full time spot was posted in error (which is a bunch of crap), as well as my performance in my former position was inconsistent (which is also crap because my numbers throughout the last few months have been consistently high) and I basically need to prove to management that I’m a good fit in my department for at least a month before I can even be considered for a full time position. He wants me to learn from my co workers and I intend to do that but what if they chose to ignore any progress that I make? 

It’s a huge gamble, because it relies directly on customers accepting cards and services that most customers might not be interested in. It’s hoping that a full time position will even be there but what if there aren’t any available or they hire externally again. I’m tired of being passed over, I work hard and pick up extra shifts. I work my ass off when I’m there. 

I just don’t have a lot of faith in the promises that he made, that he wouldn’t fill it externally but I’ve seen it before at my last job, and it took my almost a year and a half to advance to a higher position. 

I guess I’m just trying to rationalize my staying with the company. Should I tough it out and hope that they find me worthy to put into a full time spot? Do I take this as a sign that I’m not meant to stay and use this as an out? I don’t want to leave but I almost can’t afford to stay.

117,"So... I recently started working somewhere and met this guy. For whatever reason, him and I really hit it off in the friendship department. Now, he has a girlfriend &amp; I respect that relationship and do NOT wish to crash it whatsoever. However... on HIS end I’m not quite sure how he feels?? Idk if I should step back or??
One of the first days of knowing him, I drove him to his bank on our lunch break since he didn’t have a car &amp; when we got into the car the first thing he said was, “no way you’re single because no guys wants to date you. It has to be you that just don’t wanna date anyone.” 
Then on another occasion, I came back from grabbing food on a lunch break and went to sit on the benches outside by a female coworker &amp; well— he happened to be there as well. When I approached the bench to sit down, idk what he was talking about to his other coworkers, but he looked at me and called me girlfriend number two and I was just SOOO confused and just went “hm???” But he then quickly moved on. 
Well, then last Thursday after I dropped off my friend back at her place, I get a call from him asking me to pick him up from the gas station as he was tipsy and didn’t wanna walk home. He said, “come onnnn, how much do ya love me?”
I hesitated, but since I was already driving and in that area, I picked him up anyways. We drove around for a bit since he didn’t wanna go straight home, but then when I went to drop him off he said, “let’s sit outside for a bit and talk before I go inside.” And so I did, we talked and what not. It got.. weird though. For somebody who has a girlfriend, he sat oddly close to me and also asked me about my glasses since he had never seen me wear them before. He then stole them and put em’ on and he also said how he thinks people who wear glasses are cute. When I decided I should head home, he stood up at the same time as I did and hugged me. Full. On. Hugged. Me. I didn’t know what to do honestly?? 
A few other little things are just like how he stole a sip of my coffee, bought me coffee on several occasions, I sometimes catch him staring at me and one day I was going to ask him a question that was work related and I started off with, “would you go—“ and he said “on a date with you? If that’s the question then yes I would” and I got all flustered.  He also always calls me hun.. idk it’s just weird. He has a girlfriend, yet does all of this and it makes me weary of him since I don’t wanna be the person that makes his current relationship end.. ugh.

121,"so watching the news I always see these buses and trucks trying to go under bridges that are too low for them.  me being an idea guy came up with a simple system to stop a vehicle from going under a too low bridge.

It's simple.  place a sign 10 feet from the bridge over the roadway.  this sign says ""If you hit this sign then you will not fit under the bridge""
so the bus or truck hits the sign, that triggers warning lights and maybe a arm that goes down and goes across the entrance.
so only an idiot or a crazed maniac bus driver would bust through the arm with all the lights. the bus driver stops, nobody gets hurt or killed.

so i drew up plans for this and sent to to the biggest railroad corp .  the last one that had the low bridge that killed some people on the bus.

Never heard back from them .  gave up and forgot abut. 10 years ago.

He thinks I’m the worst driver on this planet. Whenever something happened to me on the road he ALWAYS gets fucking furious and starts blaming ME for other people’s actions. 

Last time this happened this crazy van was speeding I was too but at an acceptable speed. I was in the fast lane (was going 75 limit is 65) so there I was and I see this crazy van speeding behind me and in my mind immediately I think “well can’t get on middle lane (the were cars there) and I can’t speed up (dad locked it at 75)” so I just stayed there and kept going at my speed. This van was going WAY faster perhaps 90ish. So there I was in the lane going 75 while this crazy shjt is going 90 and there’s no possible way of me getting out and I keep seeing this van approaching and FAST so I start to panic until I realize I can’t do shit to avoid getting my ass rammed so I just calm tf down. So then right before he hits me (instead of slowing down) he goes off of the road, his tires start doing this crazy sound when you go off of the road and fucking shit just keeps driving. Bitch almost took my fucking mirror with him. When dad got home I told him kinda as a “haha see what happens when I can’t speed” joke and dude. 

The guy LITERALLY said it was my fault. Bruh. What the fuck would you have me do in that situation? Didn’t even answer my question. Just kept saying I shouldn’t be looking at my rear view mirror.  Oh ya? Then WHY THE FUCK do car makers put rear view mirrors? -.- 

Today I was almost rammed by an 18 wheeler. This time I did everyone correctly. I wasn’t speeding at all. I was getting out of the freeway and this shit almost rammed his thing into me because he wasn’t paying attention to cars. At the last second I had to give it all of the gas and go off of the road to avoid being hit. 

I’m not even telling him about it. I just know he will say it was my fault.

123,"Almost two week ago, I was sitting home alone enjoying my day, when my roommate comes back with two people. A man and a woman, both 30\-somethings. They pack all of their stuff into the living room and part of the kitchen and stay for the night. \- The next day I ask what they are doing here and he tells me ""they are just staying for three days until their apartment application goes through.""

Well 3 days goes by and only the guy is left behind. He doesn't leave. I ask my roommate what's going on and he tells me that ""his girlfriend bailed and now he's gonna stay here for two weeks until he can afford to move.""

So a week passes and I notice that the guy never leaves the apartment. Ever. Except to get beer. He's constantly drunk. And I ask my roommate what's going on and this is what he tells me ""He's got a job making a lot of money under the table. He owes me 2500 dollars and he's going to pay me back before he moves. So he's staying on the couch paying me back.""

So apparently, this guy, without any warning for me, is going to be living here MONTHS, being annoying talking constantly, being drunk and listening to what I'm doing in my room. I just want this guy out, and every time I ask about when he's moving, my guy dances around the subject and basically tells me to get over it.

I could have done 2 week, no problem, but now it's going to be my entire summer having to live under the same roof as this guy, he never leaves and the wall are paper thin.

Here's the kicker, nobody likes him. No one. He has to stay here or he's homeless, but he still manages to find girls on tinder to shack up with and had the audacity to complain about not having a key and not getting to bring girls back to our couch. He also has a dog.

I only make 730 dollars a month. 500 of that goes to rent. I'm living pay check to pay check off of foodstamps and looking for another job. How should I go about dealing with this guy if my roommate is unresponsive?

I am essentially interested in a Psych degree in mental health and counselling, but, I am truly not made to understand math or complex sciences. Would it be stupid to major in English? I am worried I won't find a job that will suit me well. I actually found jobs that include writing for mental health, and this is exactly what I would enjoy doing. It's just that I feel without a Psych major, I can't write or edit. Moreover, I feel as though I can't really do the opposite without the other. I'm not sure if this makes sense but I don't want to just end up as a high school English or Psychology teacher just because I couldn't find what I wanted.

I am very hard working but when prompted with making a decision for myself, I am extremely unsure because I am somewhat perfectionist in my thinking.

I still work with the original owner and am a friend with them. How do I tackle this situation? I was originally just got going to tell, but then it’ll just be much worse when word does get out, and I’m sure it will. It’s hard to keep cute pup pics off Facebook etc. I’m at a loss here... 

I just want to keep the dog happy and safe and that’s what I can and will do. I also would like to not hurt either other party’s feelings if possible. Any advise would be appreciated. It is clear that they do not want to dog to go to the original owner due to the care provided for the dog and I imagine their whole falling out thing that happened and I’d like to respect their wishes.

142,"I'm 17M and on the next school year I'll be on my 12th grade. I am from Asia and I could ""indirectly"" feel the pressure of my parents' and peer's expections on me. My parents are expecting me to pass a LOT of College Admissionship Tests, and hopefully they expect me to land a scholarship. 

As of now, it is our summer break and I bought myself a CAT (College Admissionship Test) book reviewer, and I've decided that I shall dedicate 5 hours a day in studying the book reviewer.

I can say that I am quite ""smart"" on academics since I can study dillegently for countless of hours, but right now,  whenever I try to study I could notice myself lose focus cause' I could not stop thinking negatively. Whenever I try to study on a subject, negative thoughts keep bubbling up inside my mind. Things like: ""What if you wont pass"", ""What if you're not smart enough"", ""What if things would go wrong""--- all of the negative 'IFs'.

At times like this I can see my confidence fading away, resulting me to feel hopless; and eventually it makes me give up on studying which causes me to play video games all day.

150,"I'm going to keep this as simple as I can. Basically, me and my family don't know what to do or who to talk to who can help us right now.

So my older sister is special needs but that's too much of a broad term. She's all over the autism spectrum, but her biggest disability is her behavior.

It's well known that her behavior is violent. If she gets angry she will throw things like furniture and practically anything she can get her hands on. She will also physically attack people, and she goes after her caregiver about twice a week, forcing said caregiver to call the police.

Yesterday, we had a similar situation, but this time I was also attacked by her and for the 19 years I've been living she has NEVER gone after me, and I can confidently say that I had never feared for my life as much as I did today.

The police took her to a nearby hospital since she went after an officer as well, and right now is still in the ER and hasn't been admitted. We've contacted a lot of people and eventually got one of the social workers at the hospital to see if they can get her a bed in an actual mental hospital. Unfortunately, they called last night and said she was rejected soley because it's behavioral problems.

We don't know what to do anymore, but we know for certain that we do not want her to come home. We are afraid that one day she will severely injure one of us to the point where we are hospitalized. It pisses me off that we haven't gotten any help whatsoever and we've been turned down for a lot of things. Hell, a specialized group home for behavioral problems rejected my sister because she was, and I quote, ""too autistic.""

Of course we love her, but we're afraid for her to come home. We don't feel safe. She is too unpredictable to live here and we're at our wits end. We can't just put our lives on hold like we have been doing for these past few years since my mom and I just got new jobs and we just feel like we've sacrificed so much that it's beginning to feel hopeless. If you want an idea how much this has impacted our lives, both my mom and I have not attempted but contemplated suicide several times. Just an hour ago my mom woke me up to admit this and I admitted it to her too.

Right now our only plan of action is to call our county's community of mental health organization and demand options and flat out tell them that we don't want her home.

If there is anyone here in this subreddit who is really well versed in the mental health/disabilities line of work and knows what our options are, I would be so grateful if you could share your insight. What should we do now? What are our options if we refuse to take her home? Is there any kind of way for us to actually get what we want this time or are we in way over our heads?

155,"I won't go into too much detail, but I'll explain a little backstory for context.

After I graduated university, I moved abroad for about 7 years and recently moved back to my home country \(US\) because of my father's sudden death. I've found it pretty easy to deal with since it happened while I was away. The distance has made it easier for me to emotionally detach myself and I'm honestly grateful for that. My father and I were never super close, but we did get along pretty well and shared a lot of the same interests. 

During the 7 years I was away, I never once visited home. I just never felt homesick and Skype was always good enough for me. My father never asked me to come home and was always genuinely happy for me because I was enjoying my life. My father's side of the family has always been nice to me and my mother has always called them the ""good side"" because her's is all kinds of crazy. Growing up, I would see my father's side about once or twice a year during the holidays or summers. Once or twice a year was never enough time to really get to know them, but there was always a general feeling of kinship. For the past 7 years I focused on my life abroad and during that time my family \(excluding my immediate family\) has never called, texted or emailed me to chat or get to know me personally, so I just assumed it was no big deal if I did the same. I've never felt upset by their lack of contact because it felt normal. The only times I would ever actually talk or visit my family was when my father would Skype me or when he would bring me to family gatherings \(when I was younger.\) I figured whenever I saw my family again that everything would be just like my childhood holiday visits. I never realized that my father was the sole reason that I had any contact with them to begin with.

Anyway, on social media I've noticed that I'm basically being ignored. My aunt tagged all my cousins in a ""I love my nieces"" photo except for me. We've never been super close, but I at least used to be tagged in stupid family FB posts.

So after all of this I'm wondering where should I go from here? Has anyone had a similar experience becoming estranged from their family? Nobody has openly said that they have an issue with me, but nobody has reached out to me either. I thought about contacting them myself, but it's overwhelming because I'm just one person and there's like 20 people on my father's side. They're also all very close to each other. My cousins invite each other to events/parties/weddings, but not me. I know I haven't made the effort, but they haven't either.",15May2018,1

157,"Im sorry for the long post.

I'm a 21 y/o college student who's lost all passion, motivation, and excitement for the future. I'll be 22 y/o in September and I feel like less of an adult than I did in highschool. I've completed 6/8 semesters.

I am the oldest of 5 kids. We were all raised very below the poverty line in the deep south by a single mother. I remember vomiting from hunger as a child, having to borrow water from the neighbor's house when we couldn't afford to pay the water bill, never being able to attend or participate in after-school activities or go out in general because we never had a car, and could rarely even afford the $2 for the bus. My father was a drug addict who would argue, fight, and steal bill money from my mom (when he wasn't locked up behind bars). I was a very quiet kid growing up, so I just kind of learned to silently fight through the negativity. I excelled academically and eventually got accepted into the #1 HS in my area. I never really noticed how different my life was until I got accepted into this school. Most of my classmates came from very well off families. A lot of the time I felt embarrassed for being poor. I used to feel angry at my parents for being uneducated and making bad decisions, but then I would feel ashamed for having those kind of negative emotions towards the two people in the world who are probably are the most proud of me.

I continued to focus on school. I always saw college as an escape from living in poverty. I could finally be a kid and just worry about my own needs. I wouldn't have to console my mom as she cried over money and bills. I could come back to a dorm where I had my own bed, instead of an old torn up leather couch. I could have a meal plan where I had unlimited access to a dining hall, instead of taking home the left-overs from the fast-food job I worked for dinner. I think the best part was that in college everyone is poor so it becomes sort of a running inside joke, instead of source of embarrassment.

Soon I became the first person in my family to graduate HS (neither my mom, dad, or grandparents had graduated) and I even got accepted into the #1 college in my state. In addition to a few personal loans and scholarships, my mom pretty much plummeted herself thousands of dollars in debt throughout the 6 semesters I've been here so I could not only afford tuition but also have a few extra thousand dollars to cover my living expenses. I know she pretty much sacrificed her financial future and I am forever grateful. 

When I moved in the first day I couldn't wait to reinvent myself, excel in my major, and meet tons of new people. The first semester went well, but second semester the self-discipline I had in HS started to disintegrate. It felt like the more time I had to focus on my own thoughts and self-improvement, the more I became a procrastinating, confused, and depressed person. I started questioning my life, my major, my authenticity. I got pulled into a friend group where everyone did psychedelics and smoked weed. I started doing these drugs too, specifically hoping a psychedelic experience would help me sort out the confusion I was feeling. Over time the drugs just made me completely reject the previous desire I once had to reach a certain economic status or be viewed as successful and respected by other people. I felt like the professionalism that college teaches is very superficial and phony. People like my parents and blue collar working class people I viewed as authentic because they are less likely to put on a face. 

The really damaging side to this shift in mindset is that I've replaced my previous ambition of escaping poverty with complete nihilism and apathy. I slowly became an agnostic, and I'm headed towards atheism. I stopped budgeting my the money for my living expenses and have racked up almost 2.5k in credit card debt. I've gambled (for a short period), started vaping nicotine, and became a very heavy weed smoker (due to my father being a drug addict I used to be very against drugs of all kinds). I've gradually been doing worse each semester since freshmen year. I do the bare minimum amount of work to pass a class or sometimes will take an F on an assignment if its too much work. Since I performed really well freshman year all my previous professors who thought I had a lot of promise, are all confused at my low quality of work now. I've been having unprotected sex and will sacrifice money, school, and sleep to have sex. I feel depressed. I feel like a fraud because my mom and family believes I'm still the hardworking focused kid I was in HS, when in reality my life is spiraling out of control. I feel like a fraud because I excelled in my major freshman year and I know I have the ability to excel again, but my peers and professors doubt me due to the gradual degradation of my work ethic and work quality. I feel like a piece of shit for wasting my mom's money, that she can't even afford. I feel angry that I cant go more than 3 days without weed or nicotine. I feel like a fucking dumbass for running up spending so much credit.  I feel angry that I can't truly be happy living apathetically and nihilistically. I've invested too much of my mom's money, my money and time into my degree to dropout now, but it truly means very little to me. I could skip graduation, no problem.

Ultimately, I want to transform into a better version of the person I was in HS. I feel like that version of me was a happier more fulfilled person than the current me. I feel like I lived less selfishly and was more hopeful of the future and therefore took actions to insure a better tomorrow, while keeping those who care about me proud. Right now, I do whats feels best in the moment and worry about the consequences the next day. My current moral code revolves around being authentic (whatever that means), apathetic, and individualistic. I live my life for me and no one else and am slowly convincing myself that the world is my reality and I'm slowly becoming more and more detached. This needs to change. I just do not know how to change into a better mindset.

TL:DR: Came from poverty, was motivated by poverty throughout highschool, went to college and started over-thinking, became apathetic, now I want to become motivated again.

159,"When I step back and think critically, the way society is shaping to become more progressive towards women in STEM, gender roles, LGBTQ+ etc is absolutely the direction I want to go. As a straight-male in STEM myself I completely see the economic and creative impact that a diverse team would bring. 

However, I blame some neurological aspect of my brain that whenever I see something new that doesn't 'fit' with my historical experience (i.e black female programmer, or black male Achilles in Troy) some emotional wiring gets triggered hard. I find the sensation is similar to seeing a flying car or a purple cow, i.e your brain telling you something's out of place, but with socio-cultural aspects it hits me even more. 

It's like when I watch The Force Awakens, Netflix's Annihilation, or some other movie with strong, female lead characters with an overwhelming proficiency in STEM and/or heavily inclusive towards women of color, it triggers the heck out of me. I understand the motivation, and movies are the perfect medium, but goddamn I suddenly become a racist/bigoted/sexist lunatic when I feel the agenda is shoved in my face. 

I didn't feel anything in Django Unchained or any slavery movie. Contact, about a female scientist played by Jodie Foster is one the movies that got me into STEM and I absolutely LOVED it. It never once occurred to me that an agenda is at play. Maybe I was hooked on the plot.

160,"I have this co worker who is always taunting me by yelling from across the room to ""hurry up and do x or y"" in a very loud, rude and condescending tone (often immediately repeating it 3 or 4 times like i'm deaf). He never does this to anyone else and has been doing this for a few months. For example, today I was cleaning up at the end of our shift and decided to sharpen my knife (i'm a cook) when he yells ""hey *name* cmon we got things to do, not sharpen knives"" again in that loud disrespectful tone. Keep in mind this guy just joined our team from being a dishwasher. So I ask him what they need help with. He again shout in a loud condescending tone ""I don't know*name* why don't you look around, is this your first time closing?!?!"" He keeps doing this about 3 more times for every little thing I say or do. The final straw was when I went to fill out our cooling logs (something I do everynight), he shouts in front of everyone in that same tone ""Is it time to go home *name*????"" ""Does everything look done to you??? So why are you near the exit??"" The log is located near the exit. I tell him that I was just filling out the log and he just shakes his head at me and thats when I decided to confront him. I asked him what was up with the disrespectful tone and his excuse was that I was acting like I don't know what to do. I explained that even if that was the case it doesn't justify him talking to me in such a disrespectful tone. He then tells me to not raise my voice (ironic considering he's been yelling at me everynight) at him in a threatening manner, in which I responded ""yea and what the hell are you gonna do about it?"" (I know I went a little overboard saying that but I was pissed after all the months of his harassment) He said ""nothing"" turned and walked away. I again explained that I never talk to him disrespectfully but he always does it. From this point he just ignores me and we clock out and go. Again, he has been doing this for the past few months almost every night. I've kept calm because he is usually a cool dude but I guess maybe he got comfortable and is trying to see how much disrespect he can get away with...I don't know.

162,"Right now I am in a pretty big fight with my girlfriend. We've been arguing for quite some time now, and then for about a month in between I fixed what I needed to fix and we didn't fight one time and had absolutely no problems. But I made another mistake and it led to the fight that we're having right now.  

Right now we agreed to give each other time to think about everything and to calm down. We also agreed to meet one month later to talk about our relationship. She said that we can't contact while we're waiting for the whole month, but just a few days ago I texted her first \(I know, my mistake\), but it led to a pretty good conversation. We agreed on a few things, and she thanked me for talking gently and kindly to her, and said our goodnights. The problems in the relationship were basically all because of me, I was obsessive, I got upset over little things, etc, and it stressed her out. At first she said she wanted to break up, but now we are at the point where we agreed that nothing is decided until we meet and talk about everything that happened and what we want to happen next.  

She is in the dance club at school and has been preparing for a long time for the school festival. When we weren't fighting she made it clear that this was extremely important to her and that I needed to be there to support her. Now that we're fighting, though, I'm not sure what I should do. I know a lot of people's first reaction would be to not go because we are obviously not on good terms, but I don't want to regret not going, as I know how important this is to her.  Also, the festival is tomorrow so I have to make the decision quickly.

I've boiled it down to three options. 

1. Go, but don't tell her that I'm going.

2. Ask her if I should go.  

3. Don't go.  

At first I thought option 1 was the best for some reason, but now I'm leaning towards option 2. The reason I'm scared to do option 3 is because when we started this fight, she told me that I ""changed."" I asked her why, and she responded telling me that I didn't tell her that I loved her while we were fighting. This showed me that she needs to be reassured when she's upset, even if she doesn't want to be obsessed over. Which is why I feel like I would regret not going all together. But I could also regret texting her and asking her if I should go, because she did say that we shouldn't contact each other. I don't want to risk doing something stupid and her telling me that we can't meet in a month to talk about our relationship.

Please feel free to ask questions because this is a VERY condensed version of the story. I am very curious what people will think about this, because funnily enough most of my friends and family think I should pick option 1. Now I'm leaning more towards option 2. Thank you.",15May2018,25

That cause he’s shaved and felt his hair before and has EXPERIENCED it, means he is credible to say that shaving facial hair makes it grow out thicker. 
In my response I told him that myths are directly created by deceiving experiences and that he isn’t the only man in the world who shaves their beard. He’s in his late 40s and so he doesn’t udnerstand how helpful the internet can be and how much more credible it can be (with the right sources) than his own “experiences”.

WHAT CAN I SAY TO HIM THAT WILL DISPROVE HIS MYTH OF “EXPERIENCE”??
If you’re confused, ask me :)

172,"To preface, I’m an 18 year old male high school student (now) with the sole ambition of graduating. I personally consider myself anti social in person, therefore I do not party, drink or have any kind of sex life at all. I do not have any desires of having a romantic relationship at all at the moment.

For my story I’ll be referring to my friend using pronouns only due to privacy’s sake

Since September I’ve had a really close friend of the opposite gender (who I did not harbour feelings for) drop me during the 5 month span of me being severely depressed. She was someone who I felt as if I could be good friends with as we are of the same ethnicity (Our ethnicity is uncommon where we live) so we hit it off there. Time passes by and both of us fall into the trend of seniors only having a few “true” friends left and thus our friendship changed to that of a closer relationship. Eventually we get close enough that we end up making a vow to one another. I swore to be there for her whenever she needed me and she at least claimed that she would reciprocate the same for me, but given the title of my post clearly that didn’t happen. 

January comes and that marks the beginning of the second term. I’ve never really been a great student, however I believe I’m the type of person who can easily obtain “B’s” without trying. With every senior high school student comes the struggle of applying to post secondary institutions, this grades are if anything, the utmost importance. Basically what ends up happening is I start to lose patience of dealing with her issues. (At the same time I’m trying to keep my grades poised at a B). I’ve felt obligated to help her with her relationship issues but eventually she I became overwhelmed by both school and her. I couldn’t take it anymore and went to see my school councillor about the issue. I feared that she was getting too intimate with someone who she shouldn’t have and I told the councillor about it. This was the end of our friendship. She wasn’t very happy about this as to her nothing was wrong with her relationship (but clearly if she was talking to me about it something is wrong). The end of our friendship marked the beginning of my depression as I was too attached to her as a friend

For the past 4 months I’ve been confining myself in my room as a sort of self punishment. Given that I did so I was unable to attend school because of my own feeling of guilt towards her as I felt as if I failed my duties as one of her closest friends. I felt as if I could somehow find a way to deal with my depression on my own then I’d be able to face her again and everything would be normal and she’d forgive me. What I didn’t know is that she didn’t actually care for me at all, whereas I had assumed she did to at least a minor degree.

I had recently found out that detail and have come to the conclusion that she isn’t worth my time nor effort, however she was been a huge part of my life (as she was one of my only closest friends) and I somehow keep believing that I still need her, despite the fact that she pretty much abandoned me. I’m not sure how to fully convince myself that she isn’t worth it.

TL;DR: I got dropped by a really close friend when I really needed her for emotional support from her thus leading into a 4 month depression (due to dealing with her) and for some reason despite countless attempts of convincing myself she’s not worth it I can’t fully believe that she isn’t worth it.",15May2018,1
173,"So recently I discovered that my friend and her SO Have been going to Nude beaches together. I was a bit surprised by this as she wouldn't usually enjoy this.  But she says she has taken a liking to it and kinda gets a bit turned on by strangers seeing her Nude. She's been with this guy 4 years and they're engaged and its the first time I'm hearing this. 

She also said one night they'd uploaded some of her nudes to a website together but deleted them straight after, kinda like an online flash. She says she's not bothered by it and i shouldn't be worried by  it as she doubts the photos will spread if they're deleted quickly and only they had viewed them. 

I'm just worried that maybe something else is going on, she never used to be into this sort of thing but now she is. I feel like they're relationship isn't normal

Ive been working here since the start of the year and everything seems normal. I work at a temp agency and just do back office things, like assistant stuff. I have very little to do with clients and job seekers.


My boss is also the owner of the company and there are 6 other guy agents raging from 23 to late 40s. Not often but sometimes I do hear things like ""Dont date a guy from this or this country"" and sometimes i hear things like ""Dont disrespect your parents and date a black guy""


Now I do not care, again I DO NOT CARE about those things and I will love whom I please no matter of those factors... It doesnt intressed me, I just dont know how to react to these things anymore. I was raised by my parents mostly my father to love and accept people for who they are, he takes great care to not isult people and always tries to be upfront and caring with those things (like he will be respect full of relegions belives like fasting or wont each a type of meat or any infront of people before asking) and thats how I was raised to be cautions and respectful.


So these remarks and these almost commands and ""rules"" said by my boss and sometimes cooworkers about people that arent from my country or white bother me...

176,"Hello.

In my school it is traditon to do pranks on the teachers the last day of school when you graduate before summer, so me and a buddy of mine wanted to do so in form of chili. We ordered the hottest chili\-chocolate avaliable online \(Instant Regret\) and wanted to make a delicious cake for them. This chocolate has over 6 million scoville units, so its's damn hot \(Carolina Reaper \(the worlds hottest pepper\) is 2,2 million scoville units\). 

So we were wondering, should we do it? Our favourite teacher said he expected something big for his favourite students, but is this too big? 

And if you think we should, do we make hot chocolate or cake? We thought if we made hot chocolate we could do a toast or something to make them all drink it at the same time, but we don't know.

I go to an all-girls school and thus only have a handful of guy friends. There is only one guy friend I have in mind if I were to take a date but we have only met once because we live about an hour apart. 

I do want to take a date and some of our mutual friends have assured me he wouldn’t say no, but I’m very confused as to whether it would be worth it. 

I want to fit in with the majority who have dates and while some of my friends aren’t take anyone, a lot are. I have always wanted the ‘date’ picture and the whole prom experience ever since I was a little girl. Plus, I do really like him as a friend.

However, I’m worried the cons outweigh the pros. It will be difficult organising transport for him seeing as he lives a while away and he only knows two of my friends so he will barely know anyone at the formal. I’ve been told I may have to ‘babysit’ him all night because of this. Also, there’s the dreaded having to ask him. What if he says no?!?

I’ve always been a bit self conscious and anxious in social situations but as I’ve gotten older and put on weight, I’ve noticed it getting worse. I’m classed as overweight for my height  (size 16 and 5’3’) and I’ve always been very aware of how I look. From about the age of 18, I began to be worried about how people saw me and felt like I was being judged everywhere I go, and that people are staring at me. It hasn’t helped that a lot of my friends moved away to university and the only friend I have now lives 3 hours away so I don’t have any social life. I also live at home with my parents still to save some money as I go to my hometown’s university. 

I was really excited to start the course I’m studying but over the year, I’ve noticed that I’m losing motivation and my attendance is awful. It’s not that I don’t want to be studying, some days I’ll get dressed and ready to go, but I just freeze before leaving the house. Because of my attendance, I haven’t made any friends on the course, and because I’m 3 years older than all of them, I feel almost like the odd one out. 

I still want to continue the course, and I’m hoping that over the summer, I can try and push myself to try and work through whatever is my issue, which I’m thinking is just general anxiety. I’m also trying to lose weight which should help. My only issue is that I feel like with my attendance , I’m scared they may not let me back next year. I did have an attendance meeting with my tutor back in January, and I haven’t had a second one because my attendance improved but I haven’t been at all the last two weeks.

I feel like as I spent more time in high school taking courses I really don't like, my grades have been slowly slipping and my motivation to do homework or study has gone down. It also doesn't help that I took 3 APs this year and 2 of them I don't even know why I took them (Bio and Econ), I just wanted to try them out and see what it was like. I also didn't take any classes that I really enjoy like art because it wouldn't fit into my schedule. My first quarter I was doing really well getting almost all As and a few Bs, but as time went on, I stopped doing work and studying to learn and because I was interested, and more of just doing it because I have to and putting in the minimum amount of work for most of my classes. For example my grade in Calc went from an A- average to a B-/C+ average now, because I stopped doing homework after I got so tired of doing it. This is pretty bad since I'm going into cs and math is kind of important. Thankfully some grades went up like in Bio and Literature, but that's still just from the minimal amount of work I could have done, and it has nothing to do with my field. I'm just really afraid that even though I'm telling myself in college I will try and love doing work again, the reality might be that this will just continue into college as a habit. Not only that, but college costs a crap ton of money, and I was lucky enough to get a scholarship, but that comes with a GPA you have to maintain every year. If I don't, then I don't think I can finish college due to the cost being way too high for me and my mom.

208,"Hello everyone
I live in the USA. I’m 23. I’ve been married for almost 2 years now and I’m very happy with my wife. We have a great relationship and don’t have kids yet.  My problem is my job. I absolutely hate it. I’ve been here for 5 years now. I don’t quit because I have no real skills and this job pays way better than any other job I could get around here with no real skills. I’m pretty much worthless outside this job. I run a crane and load trucks. Any similar job pays a lot less. I know I got lucky getting this job. For some reason this is the best paying company in my area for what I do by a big margin. If I get another job i won’t be able to afford my home payment as I would be making 6 or 7 dollars less an hour. I’ve tried going to college twice now but I can’t stay concentrated on what I’m learning. I thought video games was the reason I couldn’t concentrate as I love playing but I was able to delete my favorite games and not play for 2 months and still couldn’t get the work done. I just get frustrated and lost with school work. I’m a very slow learner so I’m always hesitant to ask for help cause it takes me longer than a regular person to comprehend things. I’m not sure why.  I ended up dropping out two separate times cause of bad grades. Once right after high school and the second time just a few months ago. We recently had a lay off here at work and I was lucky enough to keep my job but the whole time I was excited, hoping I would be one of the ones to be laid off even though it meant losing the house. I just didn’t care. I thought about trying to get some IT certifications when I heard about the possibility of lay off but I just didn’t do it. I just came home, showered and had dinner then went to bed since I’m tired from working long hours. Losing the house wasn’t enough motivation. I didn’t even tell my wife about the lay off until a week before it was happening. I just want to know what I can do right now to help myself move on to a different job. How do I get motivation to try. Anything I think of usually doesn’t work out like college. If I do Get an IT certification most jobs start me off at 12 or 13 an hour and I can’t do that. I thought about trade schools but most require me to go full time and I can’t do that cause of my job and some IT careers they have available part time will start at to low of a wage to keep my house. I know I screwed up by not pushing my self harder to do something before marriage but I just had no self confidence and being married has made me happier than I have ever been in life. Like I said I’m very slow at learning. Anything new I tried to learn at work I would always make a fool of my self and frustrate who was teaching me.

 So basically I hate my job but have no motivation or self confidence to learn something new. Anything I did try didn’t work out either because of low pay or unable to comprehend and failing. What can I do?  Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",15May2018,1

I decided to take it home and plug it in to my computer with the intentions of finding out who it belongs to (again, I know, not smart). 

In one of the folders he has a bunch of pictures of female models. Most of them are adults, but there are about 2 pictures where the girls appear to be under age, perhaps 15-17. They are not nude or sexually suggestive but a bit scantily clad. Based on the watermark it looks like they were taken from some jailbait gallery website or something. Honestly they look like the type of selfies girls would put on their facebook or instagram. 

In another folder he has his resume with his full name and contact info. Should I take this to the police? Would this be a concern to them at all? Not sure if these pictures would be considered CP or what. Or should I just call the guy and offer to return it to him?",15May2018,0

I am M/23 and I have been out of school for a year living at home and working. I make a good salary and have a stable job. I am living at home currently, but more and more I want to move out. My parents are very against the idea and think I need to save move before moving. 

I pay $500 a month on my loans and should be done paying them off in about two years. And the rest of the money I have saved this year I have invested in a few stocks, ETF/Mutual funds with about 2 months pay in free cash for everyday use and taking out my girlfriend. 

How do I convince my parents I am in a good place to move out. I commute by car 30mins to work. Moving out would add about 20mins to that time.

I don't have any major reason to move out other then my parents still treat me like I am in highschool. Giving me a curfew of 2am, and constantly ""checking"" on us when my gf is over.

Am I over thinking everything and should stay at home a while longer. Or is it time to start making plans to move? When I do look for apartments, whats should I really be looking for (ie. utilities included, parking, etc)

It is. Driving me. Insane.

I just spent all of Mother’s Day deep cleaning AGAIN because I cannot find the cause of this smell. Deep cleaning makes it go away temporarily but it’s been two days now and it’s back fully again.


There are vents for central heat/AC. I am pretty worried something has died in my crawl space. Has anyone ever had this issue? 

I am looking for advice on what to do. This has never happened before and I’m starting to lose my mind a little. It is a very very small house and there shouldn’t be a mysterious smell I can’t pinpoint and destroy.

I am in a bit of a fuss, where I dont really like my current university which is Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Which is actually a pretty reputable university in HK, currently ranked 18th in computer science around the word and 3rd in Hong Kong. I am in my second semester of year 2 and really dislike the overall environment of the  university. I feel as if theres too much pressure to get high grades over here and no one is really here to learn but just to get high grades and everything seemed to be so manipulated by the mainlander/local students who all just study all day and cause the curve to sky\-rocket.

 I feel like lecturers just assume you know everything and just rush to the next chapters. 

So I'm kinda in a fuss, where I dont know if its worth leaving a reputable uni like HKUST for another uni in Astralia which has connections to my previous college. I asked my old lecturer whom I'm pretty close with and she suggested that my options include Uni's in Uk or University of Wollongong\(UoW\) in Australia. 

What I'm worred about is that do where you get your degree from really matter after graduating? As UoW is not as highly ranked as HKUST, where HKUST will be considered a pretty highly ranked university. I dont want to be jobless just because of this choice and would probably rather just suffer through the rest of the years if thats the result.

I will be starting year 2 most likely so at most I lose 1 year worth of progress and will graduate a year later than usual. I will be persuing the same degree over at UK or UoW, no matter the choice. 

So could you guys please give me advice on wether I should drop out and persue this decision or should I refrain from doing so?

Fast fowars a week later, she asked me to hang out with our son 2 days in a row, the same night she confessed she missed me and how much our son looked happy with the 3 of us, the very next day she asked me to hang out alone and so we did.

The same night she asked me to sleep over, in the same bed, the night after, same scenario. Went home for about 2 days before she asked me to go hang out at her place all day, went back home, woke up to a text ""wanna come over again today?"" 

And now I'm here. Smoking a cigarette outside of her house confused to what the fuck this all means. I'm afraid I'm being played or messed with. She says she doesn't want to date anyone including me.

I'm one of five kids and the girlfriend in question is my eldest brothers. In the year long relationship theyve had shes proven to be a liar, controlling, and abusive. One of my brothers and I have made it clear that we dislike this girl because she is the definition of a snake. My other two siblings tolerate her to an extent because they dont want to get involved.
Well this chick has been leaving ""hints"" that she wants to move into the family home (we all still live their until we finish school or have stable jobs). She lives two hours away and will talk about going to school around us or finding a job around us. She works minimum wage and wouldn't be able to pay for her car payments and an apartment. My brother is barely working and is going to school full time so he couldn't pay for anything. 
Her parents wouldn't support her because she doesn't contact her father and her mother is relying on a boyfriend for herself. (Nothing wrong with that if they're happy, but he has his own kids to support) so she keeps trying to mention how great it would be to live near here and nearly asked my mother if she could. 
My mother told her that my brothers focused on school and it's his top priority and basically shut her down, but I'm afraid that wont last because he is the golden child and this girl has gotten away with everything shes done to our family so far. (Disrespectful at an aunt's wake, entitled to our families cars, called my mother and father liers.)

249,"So I currently live in a country that's in shambles, to say the least. People in my age range (mid-20s) are all leaving the country in a mass exodus to find a better life abroad.

Right now I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I have two choices to emigrate to: Canada, where I have lived previously and have an open work visa that may lead to permanent residency. And, Argentina, where I have never been, and don't have any jobs lined up yet, but where I have a much larger support base (friends/family). More relevant though, a girl who I very recently began seeing just moved there.

I'm 26, unmarried, and don't have a college degree, but I have a lot of valuable work experience. This experience is what has lead me to find this job and work visa offer from Canada. The job pays well, however, it is not a job that I enjoy doing or that makes me happy. I am considering this job mostly because it comes with a work visa and a pathway to permanent residency, not because of the pay. I can count on one hand how many friends I have in Canada, as for family, I have none there.

Argentina has always been my plan B (plan A being the US or Canada). I have lived in three countries so far, consider myself an adventurer and I love trying new things and adapting to new environments. In Argentina, I would pursue work in the field of fitness, exercise, healthy nutrition and the such. I love this lifestyle, it is my passion and it makes me happy, even though it might not pay as well as my Canadian prospect. But I think the real reason I want to go Argentina is because the girl I began seeing 3 months ago just moved there, and I really think we are falling for each other. I am a romantic, I don't know if this relationship would lead to something more serious, long-term, or marriage in the future, but I'm damn sure I would like to find out.

So what do I do? 

Canada is the safer, more stable, higher paying/higher quality of life option, with a job and paid flight lined up. But in Argentina I have love. Not just this budding love for this girl, but love for my passion and lifestyle (which is VERY challenging to stick to with the work I'm being offered in Canada). Argentina would be a romantic adventure in my life that I might not have the opportunity to pursue again, but if I turn down Canada I may be missing out on one of the most important job offers of my life.

It is also worth noting that I have yet to have my Canadian work visa approved, it's been processing since February and I'm assuming it will be approved soon. For Argentina I don't need a work visa or anything. But if I'm honest with myself, deep down I hope my visa does not get approved so that I'm left with only one option...

253,"Hi Reddit, I’m writing this to ask for advice in regards to my career. I’m in a cross road and feeling lost about how should I advance. 

Currently I’m in a job that pays me decently. Initially I started this job feeling very enthusiastic and hoping to learn new things. However after months into the job I’m feeling very mentally drained out due to politics as well as unhappiness about the way my team leader manages the team. I did spoke to him a few times about how I felt, and all he did was brushed me off by saying he understood what I meant and will try to arrange things so that our team can function positively (our team seems to have no teamwork and everyone just functioning on their own, and it always screw up big time when our manager calls for meeting when we can’t get in sync with the stuffs we did) 

Another reason why I’m feeling mentally drained is that I tried my best in learning things that aren’t related to what I’ve studied/specialised in. When I interview for this job, the manager did told me that I’ll be handling an area that’s in total relation to my field of study. However on the first day of work, he did a sudden switch and place me in another area which I’m totally unfamiliar with and have no knowledge about, hence it was a pretty rough start for me as I have to learn things from scratch.. 

Now I’m being offered by another company, however it’s 25% pay cut as compared to my current company, but this company is purely dealing with my field of study. Should I make a dive to switch or should I continue to learn as much as I can in this current company, feeling unhappy and unmotivated to go to work everyday? ",15May2018,1

255,"So, I am 21/F. Trying to date, I struggle with almost every guy not texting me. They always do at first but it fades off, or they only make small talk. I think ignoring people is incredibly rude. 

I think texting someone you're interested in every 1-3 days is normal. Not even huge conversations, just 'Hey, how are yous?'

If someone ignores my text, I don't double text.  if they aren't pushing conversation, I stop initiating. I usually cut contact with people because I can't stand being ignored or constant small talk.  It really bothers me when people do this, especially potential romantic partners.

Am I overrating?  Should I not stop contacting people over this? I have the mindset of 'if someone likes you, they will talk to you.'

260,"I’m a 17 year old high school student. Today is what should have been my senior years graduation, however I’ve lost who I was and stopped caring about school.

Some background: I used to be a pretty decent student. I had a GPA of 3.45 and finished my junior year with 3.7. I thought I should really apply myself my senior year so all the classes I took had a weighted grade. I estimated that by the end of my senior year my cumulative GPA would 3.7.

What changed this? Basically, my junior year, my mother passed away. I became depressed and stopped going to school for an entire quarter. They put me in credit recovery for my core classes but my elective classes couldn’t be recovered. When I returned, I used my mother’s passing as an excuse to work harder. I finished the rest of that semester with nearly a 4.0. When school started for my senior year, I thought I was just going to glide through all my classes. All my classes were advanced classes and I even took my first college class. First quarter went pretty well, not as well as I expected but as good as school was going before my mother’s passing. Right at the end of this quarter, I met my first and current girlfriend. She’s been a major part of my life and I know it’s not what she signed up for but she makes me forget about what happened to my mom. Moving on from her, since roughly the time that I met her (about a month after), my grades went downhill. All the way to the point of failing. I stopped showing up for my first 3 classes, and I’d leave before the day was over. I would only show up for 3 of my 7 classes. I’m now 1.5 credits behind where I had to be to graduate. I can only recover 2 in summer school and will likely have to continue going to school for an entire semester next school year just to get half a credit. 

I’ve already been accepted to all of the colleges I wanted to go to. Will they accept me again after I finish next year? Is there any other solution to what’s going on than just leaving it up to hope? I hate who I’ve become and I want it to change. ",15May2018,1

Same thing happens when I come back to the apartment, my cat is waiting at the door and will shoot out as soon as I open the door.

265,"So I'll start from the beginning. I recently moved to Canada and got a job in a kitchen. I went out with a bunch of people from work to a bar and ended up hooking up with one of the servers. She and I hooked up for a couple of weeks afterwards and it felt like things were moving way too fast. She kept speaking as if we were a long term thing but I don't trust relationships and I don't think I ever will. Even so, I started having feelings for her but continued to not act on them to an extent, I treated the relationship more like a booty call than anything else.

Anyways, she ended up hooking up with a different guy from work and I'm ngl, it hurt a bit. But we talked to over and both decided that it'd be better if we stayed friends. She wanted to be fwb, but I insisted that I didn't think hooking up would be a good idea.

Fast forward a couple months and we're pretty good friends, even if there is a little bit of sexual tension left over. But she's been hooking up with a dude who has no interest in her and treats her like trash. He only fucks her when he wants something and she keeps going back. They're not really a ""thing"" since he doesn't really fuck her too often, he always insists they are not a thing at all, and she keeps going back to him and trying to hookup. 

She's talked to me about him a few times and I've been there a couple of the times he's said some pretty nasty stuff. She looks to me as if she wants me to help her out and she often texts me after particularly bad events and wants me to ""come over and talk"". 

I think of her as a friend only though and don't really have an interest in hooking up again. I'm just in a weird position where I don't feel like I can do anything to help. I know that she's done things like cut herself when she was younger and she's struggled with depression and I don't want her to go through that again.",15May2018,1
266,"Let me preface by saying that I recognize I have a very hard time saying ""no"", and I have a lot of anxiety about disappointing others even at the cost of my own comfort. These qualities are what I'd say has gotten me here, in an increasingly sticky situation that I no longer want any part of. Any help is appreciated.

**TLDR: Acquaintance (A) asks me for help delivering a gift to someone (B), which involves going to A's apartment to pick it up. After saying I'd help, he lays on more and more favours for me to do for him, including grabbing a box of his stuff to save from his landlord. Gift is strongly rejected by B, who tells me some concerning stuff about A including blackmail and harassment. Now I'm stuck with a box of his stuff and I want out of this situation.**

A couple weeks ago, I got messaged by a guy (let's call him A) asking for some help. I don't know him that well; he's certainly not a friend, but we've been in the same classes a couple of times over the years, worked on a few homework sets together, and he's asked me about my research a couple times so he's not a stranger. I've always kind of gotten some weird vibes from him though.

He asked me for help with ""something"" related to my field. After inquiring and thinking it was just more research-related questions, he revealed that he needed help delivering a gift to someone in my department (let's call him B), who I share an office with (among others). I don't know B that well either, but I've always known him to be a nice guy. He also showed me an accompanying letter that gave some context about the gift. The letter should have been my first warning sign. It was... strange. It was quite long and rambling, and seemed like an apology letter yet it was light on the apologies, and it mentioned he had fallen on hard times recently. He had sent this letter in an email to B and his girlfriend. For some reason also CC'ed several members of the department including B's supervisor.

I asked him for more info, like what getting the gift would involve. He said I'd have to pick it up at his apartment (I've never been to his apartment). I asked why he couldn't deliver the gift himself, to which he replied that he had been forced to flee the city after having been, well, sexually assaulted by someone at our school, and was not sure when he'd be back, and that this gift was part of a healing process and needed to be done soon. I asked if he had a roommate that could give the gift to me to save me a trip to his place, but apparently his roommate left the apartment for reasons related to why he fleed the city. 

That all should have been another warning sign that I should not get involved, because clearly there's a lot of shit going on here, but I felt sorry for him and the gift was clearly important to him. So I said I'd help. It would only take a half hour out of my day after all. He said he'd send me the keys to his apartment over mail. Right before I got them he added that he'd like me to pick up a ""couple"" things for him like his mail. Sure, I'll be there anyways so why not. After I let him know when I got his keys a few days ago, those ""couple"" things became a huge list of items like t-shirts, ties, sentimental items, a suit, books, notes, art on the wall... well jeez. He said he was worried about his landlord, who has apparently threatened to get rid of his stuff in the past. He also wanted me to take pictures of his room and inside all his drawers. I just said I'd do my best. 

Yesterday was when I went by the apartment. I put a box together of as much of his list as I could carry, and went to deliver the gift at school to B. Well, this was finally the moment where I said to myself ""what have I gotten myself into"" because B vehemently refused the gift and said he didn't want anything to do with A. He apologized for making this awkward for me and recognized that I really didn't know any of the story. He described A as a strange guy, they used to be kind-of friends, had a falling out about a year ago, and since then A has since done things like blackmail him, harrass him and his girlfriend, lie about some incidents, and said extremely derogatory comments about his research to not only to him but also his supervisor (things like that the work he had done was totally and seriously wrong, despite not being in the same field). He had also done something like this before where he had tried to give an unwanted ""gift"" to one of the profs that B described as harrassment, CC'ed a bunch of people about it, and asked lots of people in the department to help him deliver it. And, he'd asked at least one student before or alongside me for help with this particular gift (that other person had the foresight to ask B about it before saying he'd help, and immediately said he it sounded super sketchy... clearly, I did not have that foresight). 

That brings me to the current dilemna. I have the box of his stuff in my office, and his keys, and based off what B and the other student told me I really don't want to be involved with this guy anymore. B and others advised I turn the stuff over to the department head, who is already aware of the situation and is familiar with A. I talked to the department head about it and he was very understanding. He assured me they would find some space to store the stuff, and he would take care of A's keys (I'm not sure if that means mailing them back to A, or giving them to the landlord if A is not paying rent).

I haven't given the stuff to the department yet, and A is now asking me for updates (I haven't talked with him since letting him know I picked up his stuff). I'm not sure what to say. On the one hand, I've helped him this far and maybe I should be responsible for his things, and if his keys make it to the landlord it would probably be bad for him. But on the other, I feel like I've really done more than I should have, I don't like how he kept adding on things for me to do after I said I'd help him, and perhaps I should get out of this situation ASAP and let the department handle it. If I do the latter, I don't know how to break it to him.",15May2018,1

269,"I work with an older guy, who's pretty awesome when it comes to work, but is also stuck in the 50's. He hates every minority, thinks pittbulls are *automatically* mean dogs, doesn't believe in climate change. I'm almost amazed he's managed to stay this far behind the times.

Now some of this stuff I honestly don't care about. Ok grumpy old guy, hate smart phones, I'm still going to use mine. He hates all minorities....but doesn't treat them any differently. Politically, he'll never change my mind so why try to change his. 

I'm just curious if any one has had experience getting someone like this a little more up to date. We had a conversation about climate change today, and he honestly thinks it's false because we had a cold winter. ""The liberals want you to think it's getting bad so they can increase regulations!"" So I played along, said yeah let's say it's total bs...what do the ""evil liberals"" have to gain by regulating pollution? He didn't respond, and seemed to have a moment he was thinking about it...before changing the subject. 

I'm pretty sure it's a lost cause, but was curious if anyone here had successfully showed someone like him the other side. You would think basic logic would make him see, but he's totally blind to anything that counters his opinions. Also, he's convinced I'm also blind and that the liberals have tainted my mind. So, its a long shot, but he's very intelligent in other areas so I believe it's possible. 

It sucks, I have a lot of respect for the guy, then he'll say one stupid thing and I just have to walk away. I've let more things go in a day then I've responded back in the 4 years we've worked together. How do I show him facts without attacking opinions? How do I explain to him some of his ""facts"" are opinions and what he considers to be another's opinion is actually a fact? 

Please don't fill the comments with ""It's not your job/problem/buisness."" I know, and I'll probably never get through to him even if I try, but I was curious if there was even the smallest chance. ",15May2018,1

I just got a haircut and when my dad picked me up from the hair cuttery he commented on it again.

I have a small mouth, so when it's closed I look like I'm scowling, and my eyes always kind of have this half\-lid set to them. Also, due to my facial structure, there are natural creases/lines under my eyes from how my skin rests over my cheekbones. I also have very thick lashes. Sometimes people ask me if I'm wearing eyeliner or eye shadow, but I don't wear makeup; my eyes just look like that. 

Recently I've begun to notice that there's a big difference between who I know myself to be and who people perceive me to be and this is mainly due to my physical appearance and mannerisms. I am a very laid\-back and generally cheerful person but I tend to come off as mousy, meek, or even just plain depressing. This is because I'm short, I don't exert a very demanding presence, and I spend a lot of time listening and observing rather than speaking, but not because I'm shy. 

What are some ways I can fix this? I don't want to be seen as this mousy, tired person. I want people to see that I am confident and cheerful. I want to be able to be approachable so that I might share this cheerfulness with others...but I can't do that when I apparently look as if I've seen all the world's sorrows and then some.

I'm 22, I have 3 classes left for my AAS in Auto Tech, and I work for a large, local dealership for and have about a year now. The problem is, I work in the Quicklube area of the dealership, and as such, don't really see much use of the degree I've been working my butt off to obtain. I know how to wrench on cars, I do, and have done, everything from engine/transmission swaps, replacements, and rebuilds, to brakes, to electrical diagnosis, you name it. I have tools, I have knowledge, I have firsthand experience, but I have no ""legitimate"" professional experience, and no shop in my area is willing to give me a chance actually wrenching on cars. I've been turned down a couple times for the fabled ""3 years experience"", but nobody is willing to take a chance.

How should I proceed from here? My dealership has made it pretty clear to me that I'm on the rotten bottom of the totem pole and probably will not go on to be a line tech. I just feel stuck, and I'd rather not ride out the rest of my degree in the Quicklube.

Now, I have about $30 left for the next 9 days. I need to buy cat food, so that is at least $6 or so accounted for. I have 2 frozen meals, 4 hot dogs and some milk at home. I need to make it last, so in between eating, are there any tricks to stop my stomach from hurting? Water and coffee works, but it's very temporary and being at work is getting hard.

Thanks!",15May2018,1

If I give my 2 weeks notice now, I forfeit my bi-annual bonus which is around $5500. They told me in the verbal offer that initially they weren’t going to hit my current salary target but after interview and references, they want me there and offered $5k over.

288,"Im worried. My mother has been financially,mentally, emotionally, and at times physically abusive of my grandmother, and emotionally, mentally, sexually, and at times physically abusive towards me. We ran out of money because of my mother's compulsive spending and refusal to work and now we are homeless, sleeping in the car. Yesterday the car broke down and my mom became angered because she thought my grandmother could had made it break down out of spite. Last night, my mom became particularly enraged and started threatening my grandmother in the middle of the night. She then kept telling her she was mentally ill, a wretch, a horrible person, a vermin and abusive laced with profanities. She was physically threatening. 

This morning, she forced my grandmother out, in the cold,and took her phone away so she could sell it. i almost called the cops but didn't want to make a scene.  I tried to get my grandmother back in the car when my mom went to use the bathroom, but she was too scared to come back. When my mom went to get breakfast from the grocer, she was still near the area and I got out of the car, ran to her, and told her to get in with me so i could lock the car and drive off. She said it was too dangerous with my mom and that shed try to persuade the hostel to give her a place to sleep for the night. 

I am worried about being with my mother since she is mentally unstable, narcissistic, and easily inflamed. She has stated she needs me under complete control and has been becoming more and more loopy. My grandmother is near eighty years old and has no where to stay. I've slept outside before and it wasn't fun, especially hell for someone as frail and elderly as her. She needs to be watched for. She has nothing to eat.  I have an open CPS case and don't want them involved. I know if they find out we're homeless they'll take me away, especially with the current situation. I sent an email to her since she has her IPAD, but I'm not sure when she can get back with WiFi. I feel the right thing to do would be to leave my mother, but my mother won't even let me shower on my own ans insists on  watching me. The next opportunity would be when she gets breakfast at the store tomorrow. 

If I leave, I'd try to get me and my grandmother into a shelter, apply for food stamps \(under 18s can I believe\) and start working. I don't trust my mother. She's the last person I want to be stuck with. Advice wanted. ",15May2018,15

295,"Recently I \(22F\) cut off all contact with an emotionally abusive friend. The final straw was when she tried to pressure me to break up with my long\-term boyfriend \(She is bisexual and hinted that there was 'someone' out there who could treat me better\), trying to convince me that he raped me and I'm so delusional I blocked it out somehow. Two weeks ago she realized her calls were going straight to voicemail and has been aggressively trying to contact me since. 

* First she called me about a dozen times and sent messages asking if I'm aware she wants to reach me. I blocked her number. 
* Then she sent messages through my boyfriend and a mutual friend on Facebook. I asked them not to get involved, but she continued sending all of us messages. 
* She said that she refuses to be ignored and threatened to come to my house, then took it back and asked to meet in an open place.
* Two days ago I got IMs from her saying she talked about me with our mutual friend and told her I was a liar, and threatening to tell my boyfriend all my ""secrets."" I blocked her from Facebook, but
* Yesterday I found out she messaged my boyfriend saying ""your girlfriend was raped on prom night and almost got raped again by some other guy. She's a liar who likes to ghost people for power and she told me she enjoys seeing you suffer.""
   * Note: While I have been sexually assaulted before and my boyfriend is already aware of this, that girl didn't know any of the details and just made some up to hurt him more. Regardless, it's bringing back bad memories for both of us.

Now I've been having nightmares about my sexual assault, and my boyfriend hasn't been able to focus on his final exams. I tried to contact the mutual friend and ask her to stop relaying information about me to this girl, but she was very hostile and said she wouldn't stop my former friend ""from talking about the person who broke her heart.""I feel so alone in this and I think this qualifies as stalking, but my dad says that I shouldn't call the police because that's giving her attention. He said she looks too innocent and blonde for the police to believe me anyway and I should just ignore her until she gets frustrated and leaves.

311,"I’ve just come to the realization that I might be dealing with a problem. recently (the past year or so), I’ve been having reoccuring thoughts of commiting murder or other violent acts (fantasies, not plans). since I started getting them frequently it’s gotten worse, and the last couple of weeks (months?) the fantasies have gotten more detailed and harder to ignore. 

for a long while I thought it all started back then about a year ago when I got into true crime, and I thought that I was just being in this edgy phase or whatever, but what I am experiencing is not something I choose, believe me, and it is very real, hence the secrecy. once these visions did not disappear I figured all the crime and gore that I was exposed to on the internet worked as some form of a trigger, and that these fantasies were a way for me to express my repressed anger, but the thought crossed me today, that they did not at all arrive as late as a year ago. 

I now remember moments in my life when I’ve had violent thoughts. for example during a period in my life (many years ago) when I was working at the local stable, there were these hay bales that had to be cut up, and I remember always wanting to be to one to do it. when I got the chance to, and I was alone, I’d stab them multiple times imagining they were people before slowly cutting them up and visualising intestines coming out of them instead of hay. I had completely repressed these memories up until today. similar fantasies would cross my mind just holding that stable knife, and the hooks up on the hay loft also gave me ideas, and this was years ago, long before I knew about true crime. 

so, now that I’ve got my issue laid out, what the hell can I do about it? as much as I enjoy these fantasies, I want them gone. judging by the way they are becoming worse and worse, I fear that one day they will be more than fantasies (even though I trust my self control enough to not really believe that). anyone got any ideas? is there something wrong with me? perhaps this is all normal for a soon 18 year old, perhaps I’m just making a problem of something completely usual, I have no idea. I’d be thankful for any kind of advice on what to do about this. ",15May2018,1

At the same time, I also had a male friend from one of my volunteers who was very kind, gentle, and interesting but also very awkward. At the time, I thought that it would be a good idea to set them up on a blind date. This was about 2 years ago.

A few days ago, my female friend confessed to me that my male friend had forced himself onto her several times during their dates. She did not say anything at the time because he seemed like a really great guy in front of everyone so she thought nobody would believe her. She is also suffering from depression so I guess she didn't want to add more on to her plate.

Although now she seemed to have moved on. I feel extremely guilty for what had happened. Although I know I couldn't have controlled my male friend's action, I still feel that I was some kind of accomplice for what had happened. 

I feel that I should talk to my male friend about it, though I have not spoken to him in a long time. But I don't want other girls to experience the same thing that my female friend did.

317,"Without a doubt I have came to the conclusion that I need help with many things in my life. For now I will explain my situation an the questions I have.  So I own a team called Essential and it is newish in the sense that we are only about a month into the esports scene.  An that we have not be able to develop into anything more than what we are at the moment.  The reasons from what I have seen is that our players are not able to be excited for working for us and that they become inactive over time, we do not have any staff that are experienced in managing a esports team including myself, and finally is that getting people to want to upload videos or make a group video is difficult when everyone isn't on the same page.  So my first question is How do I get funds or exposure to invest in tournaments for our team? Second question is what should our basic roles be so far we have Owner, Manager, then game manager such rl manager, fortnite manager, etc. Third question is how do I get people to understand that the gaming scene is not going to come to us and that we will all have to work and be devoted to the team if we want in to grow.  Trust when I say I ask my player if they have anything to improve our team, but they have no new ideas that the managers an I have not tried.  So if possible answer my questions with as much detail as possible. 

NOTE: If you think you can help us out as a manager or a gamer.     We at the moment play playstation 4 fortnite, rocket league, overwatch, and more. Also we are now moving to pc also such as csgo league of legends and more in the future.  One more thing to add is that we want to get ready for Black Ops 4 so if your really good at cod and play on playstation for sure join. ONLY requirement is that you must have discord.

I am almost 21 years old, have some experience in the work industry so this gave me a possibility to ask for a credit or loan to buy my first car. My new car is a Ford Focus 2005 Mk2 1.6 Gas 76kW having 100 HP. I am very happy with the car since is been well take care off by the previous owner and has almost 153.000 km on board. I am very happy with the car but i think *as the title said* i need improvements regarding performance. A small story first. My dad bought recently a Ford Focus Mk2 1.6 Diesel car which has been modified at the ECU and reached almost 126 HP. On the highway he is driving at 150 km/h with almost 3500-3600 revs per minute and i have at the same speed almost 4700-4900 which i think is insane but again diesel vs petrol. I don't want to increase my performance to run at high speeds or to drag race a random BMW but i want to be able to drive at 140 with 3000 revs per minute or something decent. As an example, i drove to the mountain which is almost 170-180 km away from me and my car kinda consumed half a reservoir when driving at 130-140 km/h. I've searched on the internet for improvements but i know what to pick and what to invest. I want to save money to make a change under the hood since i am planing to keep the car for a long time. Also, I've read online and it said when upgrading your ECU you gain almost 7 to 8 HP and i think that will not be enough for me. Any thoughts what i can make to improve my car performance to drive at 140 hm/h without re-fueling every 2 hours? Excuse my english btw :)",15May2018,1

My brother has been married to his wife for 12 years and they have a 13 yo daughter. They split just before Christmas and he was still living with them until mid Jan. I found out it was meant to be a trial separation but in the beginning of Jan my brother started seeing his current gf.

My problem with this relationship is:
1. He started seeing his new gf (met on tinder) while he was still living with his wife and daughter
2. He hadn’t asked, or mentioned, to his wife he wanted to start seeing other people
3. He hid it for a month before she found out (and was using his wife’s money to pay for their dates)

I’m torn. Yes, he’s my brother. But morally I find this abhorrent. My parents are upset because of my stance and seem to think his wife has ‘poisoned’ me. 

Advice please?",15May2018,0
333,"I've been having issues with my mother lately. It's been like this ever since I had to leave college early due to illness. She barely ever talks to me because she thinks I'm too negative and gloomy. Granted, I'm not the most positive person in the world. But when you if you were like me and you had to deal with being diagnosed with cancer at 18 and having to tack on two extra years of undergrad because of pneumonia, you'd be pissed off too. We also had an argument while we were out driving. I'm currently 22 and don't have my driver's license but have been taking private lessons. I wasn't doing too well, not looking both ways at a stop sign and she got angry. During the argument, I told her I wanted to get my license to make her happy. She tells me she doesn't care if I get my license and she only told me to get it when I was 16 because ""that's what normal people do"". As if I haven't been dealing with being sick and going to college full time. Yes, I should have gotten it earlier, but who the fuck says that kind of shit to their kid? 

I remember the day of my fifth grade graduation. My mom didn't show up. When I came home, she said she didn't show up because she was embarrassed of me because I got in trouble a lot during the fifth grade. Ever since then, all I've tried to do was make her proud of me. Whatever people thought of me didn't matter as long as I was doing good in her eyes. But as she's becoming more and more distant to me, it makes me feel like I don't matter to her anymore. Like I'm simply a burden she's better off without. How should I try to make amends?",15May2018,1
334,"In one of my exams this year the test paper had the wrong theorem to use for a question, i spent the first 45 minutes trying to calculate this section using this theorem (worth a third of the marks on the exam) and then suddenly the invigilators come round and tell me its wrong and to use this new one instead. Bare in mind this is a 2 and a half hour exam so 45 minutes is a lot of time to then have to do it all again, didn't finish the paper because of it.

339,"I've been going through a lot of issues. I have depression and anxiety. I've been going to doctors ever since I was a kid. I take pills each morning and night and go to therapy. I've been seeing my therapist at least once a week. I've been seeing the same therapist for years.

I finally graduated. My mom was so proud of me.

I don't know what happened. I was having a really bad day. I even threw up and was feeling so sick. But once the graduation ceremony ended my family was waiting outside for me.

My mother came up to me trying to go about giving me a big hug and a kiss. I guess the kiss grossed me out or something, and so I sort of pushed her away...and I even grabbed her face I think...yeah I squeezed her face with my one hand...I was very aggressive and ugly pushing her away.

And then we started taking pictures, and my uncle says go give your mom a hug. And I look over and to my horror she was crying.

I've never felt so ashamed and horrible in my life. It's been three days since it happened, but I can't shake away these feelings of shame and guilt.

My mother was crying and said ""You don't know how hurtful you can be.""

I then apologized and then we all got together and went to a cabin. Then we went out for dinner. I then hugged and held my mother and apologized. I even sent her a text message. She said she understood my mood swings and should have known better or something. We had a good dinner, took lots of pictures smiling.

Everything is back to normal.

However, I keep feeling so horrible. I'm crying right now as I type this. I hurt my mother so much. What the fuck is wrong with me? I can't believe I hurt my mother like this. Even though I apologized and she forgave me, I can't stop feeling awful.

I feel so much regret. I wish I could just go back in time and just...act like a decent human being and hug my mother back when she tried to hug me and kiss me. Why couldn't I just hug her and feel happy? I was not feeling happy, I felt very bad.

I feel so ashamed. This was probably the worst day of my life. To see my mother cry at my graduation, was the worst thing I've ever experienced and I feel so guilty, ashamed, and horrible.

Why did I push her away? Why couldn't I just act normal for once? What the fuck is wrong with me? I feel so guilty for hurting my mother like that. Yeah, I apologized and she is fine now....but I keep having flashbacks of my mother weeping. It was extremely disturbing to see my mother crying at my graduation. I feel like the worst son on the planet.

To her this was a big special day. And I ruined it with my shitty behavior. I don't know why I'm such a god awful son to her. I tell her I love her. She said she understands my mood swings and thus forgives me.

I made my mother cry? But I'm not in control of her emotions. She made herself cry? She has cried numerous times in dealing with me. She is very emotional.

I just feel so bad, even though it's over and everything is fine now. I just can't stop seeing my mother crying. And it really, really hurts.

340,"Ok this is gonna be a rant so just bear with me.

I'm a senior in high school. I graduate in a month and go to college in 3.

So this girl I really like has actually started talking to me recently. We've gone out to lunch a few times and recently she agreed to go to prom with me. To the best of my knowledge she only thinks of me as a friend. It would make me the happiest guy alive if she agreed to be a thing but we're both going out of state so it would never work out. What's really been bothering me though is that there I think I overheard that some guy out of state who used to go to my school is gonna ask her out instead. Usually this wouldn't bother me but her friend told her and she got really excited. I only overheard this and i have no details and im not even sure if this is the case. I might have been reading the situation wrong.

So what I'm really asking is what do I even do in this situation? Asking her out would probably be a no, and even if she said yes itd only last for 3 months. Asking about the guy thing would seem nosy and creepy. I know the obvious answer is ""move on"" or ""let go"" but shes inside my head and I can't get her out and its driving me crazy.

341,"Hi there,

I’ll try to make this as short as possible. I have recently been made an offer to study a healthcare degree at my first choice university which I have been extremely exited about.


However, I made a stupid decision one night which resulted in me receiving a caution for possession of a class A drug, which I immediately declared to the university, as I didn’t want it to effect anything. 

Unfortunately I received the bad news today that my university start date will not be this year (I’ve told everyone that I know that I am starting this year), but September next year. This is because the university decided it would be best to defer my course. Which is completely understandable given the circumstances.

I am unsure what I am going to say to my parents who have been so proud of my new venture. I can’t bring myself to tell them the truth. Is there anything that I can tell them which could be a good reason for me to purposely take a year out? Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated as I am desperate at this time. If you need any extra info feel free to ask.

343,"Background:

• This is my 4th season coaching with the local rec league and this is the first time I feel out of control of the team. I'm coaching U11 (6v6) girls and I've been with this group since they were in U9.
• I have twin daughters on the team, C and E. This is E's 4th season playing, C's 1st. 
• There were a few too many girls who signed up this season, so we had to split into two teams. We each have 8 on the roster and talent was split fairly evenly. 
• My assistant coach is the president of the Club. His daughter M has played for 7 years, but it is impossible to get any kind of effort out of her. This is the 3rd season I've coached her. She's had these behavior issues before, but with a larger team we were able to compensate for it a bit better.
• We lost all 6 of our regular season games and we have 4 tournament games a few weekends from now. Last season we were 6-3.

So here's my problem:
When I say it's hard to get effort out of M, I mean it. She won't run more than 20 feet at a time. When she's done running, she walks slowly. Won't even attempt to jog. Her footwork is great, but she won't go to the ball and complains if you tell her to. She'll stand still and hope someone passes it to her. She's a bigger girl, so I see how running would be difficult for her, but her attitude is the biggest problem.

Whenever her teammates encourage her to run, she gets embarrassed and will fall to the ground with an ""injury"" and sit on the sideline (until we do something more fun) and will proceed to talk crap about other girls on the team. 

As I said, this is my daughter C's first season. Her footwork isn't great yet, but she tries really hard and is one of the toughest ones out there (her face literally bounced off of the field yesterday during practice and she got up, straightened her glasses, and got back to it). When M feels insecure, she'll tell C that she's not very good and that she's the reason we lose. Or, she'll talk about C behind her back and encourage other girls to talk badly about her too. E tries to stand up for her sister, but then M will start in on her. Eventually, my girls start being mean too, and before I know it, everyone is in tears and practice is derailed.

During games, M will call for the ball, but then cry and basically stop playing if she doesn't get it, even if she's not in a good position to pass to. She'll beg to be taken out and then cry that she wants to go back in, but only at certain positions. She'll say things like ""It doesn't matter, we're going to lose anyway"" on the field and during halftime.

We've had team meetings to let the girls air out their frustrations and talk to each other. We've done teambuilding exercises. I've alerted parents about the problem (leaving out identifying specifics) and asked them to talk to each of their girls and remind them to be good teammates.

M purposefully elbowed a girl in the chest during a drill last week because she was mad. That girl was physically hurt, but she was more upset that it happened than anything. The girl's mom sent me a message and said she was crying so much after practice, she threw up.

When I try bringing it up to her dad, he'll just say something like, ""well C is saying things too"" or something else to excuse her behavior, and nothing ever changes.

I've brought in guest coaches with proven track records before to help me out (and to make sure I'm not crazy with how things are going). None of them have ever dealt with something like this. 

If I bench M, it really just makes things worse for the other girls since they won't be able to take breaks. This team is too small for someone who is acting like that, particularly when her dad runs the Club and so there aren't any real penalties for her.

The rest of the girls work hard and they don't deserve for the season to be going like this. They play hard, but when something goes wrong and one person (ahem) starts complaining, everything gets unraveled.

We have 5 more practices until tournaments and I really want us to finish strong and make *something* good out of this season. If anyone has ideas, I'm all ears!",15May2018,1

351,"So me and my gf have been together since 7 months already and this is like our first serious relationship we are both 19 and everything was good. When we met she talked a lot but a lot about her ex and her traumas with him. I was fine with it and supported her. We got together but she kept talking about him while being together,we would go down a street and I would say something like “man I wish I visited Holland” and she would answer “he was an asshole as we were there..” and would start telling me such shit. I told her and she kinda seemed puzzled that I found it not normal? But she then stopped altogether,couple months forward I was at her home and her sister said something about my gf and her ex I can’t remember exactly what right now but it bothered me a looooot. I was mean even if she didn’t do anything but I just felt hurt because I didn’t want to hear anything about that again. 

Many months later we went to the cinema together and on our way back she said jokingly that she would marry her cat and I said “wtf would you sleep with the cat and not me then? ahah” to which she replied “yes ahah maybe with 2 cats even better”

So this was the first joke that wasn’t funny at all but just got me thinking that she has such fantasies I don’t know. I mean 2 cats= 2 guys in my language as we were talking about sex.
I got mad once again and a couple days later I closed an eye and let it be not bothering about it anymore.

Then this dumb shit happened,last weekend we were really happy together everything was perfect and we got into a sort of punishment sex where I would just do whatever I wanted if she was a bad girl. Obviously I didn’t even have a reason and still did what I wanted. 

You know how it goes,she apologises saying she won’t be a bad girl anymore so I tell her to be one so that I can punish her.

To which she looks at me and says “I betrayed you with another guy,no 2,no with 30 guys from your black friends family” and laughs.

At that point I’m just left dumbstruck and my penis dies faster than the speed of light. I tell her I’m disgusted and that I truly didn’t expect this from her especially in such a situation so I tell her she can go home I don’t want to see her anymore. She apologises and says it was only a joke and shit but I didn’t even bat an eye and she starts crying to which I just tell her it’s ok and let her stay a bit more but also trying at the same time to get her home faster so I don’t have to deal with the cancer she gave me.

We kept arguing for the past days about this. 
In the last weeks I noticed her somehow changing,she would be totally weird sometimes like for example we had driving hours together and I wanted to kiss her before letting her drive as it was her turn but she just gives me a slight kiss and then with a commanding tone tells me to get her stuff and put it in the back of the car. I didn’t say anything as the instructor was there too and I didn’t want to make a drama out of it. Then I tried touching her neck in the car and she just got mad and said to let her drive,I was stupefied. It was fucking red light. You don’t even have to do a thing when it’s red. 5 minutes later I’m almost home and she touches my leg and I touch her hand and go home without even saying a thing. She later said she had headache and that she needed to concentrate when driving but I didn’t do anything while she was driving which makes 0 sense for me.

Then she also started talking about my friends a lot of the time. I told her once about my black friend and since then she keeps using him as example for anything.  We would be just making fun of our friends and she would use the example of my black friend,I would say for example “oh damn the test was really hard and I didn’t study a lot but I still got a B” and she would say “ahah I bet your black friend got an F” or shit like this. At first it was funny but then she kept using this so often as example.

Then she would sometimes get jealous without any reason and tell me I’m just like my friends/I do whatever they do too. Which is not true but w/e.

Then today morning I told her I forgave her and she was happy and then I told her I met with a friend and he told me to go on a walk with him after school. And my gf kept asking with whom I was going,I told her with a friend and she kept asking who this friend was.

I seriously was like..”are you fucking kidding me right now? you want so much to know him? do you want me to fucking give you his number or what?”

This afternoon same shit,I told her I didn’t know she had such a side of her and she said in a sweet yet jokingly way “sometimes I have really bad sides in my brain ahah” so I told her I should break up if she has such a side of her. She just told me this side of her isn’t there anymore now.


I seriously am fucking wondering if she is into this shit and wants to betray me. Like,all examples and evidences bring me to the point of saying that she wants others.

And the worst part is the sex part,who the fuck finds it funny to hear such a thing while having sex?

And what’s more,when I have sex I always tell the truth like I need to do this to let all the feelings out. But what about women? Should I understand that was her true desire? I’m fucking ashamed to have experienced such a thing and I hope I’m completely wrong. Opinions on this? Am I guessing wrong or exaggerating? Or I’m on the right track?",15May2018,1

Well she left me hanging by saying that she wouldn't say no or yes because she didn't want to lose me apparently. At this point I knew this pretty much meant that I had no chance and that she just wanted to let me off without hurting me.

I chose to respond to the messages and this led to a really long conversation which ended up in us going to the beach to talk this past Saturday. The entire day we were really close and touchy, but the thing is that she has a friend with benefits kind of relationship with someone else.

Should I try to become a thing with her over time even though she has a friend with benefits relationship with someone else? Should I still talk to her even though I'm slowly getting jealous and building feelings for her once again?

363,"Little background about me \- One month ago I found out a girl I loved \(and who I thought loved me\) cheated on me with her ex, the very NEXT DAY I find out I was fired from my job at a call centre for forgetting to do security checks \(literally stupid, I know\) and I was supposed to move in to a new house that very weekend that I couldn't afford. BAM, in 24 hours, no girlfriend, no job and no house.

I've managed to gather some funds and I've moved in to the new place and managed to get a new \(boring\) job that pays better, has better hours and is closer to the industry I'd actually like to work in. The problem is I live on the other side of the country from my family and friends and I'm lonely as fuck ALL the time. I have a couple of friends here but they all have girlfriends and are busy, my new job is not sociable at all either.

I feel like I'm wasting away. I sit here by myself, I drink more than I should, I'm 24 fucking years old and I look 30.. I'm balding a bit and I feel like my life has gone done the fucking drain. I'm so low and depressed all the time.. I feel like I'll never get a girl as great as I thought she was. I was punching massively and everyone knew it but I was so happy.. Now I feel like a big joke and I have absolutely no one around me and nothing that I enjoy. I just really would love to hear some stories about people who have been in shitty situations and managed to come out for the better.. I could really use it right now.

Thanks!",15May2018,2
364,"To begin with, she was my teacher and also about 10 years older than me. Her husband is a total dick, keeps putting her down and is not afraid of physically hurting her, so I kind of understand why she decided to break 9 straight years of loyalty.

We've been seeing each other for about a month, and everything that could happen happened, and I couldn't be happier. However, we were getting emotionally attached in the process, and she dumped me twice (but I knew from the bottom of my lungs that she would come back, and she did).

Her mind was overflown with information for the last two weeks. She had to deliver a very important project and was staying up late to finish it. Things started to fall apart when she finally did it. Short answers were common.

Last Sunday she decided to break up with me again. She said some nice things about me and our relationship but it didn't felt sincere. I didn't want to lose her so I tried to convince her to think about it, and she agreed to that.

We won't be speaking to each other until this Sunday. What should I do?",15May2018,1
365,"Background: I am a 25 y/o female who works in the film industry as an AD (a lot of responsibility on set and the highest in chain of command below the director/producer). I ended up working on a feature with a 35(is) y/o man as the UPM - we'll call him Bob - who was very inexperienced (had only worked on one 48 hour project before) and just a general asshole. Despite being very inexperienced he was just a big know-it-all and was constantly trying to tell other people in other departments how to do their jobs as well as making it very clear that he didn't like taking orders from a ""little girl"" like me.

So he's an asshole, big woop, I've worked with lots of assholes. I'm a professional, I dealt with it. On the last day our (20sF) 2nd AC comes to me and tells me that Bob got drunk last night after wrap and told her a story about when he was a high school teacher in another town this little 16 year old ""skank"" student of his seduced him and tried to steal his money in court. She immediately looked him up to find several news articles that covered the whole situation and painted a very different picture:

He brought this 16 year old back to his house one night, got her very drunk and had his way with her barely conscious body. The next morning she escaped while he was asleep and walked all the way to the police department to report him. He was arrested, given jail time that was eventually reduced to community service hours, was fired, registered as a sex offender, banned from ever being within 500 ft of a school again and can no longer be alone in a room with a minor. The girl got no compensation. There are many news sources that cover his trial. He plead guilty to everything.

This was maybe a year before I worked with him on this film. I told the director and producers of this film and, while most of them seemed shocked and upset, nothing happened. It was the last day of the shoot so it's not like he could have been fired anyway. I looked him up again a few months ago when warning someone else about him and found out through a new article that he had been arrested again for breaking a restraining order a different woman had against him because he had apparently stalked her in the past.

According to his social media he is now on a few new projects. I have been warning my friends and coworkers in the industry not to hire him, or to at least look him up before hiring him, but he still seems to be getting work...

Where I'm at now: Being someone who was also sexually assaulted at the age of 16, what he's done makes me furious. I am absolutely terrified that he is on the loose in this industry and that he's just going to be given more and more opportunities to assault young women trying to break into film. (Before I knew about his history, he was allowed alone in the trailer with a couple actresses who were minors. This was also where they were expected to change wardrobe in there and whatnot. He never let anyone know that he wasn't legally able to be with them without a chaparone)

I have told all of the people I know, but he's still getting work somewhere. I want him blacklisted and out of my industry. He's a literal rapist and stalker. There are many articles on him online proving that he has, not just once but continually, harassed and assaulted young women.

I have considered doing a big outing on social media, or contacting the police to let them know he is violating certain restrictions they placed upon him. The only problem is that he has friends in the industry and anything drastic might end in me being blacklisted by some powerful people as well.

I don't want to sit idly by and do nothing, but I also want to make sure I get my point across before having my voice squashed by these powerful people in the industry.

What do you think is the best way to handle this situation?

tl;dr Worked with a guy who I found out had a history of raping and stalking underage women. How do I make sure he never works here again?",15May2018,1
366,"About a  month a go I started at my new retail job, which I was very happy about I needed this job to pay bills because I'm an independently living young adult. In my interview I was asked how many hours I wanted and I told him I'm looking for part time hours (15-20) and I was told that's what they were looking for, I eventually got the job and started on a pretty limited schedule that opened up a few weeks later.
  My issue is despite my mostly open schedule I'm only getting scheduled about 7 hours a week, less than half of what I was told I would be getting. When I went to discuss the issue with my manager he then told me something entirely different. I was told that it was my responsibility to pick up shifts to get the hours I wanted, (meaning I can never schedule any plans outside of work because I never know when I'll be called to work to pick up a shift). My manager then went on to say that no one gets the hours they asked for and then went on to blame people that only work a day or so throughout the week  for him not being able to schedule us with the hours we need. 

I've worked in other retail positions and this is the first time I've ever had this issue. I feel like I'm being used as an employee not valued as one. I don't have the option to quit and I'm just at a loss for what to do.

Ps. They also never give me breaks I'll be there for 4 and a half hours right through lunch and I won't even get 10 minutes to heat up and eat my ramen. This isn't an exaduration I haven't been give a single break since I started.

Then my freind said do u want to get messy (with my name) and she said no but in an EXTREMELY calm way. Then my freind asked if she would get messy with him and she said HELL NO. Next she always makes fun of my dick. She said I’ll say your dick is bigger If your nice to me. NEXT everyone knows I’m addicted to porn and masterbaition and we talked about porn for legit ten minutes. Next this one bitch was like (her name) will never date you. Well at gym she asked if I wanted to wrestle her and my freind said he would and she said fuck no your just jelous. Final thing while in my car she was twearking by the school and stared at me then waved at me and when I waved back her and her freind laughed and I left.

370,"Apologies if this is a bit long - I need some advice. Throwaway account, I hope it’s obvious why.

Throughout the past few months I’ve had a matter in court. Essentially, a classmate of mine at university was charged with stalking me (though the actual code offence is called something else). 

While the backstory is lengthy, essentially what happened is we were in the same graduate program and struck up a casual intimate relationship. When school got busy, and I began having less time (it was grant application season), he started having some strange behaviours. He would tell me he saw multiple counsellors a day and had started two new medications because of me. He also seemed to have a new major issue daily which required my support. When I got the sense he was unwell, I suggested we take some time to focus on ourselves and that he should focus on getting healthy.

This led to an absolutely terrifying situation filled with manipulation and emotional blackmail. He involved not only me but my close friends in a constant and ever-evolving story about his life and how I had destroyed him. Essentially the message was that if I got back together with him, he would be healthy and if I didn’t he would end his life.

The events peaked after I had requested (per the advice of counselling services) that he not contact me further. As he brought the behaviour to campus, and tried to find me, campus police were involved. The file was then transferred to our city police, statements were taken from myself and the others involved, and he was arrested and charged.

I live in a country where charges are brought by the state and the Crown represents the interests of the state. A couple days ago, a representative of victim services reached out and disclosed that the Crown was considering withdrawing all charges for a plea bargain put forward by his lawyer. Essentially, his lawyer os requesting a restraining order barring him from contacting any of us for three years. However, this would also mean he would have no criminal record and no finding of guilt. The Crown has asked for my feelings on the subject before accepting or declining.

Here is where I am stuck. While I am not out to ruin lives, this feels dismissive of my experience. I was in counselling for months, diagnosed with PTSD, and have had significant personal struggles as a result of this. I deferred completion of my courses (as a fully-funded graduate student, something I’ve been working towards for years), and have struggled to find my normalcy again. This man terrorized me. I feel let down not only as an individual, but also as one among many women who have been victimized as a result of ending intimate partnerships. This is *never* okay.

However, voicing my support for the deal would mean I am legally protected for three years - after which I would be able to apply yearly for continuation. In contrast, a finding of guilty would result in perhaps a six month probation order with the same protections, after which I would again need to reapply.

Accepting would also mean the matter is resolved. It would, however, also mean I would not get the opportunity to read my victim impact statement to my offender - outlining how his actions have hurt and continue to hurt me.

The representative of victim services is expecting my answer tomorrow.",15May2018,6

I graduated from college two years ago with a 3.9 gpa in management, took a year off and just worked with my dad, and now am working for a grocery store for just 13 an hour (mainly because of no experience and just a degree). I was hoping to move up with this company, but the corporate culture and the bad reviews I’ve read from managers who’ve worked there has turned me off about the company.

Hopefully I’ll have the balls in the very near future to step on stage and chase that dream, but for now I’m just living with my parents in Virginia because I’m able to save a lot of money by living with them. I have 20,000 saved up already. I’m currently on Vacation in Denver. I have tons of family in Denver and they are always encouraging me to move out here. I really love the city of Denver, but not sure if it is really worth the costs. I’d have to go from living with my parents and paying just 300 in rent to paying 1000 in rent and having to buy my own food lol. I just see so many people blow their money in their 20s and feel like I have a real opportunity to save tons of money and get way ahead financially by living with my parents. On the other hand, I think it would be really cool to live in Denver. The city is BOOMING and the stand up comedy scene is growing in Denver too. If I want to do comedy in VA, I pretty much have to drive for an hour up to DC. If I lived in Denver, I could walk to all the comedy clubs in under 30 minutes. I also feel that moving out of my parents house will give me more drive in my work career and even more drive in chasing my dream as a stand up comedian. As some people say, you experience the most growth by getting out of your comfort zone. I’m just not sure what to do. I think it’d be wise to live with my parents for maybe another year, have 35,000-40,000 saved up, and then move. I just hate the fact that I could live with my parents for years, have well over 100,000 saved and not have to ever stress about finances.

If I move I'm worried I will be lonely and miserable, but if I stay I'm worried I will hate myself and still be... lonely and miserable.

A couple months ago I escaped a highly abusive relationship (my family knows about this and they are helping me in every way they can, so I do have lots of support) however, my mental health is in very poor shape.

I have lived here my whole life. 
I discussed this with my mother, and she said that since my father will be moving to the new state in about a week and a half to start his new job, I could go with him if I wanted. She said it would get me out of this place sooner so I wouldn't be constantly reminded of what went on. (In the new state whenever I get there I will be starting therapy regardless) It is my choice to stay or go, but I'm not sure.

Alot is going on.
I just turned 17 and have a lot on my plate.
My dad is disabled and can't work/do things a lone (well a carer comes for an hour whilst im in school which helps)
I practically have to keep the household functioning alone atm as my siblings are busy at uni. I have one older brother who is 23 and living at home who spends his days not showering/only getting up for food/locking himself in his room. He doesn't work and was meant to finish his uni degree last year but my mums death hit him real hard.  Too bad her anniversary falls right around exam and period time. Whilst trying to keep my household together I'm also working at the moment mainly on weekends just so I can have money for extra things like clothes or food (like chinese) or any extra costs that I dont want to put on my dad.

It seems like my family have forgotten that I have exams too so I'm currently juggling making sure my household is functioning and achieving the grades I want to achieve. I'm still shaken on the year anniversary of my mums death but it gets to the point where I have to ignore my own self care for the sake of others. If I stop now lord knows what will happen.

I have no energy to attend school and I have exams looming that practically determine my life and uni choices etc. I feel overwhelmed at the moment.

Boys are pissing me off too. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of because I'm vunerable and practically desperate for distractions of any kind.

I miss my mum and the order she brought into my life, I miss the fact that she used to run things and keeps things in shape and make sure that I was well and organised. I miss not having to do EVERYTHING for myself. I just want to be a normal teenager.

Sometimes I wonder why I was given such a complicated life, why I have to have to have so much hardship, why I have to put up with so much. All the time I just ask myself why me? Accepting my reality is hard and I hate it. I do wish for a better life all the time but when will that come?

I'm sorry for writing such a long post I just need to let things out. I'm just desperate for someone to acknowledge the fact that I'm not okay because no one seems to realise anymore.

392,"Hello, I don't know where else to ask about my dilemma. Or if I am asking in right area. I apologize if I'm doing anything wrong. I have two used cars, a 99 Jeep Cherokee Sport, and a 96 Ford Escort. My Jeep broke down a year and half ago and as of today my Escort is broke down. I need transportation to be able to work due to my location and I don't work with anyone else to carpool. And I am also very very short on cash. Actually, I am going to have to borrow or come up with a miracle to find the money. Anyway, the advise I need is what is my cheapest option. My jeep needs a flex plate and from what I understand the labor will be quite expensive on that. It also needs a crank sensor. As of today, the entire exhaust broke off of my Ford escort and I cannot find anything affordable used or for sale in my area. Does anyone know where or who would be the cheapest place to get parts and which would be the cheapest repair of the two? Idk what to do, I am just looking for someone who may know something about cars or car parts and could help. Thank you in advance for your time.",15May2018,1
393,I have been thinking about this girl from high school lately. I still like her and I am in my fourth year of college. Things between us were a bit weird at the end of HS and I have been conflicted lately if I should DM her asking her out or not.So much time has passed since we last spoke and saw each other she has just been on my mind so much since lately. Should I message her or just forget about it?,15May2018,1
395,"The title kind of says a lot of this with obviously less details, so heres some backstory.

I dropped out of highschool a while back and obviously now know how big of a mistake that was as I dont have my license a car, or even had my first job yet, around that time a girl was over at my house with her friends and she liked messing around with super shy guys, flirting with them, making them blush she just thought it was fun to see them get all flustered.  Well she eventually asked me out and at the time I was pretty depressed and didnt want to be in a relationship, but she kept persisting and I eventually caved and decided I'd say yes because I thought ""Hey she's cute, who knows this could be a lot of fun.""  We ended up dating for nearly 5 years, went through hell as I got kicked out of my moms and had to live with her and her mom, then we got kicked out of there and moved in with a friend, then we had to move out of there to my dads for reasons.  Now we're almost to the present, about a month or so before we moved out of my dads to finally get out own place, she builds up the nerve to tell me her feelings for me are no longer the same as they used to be, it broke me I'm still shattered every day knowing that the woman I love is just out of arms reach for me.  Now I agree'd to be friends with her because I keep thinking/hoping that we'll get back together, that all the shit we went through just wore her down and now that we're in a good place she can stop stressing.  I learned a few weeks ago when I went out with one of her friends to go drinking that they have feelings for each other, I still want to be friends with said friend, I dont hate her, or resent her, or blame her for any of this.  I just need advice on how to move on from this, or if it's worth holding onto this feeling because I truly, truly feel this person is my true love.  So I guess if any of you were in a situation like this what would you do? of if you have been in this situation or a situation similar to this how did you get through it?  Literally anything you guys have to say could help me a ton as I've got no idea what to do.

TL;DR The woman I love broke up with me for losing her old feelings for me, staying friends, but I still love her, she now has feelings for a mutual friend, all while we still live together.",15May2018,2
396,"Hi there, I've had a room mate for the past 5 months who has been slowly descending further into what I can only describe as a well of addiction. He's pretty much stuck to his computer till the dorm wifi shuts off, from the end of his classes till about midnight. Normally I could tolerate this behaviour, even though I would be openly disapproving, but it's currently exam season here. 

 His behaviour has not changed at all, his grades rock bottom and his habit of staying up to use his (noisy) laptop eats into my sleep. He constantly falls asleep during lessons till the point of serveral teachers approaching him outside of class. So far I've tried talking to him, short of contacting his parents as from personal experience it doesn't help the situation. I've tried talking about it both very frankly and casually, everytime ending either with him brushing me off or being openly hostile saying I'm forcing my lifestyle on him. I know he recognizes that he can't keep this up, but he still refuses to make any changes. Even when he does, he almosts always turn on them within a few days. 
 
 Even tonight there are exams in 2 days, and despite an agreement to sleep earlier for the period he has reneged on it to stay up and play and when I mentioned that he promised to sleep earlier his became extremely defensive and refused to talk about it.

As of now I have no idea how to bring up the fact that he needs change (that I haven't already tried) in a way effectively. I'm considering talking to school staff, but I know they can't do much if he's unwilling.

403,"I’ve been working for a transportation company for 3 years and gave up my place shortly after I started. When I first joined the company we were making a pretty decent amount of money, but then changes started taking place and runs available became less. This job doesn’t require me to have my own truck because we drive the vehicle (90% cars, vans and pick up trucks) where it needs to go, and we do this across all 50 States. 

I kept telling myself I would find a job locally in Los Angeles to get off of the road so that I can get back to being stable and in one place, when I started noticing that I really am not making any money, let alone saving anything. It just isn’t getting me anywhere, and I don’t have family or friends to stay with out there either. 

I want to take a leap of faith and just go back to Los Angeles and figure it out, but not having a place to stay isn’t an option. Transportation isn’t that much of an issue because there’s public transportation. 

These are my thoughts: 

1. Rent a place on Airbnb for a month and find a local job in the transportation industry (I would also utilize that time to get my Class B CDL). 

or 

2. Buy a used car between $1000-$2000 (that hasn’t been all too easy to save, but I’m getting close) not pay for a room and least have my car to sleep in. If I need to shower I can get a gym membership in the meantime until I find a job and stack my money for a place.

408,"Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this. It means a lot. 

Basically, I have a crush on this girl from college. I’ve technically known her for about 2 years now through being in some of the same classes but we didn’t sit near each other so we never really spoke. I had always thought she was pretty and nice but didn’t really have strong feeling for her back then. I was mostly focused on doing well in my classes and not much else. 

We started talking during the last month of this semester and I’m really falling for her and I think she might like me too. She laughs at my jokes (even one that I didn’t think were funny), sometimes I catch her staring at me in class (though I could totally be misinterpreting that). At the very least I would say we are friends at this point. I don’t think I’m putting her on a pedestal since I definitely recognize she has some “flaws” but I do think she is an amazing person.

The school year has come to an end and we’ve gone home for the break. The thing is she told me she lives in a town about 3 hours away so seeing her in person is not much of an option. So I’m trying to stay in touch with her online  over the summer without being annoying or creepy. Right now, we are friends on Facebook and Snapchat (though she’s very inactive on Snapchat). Sadly, I don’t have her phone number. We have messaged a few times so far on Facebook, though I’ve started both conversions. Speaking of which how often should I message her? I think they went very well since she didn’t seem uncomfortable in her responses or like she was trying to end the conversation. We made jokes and used emojis etc. I tried to make it fairly obvious that I think very highly of her. 

For example: I asked her if she had any luck finding an internship this summer. She said she’s still waiting on replies. I told her “Same situation here, not that I’m in any hurry to start working. I’m sure things will turn around though. You’re like the smartest person in our grade. Seriously, you’re just like Hermione from Harry Potter, *cough* except you don’t get us any House Points for that competition 😅” (FYI our school has this competition similar to the House cup from Harry Potter but our department has consistently gotten 0 points for the past few years) I thought this would be funny and flattering. She gave a humble response (which was cool learning little things about what kind of person she is) and she even used this thing 🤩 in her response.

Lately I can’t seem to stop thinking about her. My main fear is that she might start dating someone over the summer. So I want to be in her mind that someone cares about her. I don’t think it’s a good idea to confess my feelings to her through “text messages,” but I want to let her know I care about her. When next semester comes around we have a lot of the same classes so I’m going to try to seat next to or near her and hang out more. 

TL:DR. Crush on girl. Became friends during the last month of the semester. She lives far away and won’t see until after summer. I want to stay in touch with her over the break without being annoying or creepy. ",15May2018,1

414,"Hi everyone I’m in a tough spot with my best friend and I really need some advice. 

My best friend was very close to a guy in highschool, they were never intimate but cared greatly about each other. I didn’t know my best friend at the time and went to the same school as the guy, while at school he made sure to take every chance at bullying me (I was in a bad spot in highschool which made me an easy target for bullying). At the end of highschool I met my best friend through a job at McDonald’s where we both worked. We lost a lot of weight together and focused on becoming better people which is part of the reason we are so close. In September the guy made a move and brought her to a party, they both got extremely drunk and he tried to have sex. Nothing happened however and days later my best friend was told by his friends that he was bragging that he was going to fuck her and then never talk to her again. 

Flash forward to this month. He had tried to message her throughout the year, however these usually ended in fights. She found a boyfriend since. He messaged her recently and said that he never was going to do the things his friends told her. He told her that he genuinely cares about her and wants to become friends again. When I heard this I instantly became upset, I had flashbacks to his constant bullying in highschool as well as the fact he treated her terribly. She got upset and me and told me I was overreacting and that she really wanted to make up with him. After a day of not talking I told her if she really thinks he’s changed I would “support” her decisions.

What should I do? I think that if he comes back into her life it’ll be the end of our friendship, he turns her into someone I’d rather not associate with. She’s the best friend I’ve ever had and the idea of losing her genuinely makes me upset.  Plus the thought of him getting close to her makes me feel uncomfortable as he easily manipulates her.",15May2018,1
415,"Hey so this is going to be really long but I'm in a total rut right now and I need some advice soon because I honestly have no clue what to do.

I'm a 17 year old male junior in high school. I had a pretty uneventful for most of my life, until 2016 when I heard that my Dad had an around 9 month long affair. Naturally, this completely changed my life. I don't even know if it mad me sad, it just made me feel numb. I just couldn't believe that my Dad who seemed to have a great relationship with my Mom my whole life would do something like that.

From there, things just turned shittier and shittier. My Dad started telling his family and his co-workers that my Mom is crazy and that the reason he had the affair was because my Mom was a bad wife and mother, which I was sure at the time wasn’t the case. But that completely ruined my relationship with my Dad’s side of the family, and they basically shunned my Mom and banned her from all family gatherings.

My Dad has done almost nothing to try and fix this. The most he did was write a letter to his Dad that he regretted what he said and that he wanted him to respect my Mom. He then later told his side of the family that my Mom wrote it which furthered their crazy narrative about my Mom and just made things worse.

My Dad is currently separated from my Mom. They’re planning on staying together and I honestly have no idea how they haven’t gotten a divorce yet.

But this leads to today, where my best friend of over 10 years today told me that he felt uncomfortable around my mom. Now I noticed for a while after I figured out about the affair that my Mom’s mental state was deteriorating a bit, leading to her having 2 seizures. Its gotten better, but I can understand why my friend felt uncomfortable around her considering the whole atmosphere of the house. But lately I've been realizing that I've lost other family friends as well. A few friends from my church cut ties with my mom because of mistakes she made during this whole ordeal. Its making me question whether or not my Mom is actually crazy or what.

To top this all off, I'm beginning to feel extremely uncomfortable around my Dad. He has started to have a slight drinking problem, and has been really defensive and weird around my family. He can't talk to my mom for more than 5 minutes without raising his voice and getting defensive. He's also started to try to get pity out of my, purposely trying to come to me crying while trying to put the blame on mom.

I know this is a lot but I wanted to ask a few things about this. How do I wrap my head around all this? How do I help my Dad try to fix things? How do I tell who's really in the right here? Of course my Dad had the affair and told a bunch of people shit about my mom, but people seem to think my Mom is crazy. How do I make my friend more comfortable around my Mom? How do I talk to my Dad about all this? I need some help please.

418,"Hello reddit,

I think I need advice regarding something that happens to me kinda often. 

This thing I'm talking about is a bit weird to explain, but basically, what happens is that everytime I care about something or someone, or consider them important for me, I tend to try to do EVERYTHING almost perfectly with the fear that if I don't do something the right way I might fuck up something related to the things or people I care about or consider important. 

These things sometimes are things directly related to what I'm fearing to lose. But sometimes they are things not even relevant or directly related to them. 

An example that comes to mind: I have found myself doing very repetitive actions trying to do everything perfectly or almost perfectly like washing my hands a lot of times, reading something a lot of times even though I completely understand what I'm reading, looking a lot of times at something and each one of their details, or repeating any kind of action a lot of times until I feel I have done it right \(which is very exhausting and annoying most of the times\). 

ALL of this things with the fear of losing or somehow affecting something I care about or consider important in my life even though I'm well aware that they don't have nothing to do it.

I hate when this happens to me because it just doesn't allow me to fully enjoy the things I care about.
