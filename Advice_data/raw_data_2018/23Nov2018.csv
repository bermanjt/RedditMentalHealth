0,"Basically im the captain of my high schools basketball team, i play point and i suppose you could describe as the average jock? (even though i hate that term) i go to most parties, am friends with most people and like most my grades suck. Anyway into my situation. Well it all started about 2 months ago when my principal asked me to see him one morning, he basically told me my grades are terrible and i really need to improve. Me, being the careless guy i am decided to ignore him and just carry on as normal, doing minimal homework and partying instead of caring about my grades. Well last week he approached me again but this time got my basketball coach to join in as well. They both then told me that i basically need to show an improvement in failing subject areas (which is basically everything except for gym class) within the next 2 weeks or im off the team.... This shocked me as well as my coach who obviously wasnt told about this before they came as he was as shocked as me. I told them i try which in a sense is kind of true i do try in the lessons just not outside of class but they said to get me more focussed and to know im actually doing work outside of class they are assigning me a school student tutor (student tutors are basically smart kids in the same year as you who volunteer to tutor other students their age in order to receive extra credit). Now this shocked and annoyed me basically because i would now have a tutor who everyone knows are nerdy kids who sit in the tutor centre the whole day studying, if people found it i would be so embarrassed. Well anyway to cut the story shorter i argued back saying i didnt need it even the coach said i needed to be in practise to try and help me out but in the end it was no use and the principal was having none of it and basically told me and my coach that im having the tutor and going to show improvement or no basketball. So my first lesson was 2 days after that at 3:15pm the exact time school finishes and everyone goes home i tell all my friends im going out with my family after school and that i cant hang out, they seem to by it and start saying their goodbyes, i wait outside the school until im sure everyones gone then i go back inside and make my way to the tutor centre. I arrive looking around the tutor centre for the only information about this girl i was given which is her name ""Haley Roberts"" lucky for me theres only one girl in here so it was pretty obvious she was my tutor i walk over and boy was i wrong about the stereotypical tutors at my school because i look at and....wow.... thats the only thing that comes to mind. She has brown eyes, long brown/auburn hair to just below her shoulders and was sitting at one of the desks next to the window at the side. We start talking i explain my situation and she seems to understand that i dont want anyone knowing. She also knows who i am roughly mainly because basketball such a big thing in my school but i kinda felt bad for not knowing her. Anyway thats kinda the backstory and back to the question that i need help with. Basically its been about a week and a half since i start these sessions and i kinda feel like im falling for her. hard. i've had girlfriends and hooked up with girls at parties but never felt like this when im with her its like i dont have to act like this 'jock' type character and i can just be myself and talk about things i dont with my friends and she seems to listen as well and we talk about her. Im just nervous that if i ask her out and we start dating what will my friends think? what will the whole school think? will they make it hard on her for going out with someone like me when shes a nerd?. See i know how my friends can be and i know they wont approve of me going out with a, and sorry to use this term for a geek or nerd or whatever you wanna call people who care about their grades. See we have been seen around school together and i think she gets the impression im embarrassed by her? which im not its just the situation that were in. When people ask what were doing im normally the first to answer replying with something like ""oh i forgot what the homework was for math and was just asking what it was"" ik im sad but i just freeze when they ask and thats all that comes out. So any ideas on what i should do? or do i just need to suck it up and deal with the consequences if i really like her?",23Nov2018,1
1,"I don’t know how to put this in words that won’t make me sound crazy. 

When I moved back home from university I decided to live with my mom and my stepdad for awhile until I could pay off some bills and get on my feet. I had a job, car, my room in their house that I paid for, and a completely normal social life. 

But a few months into this whole rigamarole I started having these crazy intense sex dreams. It started out one time when I fell asleep on the couch, and then a week or so later it was when I was sleeping in my own bed. I won’t go into specifics of the dreams, but they were very realistic. I could feel what was going on and even orgasmed.

It started to get to the point where this was happening multiple times in a week, spreading over a lengthy period of time — probably about two or three months. I wasn’t really complaining but it was confusing because of how real it felt, but I knew I was obviously dreaming.

It kept happening but then it started to taper off for awhile. I didn’t feel very concerned about it until one day I started googling what it was called and if other people experienced something similar. There are different medical terms about wet dreams and what not, but I couldn’t find any stories about people actually feeling the penetration and what not. Also, as a woman it is extremely hard to find out about female nocturnal emissions. Can we do something about that?

Anyway, I was starting to get a bit worried because I couldn’t seem to stop these dreams from happening, even when I tried to wake myself up in the middle of them I couldn’t. I didn’t lock my door a lot because of my dogs going in and out of the room through the night. I don’t know if that matters, but it was just me, my mom, and my stepdad living there.

As soon as I got my own apartment and moved out the dreams stopped — and I haven’t had one since. Nothing has changed in my sexual life to prevent the dreams from happening, the only thing different in general is that I live on my own again.

I don’t know what to think about it all. I’ve done some serious research since and even went so far as to find this crazy article about demons that have sex with you in the night or something.

But there has to be a real answer for this — medical, psychological, etc.",23Nov2018,1

5,I'm currently taking Math 20-1. It's the only subject I'm a grade behind in because I got a poor education in it via homeschooling a few years ago. I'm interested in going into computer sciences however I need math 30-1 and also it would need to be 80% or more as an average. I have a 57% in math currently. I don't want to blame it on the system or my situation but I have a sub par teacher that is making it pretty difficult for everyone and I have ADHD (I can't use meds because it aggravates my anxiety).  If I get lower then a 60% average I will have no choice but to move into a lower level of Math grade 12 that won't be high enough to get me into computer sciences. I'm struggling but am also stubborn about making it to Math 30-1. Does anyone have advise to more effectively absorb info and also bypass a less then ideal learning atmosphere? I keep trying my best and have confidence in my answers but I'm still receiving sub par makes and instructions on how to fix them. Some people still like and respect this teacher but her pace and style is making it very difficult for me and she won't hear any complaints. Any advice is appreciated.,23Nov2018,1

10,"Hey guys, so I'm 19, male. And struggle with the concept of dating quite a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, throughout my teens I've had countless amounts of disappointing in love, often all resulting in me falling in love with people I cannot be with, either because they found someone before I did anything about my feelings, or they just could reciprocate. 

&amp;#x200B;

But now that I've been making friends at uni, I feel like I could actually find someone. I've met this girl recently, I think she's very attractive, and emotionally, my kind of girl. However, I really struggle with taking our friendship to the next step. I can make friends really easily, for most part, I can talk to anyone, but when it comes to progressing a to a relationship or something of the like, I just don't know how to even do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of my friends got a girlfriend just by saying hello on facebook, then asking her if she would come over and watch some netflix, they didn't do anything that night, but just cuddled and stuff. I feel like I could ask the girl I'm interested in, if she would like to come over, I would ask her to get lunch with me, but I'm a pretty poor uni student, and I don't even have my license. So I'm a bit intimidated by the idea, like if I ask her to come over, and she actually says yes, what do we even do? we could have dinner together, but is that to formal? if we just watch netflix and cuddle, is that to little? or even to much?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice to go forward with this would be appreciated, my dating life hasn't been that fruitful at all, so I have no idea what I'm doing and seeing as I've suffered so much already, I don't really want to fuck up my love life even more.

I'd love to be able to do it properly, not feel so self-conscious. But I just feel like the loser freak.

I'm told I'm attractive but I'm also weird looking, I'm lanky with a face that's described as 'expressive', it makes me really self-conscious.

14,"I wasn’t sure where to post this, but here goes:

I don’t want to go into too much detail to avoid revealing identities/situations, but basically someone I know has been extremely sick for almost two years. Doctors cannot figure it out. The disease hit them very rapidly and they now have basically no motor functions. Their brain is still fine and most tests come back normal, which is why doctors are stumped. Diseases they’ve tested for showed similar symptoms, but most of the doctors got caught up by the fact that whatever it is has ravaged this person so quickly, and at an alarmingly young age. 
All of this came about right after this person got married to someone they had not dated for (that) long. Their spouse has been reveling in the attention and along with many MANY other red flags I won’t state, I have reason to believe their spouse may be poisoning them or have a serious case of munchausen’s by proxy. I don’t believe they are  completely fabricating said disease, but perhaps aggravating symptoms or not properly caring for this person. Possibly abusive.
They have an appointment at a very prestigious hospital soon and I am wondering if there is a way for me (anonymously) contact the hospital before they go and let them know the situation so they will be less likely to miss it, if it is truly what is happening? 
Obviously I can’t know for sure, but there are far too many cases where doctors are fooled for years and then the victim ends up dying at the hands of their abuser. I am so scared for this person. I pray that this is not what is happening to them, but it is impossible to ignore this potential scenario given the circumstances.
Has anyone had to do something similar? What is it like? Does anyone have any experience with munchausen’s by proxy in their personal life they’d like to share or any advice?",23Nov2018,1
15,"I've had clinical depression since I was very young and a difficult childhood that as made me a bit of a wreck. My grades and family are suffering because I am essentially a corpse. I have done therapy, medication, even contacted suicide websites. Yet here I am, analyzing people from a distance and envying them. I have a job but fake such a pronounced personality that I feel there is no way to escape from it and it's exhausting. People have made friends with the person I am not. I am motivated only by the things that deeply move me like technology. However, my grades still suffer because I try to convince myself to give a shit about the quadratic formula so I can get better marks but they are sub par at best. With the marks I'm getting I won't be able to get into any good university course and by extension won't ever be able to move  to NY which as been one of the only concrete dreams I've ever had. Ideally I don't want to become dependent on drugs but it's tempting because of my situation. I already abuse food as a form of punishment and pleasure. I starve or I am full beyond comfort. I know it is out of boredom but I feel like there is nothing else to do when all the people I speak to have no idea who I actually am and my family is distant and difficult to be around.

17,"I(19F) met my boyfriend Greg(29M) through a friend. Everyone seems to think he’s great . Feminist, liberal, owns a dog and charming. Before me, there was another girl he was talking to (21F). But he said she was stringing him along. When they stopped talking she begged for him his attention. She started not doing well mentally. I think she didn’t have much emotional support in her life.




He says he’s had depression his whole life and gos into periods of unemployment. He’s never dated younger girls. His last girlfriend was the same age. He said she was abusive. Like throwing things at him calling him names. He’s been to a rehab for depression but said it was a scam and wasted his money.



He’s an intellectual he dropped out of college because he said it didn’t challenge him enough. He used to work a job but now quit and lives with his parents. He did the books for a company but says he hats this capitalist society. That he hates that cooperations run our lives. He hasn’t worked for eight months.


Once he quit his job after we were dating for what seemed like the most perfect two months. He started talking to me about suicide. I said I’m not a doctor, I can’t handle this. Now anytime I bring up my criticism of him. He brings up how he doesn’t feel safe talking about his problems anymore because I “abandoned”. He says I’m bad at arguing. That I’m illogical and over emotional. He never gets emotional. 


He says the things he says to me are provable facts. He’ll make me beg him if I want to FaceTime, then act like he’s doing me a favor when he does it. He says I’m a liar cause I tell white lies. He checks the data on photos I send him to catch me in a lie of when I took them. He says I’m manipulative because when he gets in a “mood” he won’t want to talk to me. So I try sending a sexy selfie. That makes me manipulative. He says I like drama and that I’m immature. He says he has a right to suddenly ignore because no one is entitled to attention. He’s the only one I talk to about deep emotions so I feel lost when he does that.


One time on my birthday I was on vacation. I was with a close friend of his (who is a girl). As soon as I got there he was grumpy on the phone , when the day before he was happy and cheery. Said he was in a mood from depression. We were on a break. I wanted to FaceTime him for my birthday so I called a couple times. He says we aren’t dating, we are never going to date so stop acting like this. That I act entitled.



I say he needs to get his head out of his own a**. I say he’s a loser. He says that I’m deflecting. That what he’s saying is logical and fact. What I’m saying is just nonsense. That every time he has a criticism of me I turn around and throw his illness in his face. He says I’m a mean person for not understanding how I’ll he is. He refuses to go to therapy because he has tried it for ten years. He says it does nothing. He blames his parents for not doing something sooner.



He says because this stuff I’m abusive to him. I feel like such a bad person like I’m mean. What’s wrong with me? Am I mean? How should I fix the relationship?

 I'm very scared of that happening again. I can see the telltale signs. I'm constantly clenching my jaw or fists, I get frequent headaches and back pain, nerves in my eyelids flicker constantly, I sometimes feel faint, get occasional heart palpitations, difficulty sleeping, etc. I try to relax as much as I can but it never feels like enough.

26,"  

**LONG POST - READ TL;DR AT BOTTOM IF CAN’T BE BOTHERED TO READ ALL.**

So, I'm in my second (last) year of Sixth Form College doing computing, I don't like anyone in my class, they're pretty much your run of the mill nerds so I haven't made any friends with them for the past year and don't plan on doing so before I leave. However, I do have a fair few friends and about 99% of them do a music tech course. 

Now, towards the end of last year - November/December time - I was walking between class and saw this girl walk by, and she was pretty damn cute, IMO. 

I don't tell anyone about her for quite a while from fear of been made fun of by friends, I haven't had a good track run with girls before, they know that and I know that and they usually say things along the lines of, ""Don't bother"" or ""You won't do it"" when I tell them I might try and talk to someone. I’ll see her passing such as just before lesson, yet I don’t make any attempts as I don’t want to make her late for any of her lessons.

I carry on not telling anyone until around mid-May because I don't often see her around much and thought maybe some of my friends might know her. I tell my closest friend about her and he says ""Oh, that's (let's call her Chloe) from the other Tech class”. I was quite glad that someone knew who she was at this point and that he didn’t tell me to “leave it”. He said he doesn't know her personally, nor does he know whether of our other friends do. He then tells his other friend (we’ll call her Sarah) who sends me a message saying that she knows Chloe a little and could probably try and find out some stuff about her. 

A couple of days pass and she sends me another message saying that she’s not currently seeing anyone. 

Feelsgoodman.

A couple of weeks pass and nearly all my friends know about how I feel about this girl. They’re really trying to get me to talk to her, but my nerves are way too overwhelming and even thinking about talking to a girl and to make a good first impression frightens me. I come into the tech class where everyone usually hangs out and my friends just said, “You just missed Chloe, she walked out about 5 minutes ago”, I was quite at this point annoyed because I felt good that day and could’ve built up enough courage to start a conversation with her. 

**Note: I’ve not been with any of my friends when I’ve seen her in person and I’ve never pointed her out since I’ve told my friend in the first place, he’s just guessed who it was from my description and I just went along because I’ve never been one to confront, I was just happy that someone knew her.** 

Now this is where it starts to suck.

About a week passes at this point and I decide that I’ll message her on Messenger because I’m not good enough to speak to her in person and I can safely hide behind a screen since I’ve never met her in person and pretty sure she hasn’t noticed me at all. I find out her surname from Sarah and I go ahead and find her on Facebook. I find her but was a bit sceptical since her profile picture didn’t look like the girl I first saw. I gave her the benefit of the doubt (I think to myself that it could have been a friend or sibling), and send a message saying “Hello”. We talk for a few weeks and haven’t arranged to meet up during college time or anything and we realise the end of the first year starts creeping up. She’s from Cuba and is really into marine life and stuff and so I suggest to her that she should go visit the local aquarium in our city. She then says she has never been but has wanted ever since she came to England in June 2016. I was planning on asking her if she wants to go the aquarium with me some point during the Summer holidays. I keep putting it off as I feel too awkward about asking her.

A couple more weeks go by and she says she won’t be talking so much one night since she has friends over or a party for her 18th birthday. I wasn’t bothered and just carried on with my night as usual. Then around 1am I get a voice call on Messenger from her, I dismiss it as I feel she didn’t mean to. Then two minutes later she sends a video (black footage) but the audio is her friends and her just giggling so at this point I conclude they may be drunk. Again, I dismiss it and carry on with whatever I was doing. Then a flood of gibberish messages come through. I have a friend who has rather fat fingers and he mistypes most words, this came in handy when deciphering her messages. They then start to become more legible and we start a normal(ish) conversation. She then starts saying how much she’d love to go the aquarium with me and starts naming dates and times of when we should go. Now, I wasn’t comfortable making plans while she was drunk so I tell her I won’t make any plans and that I’ll ask her in the morning if she still wants to go. Morning comes around, I ask her, and she still would really like to go. Hell yeah, my first real date.

We agree on a date and time in a week’s time and just message each other until then.

Fast-forward to the date. My dad takes me as I can’t drive yet, and I wasn’t enjoying the thought of cycling 1.5 hours to the date, it would have not done any wonders for my appearance and would have made me smell of sweat. My dad drops me off at the car park and drives off. I message to say that I’m walking through the car park and she replies saying she’s waiting by the entrance. Now, if you have been paying attention (and have read this far – well done), you can probably guess what happens. That’s right, I see her. Not “her” as in the girl I’m attracted to, but “her” as in the girl in the Facebook profile picture. At this point I was pretty disappointed. I didn’t show it, but I didn’t feel like carrying on with the date. I decide to go through with it and I didn’t want to be a bastard. We spend around an hour in the aquarium and then head towards to the centre of town and go to the shopping centre to get a coffee and sandwich for lunch. I really enjoyed the date, she was really funny and nice and shared a lot of the same interests with me (we had already discovered a few things we both enjoyed through messaging, but we found more similar interests just being together). However, I didn’t want it to go any further than us just being friends as I wasn’t attracted to this girl, I did enjoy being friends with her though. 

I walk her to the bus station and wait with her until her bus arrives and say goodbye to her. When we both get home, she sends me a message saying she really enjoyed the day but felt we should just stay friends. This has been the first (and hopefully last) time I’ve ever been relieved after being rejected. 

We keep messaging for the rest of the summer until a couple of weeks before we start college again. Those weeks leading up to the start of college our messages become more infrequent until we just stop altogether. It seemed to be mutual, so I was a little disappointed we stopped but not too much. I haven’t spoken to her since the 16th August and ever since I’ve started my second year I think I’ve seen her \~4 times. So, no awkward aftermath of drifting apart.

A couple of weeks later I kept going through the whole summer and scenario with that girl and just think I should’ve tried to make something out of it with her because I probably won’t be able to speak to another girl again after all that. I started developing a temper with people and even my closest friends as I blamed them for letting me go through with it. I don’t anymore as I know it was my fault ever since I saw her on Facebook. 

I still don’t know who the girl I’m actually attracted to since last December is and still see her around. I really want to speak to her now and not dwell on it anymore, but all of my friends are tired of me asking for advice. They’re all in relationships which is why I want to speak to the girl, so I can fit in with my friends. I just see them all the time in their relationships and feel like I’m missing out on something.

So now we time travel to yesterday. I was waiting for my mother to pick me up at the entrance of college then remember that I’ve seen the girl walk this way out of college before, (there are two exits to the whole college site). So, I decide to use this opportunity to talk to her and I turn around to see if she’s coming and sure enough, she is.

Now, me talking to girls is like being on the edge of the cliff. All you friends have jumped into the water and are having a really good time, you really want to jump but there’s something stopping you. You don’t know what it is but there is definitely something stopping you.

I start building up courage to say “hi”. She starts to get so close that I run out of time to think about what to say after “hi”, a problem I’ve struggled with forever. She looks at me and I just look back. No emotion. Just looking at her. She walks on, obviously.

28,"I’ve been working at a Montessori school in a toddler classroom for a bit over a year now. A lot of the philosophy is new to me and although many aspects are positive, there have been a few ideas that make me uncomfortable. 

In our classroom, I am an assistant. My role is to redirect behaviours and ensure the smooth running of the classroom based on the head teacher’s direction and goals. 

A huge tenet is natural consequences which I feel is useful in a lot of circumstances. Ex. If a child is goofing around instead of getting ready to go outside, they won’t have as much time to spend with their friends. That’s frustrating. And I have no problem supporting that lesson. We have high expectations of the children and know they are capable of getting themselves ready. 

Our head teacher insists that at lunch time, all students must set up their own spot at the lunch table (placemat, plate, cup, utensils) prior to saying grace and being served. That’s fine. We know that they are capable. What I’m struggling with is the “natural consequence” of children who don’t set up in time (ie. the children that are being silly or off doing something else after being told it’s time for lunch). If it is noticed that there is a child or a few that haven’t set up, we are instructed to put the plates out of sight for the children so they won’t be able to have lunch. 

Today one of our students realized about five minutes late that he was missing lunch. He set everything up and when he went to reach for a plate, they had already been put away. He went to each adult in the room asking for a plate, and we were instructed to tell him that he missed the opportunity to join for lunch and that he could find his bed or sit down and have some water.

He ended up going to bed. The same routine happened at snack- we were instructed to deny him snack because he said no when he was asked if he wanted something. Later he realized that he did in fact want to eat and asked politely, but he was told that “no means no” and again, he missed the opportunity.

This happens frequently enough in the classroom to the point where I feel uneasy. I think about withholding that information from his parents (who are paying a lot of money for a healthy catered lunch) and how they would react.

If he had set up and refused to try any of the food that would be a different story. But this seems more of a case of using food as punishment or for learning a lesson. If they are your own kids, okay- but as a child care worker I feel that I don’t have the right to deny a child food.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts. ",23Nov2018,1

32,"**LONG POST - READ TL;DR AT BOTTOM IF YOU CAN’T BE BOTHERED TO READ ALL.**

So, I'm in my second (last) year of Sixth Form College doing computing, I don't like anyone in my class, they're pretty much your run of the mill nerds so I haven't made any friends with them for the past year and don't plan on doing so before I leave. However, I do have a fair few friends and about 99% of them do a music tech course.

Now, towards the end of last year - November/December time - I was walking between class and saw this girl walk by, and she was pretty damn cute, IMO.

I don't tell anyone about her for quite a while from fear of been made fun of by friends, I haven't had a good track run with girls before, they know that and I know that and they usually say things along the lines of, ""Don't bother"" or ""You won't do it"" when I tell them I might try and talk to someone. I’ll see her passing such as just before lesson, yet I don’t make any attempts as I don’t want to make her late for any of her lessons.

I carry on not telling anyone until around mid-May because I don't often see her around much and thought maybe some of my friends might know her. I tell my closest friend about her and he says ""Oh, that's (let's call her Chloe) from the other Tech class”. I was quite glad that someone knew who she was at this point and that he didn’t tell me to “leave it”. He said he doesn't know her personally, nor does he know whether of our other friends do. He then tells his other friend (we’ll call her Sarah) who sends me a message saying that she knows Chloe a little and could probably try and find out some stuff about her.

A couple of days pass and she sends me another message saying that she’s not currently seeing anyone.

Feelsgoodman.

A couple of weeks pass and nearly all my friends know about how I feel about this girl. They’re really trying to get me to talk to her, but my nerves are way too overwhelming and even thinking about talking to a girl and to make a good first impression frightens me. I come into the tech class where everyone usually hangs out and my friends just said, “You just missed Chloe, she walked out about 5 minutes ago”, I was quite at this point annoyed because I felt good that day and could’ve built up enough courage to start a conversation with her.

**Note: I’ve not been with any of my friends when I’ve seen her in person and I’ve never pointed her out since I’ve told my friend in the first place, he’s just guessed who it was from my description and I just went along because I’ve never been one to confront, I was just happy that someone knew her.**

Now this is where it starts to suck.

About a week passes at this point and I decide that I’ll message her on Messenger because I’m not good enough to speak to her in person and I can safely hide behind a screen since I’ve never met her in person and pretty sure she hasn’t noticed me at all. I find out her surname from Sarah and I go ahead and find her on Facebook. I find her but was a bit sceptical since her profile picture didn’t look like the girl I first saw. I gave her the benefit of the doubt (I think to myself that it could have been a friend or sibling), and send a message saying “Hello”. We talk for a few weeks and haven’t arranged to meet up during college time or anything and we realise the end of the first year starts creeping up. She’s from Cuba and is really into marine life and stuff and so I suggest to her that she should go visit the local aquarium in our city. She then says she has never been but has wanted ever since she came to England in June 2016. I was planning on asking her if she wants to go the aquarium with me some point during the Summer holidays. I keep putting it off as I feel too awkward about asking her.

A couple more weeks go by and she says she won’t be talking so much one night since she has friends over or a party for her 18th birthday. I wasn’t bothered and just carried on with my night as usual. Then around 1am I get a voice call on Messenger from her, I dismiss it as I feel she didn’t mean to. Then two minutes later she sends a video (black footage) but the audio is her friends and her just giggling so at this point I conclude they may be drunk. Again, I dismiss it and carry on with whatever I was doing. Then a flood of gibberish messages come through. I have a friend who has rather fat fingers and he mistypes most words, this came in handy when deciphering her messages. They then start to become more legible and we start a normal(ish) conversation. She then starts saying how much she’d love to go the aquarium with me and starts naming dates and times of when we should go. Now, I wasn’t comfortable making plans while she was drunk so I tell her I won’t make any plans and that I’ll ask her in the morning if she still wants to go. Morning comes around, I ask her, and she still would really like to go. Hell yeah, my first real date.

We agree on a date and time in a week’s time and just message each other until then.

Fast-forward to the date. My dad takes me as I can’t drive yet, and I wasn’t enjoying the thought of cycling 1.5 hours to the date, it would have not done any wonders for my appearance and would have made me smell of sweat. My dad drops me off at the car park and drives off. I message to say that I’m walking through the car park and she replies saying she’s waiting by the entrance. Now, if you have been paying attention (and have read this far – well done), you can probably guess what happens. That’s right, I see her. Not “her” as in the girl I’m attracted to, but “her” as in the girl in the Facebook profile picture. At this point I was pretty disappointed. I didn’t show it, but I didn’t feel like carrying on with the date. I decide to go through with it and I didn’t want to be a bastard. We spend around an hour in the aquarium and then head towards to the centre of town and go to the shopping centre to get a coffee and sandwich for lunch. I really enjoyed the date, she was really funny and nice and shared a lot of the same interests with me (we had already discovered a few things we both enjoyed through messaging, but we found more similar interests just being together). However, I didn’t want it to go any further than us just being friends as I wasn’t attracted to this girl, I did enjoy being friends with her though.

I walk her to the bus station and wait with her until her bus arrives and say goodbye to her. When we both get home, she sends me a message saying she really enjoyed the day but felt we should just stay friends. This has been the first (and hopefully last) time I’ve ever been relieved after being rejected.

We keep messaging for the rest of the summer until a couple of weeks before we start college again. Those weeks leading up to the start of college our messages become more infrequent until we just stop altogether. It seemed to be mutual, so I was a little disappointed we stopped but not too much. I haven’t spoken to her since the 16th August and ever since I’ve started my second year I think I’ve seen her \~4 times. So, no awkward aftermath of drifting apart.

A couple of weeks later I kept going through the whole summer and scenario with that girl and just think I should’ve tried to make something out of it with her because I probably won’t be able to speak to another girl again after all that. I started developing a temper with people and even my closest friends as I blamed them for letting me go through with it. I don’t anymore as I know it was my fault ever since I saw her on Facebook.

I still don’t know who the girl I’m actually attracted to since last December is and still see her around. I really want to speak to her now and not dwell on it anymore, but all of my friends are tired of me asking for advice. They’re all in relationships which is why I want to speak to the girl, so I can fit in with my friends. I just see them all the time in their relationships and feel like I’m missing out on something.

So now we time travel to yesterday. I was waiting for my mother to pick me up at the entrance of college then remember that I’ve seen the girl walk this way out of college before, (there are two exits to the whole college site). So, I decide to use this opportunity to talk to her and I turn around to see if she’s coming and sure enough, she is.

Now, me talking to girls is like being on the edge of the cliff. All you friends have jumped into the water and are having a really good time, you really want to jump but there’s something stopping you. You don’t know what it is but there is definitely something stopping you.

I start building up courage to say “hi”. She starts to get so close that I run out of time to think about what to say after “hi”, a problem I’ve struggled with forever. She looks at me and I just look back. No emotion. Just looking at her. She walks on, obviously.

I just don’t know what to say after “Hi”, neither do I know how to approach her, you know, after not knowing her at all.

TL;DR – I see girl. I like girl. Tell friend. He says it’s so-and-so. Me happy. Talk to who my friend said it was on Messenger. Arrange a date. Go on date. Not girl I’m originally attracted to. Stop talking to false girl. I hate myself and friends for a while after. Realise it was my fault. See original girl. Too afraid to talk to girls. Try and talk to her.

33,"Hello all,

I want to go to Big Bend in December. I brought this up to some friends who were excited about it, but could't make the time. I looked around a bit more and found a friend I know who would be going with a few of his friends. Unfortunately, they are leaving two days earlier than I can go, but will be staying there as long as I attended. 

Big Bend is about 10 hours away from where I live. The farthest I have driven by myself is 5 hours. I will have three good days to hike around.  I am leaving Texas in August and may not have this chance again. It seems like a perfect situation. Gear and food are planned - I would just have to pitch in with some cash. My schedule is completely free for that week.

Do you take photos of your parents? Should I take photos of my parents?

This girl is in one my college classes. I went to class one day and she came up to me telling me about the temporary location change we both forgot about. We had never talked before. We decided to uber to the class, it was like $5 so I paid. No big deal. I wasn't going to ask her for $2.50 lol. 

Saw her after class getting food so said hi again while we were in line. She told me about an event the following night for a non for profit she runs and invited me, said ""bring your friends"". Another member of this non for profit was meeting her for lunch so when said friend arrived she introduced me, saying ""this is my friend ____"" (friend zoned?). She took down my last name to add me on Facebook which she did later that night. I ultimately couldn't make the event because of family obligations I forgot about.

Messaged her a few days later saying sorry I couldn't make it and asked how it went. She replies saying it went well and asking how my weekend was. Said it was good family time, which she reacted to with the heart eyes emoji. 

Week or two later I messaged her asking for notes from class which I missed. She didn't reply until a few days later, saying she was so sorry and that she hadn't been to school for about 2 weeks because she was facing mental health issues. I said something like ""no problem pretty lady"" and said hope you're feeling better, etc.

She didn't reply for literally 10 days, saying she was sorry she didn't reply sooner. She thanked me for my kind message and included a heart emoji. I said ""no problem cutie"", we continued to talk a bit about the essay, class stuff, etc. 

Next class I sit with her and her friend. She messages during class saying she wants to respond to the prof but he's too opinionated to argue with or whatever. We go our separate ways after class but I end up bumping into her again because we exited the building at different locations. She touches my arm and says she'd talk to me later or something like that. I told her earlier that I was going to work right after class, and she messaged me later asking how work was going. I replied but never heard back from her. 

This morning before class she messages me asking to save her a spot as she thinks she'll be late. She does have that other friend in the class so I thought the fact that she asked me was a good sign. We have presentations followed by a Q and A next week and she asked if I wanted to help each other out and ask each other questions after our respective presentations. I misunderstood and thought she meant coordinating beforehand and making questions together so I said ""sure we can do it over coffee!"". Then I realized that wasn't what she meant so I said sorry I misunderstood but yes we can ask each other questions during our presentations. She said no it's fine and that she's cool with coordination beforehand but ""probably not"" because next week she has exams and essays due.

She ended up getting there before me so I asked her to save me a spot which she did.
After class we walked together, we were going the same way and she walked with me to my subway station. We talked about our living situations. She said she lives alone and her condo is pretty cool with a pool and jacuzzi and I should ""come check it out sometime"". I said ""yeah let me know"". I told her I also live alone and we talked about our pets. At my stop she initiated a hug goodbye, not a full hug but a one arm around each other type hug. 

Few hours later I messaged her asking how her essay is going. Haven't heard back. There seems a possibility she is interested in me but I wonder why she takes so long to reply especially when it says she's online. Also wonder why she basically said she was too busy next week to meet up. Even when I'm busy, if I like a girl I'll make time for sure.

Anyway if you bothered to read this far let me know what you think!

I used to work into the night doing homework everyday and sometimes not even go to sleep in order to finish my homework. I feel like I can't do that anymore. My body doesn't let me. I get too tired to think earlier and I start feeling dizzy. I also don't learn very well during class and I'm used to teaching myself my school lessons as I go through my homework which makes it take even longer. I also take longer than the given time to complete test and the teachers have stopped giving me extra time to finish my test. People always tell me to apply myself or get better at managing my time, but i've been trying to do that for years and it just never works.

I'm happy that I finally get a normal amount of sleep. I have been getting sick less, my skin has gotten better, i'm eating more, and my dark eye circles lightened. It's like as my grades have been dwindling, my health has improved. Overall, I haven't been feeling all that great. I don't think 'm really going to go anywhere with the grades I have now and I feel unaccomplished. After school i'm tired and my whole body feels sore. Lately, I keep on crying and I have no clue why. I don't know how to balance my health and school.",23Nov2018,1

60,"So I’m pretty awkward socially. I’m pretty much your “basic white bitch” and I think a lot of people assume I’m just a dumb white girl. I can be an unexpectedly deep person and have a very high level of empathy and insight. I am almost too empathetic-I can feel others very deeply, and understand them well. I suspect this might actually be sort of harmful to me, though. 

Regardless, I would like to improve my social skills. I can get pretty anxious around new people, and I don’t always know what to say or say something kinda dumb since I’m anxious. Last night, a close friend of mine invited me to a pregame and I felt so awkward the whole time. I tried to contribute in conversation or joking around, but I just find it hard to relax. I was thinking that having some tips would be helpful during a time like that. I kept thinking that she would have had more fun if she didn’t invite me, because I felt like the odd man out and the awkward straggler friend.  

I am also very sensitive and take a lot of things to heart. because of this, I am pretty easily bullied and I suck at defending myself. I then lash out at myself when I feel like I didn’t defend myself properly. 

Anyone have any advice on how to outgrow social anxiety? I also suspect I might be socially avoidant, because I desire to have a big group of friends but I pretty much nerf any chance at making friends. I think I am capable of being charming and at ease, just not sure how to get there. Confidence building tips would be helpful as well! ",23Nov2018,1

In the past 6 months since I graduated I have had just about everything happen to me. My initial college plans were cancelled weeks into the project and out of the blue. This hurt my resume as I had put it on my resume (big mistake) but only because we were weeks into the project. Due to the actions of the supervisor I removed it from my resume, and had to take a temp job (ended end of October) to pay bills. At the same time, I kept interviewing for jobs. I have since doubled down on interviewing for jobs but have yet to get an offer. If this keeps up I will again, have to take another temp job to pay bills but am currently making enough from side jobs to pay my bills. My home life is a similar level of crazy and simply do not want to talk about it.

65,"So I don't really know where else to post this. 

Last Monday my roommate was thinking he had some of the symptoms of tapeworm. We didn't really take it seriously and sort of laughed about it, but we agreed he should definitely go to the doctors the next day. I should mention now that we live in Quebec, but neither of us speak a word of French. 

Anyways, he goes to his doctor's appointment and gets told ""yeah you might have tapeworm, go to the hospital tomorrow and get it checked out."" As soon as he told me this I started to get worried. I mean tapeworm is a pretty serious thing, right? Why wouldn't they deal with it immediately if there's actually a chance he had it. 

So Wednesday he goes into the Hospital. He told me that the doctors/nurses he interacted with all spoke very little English, and it seemed like they were getting frustrated with him because he couldn't speak French (again, that's from his perspective, I don't actually know how they were acting and he may be exaggerating). When he told me this I got sort of pissed. I mean they have this patient that might have tapeworm, and from the way he told it to me they weren't taking it that seriously. 

So they give him some materials to take a sample of his feces with, and told him to take two samples 24 hours apart. 

He took the first sample today, and told me there were small opaque white worms in his poop. He told it to me so calmly too, it sort of freaked me out. I google image pictures of poop with tapeworm and showed it to him, and he said yeah it looked sort of like that. 

I'm freaking out for him right now, and I'm trying to tell him that he should go to the emergency room ASAP and get this shit figured out, but he doesn't want to. 

Now, I know nothing at all about medicine, so I might be totally overreacting to this, but I wanted to put something out there and make sure at least. 

I guess my main questions are: **is the procedure he's following the normal one for people with tapeworm? and should he go to the emergency room as soon as possible?** I really hope that I'm just overreacting and there really is nothing to worry about. 

Please someone who knows something about this let me know what you think

71,"My life's falling apart (in my opinion, might be overreacting). I'm doing pretty terrible in college right now; I might fail this semester even. I barely have any friends at the college I go to, and definitely no close friends I see everyday. There are a lot of things I consider wrong about myself, but since I'm trying to not be such a perfectionist in literally everything I do, I'll try to focus on the important parts.

Let's just say I have a lot of problems. My appearance is crap, and I have been trying to fix it, which I believe is working, but I'm still self-conscious about it, and I believe people are judging me for it (I've basically been bullied multiple times by entire student bodies in middle school and high school). I'm a hard person to deal with it, and I'm pretty sure that's why I'm pretty lonely. In addition, my voice is really nasally, and I honestly look like a typical nerd a lot. People have told me I am loud a lot and am annoying for multiple reasons (I'm paranoid, I lack common sense, my facial expressions can bother ppl apparently too?) My clothing is really weird/looks bad on me; I know that's my fault, and I've been fixing it slowly, but I think people are judging me about it and I'm also insensitive about this. The biggest problem with my life is that I'm fcking slow with everything. Like literally everything. I think I may have a learning disability/developmental delay or some sht. I also get super distracted in most of my tasks, such as reading, even with sleep, food, and exercise.

I also get tired super easily; I'm a physically weak person and I know people for sure have made fun of me for this.

My slowness basically is partially responsible for so many of my problems: I didn't put in time for researching the fashion for people my age, I don't always have time for personal hygiene (showering every two days, not shaving, etc.), I don't have enough time to eat nutritious, healthy meals (I'm a super picky eater), which leads to my poor health and my short stature, and I don't always have the time/energy for interesting hobbies, leading to me becoming a really boring person.

Anyways, I have somewhat accepted my weirdness/weakness, but I still feel self-conscious about it. I'm isolating myself from people because I feel like they will judge me and bully me or some sht. I know people say not to care about what others think of you, but when a significant portion of the people around you look down on you for things you (mostly) can't fix, what are you supposed to do about it? I'm not sure how I'm suppose to somewhat put my life back in order.

I want to meet new people but it's not like there's a weird kids club or anything at the college I go to (at least none that I know of). Any ideas?",23Nov2018,1

75,"So today was Thanksgiving and it was the first time I'd spent any reasonable amount of time with her Dad.  What I'd known about him prior is that he was divorced relatively recently, he is/was an alcoholic (worse in the past, somewhat better now), he constantly prys my gf for information about her Mom and siblings (Mom has full custody, no visitation), I think the Mom has a restraining order against him, and he has been emotionally and physically abusive in the past.

Tonight he seemed in good spirits, he was charming, funny, and generally seemed like a really good guy.  This is in stark contrast to the stories I'd heard about him.  What I do know is that he really wants to have a good relationship with his kids but keeps fucking it up.  I get the impression that he is a man with the best intentions but the weakest of wills, seems like a guy who wishes he could be better but can never succeed.

Something seemed off tonight, despite his demeanor I felt that there was a very deep sadness in him.  He took my GF to his apartment, I tagged along because I know she'd feel safer with me there.  He was looking for something, no idea what, but he wanted to give it to her as a gift and said he'd already given one to her brother.  I didn't think too much of it until I saw a text.  I don't remember verbatim but it was something along the lines of ""If you could have one thing to remember me by what would you want it to be?"" followed by ""I want you to remember me"".  I didn't tell her I saw those messages (we literally just had sex so the timing was poor) but she said a few minutes later ""I think my dad's planning something, I don't like it"".

All my instincts say that he's trying to leave a good last impression.  I don't blame the guy, as far as I've seen he just seems deeply deeply troubled.

I don't know what to do.  Do I tell my GF?  For all I know she might want him dead.  I am very conflicted.",23Nov2018,1
76,"I (25F/US) was offered a new job, senior staff at a nonprofit in my favorite city. It’s very exciting and no way I’m saying no. 

The difficult part: I work at another organization right now where I am very heavily relied on. I replaced a member of senior management but have a junior title, get paid 30% less, and my boss makes double what I do and has literally no experience in my department. Thus, I hold up the department. I haven’t been the happiest about it, and I have been denied any kind of advancement or promotion over my 2 years here despite stellar performance reviews.

The main problem... my boss is pregnant and due early January. When she announced the pregnancy over the summer, she immediately pressed me on whether I would stay the next calendar year, and that her maternity plan is... me. No other details regarding pay or title. She asked that if I had any thoughts of leaving, to let her know and she’d keep it confidential. 

Fast-forward to September when my dream job opened up. When the posting went up, I told her I was going to apply even though it’s a long shot, but I wanted her to know. I’ve been extremely open through the process (probably too much). 

Anyway, she’s been freaking out the last two months as I went through three rounds of interviews. She begged me to let them “fight to keep me” and entertain any counteroffers. She said they were considering a title change, and she’d see what she can do regarding pay. Then a week later when I asked to clarify if a counteroffer would only be made only IF dream job offered, she said our CEO/President was taking everything over and she would decide (guess it’s not confidential anymore?). Since then, NO communication from her at all. She hasn’t even spoken to me about the situation. I don’t have a comfortable enough relationship to initiate the conversation with her. 

Despite all these verbal promises of an interim title and increased responsibility, I never received anything in writing about covering my supervisor during her maternity leave. This organization generally does not stick to promises unless they’re a signed document. (I’m still not earning what I was told was the salary in my first interview 2 years ago, fun fact)

ANYWAY, I got the job. It’s good money, great step up in the industry, and moving to my dream city near family. I negotiated a higher salary and more vacation days(2.5x what I get now) and accepted their offer. No regrets. 

I can’t tell my employer until Tuesday. I’m looking for advice on how to handle telling my boss and the organization. (I’ll have to announce to a group of 80 people who all know me well and will be very disappointed/concerned). I know she’s going to have a meltdown and start crying (hey, she’s 8 months pregnant and the situation genuinely sucks). They’re going to beg me to split between the positions for an extra month, which I know will lead to performance at my new job being sub-optimal. I just want to put in 3 weeks notice and have a clean break. Should I just tell them that? Do I owe them anything?
Important note that my industry is very small and my biggest priority is not burning any bridges. 

My opinion is they need to hire a qualified interim ASAP that I can train over the next month. If they don’t do that, we have several events in January that will struggle. 

TIA. It’s a very loaded situation and stressing me out way too much, when I should be focused and happy about new position!

I want to change to be the person I want to be, but how do i do this when my boyfriend and parents already know me to be a certain way? I can’t just do a 360 on them, itd be weird. I constantly daydream about leaving the guy Im in love with, just to be able to move away and start my life over and be the person I want to be. But i know leaving such a great guy would be a mistake, and I dont want to hurt him this way. But I dont like the person that he knows me as, and it hurts my self esteem. what do i do?",23Nov2018,1

96,"Without saying to much, I have always had a strange way of thinking, but looking back the past 4 years to the time I was 16 (when I think this all started), I think in a way the things that have happened to me might not be normal at all. I have done a hefty amount of research and landed on some weird form of schizophrenia or something along those lines. 
I just want to ask for some identification advice from people who know someone with this illness, or who have experience with things of this nature themselves. Here goes. 

I have had delusions spanning from 2 sek to months at the time (almost false memories), emotions that get ""stuck"" or that only appear alongside another emotion (fear with anger), absolutely mental nightmares that tend to bleed into reality as I wake up, and most frighteningly a feeling of my thoughts being so loud that I almost expect other people to hear them. On occasion I have also heard things that were not there. 

So, yeah, looks quite bad when written like this but hopefully it might give some indicators to the people who know more on the matter. Thanks in advance. ",23Nov2018,1
97,"So I've been in love with this girl in my class for about a year, as long as I've know her for. Today I got an Instagram dm from her telling me that she loved me. I instantly responded with ""are you serious"" she sent me this emoji😊, which I took as a yes, so I responded by saying that I loved her as well. She took a while to respond, eventually saying that it was only a dare (I assume from her younger sister). My heart was shattered, but she followed up saying that she did have feelings for me and wanted to be my girlfriend. We said that we wouldn't tell anyone that we knew, and after that, I thought that it was real. The girl who I had admired and loved finally wanted to date me. Now, I had been in a relationship with her before, but after that was over, I thought that she never wanted to be with me again. An hour or 2 later, as I was getting ready for my shower, I get a text from her sister telling me that she wasn't ready for a relationship yet. My heart was once again broken. I dmed her (my crush) to ask her why the fuck she didn't just DM me herself. She started to apologise, and asked if we could still be friends. I said yes but with the added message that I didn't want to talk with her until after the long weekend. Keep in mind, we're both only 13, so we do have to see eachother every day at school. A few short minutes later, I get another DM from her sister telling me that my crush was next to her crying on her shoulder. I feel terrible, but still need time to clear my head.

99,"     I recently talked with my parents and one thing I realized about myself is that I don’t have a sense of what success should look like. I don’t know if it is because I am comparing myself too much with other people or what. 

     For example: my parents say that meeting new friends and joining clubs at my new school (which I have done) should be considered successful in my eyes. Or I am making As in all my classes. But everything does not seem like a gain to me. It’s just stuff that I have done. When I am asked what I want in the future, I don’t know. I am set on declaring a major next year, but I don’t know what I would do with it in the future, nor am I motivated to find out. 

     I also think motivation plays into my my successes. I don’t see successes in a long term setting and therefor I am not motivated to finish something. 

     I don’t know what is wrong with me. I hope to start counseling soon. It just feels like in the future all this indecision will hurt me most. Any advice on this will be appropriated. Thanks. ",23Nov2018,1

After getting into a fight with my boyfriend (everything's good now don't worry lol), I've decided to try to improve myself. However, I feel like I'm a really selfish person and I'm not so sure about how to make this transition so I can live a happier life and actually have my loved ones enjoy spending time with me again. 

I've decided to make two goals: to be kinder to other people and be less insecure in literally every aspect of my life. The only thing is, I'm not so sure how to start achieving these goals. I want to start being the kind of person that notices the little things about people and wants to help them out instead of being so focused on me and how I'm doing 24/7. 

Basically, I want to grow up, and I'm trying to figure out how.

102,"As the title states, I have been dating my GF now for nearly three years, and she has always talked about wanting kids. She knows that kids aren't on my radar yet, which sometimes annoys her, but she gets it. A little while ago however, I made the mistake over entertaining the idea of kids during a conversation by saying ""maybe one day I'll want two kids"", just because IF I were to have kids, it would be better to have two instead of one so they can grow up with each other. Naturally this comment made her very happy and excited for the future.  


Right now, I don't want kids. Like at all, in my life, ever. I know jokes about death shouldn't be taken lightly, but I would actually rather die than have kids right now. I truly see absolutely 0 advantages to having kids. I'm also reading post from dads who did not want kids who ended up having them, and a large majority said it was the worst mistake they've ever made in their life, and now they're stuck with it. My fear is that all those people who tell me ""You just wait because one day you will want kids"", or ""When you finally have kids, it will all make sense"", are wrong. What if ten years from now I STILL don't want kids? I stay up at night thinking about this because I love my GF, enough so that I've already started saving for an engagement ring which I plan to use next summer, but I know sharing my concerns may be what makes her walk away, which is understandable. I also realize it's unfair to string her along if one day things do not change.

I have made active attempts to mend any bad feelings between them and I.

Everyone knew we had a special bond despite being different people. My family didn't tell me this news until yesterday after his funeral. I never had the option of attending. Right after they told me they started posting pictures on Facebook. I'm not sure how to react. I believe telling them how I feel won't prevent this from happening again. I feel alienated from my family despite numerous attempts to stay connected. I'm wondering if I should just give up and become the person they expect me to be.

106,"There was an incident at my school that led to me, and two of my great friends to be involved in a school investigation. One of the friends was the perpetrator, and he was begging us to lie for him so he would not get in trouble. So, we lied for him. The school was very adamant about finding who was the culprit, so they turned the whole investigation over to the police (although this may have been a lie, because the situation was not that serious). He ended up confessing to the school, except when he confessed he also told the school that we lied and knew that he did it the entire time. The school has a strict honor code, and this may lead to my (and my other friend's) expulsion, or at the very minimum a large suspension. The school I attend is a pretty prestigious institution, so this could be potentially *very* life changing. It will also show up on my record, which is not going to look good for college.

It makes me feel like he's taking me less seriously and it weakens the point I'm trying to make. Like I can see he's on the verge of rolling his eyes because 'oh she's crying... again.' I've looked this up a lot and the two pieces of advice I often see are: ignore it and the other person will ignore it, or focus on your argument instead of crying. Neither of them have worked because my dad always asks why I'm crying, and if I focus on what I want to say then I can't focus on not crying (which = tears). Then afterwards, I cry a little more because I'm so annoyed that I cried again.

116,"I noticed that most friendship that last a lifetime are those from high school or college years. Afterwards, most people are just passing by in your life. Even when I was in my postgrad classes, most of the people there weren't as friendly. They seem very professional and not there to make friends. So we were just ""coursemates"" and nothing more.

I moved to a new city and I'm a complete stranger here. It's been years since I seen my high school or college friends and most of them live in different states far from each other. And we just drifted apart. Some even got married without inviting me. So it's safe to say that we aren't as close anymore. Or maybe not even friends anymore. 

The people I meet often are my colleagues and my clients. None of them are ""friends"" material. Even if they are friendly, all we talk about is business.

Then she began pouring her heart out to me, every chance she could get. She has OCD/anxiety officially diagnosed. She believes the smallest most minor inconvenience is a death sentence, and while I want to be sympathetic to her disorder ITS FUCKING ANNOYING. Like I can’t take it anymore. We can’t have one conversation without her saying she is about to die. Everything goes back to how she feels like something awful is about to happen to her. 

(Copy and paste) We literally had a conversation that went just like this: 

Her: what’s up? 
 
Me: just got back from the gym. Wbu 

Her: I think I’m going to die. Like seriously. I just ate a Cheeto and it scratched my throat as it was going down. I literally feel like death is upon me. If I die just know I had intentions of marrying you(; 


Okay and she’s so over dramatic also. She talks about marrying me all the time and she is absolutely batshit crazy over me for some reason even though we have never met. And she keeps going on even though you can kinda pick up that it makes me uncomfortable. 

The sad part is, she’s actually a cool person when she doesn’t act like that. She’s pleasant to talk to. But everything always ends up being about her.

Though, she was on good terms with him and she was there when he passed away. Still, she is grieving and I don't know what to tell her or do. We helped her with the funeral and we were always there for her. Today is her birthday. We had a nice day, we bought her tickets to see her favorite musician and we invited her out for dinner. We went home and I started to feel that she was getting sad. She started to cry, silently, in a way that you would think she just had allergies. She wasn't talking too much. At 8pm she went to sleep. She typically sleeps at 10. Before she she feel asleep, my dad and I comforted her by laying beside her. Now I ask, how can I help? We don't have a touchy feeling relationship, though we have a really good daughter-mother bond. What can I do? ",23Nov2018,1
134,"I’m literally so paranoid.

I work in a place with a bunch of foreigners. I didn’t mind them until the Americans I worked with said they were doing something illegal with our taxes. So I got pissed off and I told them off saying I was going to call immigration and my lawyer and quit.

The owner is Albanian and he called me begging for me to come back that all the other girls were telling me lies.. blah blah.

He took me and my mom to his accountant to prove his innocence.

While the manager at the time told me he had Mafia ties.

It’s been a year now since that happened and I’m still working there, I know I’m crazy but I make a lot of money there. It’s the most popular place in town and it’s growing to become corporate. 

But his Albanian friends are so intimidating and the girl I cursed out comes there with her mafia ass looking husband. The owner even fired her that day I freaked and told her not to come back because she was illegal.

Now I’m friends with all my co-workers (foreigns) we became really good friends, even call each other family.

But I feel the paranoia, I feel like they’re plotting to kill me, I feel like everyone’s in on it like it’s all an act.

I threatened that one girl, another girl and the owner but he treats me so nice and doesn’t fire me when I do stupid shit but he’s like that with others too.

I don’t want to leave my job, I don’t want to drop my friends because of my paranoia but then again I’m not sure if what I’m feeling is true. 2 of them actually went to highschool here but it doesn’t mean they’re still not involved in some mafia shit. 

I’m 21 years old and I’m scared for my life.

And I need help to determine if it’s all in my head or if this is real

135,My mom was telling me about the time she broke her leg at cheer camp. This would have been like the late 90s. She told me that her cast covered her entire leg from her toes up to her hip and she couldn’t move her ankle or knee. I can’t even imagine that! She had to wear it for like three months too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND:
My parents are divorced and both have been very abusive in their own way.a my mother has full costody and I will probably review no money from my disabled father who is in the clutches of his family that's probably liquidating his assets. My mother has been reported to DCF before and I've tried to get help with my situation before, but considering I have my own problems, and I showed no signs of bruising from times she's hit me, and I haven't shown anyone the unconsented video footage of her vocal emotional abuse DCF did not remove me***. She ""saves"" my pay checks because she doesn't let me have them. And I pay some bills because we're low income. 

I need to leave because I'm tired of having the environment on me
Some rules of hers include: 

-no sleeping over girl friends houses even though I have when I was younger
-no hanging out with guys unless you're in a group setting and must be even mix gender or mostly female
-no hanging out with taken guys in relationships
-no hanging out with guys if you're in a relationship (I'm only allowed straight relationships. If I came out as pan she would disown me and send me to the hospital she thinks being not straight is a mental problem)
-no being out after 9 but really your curfew is 8:30
-no friends even if they're off their JOL cannot drive you it must be my mom or another trusted adult of a friend's parent

-------------------------------------------------------------

MY MOM HERSELF:
Racist- has been toward me because I'm Chinese and she's Italian. She adopted me and has said racist things toward me as well as thinking theres problems with every race that's not hire or anyone of color that's not a doctor or lawyer

Sexist- until she learned females can make money in science fields she didn't want me doing anything like it. She made me not take woodshop for example because she was also afraid of the guys
She also doesn't think having friends that aren't females is dlwrkng and not possible

Lgbtq+ phobic- anyone that's not cis gendered and straight to her she thinks has some medical issue like it's a disability and a mental health problem and needs to be punished. (I'm pansexual and questioning if I'm agender or genderqueer)

Other prejudices-
-Thinking people can reade her mind
-Any one in customer service is stupid/ she can be rude and expect they'll still be nice
-Everyone wants the best for her
-shell do good for you and expect she can treat you like shit later but it's okay because she did something for you that you never needed or asked for (I get it's nice but ie: buying say a coffee and then saying something like Im a burden in her life)

Other problems:
-thinking I make her yell and get angry and upset when she does it to herself because she's very opinionated and I don't have control over say the guy pumping our gas or that I say forgot something that was her responsibility like not missing a gas station she passes while driving 

-she is financially abusive because I can't even keep ahold of my own money without her threatening me in the way of say not letting me see my friends*

*I need to see my friends because I need a break from being at home. I've gotten so depressed from not seeing them before they've become one of the only things that keeps me afloat

 Abuse
-verbally abusive and things she says is scary: ""all liars should die"" ""when you and (her bf) are sick next I'll fucking 'chicken soup you' and then you'll croak"" ""do you blow your bf with that mouth"" ""you're a fucking whore"" (I broke up with one bf and four months later found someone else I wanted to date) 
That also ties into  emotional abuse
- she guilt trips me all the time and says she can do things because she's an adult even if it's ridiculous
- physical abuse: she says away from this because she's been physically beaten belt style when young but she has still whipped a belt at me before, grabbed me, pulled my hair, slapped me with a metal ruler and threatened me in various ways including to crash a car while we're in it. Nothing has been enough to leave a scar and mostly just to sting and be red for a bit
 ---also physically abusive to my things like destroying a 150$ tablet that was my last Christmas gift from my father who is too disabled to know what time of day it is or what 1 plus 1 is
Destroyed a government provided trac phone (bc low income)
Destroyed another phone (150$) that was a gift to me
 *** I can't have any privacy she if she wants to needs to be able to read through my texts and I can't have social media without her knowing (so she doesn't know about this account) because she'd want me to explain everything but do the adult thing where she doesn't actually listen and expect me to keep answering the same question. She'd question why I post anything or who people are and want to control everything 

- parenting is basically from the 50's like anything that happens in the house stays in the house (even if you want to kill yourself which I have because if this environment)
- therapy is for insane people
- mental health doesn't exist you're either okay and sane or you have a illegal problem that needs to be locked up (but it's okay for her to have anxiety which no one can say she has just her or shell tell at you)

-bizzare weird things that just make me uncomfortable: she think she can just into the bathroom when I'm taking a piss or a shower even if I'm naked and want privacy 
-she will go to the bathroom if I'm say washing my face even though we have a second one 
-she keep telling at me to get out if the bathroom because she needs to go even if I do even though we have a second one
-shell just be naked like say after a shower and say I'm in the bathroom doing something even though it's not a sight I want to see without warning
-she pushes her way into all my doctors and everything appointments and doesn't understand no matter how many times people tell her what patients rights are and I have to have my doctors and what not just straight up lie to her it's that bad

I've sprinkled examples of her weirdness and how she's abusive and controlling and unsupportive.

-------------------------------------------------------------

***SOME THINGS ABOUT ME:
I have depression and anxiety that have been clinical and even lead me to emergency services and therapy. I have indulged in self harm and binge drinking as a suicide attempt

This ties into why DCF didn't remove me because they couldn't see past the cutting and drinking even though I'd tell them why. 

This isn't all my problems but it strongly ties into my concerns and why I posted this:

Because of my legal history for stealing from my house and consumption of alcohol and past mental health outburst (going on 4 years ago) does this affect when I turn eighteen to go and not had my parents know anything. 
I plan on not signing anyway medial rights besides if I'm not able to give consent to medical procedures if I say get in a car crash and need surgery but can't respond. I won't give them financial power either. 

I need to know what I should do when I'm eighteen like how to get medical insurance

I only work part time and make Massachusetts minimum wage for 12 hours with a week's pay of 149$

I do not have my lisence just a permit
Obviously no car

I don't want to burden my friends parents too much even though I might stay with someone for a bit.
--she would literally call all my friends and their parents and the police department when I'm eighteen as if they could do something about getting me back in the house

I'm currently 17 turning eighteen in June just after high school graduation

Planning on going to college for four years

I'm mentally stable now despite my disorders

I need to get out of my house if possible on the day I'm eighteen

Some complications include: 
-not having a car or licence
-not having a lot of money 
-no siblings 
-no family to take me in
-going to college soon
-place to live/storage
-i am adopted and the most official document I have is going to be my passport coming in. We had to give up my permanent resident card to give the okay that I'm actually a citizen (American parents adopting foreign children on touch her down of the plane in America = USA citizen but we had no official document )
(I'd need to steal all my papers that I don't know where all of them are in the house)
-When I leave if I don't take my pocessions insecret I might get physically asulted",23Nov2018,1

Everything went wrong. I tried to use your advice and confronted her about it, told her to see a therapist and that I could come with her. She refused so I asked if her parents knew, they do and they’re doing absolutely nothing. 

She keeps insisting that it’s normal and that I shouldn’t worry. She just doesn’t understand and nothing I’m doing is helping her.

She started to guilt trip me when I told her that she can’t rely on me all the time, she told me she wouldn’t be friends with her either, and that I should just go hang with my “other, more sane friends”

I shouldn’t have got into this mess in the first place. Now our friendship is on the line but I don’t want to leave her behind to rot while I go live a happy life, I’ll feel like shit about it for years. I’m at a loss, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what telling my mum would accomplish but I can’t try yet because she’s not home yet.

So what now? Do I just leave? Do I try ignore this?
What do I do?

140,"My roommate has been one of my best friends for a long time. This year, he transferred to the University that I attend, and to help him get a jump start, I suggested we could live together. (I had other plans with friends, but sacrificed that to help my buddy) We started off just fine, and I didn't mind living with him... until his girlfriend of 3 years broke up with him. Through this, I discovered a side of him that changed the way I will forever see him. 

When she was visiting to break up with him, he punched a wall in anger and broke his hand. There was a lot of crying, which is alright in a break up, but then it got much worse. When she left, he started threatening her with suicide attempts and would not leave her alone. Being his only friend at this school, I was put in the middle of this. I talked to him, his family, and mine about the situation and what was going on. He's in therapy now, but still gets very angry from time to time. For example, he was burning pictures the other day, and then asked to use my phone to text his ex because she wouldn't respond to him. I said no, that it wasn't a good idea, and he proceeded to destroy his phone in anger.

Then, the day after destroying his phone, he casually mentioned getting a town home instead of an apartment after our lease is up. I feel terrible because I really enjoy his friendship and wish for the best for him, but my dad and I both agreed that living with him hasn't been the best for me. It sounds selfish but I have to focus on school, and it has been really tough so far with the way he has been acting. I should mention that they broke up in late September, and the phone incident was a week ago. It has been a lot for me to handle, and now I'm stressed out over how I should tell him that I'm not planning on living with him. Learning about how unstable he was with the breakup, I just fear for the worst when I think about ways to tell him.

If any of you have some advice to help my situation, that would be greatly appreciated.",23Nov2018,1
142,Well I’ve gone through my entire life not really clicking with anyone I’ve always had friends and stuff like that I just have never had a best friend or anything like that and I met this girl and we just get along really well. We have the same type of humor and we love the same exact music artists and we even have the same breed of dog which is a kinda uncommon breed I don’t know we just fit and she is exactly my type the only thing is she has a boyfriend. Who she loves very much and whenever we’re around his friends she’s kind of a dick to me but she only does it because her boyfriend absolutely hates me and I barely know him. But whenever it’s just us or people who don’t know her boyfriend she’s super sweet. She would never cheat on him even though he has cheated on her. I know we could just be friends but I want more than that. She always subtly flirts with me and this is just really hurts to know the potential but know it can’t be. I hang out with her everyday at school but her boyfriend goes to a different school so he doesn’t know. I’ve literally had to hide outside of her house one time because her boyfriend came to see her and he didn’t know I was there. We weren’t doing anything romantic or anything we just were just smoking weed and chillin with her dog. And yesterday I was kinda just messing around and I asked if was in the friend zone and said no and she was serious.

143,"I don’t know if I’m overthinking this but oh god it happened 10 minutes ago and it was so fucking awkward I need hELP


So,  some backstory, I have a really close friend who’ve I’ve known since 10th grade when he was in 11th. We were both very shy but I got the nerve to talk to him since we were literal partners.
Ever since we’ve basically become best friends until he graduated, since then, we just text basically every few days.

I’m currently in my first semester of Uni. Already making it 2 years that we haven’t seen each other. He was going to an amusement park today and since I’d rather not stay in my dorm all day for thanksgiving I accepted immediately since I wanted to see him in person so BAD. The day went perfect and it was like we never stopped seeing each other, he’s literally my best friend and he calls me as such as well .

Now. We were in our dorm and he just rested for a bit before heading back home. We were sitting in my bed basically just showing each other memes we thought were funny and then we got quiet for a bit. He then proceeded to start showing me pictures of him self in a full body swim suit. Then he asked “want to see my nudes?”

This is when I was like “wtf.” So I just laughed it off and said “no, I don’t want to see your dick” the fact that he knows I’m asexual just somehow made it worse I don’t know I’m so diskfjwmd

He responded with “are you sure”

“Yes I’m sure.”

Then he got quiet again and the once relaxing tone switched to awkward and tense. Then he said “I have a picture where I’m not showing anything” and he wasn’t looking at me. He was sitting right next to me but looking away. 

He had sent me a picture a year back of just his torso asking if he should send it to a girl since he was getting more toned.

I gave in and didn’t see anything really bad about it and just said “uh ok”

Ofc the picture was him completely nude but he was cupping himself. I automatically gave the phone back and asked why he wanted to show me so badly and he said he didn’t know. I tried to suggest that if he wanted advice that all I had to say was that he looked fine and fit. 

Right afterwards he was leaving. It was so fucking awkward I just lead him to my door and told him to have a safe trip and we exchanged an awkward hug. 

Am I reading too much into this? I really don’t want to think he might like me in that way since we’re literally best friends and most of the girls he likes are the complete opposites of me in the looks department.",23Nov2018,1
145,"Hey y’all, just wanted some advice on something that’s been bothering me for years.
Firstly, my mother is extremely narcissistic and controlling and always has been (craziest incident I can remember was briefly attempting to call up my middle school everyday to check that I was following the dress code) I do not live with her, see her about six days per month at most, and I have a job so she doesn’t give me much support other than insuring me (custodial family is on Medicaid so I cannot transfer providers). As the title implies, I have never recalled a time where I told my mother “no” - I have allowed her to heavily monitor my social media until maybe a couple months despite her not paying for the phone, including daily screenshots of posts she did not like or understand being sent to my father with demands I be punished.

I am posting this because today was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I am 18 years old, and she of course did not approve of what I was wearing (not inappropriate- she just doesn’t like it) and demanded I change. I tried to stand up for myself by telling her that the law considers me an adult and isn’t she being unreasonable, to which she replied with that I am not an adult and I am required to ALWAYS listen to her because she gave birth to me. I just hung my head and answered yes ma’am, and went to dinner wearing clothes from her closet she laid out for me, very disappointed in myself for being such a pussy. Dinner itself wasn’t much better: she controlled when I ate, informing me that I had to wait to eat the same time as her despite the host telling me I could grab food whenever I wanted, controlled where I sat until the host intervened, and overall spoke to me as if I was a toddler and glared at and threatened me if I displayed any sign of disobeying. She does this in public places as well which often leads observers to start talking down to me by default as if they think I’m much younger than I really am due to being so meek to this treatment (if that makes sense).

So really, my question is, what should I do? I can’t reason with her or calmly stand up for myself because she won’t listen. I can’t be more aggressive because I’m too much of a pussy. Honestly I wouldn’t mind not going to see her anymore, but part of me feels like I “have” to because she’s my mother, and I know she will use me being able to have any decent healthcare against me.

TDLR; mother is extremely and unreasonably controlling, I’m a massive doormat and need some help with finally being assertive. ",23Nov2018,1

147,"I don't want to post a wall of text, so here's the quick if it:

Started dating a girl 3 years ago, thought she was cute, we have similar sense of humor, physically attracted to one another, live a ""cute"" relationship. I do love her and always try to look out for her. And I mean the world to her.

But I have a friend, f, who thought I was just an amazing person on like day 2 of hanging out. We had a lot in common. Recently we've been hanging out more and texting each other more, and I love every minute of it. And she's absolutely breathtaking on top of it.

But even aside from this one particular friend, I can't help but think how I'd much rather spend the rest of my life with a girl like her than my current gf, based on personalities, interests, future goals, etc.

Does having this feeling make me a dick? What should I do? Is one supposed to treat relationships with the ""bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" mindset? If I ended up breaking off this 3-yr relationship, do you think I'd be making a big mistake?",23Nov2018,1

151,"So I am just gonna go straight into the backstory since it is sort of important. When I was around 6 or 7,  my parents decided to split up as my dad had to move to America for work and since my mother didnt want to leave the rest of her relatives in London, she stayed and they broke up. My dad apparently had a little baby girl with this lady in 2005 and I just found out about it months ago. My dad left the poor girl when she was 2 and her mother lied to her about her dad being this other guy so my sister could have a dad figure. But sadly her dad ended up ""touching"" her and just doing awful things. Anyways, I began talking to her mother and after a while we began working on a plan where I can meet my little sister.


She seems like a very interesting person but I just cant seem to get her to talk to me. I just feel so bad because she just looks so insecure and scared and I really want her to feel comfortable with me. Everytime I look at her, she would just use her hair to cover up her face. When I say hi to her, she would just mumble in a very quiet volume. It has been a week and I still can't seem to get her to say more than one word. Her sister has tried to leave us alone on multiple occasions, two times where it was just the three as 3 times where it wad just the two of us, and she just wont say anything. Although she doesnt say anything, she always looks like she wants to say something which is bugging me.

By this, he tells me that his parents aren't a fan of the trashy girls he dates. He then proceeds to move out and live with his uncle.

157,"So basically a few months back I fell in love with a girl and long story short she broke my heart by dropping me completely saying she wasn’t willing to date a younger guy but then dated someone younger then me. I was head over heels for this girl I lost 50 lbs   for her and got my grades up just for her I stopped hanging around bad influences just for her and then she just dropped me. And ever since then I’ve had this overwhelming sadness come over me and for the next few months after she broke my heart I just didn’t wanna do anything like at all my enthusiasm for football, wrestling and Lacrosse just died on me completely. My grades dropped, my starting spot for my sports started to be tested by other players and I found weed to help with anxiety and sadness. 

So now it’s been a few months since I’ve cut her off completely and even tho the sadness has mostly gone there are certain nights I just stay awake and think of her even like close to a year since it’s happened, I still smoke daily now to help and I just don’t know if something is wrong with me or not ",23Nov2018,1
158,"So I have always suffered from severe social anxiety and so have never been on a date. Never had sex, never kissed someone, never hugged someone. I spent a number of my teen years isolated in my room, actively avoiding running into my family due to anxiety.
Anyway the last several years I have been doing better. Got a job, moved into my own place, made a couple of friends. Still no girlfriend though
This year, in part of overcoming my anxiety I decided I would go on holiday by myself. My dad, who lives in another country and I have never known that well, was asking that I come visit him so thats what I did.
Arriving at his house he introduces me to a girl, with the clear intention of setting me up with her. Me and the girl chat and get on, I ask her out and she agrees. Next day the date goes well, she says she can't swim so I offer to teach her and buy her a suit. She offers me a massage after and one thing leads to another and we have sex.
Now it's currently the day after and my dad had wanted to go to some parade. I ask if it's cool for me to invite the girl and he replies, super unsubtly but very casual, that she probably won't be able to as her boyfriend isn't there today to look after their son.
I question why the hell he would set me up with someone who has a boyfriend and he says he only found out about it today. I then say I will talk with the girl about it and he says not to as it is private information told to his girlfriend by the girl. He then sends me a bunch of pictures of other girls he can set me up with.
I really don't know what to do. I had already invited to girl out with us before speaking with my dad and she said it was no problem with her. She seems really sweet but she does have a child and maybe she just wants someone to help support her financially
I don't want to break it off with her, literally the day after having sex, then find out my dad had been lying. But also I don't want to get serious with a someone who just wants money from me.

Mainly just wanted to vent but any advice you have is appreciated, my head is completely f***Ed. Thanks ",23Nov2018,1
159,"Hi, I am fairly new to this community, but I am posting this to ask for advice.

I was approached by a person in college because, apparently, I was wearing a business suit. She proceeded to make small talk and all that ""get to know each other"" bs. Once she found out I am interested in business, she offered to stay in touch. At this point, I was naive as hell and though it was just people networking with like-minded people; I completely forgot about the incident after a couple days. 

After a week or so, I received a phone call from this person,  she offered to meet up so we could discuss business ideas and what not. At the meeting, I was sent a boring ass audio file to listen to and take notes so that I could do an over-the-phone interview later to see if I am qualified to proceed or not. I though I did a shitty job with the interview, but not even a second after I answered the last question, I was offered to attend a meeting where there were apparently entrepreneurs that make seven figures getting up there and talked about this vague ass business that they do (the company is Amway and BWW); they talked about common sense business stuff, and how I could make a grand a week if I find more like-minded people. I was like wtf at this point, and sensed that there is something sketchy. I proceeded to ask one of the speakers about their own company in the ""getting to know each other"" part of the meeting, the response I got was ""We have a company with our last name"" and they did not even tell me what kind of business they do.

I did some research and found bloggers that they had pretty much the same experience: they said they were in the same situation as I am, and that this Amway and BWW is an illegal pyramid scheme. I checked the Amway website, they sell all kinds of shit: I mean soap, kitchen stuff... ; hallmarks of an illegal pyramid scheme business.

I just want you guys, who probably has more experience with I am about this kind of stuff, to confirm that whether this is an illegal pyramid scheme or not.

I look forward to your response.

I appreciate every response.",23Nov2018,1

164,"I had this really close online friend. We talked and FaceTimed nearly every single day and earlier this year I bought a plane ticket and flew across the country to see her. I spent the week at her house. But things didn’t turn out as expected. The first day was exciting but then she barely interacted with me the whole time. Every time I tried to start a conversation, it’d quickly die out. When we were chillin she’d just be on her phone or computer. It kinda made me feel ignored and unwanted. When I left, we still talked but it didn’t feel the same, there was a sort of distance between us. When I told her I got a boyfriend (my first bf ever), she didn’t express happiness for me. She’d just be like “oh nice” then change the subject. I still expected to keep in frequent contact with her but she stopped talking to me altogether. Every now and then I’d shoot her a message or send her a meme that reminds me of her. She’d only talk about her life but never ask how mines going. 

A couple months later we started talking and she finally started telling me how she felt. She said when I visited her she was anxious by my stay because it was like a sensory overload for her and she missed having her own space, which I understood completely. She said when I got a boyfriend she felt abandoned and also insecure because she doesn’t have a boyfriend, and she felt like I was ahead of her in life. I assured her that just because I have a boyfriend it doesn’t mean I’m going to neglect our friendship, and she’s still just as important to me.

After this convo, we started talking regularly again and I felt close to her. But eventually that faded too. Again, it was always me reaching out to her. Asking how she’s doing. Liking/commenting on her pics on Instagram. She failed to reciprocate these with me. It’s been a couple weeks since I last message her and she hasn’t even opened it. I feel sad. I miss my friendship with her but it feels so one-sided. I feel kind of angry, in a sense. I feel like I’ve been discarded just because she was, what, jealous that I got a boyfriend? I’ve always been there for her and I feel like crap now...",23Nov2018,1

167,"Its making me depressed and lonely and it needs to stop.

There's this girl that I've been crushing on all year and I've never felt this way about a girl before. I love being around her, like when hanging out with my other friends (shes friends with them too.) and shes not there it just feels less exciting/fun.

 I've aksed her out twice (she said yes one time but cancelled the next day.) only to get told no. But I cant get over her. She acts different with me than any other guy. Shes very touchy and we get quite close most of the time, even today we were snuggling waiting for the bus. We spend hours talking outside of school usually every day. Most mornings shell ask me to come walk with her to school. Theres so many flags telling me she likes me which stops me getting over her.

Heres the confusing part, she has a boyfriend now but still acts the same around me at times she is a little less touchy but still generally the same. She invites me to things and not her boyfriend. Now not only do I feel shit for being rejected but I also feel shitty to her boyfriend. 

I dont know what to do, I cant just stop hanging with her as she is one of my closest friends. As for talking to her about be touchy we have, she knows she is touchy with me and she is fine with it she is comfortable with it. Another reason as to why im so confused. She is so comfortable with me but yet chooses to date this other guy who she feels awkward around most the time. 

I cant tell her how I feel because ill be essentially asking her out a third time and its a dick move considering she has a boyfriend. 

Look Im a mess and I need advice, it is getting me so depressed like some days ill just sit around and cry.  I don't know what to do. I need your advice.

168,"This post maybe sorta long so if you read all of it, thank you. I am a male 30. I have been with my now gf for 3 years and love her very much. I meet quite a few attractive women in my line of work and it takes quite a bit to get me to turn my head. So August of this year my company hired this woman 32. As soon as I saw her my friend who sits across from me looked at me like guys do with a nod, and my exact words were ""she is trouble and I cant mess with her"". 

Being the immature guys we are, he runs and tells our other friend and the boss. I get made fun which is fine, I take it. The joke being I'm pretty quiet and shy. But I dont introduce myself, go near her desk, avoid her like the plague and most importantly no eye contact. Then my friend gives her my number to call me one morning cause I'm running late to see where I am, and so it begins. I had this strong feeling that i cant explain when i saw her so i knew to not even tempt it by talking to her but it happened despite a month of pure avoidance. 

After the phone call, it was a text here and there, some small talk. Now I understand how feelings work, infatuated by looks with just lust sprinkled in everywhere. I knew it, so I do what always works, double down. What that means is I bust out the serious talks with a girl that I think define a person and by the end there is nothing tangible for me to hold onto and I become uninterested. MISTAAAAKKE! I wont go into detail but she is amazing and that is an understatement. It shows just being with her.

So I'm like ok this is one sided for sure. You just got to get over it and space a little bit. Then I feel like I get pulled back in. We had an event at work and her best friend came and she went to introduce me to her and the friend goes is this(my name), the guy you always talk about. She says apparently I talk about you all the time. So of course my ego takes over a little and I'm flattered, who wouldn't be. We become very close over the past month. Nothing inappropriate. Just learning about each other and what life has dealt us and we bond even more. 

Anytime we are alone it takes every fiber of my being to resist her. The tension is becoming too much for me. I cant just walk away, because she has been through a lot in her life and it would not be fair to her to be treated like that or me to act on my feelings and make a move. My biggest problem is I dont fantasize much about ""being"" with her but to actual just be with her. I dont think I'm delusional but I think we are both decent human beings and she is too good of a person to act on feelings that I think she might have and i just cant do that to my gf. 

I dont know what to do.

Feel free to ask any questions and i will answer to the best of my ability.

182,"Here is the situation. I am graduating from college with an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering in a few weeks. Based on my past internships I have been very turned off by the field by a whole, for a few reasons (monotonous everyday tasks, lack of innovation in the industry, etc). Because of this, I have been interested in entering the world of tech.

I was fortunate enough to get two job offers for after graduation. One of the positions is consulting for a well respected consulting firm and the job is based in San Francisco. The other position is unique -- it is a program that teaches you coding for 6 months and then you become a web developer for the company. This position is also at a top tier tech company near Washington DC. I now have to decide on my future and which job to accept. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my thought process. I have an interest in going into tech. This can come from starting a company or investing. I have a technical mind and know I could enjoy/handle coding but I do not know if I would get bored of it. The really cool thing about this program is they pay me teach me how to code which is such a valuable life skill these days. In consulting I think I would have more fun during the everyday job but I'm not sure I would like the lifestyle of traveling and the ""fake attitude"". In addition I would have to work long hours. The coding job would have a much better work life balance and has all the benefits of a tech company (campus, gym, it will be easy to make friends). They also pay about the same.

185,"Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit, but I don't THINK this is a medical related question.  


Anyways, I'm a college student nearing the end of my degree, majoring in Computer Science. I've always had trouble concentrating. Through my undergrad, I've always procrastinated, and then more often than not just ended up blowing off assignments that weren't important to passing my classes. I definitely lived by the ""C's get degrees"" mentality.   


Fast forward to last Spring. One day I realized that I need to grow up and be better. I began trying harder at school, and ended up getting all A's and B's last semester. My troubles concentrating seemed to almost disappear. This semester I'm working for all As. However, my classes are MUCH tougher and I'm taking a MUCH harder workload of 18 credit hours. On top of that, I taught high school marching band, which ended up being a pretty stressful season, but that ended a few weeks ago. My only other workload is a research project through my university, that I commit \~10 hours a week to.  


A few weeks ago, my troubles for focusing seemed to not only return, but much more intense than I remember them being. They seem to just be getting worse. I'll sit down with the intent to work on a project for school, look at my computer screen, and just blank. Then eventually I'll get distracted and turn my attention elsewhere.  


Here are some things I've already tried, ongoing for about a month since I started encountering this problem again: working out \~4 days a week, eating better, meditating, adopting a better sleep schedule, and cleaning my desk before I begin working.

191,"But of a backstory about me when I feel my life starting falling into pieces.

My first teacher in elementary school had a problem with me for reasons even now I don’t understand. Constantly sending me to the school’s psychologist for the dumbest reasons. That made everyone be afraid of me, remember parents telling their kids not to get close to me or they’ll probably get in trouble. Lived with that for 6 years and changed school on 7th grade.

Eventually changed schools again in middle school cuz the one I was at was full of people who didn’t like me and I didn’t like back. Teachers didn’t like me either and constantly used me as a bad example. Everything was worse on new school, dropped out, went to see shrink for a while who told me I was depressed and all he really did was make me able to live with it (which I’m not going to lie gave me a bit of peace), finished middle school online.

Started high school in a really nice school, with amazing people, but I had a lot of trouble understanding the classes and slowly started getting worse and worse grades. Everyone made fun of me because of that. Again dropped out and finished online. 

Started working with high expectations I was going to change my life and focus on learning from family business to have a very good life. Hate it completely. Even though if I keep on learning I won’t have to worry about money although it never really bought me anything that made me happy, so i don’t think much about it.

I’ve been a musician since I was 6 years old, and now I started getting very serious with it because it’s the only thing that truly gives me joy, but I’m too realistic and I understand how hard it is to make a living out of music (I have friends and family who are musicians). From one part I don’t really care if I just make enough money to get me by, but I also feel bad for my dad who has been there for me all throughout this messy life, I know he is tired, he’s worked so hard all his life, being constantly put down by others and he wants to retire within a few years and I want to give him back what he’s given me, but I also want to be happy myself.

Finished in June from Glasgow uni, I’m American. Got my MA in linguistics and am now looking to further my education. I’m only 21 so I feel like I have so many options and avenues open to me that it’s actually overwhelming me and causing me to get anxiety. 

I know I want to make a difference in the world and help people who don’t have a voice in society. Longterm I’d like to go into politics, to that effect I’m applying to public policy, public administration and international relations courses at USC, UCLA, Harvard and NYU. 

In addition to that I’m applying to film school at SC, UCLA and NYU. I feel an urge to go to the big city and make something of myself, get famous and be remembered. Paris, London, NYC, LA etc. Idk how much of this is me wanting to do it or the fact I saw Fantastic Beasts the other day and have a massive crush on Alison Sudol and that just motivated me to want to get into showbiz lol.

I do have experience with filmmaking however as I am a youtuber focusing on US/U.K. culture and travel content which usually includes cinematic B Roll. So I know my way around a camera, editing software, have an eye for scenes etc.

Success is not necessarily fame and happiness isn’t fake necessarily, I get that, but still I feel drawn to do that as if I’m meant to be something big. I’ve felt like this for years really. GRE scores are really solid and GPA is solid too so I should be a lock for the public policy courses assuming I do a good personal statement. That said I guess it’s really just a case of what I want to do in life.

I’m also applying to jobs back in the UK but obviously as a non eu person I’m at a disadvantage so that’s been going slow.

Lost my dad who was a Vietnam war vet 6 years, two weeks ago, to prostate cancer. Really could use his wisdom in situations like this, but alas, I’m having to rely on reddit since I don’t have friends. Can someone give me some advice and just talk to me?",23Nov2018,1
194,"Sorry if this isn't the right place for this, I don't know where else to put this.

So we live in generally quiet and safe suburb, there's occasionally crime but rarely anything major. However, the town is known for having dodgy people. My sister is 16 and works at a resturaunt in town, which is a 15-20 minute walk away through the suburbs. The streets are dimly lit (if that makes a difference). She finishes work anywhere between 8-9pm and then proceeds to walk home by herself.

196,"I work for my college's information security department. My job is to run the social media accounts. My boss tells me to post certain facts about cyber security and then include a relevant gif or a meme to draw attention. 

The other day, I posted a Drake meme, the one from Hotline Bling. A faculty member from a different department commented on it saying I should remove it because it is racially insensitive. The text in the photo is about password strength and there's a picture of Drake next to it. She didn't even know who Drake is, she said to ""remove the picture of the orange jacket guy because it is racially insensitive."" It absolutely isn't and I don't want to look guilty. Drake is one of the most popular artists out there and that meme is one of the most popular internet jokes.

197,"Ill try to explain/give background in somewhat chronological order

So I've known him for roughly 3 years and I'm pretty much the only ""friend"" he has left. The dude has a fairly bad reputation in school,  when I first met him he seemed fine (I don't know if it's because I was physically with him or if something changed) but now he's pretty much hated by everybody. He wasn't really the greatest person nor a humanitarian to any extent, I'd say what some people would describe as a slight asshole but yea. 

Everything seemed to have gone down hill after he went to a different school. Pretty much all his friends he had went to my school and the ones he made at his school... went to my school. He always masturbated a noticeable amount (he told me) and would sometimes deny that he has an addiction or if it's normal (sometimes the numbers he tells me vary between 1-2 times to 8). The one person that I know that was friends with me and aquantices with him kinda hates him. People at his school will simply not talk to him, and he kinda just sends himself to study because he thinks everyone at his school is outrageously stupid. He ended up throwing himself into the magnet program that seems to have way to much work even if it was a college class. 

He has pretty much no ambition, no friends, apparently no family he can trust besides his dad (he never really explained very well), and a global disposition towards the world. He doesn't like leaving the house and isn't very outgoing. He shows most of the symptoms of depression and often would say ""kill me"" or something along t hst and keeps talking about death from time to time, however knowing him and his own claims he wouldn't kill himself. I'm not exactly sure what to do with him at this point because pretty much everyone I know says to just ditch him, and he refuses to seek any sort of assistance and will continue living in such great displeasure with his life. 

Any advice because this has been troubling me for about a year now. I don't know how to turn it around or otherwise just not let him be so unhappy at pretty much everything besides self pleasuring and probably pistachio ice cream. ",23Nov2018,1
199,"I’m not very confrontational but I want to say something that will actually make a difference and have an impact. I feel as though my body language and facial expressions are probably very telling, as I get quite uncomfortable when a “joke” is made around me. So as of right now, I usually just don’t acknowledge what’s said. That way, at least they don’t get the satisfaction from me.


Today, during my family’s thanksgiving gathering, my uncle made a totally unoriginal and stereotypical joke about how black people like watermelon and chicken. 1. It’s truly just never been funny and nonsensical ... I like watermelon &amp; when I ate meat, I enjoyed chicken. I’m not black. But it’s not funny if I enjoy those things for some reason? Weird. &amp; 2. There wasn’t even anything that could’ve led to that subject. No one was even remotely on a similar subject.


Today was just an example though. I know that I’ll come across this in my everyday life and I’m not sure how to go about it, without just idly sitting by and letting it happen. And although I know I can’t control anyone, I would at least like to enlighten them or make them feel stupid. Part of this is also me just forcing myself to say something because, as uncomfortable as I am when it happens, I’m also just not very comfortable being confrontational. I feel if I had some ideas of things to say, it’d make it easier! Open to pretty much any ideas; logical, petty, whatever! Thanks ",23Nov2018,1

    To give you some back story first, I broke up with my ex around three years ago over a text (I was young and dumb, I know that breaking up this way is the worst). Since then I've tried to get on good terms with him, but he always fucked it up (he tried to date one of my close friends two days after the breakup, called me a gold digger on Facebook, told me to pretend that we're still on bad terms so that my classmates don't tease him about it and so on). 
     No drama has been going on recently, but I've noticed that my best friend has been kinda friendly with him. I understand that they have a seminar together, but he even bought her coffee. Today, I was talking to my classmates, when one of the guys jokingly said that my ex is flirting with my best friend (she's in a relationship btw). I though he just said hi to her or something, but when I came out of the classroom they we're sitting on a bench together, talking. 
     She knows how much I hate him and how he hurt me.

204,"So i have been with this group of friends for maybe around 3 years in my school and havent made any new ones since i joined this school. We met since the start of the year and i have hanged out witht them ever since. My only complaint is that, since the beginning of school, they havent been really focusing on their studies and they pretty much just talk, use their phones and sleep during class. I on the other hand, listen and do my work spending time on it. After class they would occassionally ask to copy my work which really pisses me off as i spent time doing it while they just get a free pass from me, i cant say no either because they are my only friends in school. Not only that, during lunch breaks, conversations are really stupid, talking about each other parents, talking about having s*x with each girl we see, i dont really want to join the conversation but i dont have a choice, else i would be eating alone all the time(which i fear). I have no other extra activities in school because i also fear that i cant cope with my grades too but my gpa is way higher than theirs if that matters. They dont plan to go to university but i really want to, is it too late to find a group who actually wants to do well with me? I feel as each day pass, i get dumber with them.
Im in high school btw.

TL;DR
Im in the last few months of high school and want to go to University, but my only group of friends dont have the same mentality as me which really pains me. What are my options now?

I like the taste, I like how it makes me feel but I'm also affraid that eventually it will lose its magic and that it fucks with my brain/thinking and makes me burn out, adn eventually I will be just drinking it to feel normal.

208,"First things first, it’s mine... she did the test while I was waiting outside the toilet and then showed me the positive clearblue test and it said +4 weeks.

So me and my ex were in a bad relationship, we were abusive towards eachother for 5 years and way too immature to be in a relationship. 

6 months ago we decided to really try and be in a normal relationship and stuff went really well for those 6 month. It was like a romantic honey moon period. But 4 weeks ago we both agreed that despite how good it had been, we both still needed to heal from the past relationship and couldn’t do that while being together so we broke up and went to counselling independently. In this time we stayed civil and friendly because we work for the same company. 

Yesturday she texted me and told me she was a week late so she did a pregnancy test and it showed positive +4weeks.

Now I’m in a really weird situation, I don’t believe in abortion personally for my own reasons but that’s just my vote in the matter. It’s entirely up to her. So far she has mentioned that she wants to keep it but is hoping that we get back together in the future. 

I’m worried that her keeping it on the basis of us getting back together is going to stop her from healing and potentially land her in a lot of regret.

I love her to bits and I know she loves me but right now we aren’t right for eachother because we really do need to grow up and gain independence. I’ve made it clear that I’m not willing to get back with her on the basis of “let’s make it work for the kid” or any disguised version of that. I’ve said that trying to pick up the pieces quickly and sticking them all back together is going to give us a lot of problems further down the line.

I’m in a tricky position because I obviously want to support her in every way with her pregnancy and with our child but this completely goes against what we needed for us to work as a couple. I know the child comes first now so that’s the main priority but it’s going to be impossible for us to stay in an independent and single mindset while being im there for her. So we may fall into an unhappy place.

I know we can work well together because for the 6 months before we split, it was amazing! And all we needed was time to heal from the pain our old selves created. 

We got together at 17 which is pretty young and we were both spoon fed by our parents so I think that’s why we were so immature in the beginning. 

I have no idea what to do right now or what is for the best.

210,"Long story short I dated my best friend who i'd known for like 9-10 years and i fucked things up with her. She came over to my apartment very very often for the past two years, she basically lived here. Would routinely spend 4-5 nights a week with me, sleeping in my bed, right up until the end anyway when things fell apart. 

Me and her always went out to eat. I see her in all of the things I do. All of the music I know and love, i listened to her and shared experiences with her during them. I even pushed myself to get a better paying job, like 30 miles away, so that me and her could try and get our own place. 

All I've known for the 14 months I've had that job is working my ass off in there, and thinking about her the whole time. The way we'd decorate the place, how fun it was goign to be to let her creative side go wild in our apartment (she's an artist) and watch her create a beautiful home for us. 

I've tried a number of things but there is no way to block out these intrusive thoughts. I don't listen to certain songs anymore because I can't. But there's a lot of these things that aren't so simple like my apartment. I cannot afford to move. I'm in like 6-7k USD worth of debt at the moment. I'm only 21 and don't make great money (18/hr).

Every single street I drive down in this town makes me think of her. It's been something like three or four days now sicen i got some real sleep, because this bed smells like her and makes me think of her and I can't just afford to go buy a new one. the whole fucking apartment does this. 

Does anyone have experience with detaching the thought of a person and the experiences you shared from things that have to remain in your life for the time being? I'll probably get fired soon anyway so I've been looking at a new job, but at this rate i wont even last because my mind is seriously slipping form a lack of sleep.

She had always kinda been bitchy but it was meant as a joke, but I started to take it as more serious, and about two months after the fighting started, I was saying the same stuff as she would to me (harmlessly making fun of her) and she got really triggered (that was the last time I spoke to her). A week or so later, Lisa sends me this paragraph text trying to apologize, but she broke my last straw so I just left her on read and carried on, I’ve grown to hate her a lot, but lately, part of me wants to talk to her about things, but other parts of me are saying “no fuck that bitch she doesn’t deserve another chance” and I’ve been going back and forth for 2 weeks.

 When I saw him recently, he told me it meant a lot to him to hear from me in that email and that I could keep in touch with him that way. I asked him how retirement was going and he said he was bored and didn't really know what to do with his life yet. 

Would it be socially immoral of me to send him an email that asks him if he wants to hang out and go for a walk or something? I mean, I figure that's the wrong thing to do because psychologists and clients aren't supposed to become friends, and even though he's retired, I'm assuming he wants our relationship to remain professional. 

But I love him to pieces. Not in a creepy or romantic way, don't worry. But I do get emotionally attatched to people I see all the time and I saw him for years, he's probably the only person that really knows me. To be honest, it was/still is really sad for me to lose him and I personally would just love if we could become friends. 

I really do believe it was sad for him also, but maybe not in the same way as it is for me. Like, I think it was sad for him to lose all of his clients he was seeing but probably not in a ""personal"" way.

 I think it would be a little weird at first, like the dynamic would be odd since our ""relationship"" was strictly professional before and based on me just talking to him about everything, but if he could learn to feel comfortable around me it might work out.

240,"My sister is 22, she suffers from Anxiety and has had her fair share of struggles in her life. She got her first job just under  2 years ago at a well known convenience store (I am unaware if i'm legally allowed to state the name). She is only contracted to work 12 hours a week due to mental health problems, but in the past year has been working anywhere between 15 and 25 hours a week, she is for the most part fine with this.

What she isn't fine with however is the treatment she receives from her boss, he bullies and intimidates his staff which has lead to previous staff leaving the job just because they are scared of him. Some examples of the stuff he has done includes

* Telling my sister and a fellow employee who has a stutter that they ""lack the brain power"" to work there.
* Refuses to turn on the central heating system despite temperatures dropping very low recently
* Has not given my sister a copy of her contract (I am unaware as to whether she has asked or if other members of staff have received one)
* Told my foreign girlfriend that her Norweigan ID was invalid by saying ""I'm not sure how you do things in your country but we aren't easy like that here""
* I have also witnessed him belittling staff multiple times when shopping there myself
* He does not pay staff for working after hours
* Pressurises people into working extra shifts by spam calling them.
* He was accused of underpaying a worker who he paid in cash by taking money away from him because it was ""tax""

241,"Hello, I'm rather new to asking for help from anywhere. Normally I keep stress and problems to myself, but this happens to be a little to much to bear at the moment. I apologize for the text wall, but I need to get this off my chest. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in my 3rd semester of my biology masters program, projected to graduate this upcoming May. Or rather, I would be if I didn't screw up in one of my most recent courses. My program has a policy where if a student receives a C or lower in 6 or more credit hours they will not be able to receive the graduate degree. I made the mistake my first semester in the program by taking it a little easy and ended up with a C in one course. This semester, it seems I fell back into that slump, but the mistake came from missing a due date from the syllabus. 

&amp;#x200B;

This stems entirely from my lack of passion and burnout I feel about the coursework I'm studying currently. I want to jump out into the job market and tackle the debt I've accrued through my undergraduate degree. All signs I'm feeling tell me that I want and need to get out of the program, push it off for later, something. However, my family seems dead-set on keeping me in the program.  My mother, in particular, nearly had a panic attack when I mention leaving the very first semester. This frustrates me to no end considering when she tried taking a math course, she barely passed with the help of my brother and me, ending up quitting and stating ""This is too hard for me now. ""They understand I struggle with depression and anxiety on the regular, but they expect me wholeheartedly to push through this program and make something of myself. Despite my entire being telling me to leave, everyone around me wants me to push forward and suck it up. It seems, mostly due to my mistake in my one course this semester, that I won't be able to receive the degree either way. Learning this, I felt nothing but relief and excitement that it was finally over. I'm fully aware my family wishes nothing but the best for me. 

I'm not oblivious to the fact that my mother wishes for me to succeed and push further beyond than she ever did. I know that completing the graduate work and obtaining the degree will help further me in the job market. However, all I've wanted for the past year and a half is out of this.

242,"I am only posting here, because the original post was here.  So many, many people responded; I wanted to reach the same audience and let everyone know what their advice did, and the results.  The original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9z2jff/my_brother_who_hated_religion_died_saturday_i/?utm_source=reddit-android

Some background:

In his last week of life, Brother was moved to our sister's house (who is an active nurse).  She selflessly accepted him in (despite two children and a work schedule that ICU/ER nurses have), and kept a ""baby monitor"" in the room; she was always available, cleaned him, turned him, etc... all of the needs that a dying person has, that only others whose family members are on the verge of dying can understand.

I followed the more or less general consensus, was preparing to create a coalition to protest a funeral so very much against who my brother was in life.

And in my outrage... *I* somehow forgot who my brother was in life.

I got a call from our Sis.  She wanted to check up on me, knowing how devastated I was by Brother's death.

In all of my anger, in all of my outrage... I never called the one person who had been caring for him.

Brother foresaw our mother's pain, and agreed to a Roman Catholic burial.  He did not convert as I thought I was being told, or whatever the case may have been.

Sis did not believe it either, but assured me that she made sure they were alone, and spoke to him during a lucid period to verify that he actually agreed to it.

That was the kind of man my brother was.  In his very last days, as he lay dying, he cared more about how the pain and loss after he was gone would affect others, rather than about himself.

I actually *was* the asshole, for only dwelling in my own pain and not realizing that this is exactly something Brother would do: ""sacrifice"" himself for the good of others.  Sacrifice is too strong a word, but you know what I mean.

So:  I officially thank the hundreds upon hundreds who took the time to comment, and the dozens who PM'd/DM'd me.  All of you, in all of your thoughts and beliefs on every side... again, thank you.  Brother and I always believed in hearing all sides without reservation.

You have -beyond doubt- shown that that caring towards others still holds true despite all of the hate and fingerpointing that currently seems so prevalent.

A forum of complete strangers came together.  I love you all... and thank you so very, very much.

I have on last thing to ask of you:

Do a random act of kindness for a complete stranger, just once.

I don't mean some faceless donation to charity or whatever, to some random whatever.  Instead, make a difference, if even for a moment, to some other person around you.  For no reason other than to brighten someone's day.

Give a bag to someone who is short one at a checkout stand at your local grocery.  Offer to buy someone's coffee in line behind you. Help someone to cross a street, or offer to lead someone lost somewhere in a hospital. *Something*

Because these are the kind of things my brother did every day.  And if you happened to say -or even just think to yourself- ""Because Jeremy OB Wright no longer can, let me help you""... then there could never be any better memorial for him than that.",23Nov2018,1

246,"So recently I've had feelings/a crush on this girl I work with, like legit out of nowhere. I've never had a crush on a girl before always identified as straight, and when I met her I was not attracted to her at all. 

Now that I like her though, I have become attracted to her. So it all started on this one shift, I just noticed she kept brushing by me, nothing that couldn't be accidental but it kept happening. And she also walked up to me a couple of times and just said 'I love you'. She tells me she missed me when she sees me or when I'm leaving she sometimes says she's going to miss me. 

She's also the only person I like hugging, she often just walks up to me and hugs me (this isn't unusual though, she hugs tonnes of other people too). 

Anyway, after it all started, a few things have happened which have made me kind of confused.
 
She asked 'Wait, are you straight...? Or gay..?' 

The question wasn't entirely out of the blue but it didn't fit into the conversation either. 

I said something along the lines of 'Uh yeah, I'm straight... (This is where I thought about how much I liked her, so I continued) I think, but I dunno, I mean it's 2018, anything's possible'

Then I asked her, 'why? Are you gay?'

She just smiled, shrugged and said 'its 2018, anything's possible'

For reference with the next part, she's a manager (or training to be) and the managers office in our store is quite small maybe 2x3 metres with only 2x1m of standing room, if that. 

So after this, I was rocking up early for work so I could stand in the office and talk with her, then she invited me a to come sit and eat with her while I was on break a couple of times. One of those times I ended up sitting on the stool facing her, while she stood between my knees counting cash. This is mostly because there's not a lot of space but she could have easily moved aside and counted cash from the side if she wanted to. 
Another time I ended up sitting on a crate, squashed in behind her while she sat on the stool, my legs kept brushing against her thigh but neither of said anything about it just talked about stuff. 

She also said to 'I can't really imagine you being friends with girls' (she'd asked me if I was friends with more boys or girls and I told her girls).
I'm not really sure what that means but it seemed a strange thing to say, especially seeing she is my friend - otherwise what were we?

And just the other day, we were talking to someone else we work with, about who to choose over her Ex and her best friend who both like her, and the girl I like said out of nowhere 'you should get with a girl'

Just recently I came in early for work, but I walked past her and went to talk to some others out front instead of talking to her like usual. She came out the front and said 'come talk to me'. 

I guess I'm just glad cuz that means she wants to talk to me as much as I want to talk to her.

252,"I feel really bad in retrospect but here's the story:

one of my friends recently had some boy trouble. she went on one date with a guy that was known to be really clingy and he got really upset when she told him he was making her uncomfortable and that she didn't really want to date him. She recently got together with an old flame.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night he released a rap on youtube essentially about her. her boyfriend and friends thought it was funny and lame but I got really angry about it. This guy was saying that she lied to him and led him on and I thought that her going on one date with him and calling him right after to tell him it wouldn't work out was completely justified. 

I reported the video as harrassment/bullying and briefly explained that it was painting a negative picture of my friend. We just found out that it was taken down.

According to some schoolmates, the poster cried about it. Now I feel really bad. My friend says that she ""didn't care about the video"" and ""felt guilty about rejecting him"" and that everyone that was originally laughing at him now feels bad for him. Only my friend and one other know that I was the one who reported the video, but I feel that my friend is angry at me now. I only wanted to protect her, and now I'm not sure if she thinks less of me. I feel terrible. Maybe that dude was just being dramatic. I don't know what to do. This is eating me up because I feel that if anyone else finds out that I was the one that reported the video that everyone will think I'm a massive douche. Maybe I am.

This may seem really silly but at this point I'm not sure what to do. I thought the video was a guilt trip and kind of a horrible thing to say, but everyone seems to be rallying to the side of the dude that posted it originally.

She is a really shy, quiet introvert. When I moved in, I immediately learned about her drama with her narcissistic ex who always stays at the front door too long being a douche when taking/dropping off his kid. I stupidly have gotten involved and now they're going through a custody battle, but I mostly have tried to stay away. I've supported her a lot, is what I'm trying to say, but I've also spent a huge amount of time away from her to avoid her drama and also because she makes me feel anxious with the way she naturally is...and because of my own shit I've been going through. 

I dunno, she's weird, man. she's talked about being shy and having social anxiety... And lately I've been anxious myself, having gone through a lot. But I'm mostly very relaxed around other extroverts and confident people. I'm not so good around people like this, because I have no effing clue if they want to talk or if they like me or what. They trigger me, because who knows what's lurking behind the calm, cold shy exterior... I think she's mostly warm and nice, but still. 

I invited them out this weekend and she was really excited about it. I'm sure she likes me, but could be feeling rejected I haven't been spending much time with her? Or is maybe feeling left out cos me and her kid are always laughing the house down, but her kid gets sad when she has to go back to her. She's kinda boring, with all respect to her. I want to help her out of her shell more, but also I don't want to work hard to make someone connect with me in the way I'd like. How she feels about me, I need to remember, is none of my business. 

I put SO much pressure on myself to make everyone feel comfortable and relaxed. I have felt so anxious spending time doing my own thing (which I really needed this past several months), because of how she may have felt about it. I feel even more anxious because she never takes the initiative to come to chat to me and hang out. I shouldn't have to be the one constantly approaching her... But maybe that's necessary for someone with social anxiety? Should I just continue showing up and making conversation? Because so far it's scared me off a lot and I just avoid her mostly. It's getting easier, but there's no solid consistent connection and openness from either of us.

I think I'm adding to the problem. We're both being awkward... I'm trying to change that bit by bit, but she's not trying much so maybe I should just leave it the way it is.

Is there a way for me to stop giving gifts? Or will this just upset everyone? ",23Nov2018,1
264,"Hello! 

(Sorry for spelling errors English is not my native language)

I’m (f22) currently living with my older brother (24) and my two dogs in our own place. But my mom told us she got lonely and was overwhelmed with her life and everything so I decided to move back in with her for a couple of weeks and help her a little bit. 

She has always been very kind and loving to me and my brother and because of some things that happened to me in the past she’s kind of overprotective over me. 

Fast forward to yesterday. So my mom and my best friend went to the store together(they have a strong bond) I couldn’t because of work. My mom kept talking shit about me how I‘m lazy, I’m never taking my dogs for a walk, all I do is lay around and don’t help her at all and how I talk bad about my friend all the time. None of that is true! I have no idea what got into her. Today my friend called me and told me everything she said about me and it just hurts! I’m so mad and disappointed! 

Now I kind of think she only wanted me to come back for a few weeks because she’s short on cash this month! Because I paid the majority of their bills this month and also for food and tomorrow she wants me to buy her some clothes. I wouldn’t mind any of it at all she’s my mom after all but after she said stuff like that about me I really don’t want to spend any more of my money for her! I also cook and clean but she often doesn’t even show up for dinner and rather eats at my friends house and not once have I heard a thank you.

I don’t know how to address any of this to her without starting a huge fight because I‘m afraid as soon as she comes home I‘ll explode! So please help me what should I do?

TL;DR my mom keeps talking behind my back about me even though I paid half of her bills and do everything I can for her!",23Nov2018,1
265,"Just need to get my thoughts out really.

I've been diagnosed with recurrent depression, on 60mg of Prozac a day, history of SH, recurring suicidal thoughts ect. All that good stuff. 

I've come to the realization over the last week or so that all of my problems pretty much come down to the fact that I can't be bothered. I want to do stuff, but I just .... don't. 

I'm considering dropping out of my HND in Computing (essentially the first 2 years of a degree), because I haven't learned anything, because I never do any work at home or in class really, and the assignments are too difficult, and I now don't have enough time to learn anything. I go for 2 days a week, it's the only form of structure and socialisation I have, and I know if I drop out it will just lead to me becoming a recluse in my room, because I won't learn how to program, and then apply for jobs, even though I say I will, because I. Just. Can't. Be. Bothered. If breathing wasn't automatic I would suffocate. 

If my parents kick me out, I will die. Even if I had a house and didn't need a job, I just would not do the basic things necessary to keep my body alive. Even suicide is 'too much effort'. Easier to just starve to death in bed.

 I can't even be bothered to email my GIC to see how far off I am for my first appiontment to start getting treatment for gender dysphoria. Even if I somehow got testosterone, I probably wouldn't bother to inject it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What the hell is wrong with me? I have occaional flashes of a better future, and I know how to improve myself e.g I can't learn programming if I never program, but I just don't do any of it. Even asking this on here is basically asking other people to solve my problems, because I can't be bothered. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering going back to my GP, but I don't know what they would do. I honestly think I might need to be in hospital, but that has ramifications for the future. (Dream job is cybersecurity, but I need clearance for the role I want to pursue). Again, why do I even have a 'dream job'? I don't do cybersecurity in my spare tyme, I don't do anything in my spare time, except try to while away the hours before I can go back bed. I like sleeping, it doesn't require responsibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know, I'm 20 and I feel like I'm just an immature, whiny child. I know how to solve my problems for fuck's sake, I just don't! 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm just using 'depression' as another excuse, and in reality I'm just not cut out for life. Literally. I'd kill myself if I could get the motivation. I just.... don't. Story of my life. Put it on my tombstone. ",23Nov2018,1
266,"Am I an incel? Am I an incel? What is this? Is this okay normal behavior given my tragedy?  


I want to go MGTOW, many men do this for many different reasons, let me explain why I do.  


Maybe celibacy is what I NEED?   


I'm a pretty normal dude, I think? Not the most good looking and greatest perfect personality, nor the least. I like women. Not all women. Some are evil and manipulative, some are really sweet good natured caring giving supportive cool people and good friends. I've had a very normal childhood, plenty of great friends, I've had many sexual partners and was very happy with a girlfriend or two, things sort of started to get dark for me after college when I got this job that allowed me to work from home. I basically began looking up beautiful naked women in bikinis and stuff on the internet, and jacking off. I started to get massive social anxiety. I was living in a studio, I started getting super aroused a lot. Soon it escalated to pornography - male POV stuff, nothing weird or extreme: it became an all-consuming addiction. The time I stopped going out less and less. I made excuses for not meeting up with my friends. I dodged family events with excuses I was sick and had to work long hours, etc. Eventually I realized I COULD NOT STOP. Literally. Zero. Imagine the misery and pain of that. It wasn't a cop-put, everytime I was in the store and some hottie was standing in front of me even the soft sexy sound of her feminine voice or the way she smelled or her smooth long legs I would start getting an erection, I was blushing, embarrassed, humiliated, my heart was pounding I just can't control my arousal around women. It's like every time you see and ad for some cool item online you had to have it had to HAVE TO BUY IT NOW, imagine that, you'd be broke and miserable pretty soon, yes? My brain became hyper sensitive to arousal and in neurology terms I ""eroded my prefrontal cortex grey matter"" which is for emotional regulation and impulse control. Like I would be at the grocery store and see some cutie in front of me with a skirt bend over for a second to pick up something from the bottom shelf, I got the perfect view of her buttocks and white panties and I couldn't get that image out of my head. The whole way home my heart was unintentionally pounding, I couldn't get it out of my mind, I would sit there shaking I was so excited, it's all I could think about, finally I couldn't take it anymore and I would then go look up a similar porn clip. I eventually realized I COULD NOT STOP MYSELF. It was horrible. SO HORRIBLE. This would happen again and again, I would go out, inadvertently see some honey, get turned on, couldn't get those images out of my head, go home and masturbate like crazy. I would feel horrible and sick and exhausted after. I completely went out of control. I tried to stop, I just could not. Sexual arousal destroyed my life. I started to lose my job, my health, almost studio apartment, when I almost became homeless I realized all of this was like the symptomology of an alcoholic or something, I then heard about men struggling as a Sex Addict. I immediately dived in. I couldn't help myself. This was me. These people understood. I got a 12-step sponsor and learned that I can't control this initial attraction, very little if at all. Anyways, The First Step is that we admit we are powerless and our lives went out of control to our addiction. We almost died or became insane (full of lies and false truths ie ""tomorrow I will quit"" ""just one peak / drink""), etc. Their solution is entire sobriety, entire abstinence, because our brains fire off much differently than normal people, the alcoholic takes a sip of the drink and he's off the rails again and his entire life goes to shit. This is true for me. The smallest amount of sex for me, because of my hypersexualized mind, a 5 minute peak becomes a 5 year binge, I literally CANNOT stop myself. It's agony. It's like being forcefed. I've felt suffocated by lust for so long, I just want to be free and peaceful.   


I feel like I can't focus, around women, either. I had a plan to go to the beach, come back and work on some business stuff. This BOMBSHELL hottie jogs by in red bikini, all slowed down and gorgeous, her boobs are bouncing and when she passes me her amazing sexy ass is like perfect and right near my face. I look away quickly as to not leer like a creep. But the image is burned in my mind. I start to get super uncontrollably aroused. I can't get the image out of my head. ....... next thing you know, within 15 minutes, I'm in the public bathroom on my phone looking up ""red bikini blowjob"" etc. Then I was crying and super depressed after. I feel like shit and horrible, drained and miserable. And I felt anxious and like shit, as opposed to before I didn't do that I felt healthier and stronger and happier. I was triggered, yet again.   


SO, here's where I am at today. I kicked life-draining relationship-killing pornography out of my life, I had to, it was a battle but honestly I can say I am clean and now staying sexually sober. I am becoming a better Man. Less selfish. I am spending more time with family, helping others more and genuinely caring about them, rekindling old friendships. Slowly beginning to pick up my old hobbies childhood interests and dreams again. I am starting to feel genuine happiness for the first time in years. I can't even remember the last time I picked up my guitar, a good book, or called up a sibling or grandparent. The thing is, I have ambivalence towards human sexuality now, particularly arousal. I liken it to getting tickled when you don't want to. Everywhere I go. I understand women go out in sexy revealing clothing and dress not to be  a sex object to be eye raped by men all the time but for other reasons because they are hot and don't want to wear coats in the summer or want to work on their tan at the beach etc, but when I see these beautiful women, my heart starts pounding and it's so very extremely difficult to look away from all their sexy curves and body and... god...... I went totally out of control, and I get hooked, I have this extreme aversion reaction now. It's like two magnets that just CRASH into eachother. So, I JUST WANT TO BE FREE. I didn't get a choice. Not stuck and attracted. You must keep those objects seperate for this magnetism not to occur, right? I have felt like a slave to my sexual desires, I just want a long break from the world of sex. I want to go exploring new towns, to attend concerts, have great conversations and make cool new friends, go hiking, surf the beaches, paint, read awesome novels and watch science fiction Netflix shows. I don't want to lay in bed having sex all day like a slug for the rest of my life or masturbating to pornography or obsessing in my mind about 10,000,000 sexual things, unable to think about or do anything else. It's miserable. And sexy women (triggers for me) are everywhere. Do I kill myself? :P  


Someone mentioned this sounds like Celibacy: where you have friends and everything else in life but you don't pursue romantic relationships (aka hot polarity sex) for whatever reasons.   


So, I literally can't, or find it extremely difficult to control myself around any and all sexy women, so I have to remove myself from them when they aren't fully clothed or else I get tempted, my mind fills with lust, and 5 years later I am groaning rolling around sick and exhausted and tired and controlled and miserable on a hospital bed in a blur wondering what the fuck happened and where are all my dreams and happiness and freedom and joy and peace and health and money went.... ? 

MGTOW appeals to me because I've seen the court system DESTROY good honest men's lives from cheating wives on Tinder while he was at work putting a roof over her head all day. With an extreme false sense of entitlement to what she ""deserved"" from him, just for like doing the dishes or something, and this was a genuine horrible person with issues, not a sweet girl. I get there are good and bad people, men and women alike. This was a bad one. Time goes on. Unpredictable emotions and people and previous commitments change, but the man still pays so heavily for this betrayal and can even go to jail etc. Women know this so the ones who cheat almost never tell. I like the philosophy of just finding your own independent joy and happiness in life, not having to rely on women, romance, or sexuality as a crutch to feel good and happy and pleasure or satisfaction in life, like the heroine user who feels horrible withdrawal pangs and pain and agony until he tilts his head back moaning in relief when he plunges the needle deep into his arm. I don't like the fact women can EASILY control me: Like, if she was a manipulative person I feel she could easily use her sexuality ""like a carrot on the stick"" with me, controlling me and my resources and money, toying with my emotions and brain chemistry addiction reward circuit pathways, essentially holding out sex or 'rewarding' me accordingly, when I pay for all her things or behave in a way that's beneficial only for her, right?  I get not all women are evil manipulators with malicious intentions but many I have seen and ex-relationships are and I am extremely vulnerable right now and can easily be taken advantage of. So what am I? Am I an incel? Am I just a dude who wants to find happiness in life and a celibate monk or priest or something? Is MGTOW for me? Celibacy? Do I jut need time and should date again in a few years? Do I plunge back into the hell that is the suffocating grip of sexual addiction? What?   


I just want to be free and happy, and pursue the dreams I had as a little boy (all of which were forgotten about or dropped entirely - haven't picked up my guitar in years) before this vicious addiction ever took hold of me. Sexy women walking around jiggling all over the place (intentionally or not) are NOT making this easier for me. 

  
TL;DR: I got heavily addicted to human sexuality and pornography. It destroyed my life. My prefrontal control rewired so I can't control my impulses or arousal. I suffer from hyper arousal. The tiniest thing a woman does sets me off with an erection in public, I have to leave the situations. It is so humiliating embarrassing. Since overindulging in sex destroyed my life and took away all my dreams as a child, I want to start a new path, to be free and happy and pursue my childhood dreams again, have friends, and pursue my own interests. I post about my views about how women can easily manipulate me and stuff and how I fall in love too quick and easily and people say stuff like ""Incel. This post belongs in /r/braincel"" etc.  I talk about wanting to go MGTOW and go hiking and start a farm or business and people keep throwing this Incel word at me. I'm not trying to hurt ANYONE. Yes, I am bitter and resentful I went out of control with my sexuality but that's all, and seeing a sexy woman now is frustrating to me at the least, but I just look away, I'm not like going to go on a shooting spree or anything.

269,"I have had this dilemma for I'd say max 3 years. I've split my life between two places.

I migrated to a country to finish high school/gain education, however after 6 years of living in this new country I had a really hard time making meaningful friendships and relationships (which affected my self-esteem, I had zero confidence). I missed my home country.

I've been back and forth these two places. I have friends and a boyfriend in my home country, I don't really have anyone apart from family in the country I migrated to. For the last year I've spent most of my time at my home country and only just came back to graduate in the country I migrated to (as I was finishing my course online for the last year or so).

My issue is and has been for so long, a painful realisation that I live an unstable life, where I am divided between two places, which are also very far apart from each other.

 I have opportunities to find work now that I've graduated in the country I migrated to, and I have limited opportunities for work in my home country. However, I need to gain independence and stability in my life. I need money to go to therapy and fix what has been broken since I moved away from my home.

What bums me out is that I hate my life and I don't want to hate it. I feel responsible for myself though, therefore I know I need to make a decision and the right decision is to be independent and earn my own money and stand on my own two feet and most importantly, be able to prove that to myself. Yet, that means I leave a life I have recently re-ignited and leave meaningful people and a person that I love so dearly. It's hard to explain but this is the basic gist of my dilemma.

There are many pros to staying in the country that I don't feel is my home, I can get a job and be secure. And yes, I have tried making friends, meeting people, I've been disappointed from the outcome though and have given up on trying to make friendships here. I just feel different to them, without wanting to sound condescending, I just see a clear difference,

Lastly, thinking about how sorry I feel for myself and how I still haven't figured out a solution that I am happy with after so long of thinking about this dilemma, I honestly wish I had the option to not exist. It just seems a lot simpler than having to make a decision like this one, because I feel like I'll be unhappy regardless of which place I choose to stay at. 

And I just feel like I've lost myself in the process of going back and forth and re-evaluating my life constantly and trying to push myself to get a degree to convince myself that I have made some sort of progress, but I feel like I haven't. I feel the same way I felt 3 years ago, maybe even longer than that. 

I just wanted to vent and let this out somewhere, because I know I have tired everyone around me with this issue of mine and there's so much that can be said, ultimately it's all up to me, yet I feel I don't have that strength in me to go in any direction at this point. 

What would be ideal would be to erase my mind from all this worrying and maybe be born as someone else, I don't know. Anything at this point would be ideal than living in this body and freaking out over what the best decision is. I probably have gotten to the point were fixating over this dilemma that has been so central to me has led me to hate both decisions.

I don't know. I just wanted to blurt out all this crap, I don't even know if I'm seeking advice at this point. I just wanted to share my own little crisis. ",23Nov2018,1

Hes probably 50 and hes probably married, but i can't help it he's just sooo charming.

dfjvdbvkdfnvkdnvkdnvkdnv

he caught me staring at his crotch during office hours(when i had to see him about a test which was missing a question that was worth 5 marks). He said he would give me my test in class. Btw in the office he said he can make what i did so far count out of the total of what i did, or he'll give me an extra question to do to make up for those two questions.

I made alot of eye contact with him during class. The eye contact.....makes me feel like there is this weird sexual tension btwn us. I couldnt help but stare at his butt and yes i regret it.

After class he saw me and he said he will give me 5 extra points for the question i didnt do..

keep in mind, some people FAILED the test, and he gave me 5 extra points just like that.....

another thing i forgot to add, at the end of class there were students waiting for him atleast 5, but as soon as he saw me he stopped the convo half way to talk to me....

Or is it because:

a)There were 6 questions in total(but i only had 5), i did perfect in 3 questions, and the other two i failed....but he saw that i did good in the other questions so he decided to give me 5 points( but i dont understand WHY he gave me 5 points just like that, i didnt deserve it)

b) he noticed me being awkward, staring at him, his butt and crotch and likes it..and maybe like me back :3

c) he thinks im creepy and doesnt want me to bother him anymore aka wants to get rid of me(thats why when he saw me he came up to me right away)

d) hes just a nice prof oblivious to everything i did

It just feels weird to me bc usually im attracted to guys my age, i never fell for a old guy before.

Ofc this crush is one sided he probably thinks im a weird douchebag pervert type of girl.

276,"So recently ( within the last 6 months ) I have been diagnosed with moderate depression, as well as already dealing with lifelong ADHD and childhood and early teen trauma. It wasn’t ever a problem until I went to college and I completely fucked it up and failed out the first year. I wouldn’t get up to go to class bc I’d be asleep or I would just wake up and stare at the wall or something. So, aside from that whole mess of a life, my father-figure ( you could call him that though he isn’t much of father ) has constantly reminded me of how much of a failure I am and has used every example of how everyone else in my life is doing better than me and etc. I guess what I’m asking is what do I do? I hear it from when he wakes up until he goes to sleep. And I already have enormous amounts of guilt and frustration, sadness and anxiety over everything and this ain’t helping me. Recently it’s pushed me to pick up my old habit of self harming and even that’s not helping anymore. I don’t know what to do, what do I say? How do I approach this situation?

Another problem. I am adopted and I have been living with my now family my whole life, recently my biological brother and family have reached out and tried talking to me but I have closed that chapter in my life, I have come to terms that they aren’t good people and I really don’t want to talk to them. They have never tied to react out and talk to me unless it benefits them somehow and I don’t know how to feel. Should I give them a chance or just do what I’ve been doing and just avoiding the situation bc it gives me extreme anxiety and anger when I think of them. But today, like 10 minutes ago, I got a Snapchat message from my biological brother saying he needs to see me now etc. I showed my adopted mom and her husband, my “father figure” ( who is also my biological 3 or 4 cousin ) flipped out on my saying how everyone in my family is better than me and doing better and how I’m not “a fucking princess” and how I think I’m better than them and on and on. My adopted mom tried to say something and he told her to “shut the fuck up”.

Me and one of the 3 friends I was with came back upstairs and ran into an RA. She did us a solid and let me go back into the room to make sure everything that could get me in trouble was out of the room before the police and fire showed up. They did a visual check of the room and saw the sheet I had underneath the door and smoke and obviously it smelt. After they did the visual check the RA sat down with me and told me I could get kicked out of residence halls for a week.

My parents are very strict so if I do get kicked off they're not going to let me come home so I know this is going to sound bad but should I try to lie? My friend had a juul in the room but I don't know if the cops saw it so I can say it was that and blame the smell on everyone else on my floor because everyone smokes and it always smells. Besides that I don't know what to do because I can't be homeless in college for a week and I fucked up big time so any advice would be helpful.

284,"So i just had a huge fight with my older brother. A lot of stuff was said (yelled) afterwards (by him) which really took me aback.

First, some background:

&amp;#x200B;

*Me:*

Healthy.

Very introverted and happy with it.

I was held back on my senior year of highschool cause i failed the standardized tests. (this is sort of relevant)

I am currently studying IT at university. 

My hobbies are gaming and reading, in that order.

&amp;#x200B;

*My brother:*

**Very** overweight.

1 year older than me, extrovert.

Entered uni. to a CS major but stopped after the first year, never really went back.

Just recently enrolled in a technical school for Hospitality after a 2 year hiatus.

Hobbies include fuck all outside the fact that he plays League of Legends (afaik that's the only thing he does consistently-ish)

Oh and we own one desktop.

&amp;#x200B;

The instigator of the fight:

We live in a third world country. By virtue of that our ISPs are trash and we get very low bandwidth. Used to be we would go Round Robin style with each of us playing our separate online game. This got stressful for me so i quit my games and focused more on single player stuff, this relieved my stresss while having the added benefit of not locking down the internet. My brother however still plays LoL. You can already tell how petty this is right?

&amp;#x200B;

**WALL OF TEXT**

So i come home from my midterms to find my bro walking around in his boxer shorts strutting his belly around. I put my things away then went into the kitchen to grab some lunch. When i did that i noticed my bro had fired up his game and was getting ready to play. Told him not to since i had just gotten home and he replies that *he* had just woken up. If there was logic there it flew over my head. So i decide to work on my project in the mean time and that got him going. Apparently  when i load up a user manual for a protocol or even a wikipedia page his precious ping takes a hit. Tried explaining to him but he just keeps asking me to shut it off (""asking""). What am i supposed to do, twidle my thumbs while he plays? i kept working on my thing. Fast forward 30 odd minutes and he's yelling so loud the whole building complex could probably hear him and then some. I mock him for getting mad at a game (as i usually do in these situations)  next thing you know he grabs one of his plastic chairs and hits me with it. Smashes my coffee mug into pieces which litter the ground with the coffee in tow. I get my laptop out of the way and grab the chair from him. Smack him back with it and give him a push with my leg as he tries to get closer. I guess he slipped on the coffee cause next thing i knew he was belly up on the floor. The violence dies off slowly after that but he keeps yelling very very loudly for a good 10 minutes all while i'm cleaning up the mess. Here are some bullet points from that rant:

\-I am a spawn of the devil sent to torment him.

\-I don't care one bit about him (may be true now)

here he referenced one time where he had a similar fit and he then passed out on the living room floor where he stayed for about 10 minutes until i walked back into the room. 

\-When i was held back in high school he claims to have paid for my year after that. (our family isn't too well off but we aren't **that** poor). I offered him the money and he said he didn't want it.

\-I was somehow the reason he broke up with some bimbo he met online who was way above his league (this happened like 2 years ago, no i have never spoken to the bimbo)

\-He claimed that i only got my last job because he pulled some strings. Let me tell you that is a blatant lie and those strings are waaaay above his reach and scope. Trying to undermine my job merit like that was low imo.

After all that he basically said i was dead to him and not to speak to him again.

&amp;#x200B;

By now you're probably thinking we're a bunch of idiots, fighting over stuff like this. I mean honestly that's true.

I could have just gone and taken a nap or something but i wanted to do something with my time rather than letting him effectively strip me of any enjoyment for the remainder of the day.

Without internet access i can't make any progress on any of my projects and i certainly wouldn't have any source of entertainment. This is obviously a flaw of mine and it's basically the reason i made a throwaway account for this; because i know i'll be mocked for it.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the question: 

Should i have backed down and just spent my day being bored instead of contesting this bandwidth issue?

I feel like this could all be solved if he'd just quit his game and play literally any one of the hundreds of offline titles i've amassed over the years. I've been pushing him on that but he just doesn't budge, should i push it more?

His health was brought up during the whole thing and he basically blamed me for his stress which apparently translates to him stress-eating according to him. How the hell am i supposed to bring this topic up to him? Our family has a history of heart conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all Reddit, was i in the wrong here?

288,"TL;DR I recently started work at a company that pays $11/hr as ~24 hr a week part time. Work itself is not bad but the +1 hr commute is driving me nuts. While the employer talks of hiring full time after january, I need to think a bit.

I met an owner of a distributor company after his friend of a mutual hobby referred me to him. I was not looking for a job when I went to meet him. After chatting for a while about many things including how his company had some serious issues that set him back significantly, he asked if I would work with him. Eleven dollars an hour is way too little, but I just agreed because I certainly did not have better options. We agreed that I would work around my another part time job. 

He mentioned a couple of times how he hopes to have me around long term and after January (when a big expo that may very well bring back the former clients and new ones) he would want to hire full time. I obviously am not betting on it as it is just a word so far.

Work is a combination of some office stuff, stock management, graphics design, shipping and so on. Not my usual field, but it is not too bad. I am learning and he is aware of it. It is almost like an internship. At the very least it doesn't make me stare at a clock and wanna shoot myself. The employer is pretty nice and caring, which I'm sure is more than what anyone can say. 

Here comes the 'but'. The commute is one hour one way, when there is no traffic. While some people will challenge me to the unsolicited misery olympic, saying their commutes are at least double mine, but mine is just too much for me. I can move closer, but it seems rather stupid to move in my current job situation.

I am not too bothered by it just yet, as I went in fully aware, but $11/hr is peanuts. It certainly helps me out from living paycheck to paycheck so I will see what offer I get on January.

Also having worked there for a month, I saw that there is not much sales so far. The employer said he sold ~60k a month when the business was good, but it was about 4k that month. I believe it is hopeful, but so far there is no gurantee that the expo will bring in that much money.

It eats up so much of my free time. I hate how I wake up, leave the house, come back from work around 7~9 and go sleep because I am too exhausted to do anything else, then repeat next day. So far I had very little luck in my videographer gig so I was not all that busy, but I may have a lead regarding home/building surveillance business from my relative who runs construction and realty firm around january. Even if it gets me nowhere, I do not like how I have zero life outside working that job and another.

So after the expo, maybe I get offered way more as 11/hr is not that hard to beat, but still not close to what I hope. Maybe I get a good offer, at the cost of any free time to venture into other businesses. Ideally I wanna work little less days like three days a week, with better pay. But for all I can tell at this point, it is not likely.

So now I am just worried about negotiating for better pay and hours, as I may have to just walk out if I deem it without good future prospect. I'd appreciate your insights.",23Nov2018,1
289,"Hello, my name is James, I’m 13, and I’m in a downward spiral. 

My grades have slowly began slipping since 5th grade, but it was just one B-, nothing to be worried about. Recently, I just got my final trimester one test in social studies and I got my first C. If my grades keep gradually declining, I won’t be able to go to a good Highschool, a good college, and I’ll end up in a job I hate. I got this grade because instead of studying and doing homework, I chose short term satisfaction in the form of video games. The solution seems easy, just stop playing games, do my damn homework and raise my grades, but I can’t seem to pull myself away from the screen. Is there any method, to help keep me from doing anything besides gaming?

291,"Hello, so.. As the title suggests, my very good friend's boyfriend sent me a message in which he asked me to meet and have a conversation about my friend. He also said to please keep it a secret. I haven't replied yet because I was busy and just got home. Anyway, I don't know what to do. My friend is a very private person and she keeps her issues to herself. Recently she opened up about having some doubts about their future together since they have different plans. They have been together for about 10 years. As far as I know, they are still in a relationship. She told me things that worry her as well as some other things. I told her she should be open and discuss it with him and I believe they talked about it (I'm not sure, as I already said - she rarely talks about her issues and likes to keep it positive). Now, it's possible they haven't really discussed all because she said he can be hard to talk to, like judgy and impulsive. 
Also, when we talked, I could see that she loves him but I also got a strong 'vibe' that it's gonna end soon because of too much difference. 

Now about that text, I don't feel comfortable going behind my friend's back. I know her boyfriend is a very good and nice guy and I feel bad if they have issues but I don't feel like it's my place to interfere. If he asked me something, I couldn't just tell him what she told me, it has to come from her. What should I do. He even called me but I haven't answered because I didn't see the call. I don't even want to answer it because I hate phone talks, especially if they are awkward. Thanks :)",23Nov2018,1
292,"As a guy I've been trying to keep up this ""strong man"" persona and pretend that this doesn't bother me. But it's making me feel miserable, so I've finally decided to be honest with myself and open up. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started working as a barista in central London a while back. Never done anything like this before, so the minute I was told I got the position, I looked up a shit-ton of youtube tutorials on how to make coffee and espresso shots. When I wasn't doing that, I was writing down everything I needed to know about the espresso machines I'd be working with. I took notes on techniques and steam wands used to froth the milk -- did all of this every single day for over a week. By the time my first few days of training came round, I was pretty confident and eager to get started.

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a little bit of time to get used to the machines as well as the routine of cleaning in-between servings, but I really felt like I was progressing. Early afternoon, a little into my second day of training, the manager of our store pulls me aside for a chat along with his assistant manager at a nearby table. I honestly didn't even see it coming:

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm going to be 100% honest with you. First of all, standing behind the bar is a big no-no. When you're not making anything you should be sweeping the floor, emptying the bins, etc. I shouldn't have to tell you myself. I'm not a man of many words, so when I tell you to restock the fridge or snacks I expect you to just do it straight away. No questions asked. So a lot of things need to change - *drastically*. You have one week to get yourself sorted. If you don't, nice knowing you, here's your pay. If you're not 100% sure about this, tell me now and we'll let you go.""

&amp;#x200B;

I was absolutely gobsmacked. There were a few other things he said, but none of it was good. Even the assistant manager sitting next to him looked a little uncomfortable. I still can't wrap my head around it; I always did everything I was told to do, asking questions where I wasn't sure. Always arrived 10 mins early, and I never *ever* went on my phone. Yes I was a little slow at times, but what the hell do you expect from someone who's been there for just over a day? It's a fairly big shop and I don't know exactly where everything is. I'd only started properly learning to make the 5 - 6 pages of drinks they serve! Anyway, I was far too shocked to say any of this, so instead I put on a brave face, suck it up and get back to making drinks. But I was fuming when I had time to process what had just happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward nearly a week later and by this point I'd had enough. The high-stress environment, grumpy customers, along with the manager's constant nitpicking and harsh criticism had chipped away at my confidence. I told the manager how badly I was struggling and how much it was affecting my mental health. I have severe depression and some anxiety mixed in there, which I've had for 9 years now. Been on medication since March, but I've still got scars on my left hand. My manager was a little taken aback and said that he'd let me go if I was sure. That day was the closest I'd ever come to jumping in front of a train on my way back home.

&amp;#x200B;

Two months pass and I'm trying to pick myself up, job searching again. But every time I'm about to hit ""send"" on an application, I get flashbacks of my boss tearing me a new one for every mistake I made. I can't psyche myself up for anything anymore, and I'm stuck in this self-destructive cycle. I'm not sure how to break out of it. I keep telling myself not to take it personally, that it was him and not me. A member of staff working at the train station told me that the coffee shop has an unusually high turnover of workers, so perhaps this is more of a management issue. But I've lost faith in myself and my ability to do anything right.

293,"Dislaimer: i am sorry if my english is Bad, it isnt my first language :)

So it kind of built itself up since 2 years. We are now 18 years old and first dated in school a few times. 

I fucked up and she was mad at me for about a year and I was acctually too stupid to understand why but since about half a year we are really close again. 

In this year where she was mad at me about 10 guys (no joke) tried approching her, it was nö wonder because she was the most beautiful and kind girl in school and im not biased. So understandably i was super happy about being cool again and meeting her nearly everyday for about a month. 

We graduated and went on different trips around the world for a few months and texted everyday and I missed her like hell.

When we got back we where just as cool as before and there was a lot of drama with some of the guys who approched her from before. I realised that i was the only guy who spent time with her for lonher than a few weeks because all the other where discarded as stupid or weird as hell, i acctually felt kind of proud about that and I couldnt believe my luck that a girl like her apparantly liked me enough to spend a lot of time with. I'm not shy or socially awkward and kind of handsome (at least my mum says so) but i Never had luck with girls.

Well, about 2 weeks ago she told me that i should prepare for something. I didnt know what, It was a ""big surprise"" and it turned out to be a trip to the City i lived in for 14 years and hadnt been to for 4 years with her and a very food friend of us.
We all slept in one room, she and I where in one bed and in the second night we kissed for the first time and it was propably the best night of my life. Sneaky as hell because of our friend but also kind of romantic. Next morning we woke up earlier and it ""went on"" until our friend woke up.

After that we hadnt really had time to talk because of the other guy an we didnt know what to do. She only told me that she didnt know that i felt about her like that (i thought it was obvious), that she felt the same and that she needed time. The problem is that im not sure about how i feel about her, i love spending time with her and I think about her a lot but i aint got an idea about love. I am pretty sure she thinks more or less the same. She also told me that she thought the feelings would be clear-cut and I realised that she lived in a ""Disney World"" where everything is clear as soon as you kiss for the first time. She reallised that that thats not the case and I think i made some unnecessary comments about that. 

After the longest time that we hadnt had contact since we started being cool again i am waiting for her to get in touch and tell me what the hell is going on but im scared that she wont and I will be just as clueless as before for a long time.

296,"Christmas isn’t a big deal to my family, religiously, since both my parents stopped going to church years ago and I am not christian. But my mom always raised me with the idea that “everyone should have at least one thing to unwrap!” So even if that meant a pair of socks wrapped in tissue paper... you had something to unwrap. I think it’s a great sentiment, and I love Christmas because I love showering my friends and family with gifts. I love gifting so much that I take up some extra shifts (just a few) and join Secret Santas. It’s my favourite time of year!

So this year there seems to be a widespread problem. *Nobody* knows what to get for my boyfriend. Despite loving to give, I’m terrible at picking out gifts. People know, now, to give me a list of things they’d like, and the surprise is which item or area I pick from. Otherwise... they get my attention as a gift because I don’t know what else to do. Maybe some cookies. After a month my boyfriend gave me a very short list of things he’d appreciate this Christmas other than my love and attention, and I shared the list with people who also didn’t know what to do for him. The understanding was “we all get him one thing from the list.” 

His uncle gave him 80% of that list yesterday at thanksgiving without even knowing about it, and my mom bought him the rest. Then she wanted to know what else he likes so she can surprise him. So now I have no clue what to get my partner of almost 4 years, *again*. And people come to me asking what to get him. 

My mother, though, doesn’t even have a list. She’s really happy with what she has (generally), and the things she’d like are things I can’t give her (better health, a new house that’s less $$$, higher pay, a vacation, etc). My half-sister has been texting me that she doesn’t know what to get for mom. Her boyfriend is clueless too. I don’t know what to get her either! I don’t think my dad knows, even. But she does *so much* for her family and we all want to give her something special. And while I’m on the topic, I don’t know what to get for my *sister* either, because we live 2,000 miles from each other and have an 8 year age gap. What do 30 year olds like? According to her, all she wants is sleep. All I know is we both like anime, especially sailor moon. But she has all the sailor moon merch she has room for... 

Im not really stressed about any of this, I’m just kind of... “welp.” How do you go about gifting to someone who doesn’t want anything? Just some useless knick knack that’ll clutter their home? Just nothing? I want to give them all at least one physical thing to unwrap, and if all they want otherwise is me there with them, of course I’ll be there. I’m just shit at giving gifts.

My opinion: none of us are in a situation where the pup would have the rehabilitative needs met required of the pup - abused early on in life by her first owner. We have a pitbull as well and like any dog physical exercise a solid routine and socialization helps, but he can still be a handful.

The brother and parents are adamant about keeping her, but it seems the parents will end up caring for her. The father is always travelling for work and the mother has a medical condition that would make it very dangerous for her as the pup is not leash trained. They also live overseas so helping them when we can isn't an option.

TLDR: keeping the pup would be of detriment to both the pup and the caregivers. How can I speak to them to help them understand? What are our options for a good home? (It's a no kill city)

304,"I (23M) found out 2 days ago that my SO (23F) made out with another guy while drunk at school about a month ago. 

We are together for 4 years, about to be 5 in a couple of months. I found out the news through a mutual friend at the bar the night before Thanksgiving. It was the first time I have heard of the encounter, it happened about a month ago. I approached her and confronted her about it right then and there. She owned up to it and said she regretted it and the whole nine yards. She claims she didn’t tell me in fear of losing me. I talked to her best friend and she said my GF called her immediately afterwards crying saying she messed up, regretted it, etc. 

To give a little insight, we are 2 hours apart when she is back at school, and our communication has started to slip up here and there and the distance was hard. It was something we never had to go through and everything. I admit when I say I flirted with people during this time as I missed our physical connection, but I never did anything sexual or kissed anybody else.

The rest of the night she was basically following me around crying and begging me to not break up with her and that she was sorry. I left the bar and ever since I just can’t get the situation off of my mind. 

Yesterday was the first Thanksgiving I haven’t seen her since we started dating. It was all I could think about, and just shit on my mood the entire day. Today I agreed to meet up with her shortly to talk about everything later on.

My problem is, my first initial reaction is that I don’t want to break up, but I’m just nervous things won’t be the same anymore.

Now I'm sitting at the station having missed my train by half an hour because the bus was late and we have traffic. So I've ordered my THIRD ticket now for £17 and have to wait almost an hour.

I can only get motivated by a deadline and catching up to it, I normally make it, but with a lack of quality of work. I know I'm capable of doing the work, and doing the other things.

Keep in mind I live in a small town and almost everyone knows eachother. I met him at a party and he seemed like a decent guy, we had a few drinks and smoked some weed. He gave me a little weed and told me he wpuld have the money in two days or so. I live in Canada so weed is legal. Basically I haven't got the money yet and I am getting fed up with it. He has legal issues and is going to court so I can use that against him. I am tempted to tell everyonr he is a fucking thief and that will ruin his reputation in this small town. Any advice?

312,"I'm 18M, my friend is 18F.
She wants to go to University after high school, and so do I, because it would open many paths and possibilities to work.

I don't really have a preference about the course, as long as it's not human sciences or pure electronics (it's fine if it contains stuff about electronics, but just electronics wouldn't be okay).

Me and that friend share kinda the same interests (she doesn't like human sciences at the point of going at universities to study them, same for electronics).

I was thinking, since she wants to go on studying and I'm interested in an university graduation, why not do so with a friend?

Should I just tell her I want to study too but don't care about the course, as long as I'm with a friend?",23Nov2018,1

315,"My(23m) Aunt(51yo) has custody of my 6 cousins, 4 boys (17, 14, 13, 12yo) and 2 girls (both 12yo). the 13 and one of the 12yo girls are Her sons kids and the other 4 is her daughters kids. The kid I'm focusing on the most is one of the 12yo girls who is related to the 13yo boy, i'm going to call her J to make things easy. 

&amp;#x200B;

J is a very clingy and attention seeking little girl, especially with me, we have a more brother/sister relationship because i'm one of the only people who will listen to and understand her feelings. When J is trying to get attention she try to be funny and to be honest most the time she is pretty funny. But my Aunt punishes her for trying to get attention. Will yell at her to stop and threaten to spank her.

 A few days ago I was at their house and she was trying to get attention from me so she was acting silly along with the 12yo boy and other girl. My aunt get a belt and spanks only J while the other 2 are doing the exact same thing. J said something along the way of ""why am I the only one getting hit"". That just caused my aunt to spank her again, for back talking accidentally hitting her with the buckle of the belt this time. J started crying and screamed ""You hit me with the buckle, Why are they not getting spanked"" and then the 12yo boy loudly said ""hahahaha"" then kicked her hard right in the back knocking her off the bed, J stands up screams ""you butthole!"" and then gets spanked again with the belt for screaming. J then stomps off to the bathroom to cry. I went and talked to her and she was upset because she says ""I am the only one she ever hits, the others can do what ever they want and she does nothing"".  I talked my Aunt into letting J spend the night at my place, that whole night she wasn't her usual upbeat funny self, she was very upset. We talked and she said that she feels like no one loves her and that she wished she wasn't alive. I ensured her that I loved her very much and held her while she cried her self to sleep. 

Then i called my Aunt and tried to talk to her about how it is abusive behavior that she only does to this one kid.  Aunt sees it as Disciplining her kids and she did nothing wrong. During this whole event tho none of the other kids involved got spanked or even in trouble or told to stop. All the focus of discipline was on J. Even when the boy kicked her in the back off the bed, J was the one who got in trouble. 

Now J is a kind of a difficult kid, she doesn't like being told no and has one hell of an attitude, but she also a very nice little girl that really wants nothing but to be shown love. I have a kinda soft spot for J because me and her are a lot alike when I was her age and it is kinda obvious that I have a soft spot for her. So when I bring stuff like this up to my family they just say ""oh you are just playing favorites, she is okay you don't need to baby her"". But my aunt is A LOT harder on J then any of the other 5 kids. 

I thought about calling CPS on my Aunt for this event but I don't want my cousin to be taken out of our family. What should I do to get my aunt to understand this kinda stuff is abuse? Also get her to understand how J is feeling, I don't want her to start self harming or worse. My family has a history of completely ignoring emotions and just brushing any kind of emotional issues under a rug and ignore them.",23Nov2018,1

Our sex life got better this summer but when she started to study and I working again after our vacation my sex drive started to get much lower.   


She hasnt had much problem with it but it has gotten worse. Its almost been two weeks without sex. Two sundays ago we had sex,she got an orgasm which she usually gets but then she didnt want to finish me off. Said she was tired which I also was. I felt hurt. We have talked about it but afterwards nothing has happened. She says she is tired all the time or stressed. I can be honest and say I have felt tempted to watch porn but havent, just masturbated. What worries me is that I am starting to feel like I dont care. I dont feel this strong sexual desire towards her. I love her and love being with her but I dont know what has happened to my sexual desire.  


I sometimes read posts about sexual stuff here and I get turned on if I think about some slutty girl doing something kinky but not when I think about my wife doing these things.

318,"

My cousin, “Jane”, lived with her mom until  she was 24, at which point her mom remarried. Jane didn’t have a steady job or enough money to get her own place and didn’t want to live with her mom and stepdad. My grandparents felt bad for her situation so they offered her to live with them for a little while until she had enough money to live on her own. Thinking that she’s young and would want to be an independent adult, they didn’t expect her to stay more than a few months. 7 years later... she still lives there. 

She has never paid rent, utilities, or for groceries. My grandparents survive on social security, which is barely enough for them, let alone another adult. They are in poor health and have difficulty with daily tasks. They require a lot of help -something that Jane doesn’t provide. Not only does she not clean or cook, but she expects meals from my grandma everyday and will leave her dishes on the table when she’s done for my grandma to clean up. She disrespects them and often ignores them when they try to have a conversation with her. 

In small ways, they have expressed to some family members how much of a burden she is, but would never have the heart to kick her out. Now 30, she has had a decent paying job for over a year now. We assume that she would have enough money saved to live on her own, but can’t be certain because she shops constantly. Jane’s mom is blind to the burden that Jane is, but the rest of our family (7 siblings, their spouses and kids) see how awful she is and want her out, but we feel the only people in the position to do so are my grandparents or Jane’s mom. None of them seem likely to ever say anything. The rest of us fear strained relationships if we were to speak up. 

Has anybody dealt with a similar situation? How would you handle this?

TL;DR: My cousin has lived with and leached off of my grandparents for 7 years and has been a major burden to them. My whole family wants her to move out, but we don’t know how to make it happen. ",23Nov2018,1

322,"so ill begin by getting the story out of the way.

To begin I'm a 20-year-old male and this story happened about two years ago. I went to an ex's birthday party. I got there late and the party was a little died down and it was only me, her friend, a guy she met on Tinder and of course my ex. She was decently drunk and started walking around with only a coat on unzipped (no bra or t-shirt). at some points even without the coat. I go uncomfortable for a while and kept mentioning that she should put something on, as I kept giving her a shirt. I slept there that night and I could hear her having sex with her tinder hookup. this got my mind racing to sex and as a hot-blooded young male, I felt the need to jerk off, I jerked off I think 2 or 3 times that night,( it was weird cause I could still kinda hear them so afterward I felt gross). the morning after she quickly got rid of the guy and it ended up just being me and her. she told me that her actual plan was to sleep with me that night, cause me and her never had sex when we were in a relationship. this led me to end up telling her about how I could her them and that made me have to jerk off (not them obviously). this lead to the idea of me and her having sex, which, of course, ending up happening(i ate her out for about 10-20 secs, it didn't dawn on me till afterward what id done and have since been disgusted with the thought) . afterwards, I felt really slimy and gross, one for the jacking off and two for getting "" sloppy seconds"" in a way. Not to insult her but it was a thought I couldn't avoid. I've only told a few friends about the event and only one about how I jacked off and had sloppy seconds. 

it's something that haunts me from now and then and is one of my secrets I tell to few friends. looking back id take it all back but I know I can't change the past. it's not a kind of lifestyle I want any part in. And its something that affects how i view myself a lot of the time and has tainted the thought of sex for me.

324,"Hello all, I’m in need of some guidance. 

Recently, my parents have been arguing a lot more and it is really taking a toll on me. Thankfully, their fights are never physical but I know that they are both experiencing mental abuse from living this way. I am planning to graduate and move out at the end of 2019, and I thought I could just deal with it til then but I don’t think that I can anymore. I believe that the main reason for their problems is that my mom is not mentally healthy. She displays many signs of mental illness and I have considered telling her she needs to see a therapist/psychiatrist but I worry that she will take it the wrong way and it will just make her worse. I am now considering giving them the ultimatum that if they don’t begin marriage counseling I’m going to move out at the beginning of next year. But again, my mom is very fragile and has frequent anxiety attacks, and I fear that saying this will only make her and my parents relationship   worse. My mom is very attached to me and my brother and I think she may just lose it if I threaten to move out. However, that is not just an ultimatum, I truly do feel that if the situation doesn’t begin to improve, I need to remove myself from this environment for the sake of my own mental health. I’m 20 years old and I could get more jobs and find somewhere to live close to campus for my last year if need be, even though that would be  really hard for me. What I’m looking for on this subreddit is advice on whether that ultimatum will be helpful or detrimental? Should I attempt to talk to my mom about her mental health before I ask them to try to fix their marriage? Would it be wrong to move out and leave my 17 year old brother to handle living with them on his own?

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I was 7 years old, I wanted three things in my life. I wanted a wife to share my life with, a role where I could help people, and to not worry about money. Fast forward 20 years and I have all 3 goals accomplished, and yet some nights I just lay in bed wondering about the future and the feelings of failure start to creep in.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me get into a bit more detail. I just recently completed my master degree in science and completed all extra objectives two months ago to acquire certification and begin looking for jobs in Canada. Over the course of my schooling I met and fell in love with a woman who completes my life in a way no one else could, and every day I find myself loving her even more, and she reciprocates. I also worked various jobs, utilized various extracurricular activities to solidify my wealth, and have been able to purchase a house with virtually no mortgage and enough jingle in my jeans to afford anything if I ever need it. I am also the most frugal person any of my friends know, spending roughly 100-150 bucks a month, including clothes and food. This is because I am terrified of running out of money, which had the great side effect of being able to save so much. I do not let this affect anyone but myself, and never tell my wife what she can or can not spend, as I know she is financially responsible and we both joke openly about how frugal I am.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is where the feeling of failure begins to creep in. During my graduate degree, I completed my thesis and finished all my work... and then lost everything. Due to legal reasons regarding my supervisor and their conduct, all of my research was taken from me and I was moved to another supervisor and required to start over again. My degree took an extra 2 years, with me falling into various degrees of depression that my wife always brought me out of. At the end, I had lost all of the job opportunities that had been waiting for me and the two best references I had were now no longer able to provide me a reference, due to the aforementioned legal reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to two months ago, I finish everything and can now start applying for jobs. Everyone is so happy for me, waiting for this moment with bated breath and celebrating the accomplishment. For me? It felt like nothing. University had always been easy for me, and I fully understand how big of an accomplishment this was but... all I cared about was the next step, getting a job. Unfortunately, that part hasn't happened. Every clinic I've called doesn't use my specialty or is already full. Every government job I've applied to has ended without even a call for an interview. Most jobs I'm either overqualified for or do not have the work experience (I have 3 years of experience and they require roughly 4-5 and normally in very specific areas).

&amp;#x200B;

For the past year, I have been playing house husband and doing some tutoring for students on the side, continuing to fulfill my role in life of being able to help those who are struggling. My wife is absolutely thrilled, she has someone who cooks, cleans, takes care of the finances, and helps her out with anything she needs. She even said that if I never got a job, she would be happy for me to remain as a house husband. However, I look at my old classmates either in the back-half of their Ph.D or already in the working field and I feel like I have somehow failed. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a year of inactivity due to finishing up schoolwork and the past months of no job opportunities, I decided I needed to do something, so I got a job as a server at a restaurant right beside my house. That has been amazing! I get to make children laugh, make sure my patrons have a good time, and help out co-workers who are struggling. I even make very good money to boot. Yet just last night, I sat in bed and couldn't sleep, wondering if I would never get a job in my actual field. If I was going to go year after year, as a server, until eventually all of my education and previous experience faded away and was irrelevant due to the sheer amount of time. I still apply for relevant jobs each week, and the same outcome occurs every time. I have called the companies to ask how I can strengthen my resume and the responses are always ""Oh, we just hired someone internally"" or ""we were looking for someone with a specialty in X area"". In the end, everyone I know is supportive, I get playful ribbing from friends and some interesting looks from co-workers when they find out my background. Yet I know everyone believes in me, respects me, and wants the best for me. However, in the back of my mind, the question is always there... ""Do they look at me and wonder where all my potential went? Do they see me as the person who wasted his life in school and has nothing to show for it?""

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal? I've heard it said that it can take a long time to get a job after graduating, but I've also heard the opposite. Am I just looking at this entirely wrong? I appreciate any and all advice, thank you! 

&amp;#x200B;

So TL;DR, my life is great. I have no legitimate financial concerns, a supportive and amazing wife, and I get to do what I always wanted which is helping people and making people smile. Yet I feel like a failure as everything I have done for the past 8 years with my education seems to be wasted.",23Nov2018,1

a lot of the time, my mind goes into this trance where i imagine a situation where other people see me as special/unique, and start talking out loud accordingly. i have no awareness of the transition, it happens unconsciously. at some point during the trance, i suddenly slip out and become 'normal' again. I'd say I spend 80% of my spare thinking time in this trance-state.

335,"My S.O. and I have lived in our apartment complex for almost 3 years. The complex is owned by a company that has several properties throughout the state. We love the complex, the employees, and the lifelong friends we’ve met here. Our apartment mostly noise-proof to outside noises unless a something is extremely loud. We’ve always had incredibly respectful neighbors until maybe about 6 months ago.

Our apartment door and our neighbor’s door are perpendicular to each other, maybe a foot apart at the end of a hallway. We briefly met the neighbors when they moved in - A middle-aged woman (around 40-45) and her 3 teenage kids (between about 14-20 I think). Let’s call the middle-aged woman “Jane.” Since the first day, they’ve slammed their door so loud that it shakes our entire apartment. It was a slight annoyance at first - sometimes people make mistakes and they accidentally push the door too hard or the wind sucks the door closed. We’ve all been there. But this door slamming happens at a minimum 5 times a day (if we’re lucky) to maybe about 30 times a day. They don’t discriminate about the time of day they do it. Three AM? Slam. Midnight? Slam. Six AM? Slam.

We’re all about solving issues before it gets to the office so it doesn’t have to be escalated to an official complaint. We’ve asked a few of the family members in passing to close the door softer. Our neighbor across the hall has asked them to do this as well. After talking with Jane and her family with no difference, our neighbor submitted a complaint to the management office. Jane confronted us a few days later, assuming we submitted the complaint, scolding us for going to the office and not talking to her first. 

I’m not sure if the neighbors on the floor below have submitted complaints, but they’ve talked to us about the noise issue (including stomping around at all hours) as well.

Over the months that followed, we’ve left a note on her door and have submitted a few complaints to the office. We’ve never submitted a complaint about a neighbor in the 2 years prior, noise or otherwise. The office made excuses for Jane, saying that she has kids and the wind just kicks the door closed. We all have “wind” and manage to close the door just fine. Nothing has gotten better. We’ve seen the eldest son literally slam the door as he looked us in the eye as we walked down the hallway to our apartment.

Our dog has some severe spinal issues that occasionally leaves him incapacitated for several days at a time. Yesterday the door slamming was so crazy that it kept startling him, causing him pain. I got frustrated and decided to knock on their door to talk to Jane. I’m not a person who enjoys confrontation by any means, but I wanted to ask her to close her door a little quieter in person. She became incredibly defensive, talking about wind again, asking how she supposed to close the door if she has groceries in her hand, and how I must have something on my door that allows it to close softly. After calmly explaining that I hold the door until it reaches the door frame to make sure it closes quietly, I could tell that nothing was getting through and decided to end the conversation. Not two minutes had gone by once I got back into our apartment that I heard more door slams.

We’re not sure what to do at this point. Door slamming seems so trivial, but after hearing it every day, dozens of times a day, we are fed up. We’re generally patient people but our complex doesn’t seem to be taking our complaints or our neighbors’ complaints seriously. Talking to Jane seems to make the situation worse and we don’t care to have bad relations with our neighbors, especially a direct neighbor. We also don’t prefer to move, so that wouldn’t be our first choice but may have to do so if it doesn’t improve.

tl;dr Neighbor’s door slamming is getting excessive and all surrounding neighbors are fed up. Apartment complex management isn’t taking complaints seriously and neighbor gets defensive when the topic is brought up.",23Nov2018,1

But she does not love him anymore and in fact I have been sleeping with her a few times. One of the problem is that I think she's in love with me now, we broke up but she called me and told me she still had feelings and that she loved me. She has been spreading a rumor about john hitting her, and I think it's a lie, he did not, he would never do that to her.

At this point it has become very tense between me and john, we are not the best friend we used to be, he is sad and I feel guilty, we now just see each other from time to time to throw the ball at each other. Moreover his fiancee's mother just had some results of a test back and she definitely has breast cancer and I feel like she needs me even more than before...

I don't know what to do ? His birthday is soon and I'm really scared he might learn about my relation with his fiancee and call me a chicken, hit me or even kill himself, who knows? But in the other hand I feel guilty.

And yesterday, I took my ballz and I did talk to her in front if her friends. At first I wanted to give her some hand at programming, being in the second year of the course, and her the first year... At the end I proposed my help to the group, they were pretty cool with me. But dang I did manage to talk directly to her, face to face. Gosh it felt so good.

And today, I manage to give to her my phone number. She seems to be happy about it. I said to her that I proposed my help but totaly forgot a way to talk to me. She said that she will sent to me a message.

Honeslty, I don't really care if she will respond or not. The most important thing is, I was able to talk and do something for a girl I find cool and cute. It's a major improvement for me. I have big social anxiety. I'm so happy.

But now it's been like some hours... she didn't sent to me a message. I don't have big faith into this potential relationship but if I could so something with her, well, I'll go for it. What do you think ?",23Nov2018,1
338,"Recently me and my wife had a fight over some family issues. But before that around couple of weeks ago I stop drinking I use to drink almost every weekend for last 6 months.

I am not an alcoholic but had a tendency to drink beer/scotch out of convenience. I have noticed few things since I have stopped drinking - I listen more to people now, speak less. I have started going to gym, I feel more comfortable and healthy.

But in all these days I haven’t had sex. For a week, I didn’t miss it, but for last 2-3 days I am not able to understand this weird feeling I have every night. I have a strange sensation in my leg it’s like I should go out and run and I feel bit aggressive in my thoughts. 

It’s like I don’t love my wife anymore and I think I understand her much better now. I have been married for last 10 yrs and have 2 kids. ",23Nov2018,1

I came home from the gym today and noticed some weird spray painted markings in front of my house, I also noticed it infront of my neighbours house but noone else on our cul de sac had it and there are around 6 houses on the drive, there were also some other boxes with arrows a little further up the drive and at the turning at the top of it. I thought they might be one of those thief markings but it didn't match anything I found on the Internet and we haven't received any notification of maintenance/work that needs doing in our area. It appeared sometime today and my mom remembers hearing a van at some point and that it might've had a flashing light but noone remembers the sound of spray painting.

Anybody seen these before?

340,I'm going to get straight to the point. I think I might be gay. This question isn't about whether or not the people around me will be supportive cause I know they will. This question is more directed around if I'm sure I am. for example some times I think about the possibility of me being with a boy but then the majority of the time I don't see that happening at all and can't bear the idea.

341,"For about 2 years now I have been dealing with and have been diagnosed with a mental illness, namely schizophrenia. I hear voices, and, when triggered, I go from normal, me mode, to demon mode, where I get violent, and lately, a couple of months ago, and it took a break, and then the past couple of days, the violence has been getting worse. So, now, I was living with my Mom and Dad yesterday, but they were talking about, and now it seems inevitable, to move out and go to a group home/apartment. I want to live near my family, but if I had to move out, I would prefer living alone in an apartment and talking to my family 1, 2, 3 times a day so I don’t go crazy being alone. Maybe I will find a girlfriend, and then wife, whom I can live with and split the costs, also, as a possible option. Any ideas on what to do about this? ",23Nov2018,1
342,"I’ve been living on my own for a year now. My Dad is a little upset that I don’t contact him often. He tells me to call him more. The problem is I don’t have the desire to contact him or have a relationship with him. My dad is one of the reasons why I really wanted to get a place of my own.

My father is a toxic person. He has a very short temper, he gets angry easily, he’s controlling, judgmental, rude, negative, etc. Growing up, he would blow up at me for the littlest things. Also, we have nothing in common. All the things he likes, I don’t have an interest in and vice versa. We also have much different worldviews. He’s narrow-minded when it comes to race, gender, and sexuality. I’m someone who is more open-minded.

My Dad is what you would call a bigot. He was never really fond of me having friends outside of my race or dating outside of my race and he doesn’t like that I support gay rights. All these reasons are why I choose to keep a distance from him.

He seems disgruntled that I contact my mother frequently. My mother is almost the complete opposite of my Dad. She’s very loving, warm, open-minded, etc. My mother has always been very supportive of everything I did. My father always tried to force his interests and ideals on me instead of supporting me in my own interests. I talk to my mother all the time because I WANT to talk to her. When I spend time with my mother, it’s like a breath of fresh air. I’m completely comfortable, I feel like I can be myself, and I feel safe around her.

My father, on the other hand, I don’t have the desire to do that with him because talking to him and being around him is like walking on eggshells. I’m never fully comfortable around my Dad. When I contact my Dad, I feel like I'm being forced to. My Dad’s vibe is very negative and being around him is draining. He’s making me feel guilty for not contacting him, but I don’t know what to do. It’s hard for me to force myself to talk to someone that I don’t really like or have the desire to speak to.

My Dad wants to be closer with me. I love my Dad, but I don’t really like him for all the reasons I detailed. He’s closer with my brother than he is with me, because my brother and my father have more in common and their personalities are kind of similar. I gravitate to my mother. I don’t know how to respectfully tell him that I don’t want to be close with him.

**tl;dr: My Dad makes me feel guilty for not contacting him, but there are reasons why I choose not to. My father is a very toxic person. I'm trying to distance myself from him, but the more I try to do that the more he pesters me on not contacting him. I don't know how to respectfully tell him I don't want to be close to him.**",23Nov2018,1
343,"So a few things first. 

1. Mobile. Tried formatting, it might not have worked :p
2. The friendship isn't actually mine. It's between my best friend and their friend.
3. Last year they had a friend betray them and got seriously hurt. While and before it happened they were talking to me about it. I don't want them hurt again and I will cut anyone who even thinks about it.


So, I already know that they aren't too attached. Well, actually MY FRIEND (MF) isn't attached to THEIR FRIEND (TF). TF is however very clingy, possessive and needy and MF agrees with that statement. TF gets mad when MF doesn't respond to them within a certain time, yet gets upset if MF responds to others when they're with TF. ""Others"" means people like me or MFs family. It's a double standard that TF takes too far. TF also messages a large amount with multiple messages at once. MFs response however is to ignore some of the points and respond in only a couple of lines.

How am I sure there's an issue and this isn't a normal way for MF to treat friends you ask? Well... 
A) MF has complained about this multiple times to me so I'm not making it up and I know I'm not being deceived. We fucking trust each and are very close. MF also doesn't complain about their other friends, apart from that one that eventually betrayed them and we talk shit about on a regular basis. 
B) I have also been to visit MF in their hometown three times, including being there right now. I was in their home a few hours ago and went with them to visit their granny! MF even said that TF is not the kind of person they would want to have over, whereas I have been there many times and even stayed there for four consecutive nights. TF has asked three times to come and been shut down.

Now I have tried to tell MF to call TF on the bullshit, but the bullshit keeps repeating. The reason I ask this now is because this is the third time TF has said they want to go to MFs town again and MF is trying to make TF get the hint that they don't want to invite them over or do any activities with them because TF has an unpredictable personality (MFs words) and loves drinking (MF doesn't). Again for comparison, before I left today MF asked what we're doing tommorow.

I have already tried encouraging it getting fixed, but it either doesn't work or it might even lead TF to get even more clingy. Quite frankly there are so many factors that make me question how their friendship even works, they've only known each other a year. It's possible it's because MF doesn't have many friends (5 ish in total, 0 from within 500 miles of their home apart from me for the next month because we're doing a seasonal job together).

So.. How can I help and what can I say without jeapordising my own relationship in the process? ",23Nov2018,1
344,"I cannot defend myself against passive aggressive people(my friends)who mock me, humiliate me from time to time if I do or say something they may not like. I cannot say no or easily reject their requests and put great effort to please them because if I cannot do please them, they will hurt me with their words. I always avoid situations in which myself can face the risk of being mocked. For example, I have to speak very carefully and not offend them. They intervene my life and I cannot be who I want to be. The funny thing is that they do not do that intentionally. They do not even know what is going on in the background. I lack self-esteem/confidence/awareness/trust(whatever fits in this list). I am so sensitive and what really bothers me is not if they are right or not about their statements about me, what bothers me is the fact that I cannot do/say something back to defend myself. I am afraid of people so sickly. They can turn my life into shit if I do not comply with them. They will hurt my relationship, make me break up my gf. They will murder me perhaps. What should I do? I cannot live this way. I am about to get mental soon. Therapy/Counseling or doctors/medications are no available to me. I am on my own on this. I really could make use of some advices or anything. I am sick tired of living my life by rules put by others. I suffered a lot when I was young. I was socially poorly developed boy who struggles a lot in human relationships. I am not autistic or has not been diagnosed with any sendrome. Desparation is so strong for me and is induced in every cell of me. The way I deal with these kind of people is to try to do as they say and let time pass so that I might be free of them in future(maybe they move to some other place that is away from me). However, this torture does not seem to end before it mutilates me emotinally. Root of the problem traces back to my father who was perfectionist, emotionally abusive in some ways even though he did not intend it. I could not defend myself against my father then and now the situation holds for other people. I wish I was not that emotional/sensitive. My mind does everything to tackle me.",23Nov2018,1
345,"Our friendship: We've been very good friends for about five years. We met through work and mutual friends and have maintained a close connection despite him changing jobs and moving to a different area. 

In emergencies I've helped with cash and other things when he needed it and never grilled him about it. I've also never tried to appear judgemental as to his shortcomings so I feel there is a sincere element of trust in our friendship. 

His alcoholism: He's always been a party animal, and I've always enjoyed this about our friendship. Going out with him always involves lots of booze, flirting with women, and on occasion doing drugs. However, he's shown to have less and less control in these situations over time, with him needing to go out more than wanting to and with his binges often being the cause for serious problems. 

His drinking has cost him job opportunities due to tardiness and unreliability from being hungover too often. He's gotten seriously injured in drunken fights and DUIs. 

His mental well being: During the time I've known him he's lost multiple members of his immediate family. He's recently attempted suicide as a result of depression and is currently seeing a therapist. 

He is an intelligent, socially charming, earnest and we'll read person and, in my opinion, worth saving.  

I believe his drinking is habitual, harmful and out of control. I believe that as he has just left his 20s, he hasn't acknowledged that his drinking is compulsive and self destructive. I don't think he has the fortitude to slow down, I think he needs to consider a future without alcohol. 

I'm seeking advice as to how to approach this with him and what I should and shouldn't do from anyone who may have had experience with this before.

347,"I have been on my university's Tae Kwon Do team since my freshman year and I am now a senior getting ready for my final semester. Tae Kwon Do has been an incredibly important part of my college experience and I have made amazing, strong friendships through it. I love and feel accepted by my teammates

However, last semester my instructor, without saying anything to us, moved to Maryland for Medical School. She's in her mid thirties and just finished her PhD. We were all really confused. She flies in like twice a month to run practice, but the rest of the time practice is run by these two alumns who in my opinion are really incompetent. Practice is so boring now and we can't spar(fight) because my coach says it's too dangerous without her there to supervise. I just did so shit at my last tournament, literally got destroyed, and I know it's because our practices suck. I'm not getting any better, at all, in fact I actually feel like I'm getting worse. I literally hate the stupid drills we do doing practice and find myself watching the clock the entire time.

To make matters worse, my two friends and I have become aware that my coach is in a sexual relationship with my teammate and it's fucking creepy and wrong for a number of reasons besides the thirteen year age gap. My coach literally has god-like status on my team, so the power dynamic is super weird, and my friend just revealed to me that my coach singled her out and tried to get with her a few months ago. Also, despite my teammate texting my coach things like ""I love you so so much,"" I saw my coach flirting with other girls at the tournament we had last weekend and at a restaurant a month ago. So basically the amazing image I had of her is ruined in my mind. I feel like something that was a such a core, amazing part of college for me is ruined. 

So what I can't decide is whether or not to just stick this out for one more semester or to just quit. I feel creeped out by my coach, I hate going to practice, so I'm seriously only it for the social aspect. I feel like I'm paying hundreds of dollars and spending 15 hours+ of my week just to have friends.

It was fine when they were younger and he could be a “big monster” and pick them up and swing them around and tickle them, but now that they are a little older it is different.

A bit of background:

I live about 30 mins out of town with my wife and pets. I don't have many friends, and those that I do have I rarely see. I invite people often, but hardly anything comes out of it. I've never really minded, but I also don't want to lead a stagnant life.

We had a new hire at work and we have a lot in common. He also lives in a rural area with his wife, plus musical and technical interests in common. But are also different enough that he's very interesting to me. We talk at lunch and on breaks. Great to talk to and easy going. I would love to be his friend and be able to invite him over or ask to hang out.

My friend group is going through a tumultuous time right now. I have a friend, let’s call him Tyler, who has been depressed for a while. It hasn’t been awful until recently. I have another friend, let’s call him Kyle, who also has been depressed for a while. I used to talk to Kyle a lot, but after a while I realized he wasn’t that great of a friend, and every time I talked to him recently he has just made me feel worse about myself, so I stopped talking to him.

Kyle and another friend have been in a feud for a while, and this other friend tells Tyler what he thinks about Kyle, and Tyler tells Kyle. Kyle attempts suicide, but Tyler convinces him out of it.

Kyle is still as depressed but not as suicidal, and he brings this up to me and the other friend recently. He basically tells the other friend that his suicide attempt was his fault, and tells me that since I stopped talking to him that he thought I sided with this other friend. 

Anyways, Kyle and Tyler start talking to each other, and I feel like Kyle is as putting down and mean to Tyler as he was to me, but it’s worse for Tyler because he has depression right now, and over the past few weeks I feel as if he has gotten suicidal.

Kyle tells Tyler that I hate him, and tells him that he is ugly and dumb, i find when I stole Tyler’s phone at a party.

I want to tell Tyler that Kyle isn’t a good influence on him right now, and he should stop talking to him, but I know if I do this, Tyler will tell Kyle, and Kyle will attempt suicide again.

352,"I will say that I have poor perception when it comes to judging people due to the fact that I grew up in a family that wasn't exactly healthy, and I'm sure I carry some of that around me.   


I can't help but notice a pattern in past friendship and relationship where if I brought up a problem to them for the first time ever about a behavior that they were doing that kind of hurt me, no matter how calm or nicely or rationally I'm telling them, they will react terribly to it.  And again, it's the first time I ever brought anything up to them, too.  


Instead of apologizing, they'd act as if I was the one in the wrong for pointing it out, show zero empathy, and zero willingness to listen or work through it.  Cherry on top of the cake is that they'd tell me to go find other friends, or throw back into my face that I don't have a lot of friends or people to begin with to hurt me even more after the fact.  Which of course makes me feel like this is all my problem and all my fault and that I'm the defective one.  


It's easy to say, ""Well forget them.  Their loss!"" BUt it doesn't feel that way, because while they get to dump me by the way side and go about their merry way enjoying time with their other friends, I'm left alone wondering to myself how it ended up like that.  Is it unreasonable for me to expect other people to listen when I say they hurt me and then proceed to hurt me even more after the fact?  Am I doing something wrong?  Or are these people cruel? 

I'm just kind of sick of feeling like I get the short end of the stick in a lot of human relation.  Like it always feels uneven and like I'm suppose to be the one to accept their behaviors no matter how hurtful.

356,"This is my first ever big post like this on Reddit so if there is any format issues I apologize in advance.

My life became a downward spiral as soon as I reached my teens, my first year of comprehensive school was ok for the most part except for a few teasing here and there, but as I went into my second year and reached 13 my life became a downward spiral.

At the start of the year my anxiety reached extreme levels for no apparent reason and it continued like from October to around February. In may of that year my parents relationship also started a downward spiral and by around April I was basically depressed, hated everyone around me and was extremely aggressive  despite being very weak physically, until one day I was escorted out of class after having a mental  breakdown and was referred to counseling which did help a lot.

In the next school year I gained a new interest in psychology and finally had an idea of where I wanted to go in life, and although it wasn't perfect my life improved UNTIL...

At the start of this year (2018 for all of you time travellers out there) my parents separated and I moved house to what can be considered a bad neighborhood, although it's all my mother could afford, I despised the house at first and whilst I admit it has its falts it isn't as bad I initially thought.

Throughout the next few months I decided to gain some new hobbys, these new hobbys being shortwave radio and focusing in my YouTube channel which has a small but nice community.

At the start of this new year I decided to attempt to get a girlfriend, after many failed attempts which all resulted in anxiety attacks to ask this girl out someone else told her for me even though I specifically told them not to.

I explained to her that I did like her and I should have told her sooner, unfortunately she didn't feel the same way I did about her. Sometimes I try to speak to her to be nice but she usually just flat out ignores me, which Is sad because I always thought she wasn't like that. If I'm single for ever I guess it is what it is.

For charity our school let us wear non-uniform so long as we brought in £1 to raise money. On this day I decided to wear what I normally wear, which is cheno trousers, a turtleneck sweater, and  a overcoat, in this day I received so much abuse 
For dressing ""dapper"" that at the end of the day my depression returned, maybe because this girl I liked laughed at me for dressing like this(not out loud or directly at me but you could tell she was hiding back laughter) 

Recently I've been feeling really down about all of this and I was wondering if there was anything that I should know that can help me deal with all this, I understand some people might think I'm and incel because if this but I can assure you I'm not, any advice in dealing with my parents divorce and how to get through the school year would be swell.

361,"My neighbor is an old gentleman, possibly with dementia of some sort. His house is rather decrepit looking, needs lots of work. All the plants are overgrown, the roof looks like it may cave in.

The first year I lived here I noticed he would walk around to the side of his house and mess around with something for a couple minutes, then go back inside. It was mystery. Finally, one day as he was walking around the house I happened to be outside and greeted him. I asked him what he had been up to and he explained that the water line in the house had burst open, so he comes outside to turn the water on for a couple minutes and fills buckets inside the house. 

I'm a licensed general contractor, with lots of experience with old run down houses with water leaks. I told him so and offered to fix it for him, I said I have all the parts in the garage and it wouldn't take me that long. He thanked me and said something about how he'll get around to it. 

After this exchange, I wrote hime a letter offering to clean up his yard, cut the bushes back from the house, and to fix his water leak problem. I attached it to his front door and it was gone the next day, so I know he got it. 

It's been over a year since then. He no longer goes around the house and turns on the water, but his back yard is starting to fill up with water jugs from the store.

362,"So, I live in Canada, I'm in high school, tenth grade, and I'm fifteen years old. Today I was chilling by my locker when a trio of students walked over and stood in the hallway. I heard them talking about being on drugs and that they were going to be getting and doing some later tonight. Unfortunately I didn't catch the first part, because right after it I hit the record button on my phone and recorded the rest of their conversation, something about people they might be getting it from and what they would do to avoid their parents noticing (they were 3 9th graders, probably all 14 years old). They were also talking about there being alcohol (the drinking age in Canada is 18) and screwing guys. I recorded the whole thing and now I'm wondering if I should send it to a higher up person or keep it to myself. They did see me standing there on my phone by my locker the whole time and I don't know if they realized what was happening but I fear for my own safety since they were a couple of popular students who seem to know many people. What should I do?

TL;DR I have audio evidence of students who were apparently on drugs and were inviting another student to come do some later tonight and I want to know if I should tell someone",23Nov2018,1

Hiya, this is my last resort as I really don't know what to do, the landlord/inspector/council are ignorant and won't help us with anything anymore.

So basically I live in a shared (emergency) accommodation and have been here 7 months, one of my housemates boyfriend has recently beat her up (badly) and I had a very scary encounter with him, 
im 19 and he's about 46 and he was saying about kissing me (even after telling him I'm a lesbian and very against him even being near me about 6 times)  and asking me to fake an affair with him ect, I've been terrified since.   
So she's let him back in her life as far as I know and now I'm terrified to be home or to leave my room incase I see him.. I don't want to return home incase I get hurt.  I told my housemate about what he's said to me and I think he knows I've told (he asked me specifically not to tell her what he said), she reassured me he will never be back but now he is.. 
I don't want it to be too late before I can get him to stay away (like if he physically hurts me ect)

Is this a police matter?  Who can I tell?,  the council won't listen to me any more, the landlord is pretty much negligent to this house and it's residents...  
I don't know what to do apart from isolate myself atm, I dont wanna eat, I don't wanna use the bathroom (which is right next to the room he's in with her), just incase I see him. he doesn't live here either he just stays with my housemate and wanders downstairs whenever he feels like it...

Any help or reassurance would be much appreciated, thankyou! ",23Nov2018,1
368,"What's the point of telling a joke if not to make others laugh? The problem is the more subtle it is, the deeper you have to dig the funnier it is. Like anyone else I have a need to make people laugh but the more funnier it is the hard it is to get it but you have to get it to find it funny. The struggle is funny up to a point but not if they never get it on their own. That realization sweeping across their face and flush of joy having transcended beyond an unknown. I increasingly interlace truisms with humor making jokes by simply presenting reality and its absurdities in a very calm manner. Sometimes I become a mere conduit for the amusing aspects of reality around us but other people just don't seem to get it. As in it's funny because it's true. As in reality for anyone finding themselves real isn't what anyone finding themselves real and finding reality real would want it to be.

Your advice, how can I exercise a more communicable sense of humor without being so obscure yet not resorting to the opposite extreme trope of it being funny because it's so obvious or easy (hiding in plain sight)?",23Nov2018,1

371,"I'm currently looking for a place to live on very short notice. I found an ad on Craigslist that seemed kinda sketchy for a fully furnished 1br apartment for $1000/mo, utilities included. I was skeptical but the deal was so good, I figured sending a text couldn't hurt. The owner responded with an email with pretty awful grammar, giving me a lengthy story about how he was moving out of the apartment because of his mother's medical issues, and how the cheap rent is to cover her medical expenses. 

I responded asking for us to set a date to check out the apartment, and he responded that since he was out of town and not likely to come back for a while, that he would send the keys to me via mail. He also said he was going to draft a lease contract for us and that he needed the following information:

\-Full name

\-Current Address

\-Date of birth and age

\-Telephone number

\-Occupation

\-Move in date

\-Scanned copy of any form of ID (passport, license, id card, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

None of the above information is exactly private, and he has not asked for payment or any financial information (bank account numbers, check, or anything). I am about to respond that I will not sign a lease before checking out the apartment, but can I still send the information he's requesting? Is it enough to steal my identity?

372,"I was coming back from 2 hours of shopping with my mom. She was driving, it was already really dark and it was raining a lot, and I was giving her directions because she wasn't used to drive with poor luminosity. Just in case, I had my phone in my hand and I was following the directions through Google Maps. From far away, we heard a weird noise, but we werent sure because the music was on. But then, like 200 meters after, we slowed down because we saw a car which was overturned, and behind, there was another vehicle, and two young men were trying to break the windows of the overtuned car, while yelling at the driver who was unconscious.

The accident happened on the side of big roundabout, where cars tend to go fast, because it's linked to a highway. So when my mom asked if we should stop, I said no, because i was scared we would create another accident by parking another car on the side. 

But I immediatly called the emergencies, and that's when I really freaked out. I don't why, but my mind went blank, I was so stressed. I was lucky I had my phone in my hand with Google Maps so I gave to the woman who answered the exact position of the accident (which is not exactly in the middle of nowhere, but there isnt really anything to help you know where it is, like there's no shops or little roads that help indicate where it is, it's just next to a highway, that's it). I gave her the information about the two people who were trying to help, and I heard her talking briefly with someone else to who she asked to ""collect more info"", so I supposed I wasnt the only one calling. She said there was a unit not too far away from the accident and she was sending them right away. Then, she told me she had all the info she needed and that I could end the call.

But during the way to home, I was still blank. And the worst part is that I'm still kinda haunted by that picture I have in my mind of these two guys, who were screaming at the car, and the other one who was trying to break the windows with a kind of metal stick to save the driver who was upside down, uncouscious, and the front part of his car was crashed. There's so much to process for me when it all happened in such a short amount of time.

I'll never know if it ended well or badly. There's so many things going on in my mind, and I just don't know what to do with that. My mom said to me she was proud of my reaction and how I handled things, that I was quick enough and it happened like 30 seconds before we drove next to the car, so the emergencies probably took care of it fast enough to send people to help and save the driver. But the fact that I'll never know if it's true is disturbing by itself. It's not like when you're watching a movie and you're frustrated because the ending is corny or vague. This is real life, and this is so fragile.

373,"Hey guys, i want to ask for advice. I (19M) got bullied and Sexual harassment for years.exactly from first grade till 8th grade. It stopped because i changed my school since we moved to another place. It seems like a joke right? No it is not. I know it’s been a long time and i should’ve been revived and it shouldn’t mean to me anything, but unfortunately it still as bad as when it happened. I still remember the names of the guys who were harasssing me. I was getting bullied every day from my classmates (some of them) and i couldn’t tell anyone. Especially my family, why? Because they would laugh on me like i’m a coward. And they did!!
It happend actually, the school manager once called my dad in forth grade because a guy in the fifth grade bullied me and broke my glasses. He didn’t support me, just laughed all the way back to home and told my sisters, mother and brother about it too. Until now they don’t take me as a man even though i’m 19 y.o Maybe i was coward, but come on .. i was like 10 years old maybe if they supported me during that period it couldn’t affect my life that bad. What do you mean be affecting your life... yes i mean what i said. Getting bullied and  Sexual harassment made me an introvert, porn addicted, skinny coward, nerd and lonely person with no single friend and hasn’t been with a girl sorry i mean who can’t even talk with a girl. I hate going out because i feel like i’m a soft person. My classmates in high school invited me several times to parties and i couldn’t go and i couldn’t explain why. . I used to tell them i hate going out with them because they are boring and in a result they started hating me. So What’s the good sides of me ? I got high grades on school and now i’m studying medicine. Any other things ? F**k no. I’m suffering from alopecia areata and i can’t tell my dermatologist the reason why i got this disease. I spend my weekends playing ps4. and watching series continuously or fapping all the time on different pixels Aka pornstars ._. . I can’t defend myself when i get insulted publicly they insult me and i don’t say a simple word only when i go home i fap again to get rid of bad feelings. i can’t make a complete dialogue with strangers even with the shop assistant. I have no confidence on my self. I also don’t trust anybody and i love nobody. I have no soical media accounts because my relatives always Praises my cousins and compare them with me ( as i’m a bad example). I’m lost, depressed hopeless person.

I even cut off myself from other family because my one brother is a functioning alcoholic and the other had been my most recent supoort group until I changed my holiday plans a month ago and he started saying I owe him (after I already thank and offer any help eith their home). 

I just isolate myself even more, apply to more workplaces to get out sooner, apply for public housing and food stamps/disability, and have stopped talking/seeing my brother because I always feel this masssive negativity over me.

377,"I could definitely use some advice. 

So, I currently live next door to my father, who is disabled. We pretty much only have each other to rely on. We live in a small town, with virtually nothing to do except go to Walmart, or a crappy movie theatre. There is no reliable transportation system - buses or cabs or anything. Neither one of us have a vehicle, so that is something that's made it hard to live here. I've wanted to move out of our current apartment building for some time now, as the landlord drags his feet on repairing anything, the neighbors are constantly loud - yelling and slamming doors, etc. I'm miserable here. I've tried to find housing locally, but thanks to a stupid law here, 99% of the housing doesn't allow pets. (I have 1 cat and even that isn't allowed in most places)

Recently, I visited the closest big city to here, which is an hour away, and I fell in love. There was actually transportation available. There was actually places to go and things to do. There is housing and all of them allow pets. I thought a lot about it, and the more I did I realized that this new city would be perfect for both of us. So, I talked to my father, and we discussed moving into a house together to share expenses. 

Cut to today, when he tells me that he thinks that ***this*** area might actually be better for him, because it's right down the street from his doctor, the hospital, and the pharmacy. That if we moved, there would be no guarantee we could find something with a perfect location as this is. 

So, essentially, I'm being faced with the choice of 1. move where I would be happier, or 2. stay here so that my father isn't left alone and I can be here when he needs me to help him in some way. It's not like we would never see each other again, but i would no longer be close enough to invite him to dinner on a whim, or go to his place if he needed me. What would you guys do? ",23Nov2018,1

My little sister's friend is giving her a 6 week old female pitbull that she planned on giving to me because my parents won't let her have a pet. Like I said, I live 4 hours away from them in a relatively big house with a big backyard. My housemates have an older female dog and I know that nobody would mind if I brought a puppy in. My father argues that I won't have time to take care of a puppy, that they require too much care and that I will need to spend too much money on vaccines, food, mouth guard etc. because pitbulls ""grow up to be very territorial and aggressive."" He also says that in a couple of months it will get big and harder for me to handle (I'm 5'0 and weigh a little over 100lbs). He says that if the dog was to bite anybody I would get in trouble, that because she's a female, I will have issues when other dogs impregnate her (which I explained can't happen bc the house is gated and I live in a pretty nice neighborhood where there are no stray dogs walking around).

I want to have a dog because I feel like it will help me keep a steady schedule. I know it sounds kind of weird to think of that but I don't care about myself as much as other people care about themselves. I often forget to eat and if it wasn't for school I probably would stay in bed all day everyday. I often sign up for events and stuff because it gives me a reason to do things. I like the feeling of being responsible for someone else and I feel like keeping this puppy will give me that.

The first few times it happened, i brushed it off, thinking i was overthinking it but the more she says, the more i think she’s just racist. 

She heavily dislikes the only black girl in our class (she had done nothing wrong she minds her own business so no reason to hate) 

In our school, there is a lot of black people and she makes comments on their style a lot (i get she can dislike it but it’s always just them! They’re minding their own business)

She makes comments that it’s « really dark around here »

She took a weird offense because a muslim lady was wearing a hat over her hijab. Angrily saying that she looked like an idiot.  Like it’s cold of course she’s gonna wear a hat??

So she doesn’t say literally « oh i hate immigrants » or « black people steal » but it’s alway vague and it makes me uncomfortable.

They treat each other awfully, their relationship works something like this:

She is really needy and he deliberately ignores her out of spite, she then escalates the conversation to ""you don't care about me"" he goes to ""I care but I don't want to be there for you right now and if you don't like it that's who I am, don't try to change me"". She then spirals into ""you are never there for me"" leading frequently to a tantrum, a fiercely brake up, and then a miraculous reconciliation.

I sort of imagine that was the nature of their relationship, until recently she called me saying she just tried to kill herself, we talk it out, she showed me some conversations they had, it went something like what I described before, only that it solved the mystery of how they get back together every time, she says she has no one else and she will commit suicide if she can't be with him. Only this time he replayed ""go do it, hope you go through this time""

My group of friends has always talk about the fact that they are awful to each other, and we even talk about it to them individually, they always tell us that deep down they love each other and is worth it. But now that I know their real situation, I don't  really know what to do.

I thought it wasn't my business to intervene in the relationship but I see know its clear abuse from both sides, I don't want to have anything to do with any of them, but I fear that if I cut them off, specially her, she may go through with it. They are back together again by the way and we are in our mid-twenties, to put some extra context

400,"I love painting, I love drawing and creating.. recently I have been working on commissions much more because a lot of people are getting into my work (an online community). It has opened a lot of doors for me and I’ve been selling my work online, however my mom doesn’t take this seriously. 

She thinks that when I’m not doing physical work (cleaning, yard work, etc.) that I’m not doing ANY work. Art work takes time and effort. It’s mentally and sometimes as physically fatiguing as physical work. Don’t get me wrong, I have a part time job but when I’m home I want to work on my art. 

I do things around the house, I clean when I need to, I do their wash (I don’t expect them to do my wash, I do it myself), dishes and generally try to help out as needed. But as soon as I want to work on my craft... my mom has a fit. 

It’s as if she thinks I’m wasting my time or just playing around watching movies or something. But I’m actually doing work... it’s just different to the work she’s accustomed to.

I don’t know if she’ll ever understand that my art work is in fact WORK. Similar to when she goes on about “working” in her garden, or “working on cleaning out the cupboards”. My work isn’t any less work than hers is. It infuriates me that she thinks I’m just screwing around when I’m actually doing work.

Has anyone else had a similar problem? I really want to make her realize this isn’t games to me.. but I’m afraid she’ll always be under the impression that I’m just “playing at a hobby”.",23Nov2018,1

402,"Hi,

Recently in the town where I live, there was a guy who tried to snatch my daughter.
It was reported to the police of course, before I get questions on that but my problem is that now I'm worried it might happen again. She seems fine, she's 3 years old so I don't think she grasped what was happening, but now when I'm out with her, everyone I see is a potential kidnapper.
Waking the dog this afternoon on our local park and there were people everywhere and I was so scared someone would run and grab her.

Obviously I can't keep her in our house for the rest of her life and depriving her of social interaction isn't an option. I just needed some advice on how to stop seeing predators everywhere. Even at her playgroup I won't take my eyes off her, and it's wearing me down. I'm exhausted just taking her grocery shopping.

Anyone had this? I looked online but couldn't find anything.

Answers, feedback or advice would be much appreciated. T. I. A",23Nov2018,1

Turns out #3 was wrong. After a grueling week or so of sparse communication, I was still messaging her every day or every other day or so thinking she just wanted to be alone and wanted time/space to herself, which was a part of it. I was still letting her know I was thinking about her, that I missed her, and hoped she was doing okay. I was more worried about her, it kept me up at nights not knowing what was going on.

But after a message I sent yesterday on thanksgiving saying I was thankful for her and hoped she was having a good Thanksgiving. She responded to me and effectively said ""I'm not trying to shut you out. I've just got a lot that I need to figure out on my own. I think we should just call things quits for a while at least so that I'm not just ignoring you all the time""

I told her if being ignored means being with her then I can live with that as long as I know she's okay, but she  didn't want that and I can't force her. 

I'm kicking myself because I'm hoping I didn't push her away with a text every day, or that I made her feel guilty by saying those things so she decided to just end it, or if it was an inevitability she was mulling over for the duration of going incommunicado. 

I just hope I didn't shoot myself in the foot with any of it. I was a good boyfriend, and everything was great up until that point. There was no indication that this was going to happen and I still don't understand it, I don't know what went on I'm her head or what changed her mind. Things were going great. I just hope we can resume where we left off some day, I really liked her, enjoyed her companionship, and I would pick up where we left off if/when shes ready.

I really do miss her.",23Nov2018,1
405,"*Long post incoming*
 Hello, I need some advice on how to handle this situation before I loose my mind and my soon to be husband.
To go to the start, I don't know my real dad and I was raised monstly by my grandparents. I say mostly because my mom married one guy and theb divorced him 10 years later. At the point of her divorce I was 14 , still living with my grandparents, and she left to work in Italy leaving me behind. My grandma died few months after she left and my grandpa started drinking. For the next 4 years, I give up high school, start working, start doing drugs. When I was 18 my granpa died from cancer, then it hits me, I am alone. All my mom did was to come over 2 days for his funeral and to take care of his bank acount and go back in Italy. All she did those 4 years was to send money. Now I am 23, I live in another country, found my soulmate and I am so happy. But my mom is still trying to buy me with money and everytime when I try to say something that she does not agree with she blocks me from social media, after 1 week she unblocks me like nothing happened. She got a hold of the phone number of my boyfriends mom, so what she does when I am not responding for 2 days straight ? That's right she is calling her. Talking trash about me to her and talking trash about her to me. I am done, she is lying everyone, trash talking me and playing the victim. Plus I have my weeding next year and I really don't want drama to spark there when she will be drunk. I don't know what the hell I should do. 
Sorry for the long post. And thank you for taking your time to read it.

406,"My brother, the youngest of 4 kids, is very spoiled despite his well-behaved older sisters. I wouldn’t say this is a “phase” or that he’s just “being a boy”. 

I’m having a really hard time with my brother. I heard that he doesn’t have a lot of friends and that not many kids like him. I felt bad for him. F E L T. My brother, lets call him Richard (y’know, dick), bullies my younger sister. And did I already says he’s the youngest? BOI WHY ARE YOU BULLYING YOUR OLDER SISTER WHO WONT FIGHT BACK?? Anyways, he hates when kids take or go into his property, which I can understand, but he just.. this boy will take what HE wants without considering whether he’s invading someone’s privacy or property and won’t even think about what he’s doing. He usually insults other kids and gets into fights.

My brother also has major anger issues. If he doesn’t get what he wants, he will scream and hit, and oh. My. God. It just won’t end until he gets his way.

So our parents are divorced. My stepdad and mom are always busy so they neither have the time not the knowledge to discipline this strange human being. Me and my sisters were all raised well, but since my brother is pretty sensitive, we (not me) always gave him what he wanted so we wouldn’t have an issue. I’m really disappointed with everyone doing that. Is2g that simple thing has corrupted Richard.

My stepdad is always told by Richard that he feels like he isn’t loved and doesn’t get as much as his sisters, WHICH IS NOT TRUE!! Because of this, my stepdad has resorted to giving my brother things so he feels loved, but that only raises his expectations for what he should get. Richard also has high expectations for himself, saying that he should join 3 sports activities, learning guitar, being a professional gamer, and having his very own gaming and trophy room. I’m not making this shit up. Please don’t think this is a joke.

My brother also has the bigger room in the apartment even though his sister is a year older and is a girl (gurls need more space, right?)

Overall, my brother is a spoiled brat and I have no idea how to fix him. It’s an issue for me, too.",23Nov2018,1
407," Most people start having sex at the age of 15-16, but here I am an 18 year old guy who's never kissed, hugged or had sex with a woman. It wouldn't be so unbearable if I didn't constantly see couples kissing and doing shit to eachother in public. 


 So I personally only see two solutions:

1)Get a girlfriend


2) learn to cope.


First one hasn't been working out. Any advice?


 Don't give me that bullshit ""learn to love being single"" nonsense. I'm happy alone, I have a great job, doing great in my studies, I workout, I take care of myself, I have friends and a great family. I want someone to have intimacy with. ",23Nov2018,1
408,"There's this girl in my class who I have been interacting with for class projects. She's cute and I'm most likely a below average looking guy (I don't know how to judge myself, I think on my best day I probably don't look ugly, which isn't saying much) and of average smartness. She's been taking my help for various courses by meeting outside class. My strategy was to initially use this to become friends and later maybe become something more.

One point to note is that I'm a non-westerner (but living in a western country) hailing from a very conservative culture so it's not terribly uncommon for people to not have any relationships until their late 20s. I'm currently 24 with no dating experience at all. So if anything seems off about my behavior, you know why.

Whenever I had the chance to talk to her, I would try to ""sell"" myself by mentioning my achievements. (Like I said, my physical form isn't exactly my biggest selling point). She would seem vaguely interested.

Back to the point, I one day finally mustered the courage and asked her whether she would be interested in playing indoor games with me on college campus. She said she was interested and we started playing occasionally. During one such meetings, she mentioned she was going out shopping casually the next day. I swear I don't know what got into me but a couple hours later I asked her whether she was still going to shop over text and that I was looking for someone to accompany me. She replied that she wasn't going outside and was doing it online. A couple of hours later when I asked whether she wanted to play again, she replied that she was done playing (politely, of course).

Here's the deal, did I overstep my bounds too soon? All of this happened within a time frame of 2-3 weeks. Would you conclude that this behavior classifies as creepy? (Not to be judgemental, but since I don't really look good, would my behavior be classified as creepy?)

Also, I'll get ousted from this country if I don't get a job within a couple of months so I also feel guilty for not diverting every single resource of my life towards that goal and instead focusing on ""trivial"" pursuits like these.

Any advice you could give to me so that I don't cringe thinking about what I did whenever I see her again? And how to not get distracted and focus on getting a job?

At this point I'm perfectly alright with just being not thought of as creepy, let alone progress somewhere into getting a ""relationship"".",23Nov2018,1
410," I've been talking to this girl for about 2 years now, mostly as friends. She broke up with her boyfriend just over a year ago and she's been single since. We became a lot closer over the past few months, and have expressed interest in one another on multiple occasions, but we live quite the distance from one another at the moment, so I am unable to make a move yet. I have a few problems aside from that though. She became friends with her ex again recently, and they've seen each other a few times(they live a lot closer to one another than I do to her), and I'm not sure if they're intending on getting back together or they're just strictly friends. That's one of the reasons I haven't made my move yet. Another reason is, she currently lives with a female roommate, and she casually brings up the fact that she's gay sometimes, and we've jokingly talked about that in the past, but I'm unsure if she's actually serious about that at this point. So distance aside, I'm not sure if she's getting back with her ex or not, and I'm not sure if she's gay or not. Would be pretty awkward to bring either of those up so I'm not sure what to do at this point. Any advice appreciated! ",23Nov2018,1
413,"Hello, I am on a throwaway account just in case any of my family happens to see this.  This is going to be a bit of a long story but most of it is needed in context to help understand the whole situation.

Also on mobile so probably poor formatting and grammar.

Tl;dr will be at the bottom though!

So about a year ago I lost my old job at a furniture store doing customer care.  I was getting paid decent but the owners were micromanaging me to hell and even though I was great at my job, every little mistake resulted in one of them coming in and screaming at me until he was red in the face.  Eventually I got sick of it and with my anxiety blowing through the roof because every day I could be potentially screamed at I couldn't wait until I found another job and put in my two weeks. Fortunatley, with rent and bills coming up, my uncle offered me a job at his mattress store doing deliveries.  At first it was fine because I would make 40-50 dollars a delivery and I was making enough money to pay all my bills. I also lived relatively close to where I worked so the commute was maybe 20 minutes.  Unfortunately the owner of the house I was renting decided to move out of state and sell the house so we had to move and at the time, the only place me and my girlfriend could find was back in our home town about 50 miles away.  I dont mind driving so much as it gives me a chance to think but with traffic and god forbid construction it takes me about an hour and 15 minutes to get to work now.

About 8 months ago though, he had to go on a business trip and the lady he usually has work for him was out of town as well so he asked me to work open to close (10am-7pm) for about 5 days until he got back.  Fortunately for me, my previous job I was trained in sales even though I never had to actually do any selling.

While he was away I sold a crazy amount of merchandise that was better then anything him or the other lady had sold and he noticed that I was a good salesman so he asked me to start working part time so he could take some days off and the other hours I wasn't working I would be doing deliveries still.  I was still hurting for money so I accepted the offer.

But about 6 months ago business was kind of dying so I reached out to a sales rep for a mattress company I had previous connections with, and got my uncle to meet him and he ended up bringing that company into the store and turned everything around sales wise.  He went from just getting by to making a profit for the first time in a few years and never even showed a hint of gratitude to me for setting up what could be the saving grace to his business.

After that he he offered me another deal, he wanted to bring me on full time for sales but whenever we would have a delivery he would watch the store while I went out and did it quick.  The only thing was he didn't want to put me on payroll and I can't find anything right now that pays as well with no college education or with only customer service experience, so I am getting paid under the table at a flat rate of 10$ an hour plus whatever delivery fees I make.  At first I was fine with it because I was getting paid for what I was doing and it felt even.  But eventually my 35-40 hour work week started turning into 50-70 hour work weeks.  And now I feel like he's completely abusing me because he knows I cant find a good job anywhere else.

In the past couple months he's had me completely renovate a new store that he is opening (because he's made so much profit off of the deal I set him up with), which includes demoing all the insides and drywall, paint, flooring, electrical, cleaning, I mean everything.  I dont have any real experience doing any of this and had to learn as I was going along by calling my dad (who has been a licensed contractor for 30 years) every few hours.  The reason he did this was so he didn't have to spend any money on permits or over pay a contractor to come out and do it (I still was only making $10 an hour for all this).

He's also had me working sales everyday with one day off every other week ( averaging about 110 hours every two weeks) while doing deliveries.  Hes recently stopped paying me for time I'm out on deliveries because ""I'm getting paid a delivery fee"" but all gas and expenses come out of my pocket for the work truck (he wont even put gas in it, so either I pay or the customer gets upset because we cant do a delivery).  On top of that the past few months hes had me also moving everything between stores by myself and unloading trucks of 50-60 mattresses (some weigh upwards of 250 pounds in king size and I weigh 155lbs) by myself while he sits in a chair inside and makes fun of me when I drop one or need his help.

Over the last year my knees have become completely shot as the store he is currently at the only way to unload a truck is to bring in the mattress through the front door and I cant drag the mattresses so everyone I have to crouch while holding hundreds of pounds and then stand back up once I get through.  It's like doing 50 reps of super horrible squats that just kill your thighs and knees.

I wouldn't mind doing all of this as much if I was compensated for my work better, but, at the same time I feel like I should just find another job.  He is now starting to tell me that he is going to start making me use my personal social media to promote his store so he can reach a younger demographic.  I'm 25 so he thinks if I promote his business, all my friends on social media who are just starting to buy houses and having children or moving out or graduating college, will see it and come in.  

What should I do because since he is family I get really anxious at the thought of confronting him since he will probably talk to my mom (his sister) or my grandma (his mother, who I am close to and she got me my job at the other furniture store she works at) making me out to be some crybaby to them. I also have to see him every family event since my family is all very close and every holiday we spend together.  And since I dont have any sort of degree or much experience and this job I technically dont even have since nothing is documented, I cant really just up and leave like I feel like doing.

TL;DR: lost my job and started working for my uncle.  He started working me about 110 every two weeks getting paid under the table so no benefits or overtime.  Also started making me do stuff that I wasn't qualified to do (construction) to save money and making me work my body to exhaustion because I cant get another job paying decently without college education or more experience.  

Very anxious he will complain about me to family if I complain to him he's not paying me enough or tell him he's overworking me.

Thank you all...",23Nov2018,1
414,"Okay so, I found a position for a medical assistant on craigslist. I emailed asking if 14 hours a week was okay, and if they could train me (and I mentioned that the training would be unpaid).

 I’m a divorced father of 2 and have been re-married for going on 2 years. For the past year my ex wife and her new husband have been making my wife and I’s life a living hell. Going as far as to contact my wife and explain to her on 2 separate occasions that I was or had cheated on her with my ex wife. All of this sprinkled in with her husband answering my ex’s phone when I call her to discuss matters related to the children and getting belligerent with me. Because of this, all communication regarding the children happens through a parenting tool and we have both blocked her husband from both of our phones. I would block my ex as well, but I would need an open line of communication should there be an emergency with one of the children while in her care. 

Outside of directly trying to ruin my wife and I’s relationship, she has made several slandering posts on Facebook and Instagram directly about me, and of course it’s 2018 and everyone’s on social media so this eventually finds its way back to myself or my wife through mutual friends. My wife gets upset for obvious reasons and wants me to confront my ex about these posts when she makes them and request for them to be removed due to their nature. I have made attempts in the past to do this, against my better judgment, and it aways ends in some kind of retaliation or my ex or her husband trying to convince my wife what a terrible person I am and that she should leave me etc. 

I am feeling very helpless/ hopeless of ever living a normal life with normal life problems with out the added anxiety and stress my ex is putting on my wife and I’s relationship. It’s now beginning to create a wedge between my children and I as they get older and see what’s going on. No matter how hard I try to keep them out of the drama and let them live happy lives doing kid things I know they can sense it. They will have plenty of stress and drama in their teen/ adult years, they don’t need it now. 

Today she posted something about some bill that wasn’t payed for over a year ago from an ISP (in her name) that some how has my current address associated with it. She goes on in her post telling me to “#gtfo” and leading a hate parade against me which includes the speculation that I used her SSN to open the account etc. It is 100% not a bill from my wife or I’s current address nor is it an ISP that even offers service in our neighborhood and furthermore have no need to open an account for an ISP in someone else’s name for the cost of $40 a month. I’m not hard up on money in anyway and would never even think to do something like that. Plus a $40 connection can’t be offering a desirable internet speed anyways.

425,"So my sister's live-in boyfriend left her around the time I graduated, so the deal became to watch her twelve year old son on weekdays while she worked.

The house itself is a nightmare, her unopened amazon packages and boxes of random things cover a living room, family room, 2-story double garage, and 2 bedrooms.

Her son has ADHD, which apparently involves screaming profanities, physical threats, and throwing things. I'm working on bonding with the kid, he's insanely talented at art and I'm helping him practice. He's capable of making better choices and I hope he'll be fine. She and her friends belittle me for not taking care of the kid enough, while they drink, trash the house, rinse and repeat. The last time she watched him, she was blasted drunk and hiding in her room, so I'm convinced that my nephew may not even need full-time care.

Both my parents have always worked alot with dad usually having 50-80hr weeks in a CEO position in a big company.

My father is extremely handy and even though his whole carreer has been in leadership and suits he mows his own lawn, fixes his veteran cars, enjoys carpenting and can basically fix anything, something he loves doing.

He is now in his mid 50's and is of the 'old school' when it comes to mental health issues; therapy is BS and for weak people, pull yourself together and stop being sad etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last 10 years i've gradually seen how the work enviroment, which is a super highpressure one, with an immense workload and impossible deadlines have been eating away at my dad. 

He gradually started enjoying his wine and whiskey more and more ove the course of these last years. 

I believe it to be his ""coping mechanism"" for stress, along with rewarding himself after a long work-day which gives him a constant excuse to have a bottle of wine, a few beers, and some liquor.

As I've been growing up i can never remember seing my father visibly drunk or smelling of alcohol, but this could of course be something that i notice more now that I am older.

&amp;#x200B;

He is never loud, abusive, or angry when drinking, but lately i see him stumbling and mumbling when im home in the weekends. He is usually a mix of happy-, loving-, joking- drunk.

\- Still i find it to be a problem being concerned for his mental and physical health, my parents relationship, and my siblings catching on and getting a bad role model. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've talked to my mom and asked her about this and she says it is pretyt much a constant thing but he drinks alot more in some periods.

He recently quit his job. The main reason for this being that he really hit the wall and has been on sick-leave for almost a year now, being completely burnt out. My parents recently bought a ranch where they have built a new house, so he has plenty of stuff to do, and he spends full work days doing tons of practical work on the farm.

Still he is usually drunk before 8 in the evening, alot of nights, sleeps little to nothing and wakes up at 4 in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

All things considered i would like to talk his drinking over with him and get him to slow down on the drinking, because i am concerned.

&amp;#x200B;

The main issues at hand is:

\- how do i even begin to aproach this?

\- how do i avoid him going on the defensive?

I get to live in my college town with friends that I love and continue to live a life that I'm finally happy living after years of being miserable. However, I'll be scraping by financially until I start a well paying job with good benefits in June.

I'll save thousands of dollars and can put money towards paying off student loans, but have to deal with their constant judgement, rules, and my borderline emotionally abusive alcoholic father. I was miserable living there growing up and visiting for the holidays throughout college. 

My mom is my best friend in a lot of ways, and really wants me to be practical and make the smart financial decision. It just tears me up inside to imagine not even being able to leave the house in what I want to wear (my mom thinks everything is trashy and promiscuous from jean shorts to leggings) or having to be locked up in my room to avoid my dad once he's started drinking.

443,"Hello Reddit

I'm looking to continue my education and was searching for a good place to begin. I came across some websites such as [www.edx.org](https://www.edx.org/), Khan and various other sites from another post on reddit. While many of the courses available looked appealing, I was wondering if anyone could narrow down a starting point for myself. I'll tell you a brief summary of my educational background, what courses I have completed and courses that I would like to work towards.

I had a very unfortunate end to my high school career at the end of the 11th grade and was unable to continue or graduate. While I do have many courses completed some of them I would like to redo and others I would like to progress to the next level. A long term goal would be taking some college courses at a local institution, then progressing into a university or specific job related degree/program.

One issue that I have is that college courses can be expensive and I would like to avoid spending money on a course in which I would likely receive a low or even failing grade, largely due to not having been in enrolled in any type of educational activities for many years. This is where sites like the ones previously mentioned seem like a very beneficial place for me to restart my education.

However while the websites that I sorted through from another reddit page ([https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7kj86s/what\_are\_some\_free\_education\_websites\_that\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7kj86s/what_are_some_free_education_websites_that_more/)). While seeming useful and reputable, atleast for the purposes of polishing my near decade old foundation. I have no idea which course would be relevant or beneficial to me. Atleast in the websites that I have personally looked through, I couldn't decipher a good starting point for my current level of education based on the course titles that I browsed through.

&amp;#x200B;

Below I'll list course that I am wanting to pursue in the near future. All of which are Canadian and started in BC, although I'm currently in Alberta.

If these online courses are good enough that I could skip most of the 11th grade courses when I go to an actual college that would be amazing.

Math 11 (redo)

Math 12

English 12 (I feel like I could achieve a good grade with my current skills and rust, but a brush up wouldn't be hurtful)

Physics 11 (redo/found to be relatively easy)

Physics 12

Chem 11(redo)

Chem 12

​Whoever has read through my sob story long enough to get to this point you are an exceptionally patient person. And if out of any of those people feel willing and knowledgeable enough to answer my unreasonable questions, you are an absolute hero and would be helping me start an exciting and productive life chapter moving forward. Hopefully this isn't too much to ask through a internet post, and while I think that this seems like a lot, hopefully there are some kind redditors who could point me in the right direction.

Regards",23Nov2018,1
