0,"Some background info:

&amp;#x200B;

I've never done an interview before but I've been given the opportunity to do so with someone I really admire. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our only form of communication between each other is via text and through a third party. Let's assume I only have one message I can send to him.  

&amp;#x200B;

The interview will be done online (skype, facetime, etc.) to be printed in a magazine. 

&amp;#x200B;

The magazine is being published for the first time ever, and is not run by me. However the person in charge is very connected in the industry and has other large names already  attached to it.

1,"There's a group of 4-5 girls that I'm friends (trying to be) with.




We've all really started hanging out last year, and yea we had the occasional get together, we sit together at lunch, I'm involved in all their group chats and we send memes to each other and what not.




Sure this seems like typical friend behavior, but we just don't hang out at all. And what's even worse is that when they do hang out without me they post it on snapchat.




I know they don't mean any harm, but I'm just so confused.





Right now, I just think they're uncomfortable around me. I'm a guy, and I'm gay. They don't know that, and nobody else does but me. I don't want to go through the whole emotial/social taxing thing of coming out and making a big deal, so instead I just try to act the part.




I'm almost convinced they think I'm trying to date them, but I don't know how to make it any clearer that I just want to be friends.




Maybe it's my own insecurities, and maybe I'm dumb for thinking that they're uncomfortable in asking me to hang out because I might try to make a move or something...",08Oct2018,1
2,"Hi all. I turned 21 a couple of days ago but somethings been bugging me for a couple of months now. I know that your teen years are suppose to be a really confusing time of finding yourself and finding a place to belong... but I never had that. I was a quiet kid with a small tight group of friends. Now that I'm 21... I have no idea where I belong in the world. I've been working full time for the passed 2 and a half years and saving as much as I can to be able to buy a house next year. The youngest co-worker I have is 13 years older than me so I dont relate to many people and am often talked down too. My friends all love to party but my girlfriend of a year hates to socialize. I can't seen to please either of them. I don't go out often enough with my friends and they get fustraited but I also go out so much my girlfriend gets concerned. I never minded my parent before (live with my mum) but now I feel so angry and upset when she goes into my room because I feel like she's violating the one place I can just be me and have my own space. I feel like the 16 year punk boy brother stereotype from movies who yells ""Mum get out of my room"" at regular intervals. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it normal to go through this so late and what is your advice going forward? Would love to hear your answers. ",08Oct2018,1

6,"I’m in a bit of a tough situation right now, I didn’t want to be put in this position where I have to decide whether I want to do senior year or not, but circumstances have changed. 

Basically, within the next year it’s pretty certain that my family will be moving. I’m a junior rn, so next year should be my senior year, however if we do move (which I think is pretty certain) that’ll pretty much disrupt my chance of finishing at my high school with all my friends. So I need some advice. 

Should I start making plans right now to just graduate from my junior year, so I don’t have to worry about becoming acquainted to a completely different high school in a different state, or should I just go with the flow and do senior year, even if that means perhaps going to a new school halfway through the year?

For the most part my grades are doing fine, but yet I know that I am not reaching my full potential and that hurts. No matter what I do, I either stay glued to my phone or I straight up can't focus on the work I'm doing- that is until I get to school the next day and do it all before class.

11,"I have been friends with a guy in a different country for a little over a year now. We talk everyday and have gotten really close. I know he has feelings for me, but a long distance relationship really isn’t my thing. We talked this out and he still wanted to be friends. At the same time he ended up going in a rut for the past 4 months and conversation has been really hard. I do my best to talk about things but I don’t really get answers I can respond to to keep the conversation flowing. I message him good morning everyday, I ask him how he slept, how his day was, what he is doing, how he is feeling, if there is anything I can do. Just anything. It’s the same thing over and over again. I understand very well that conversation is hard when you are in a bad place, but it’s kinda becoming draining to me. It’s like I’m not there till I message him. I can let the whole day go by and not message him till 4pm (that’s 9 for him) and he’ll respond immediately. He never messages me first. It’s like he just waits for me. I tried talking to him about this and he got really defensive talking about how “I have very little to say. I don’t need you reminding me”. He tells me to just make it easier on myself and to stop talking to him but that just makes me feel really bad and selfish. I don’t know what to do. Has anyone experienced this before and do you have any advice?",08Oct2018,1
12,"Okay, “hate” isn’t the right word, but it gets the point across.

As a kid, I got along with him fine, for the most part. But the older I got, the more aware I got of all his issues.

For one, he’s a chronic alcoholic. The longest he’s ever been sober, since I’ve been around, was 108 days. Then he went right back to drinking and hasn’t stopped since. That was about a decade ago. He can’t hold down a job and hasn’t had one for a few years now. On top of that, he can’t remember fairly basic details about my life, such as the names of the clubs I’m involved in or when I have events, so I’ve simply stopped telling him since he doesn’t remember anyway.

The biggest issue I have with him those is the fact that he’s overtly racist and has horrendous views of people who have attempted suicide, specifically those with multiple attempts. For the former, he will throw around the “N” word, and while we were at a campus tour, made comments like “it seems a little dark around here, doesn’t it?” in reference to the people walking around. For the latter (Warning for people who are sensitive to this kind of thing) he has said multiple times that they should just “shoot themselves in the head and be done with it” and genuinely believes that people who have attempted suicide and survived were just doing it for attention. I have tried to reason with him, but he’s entirely stuck in his ways.

I appreciate having him around as he’s shown me exactly who I don’t want to be and the impact alcohol can have on a person, but I really have very few positive feelings towards him. Especially since, in addition to he above, he has also stolen money from me, pretended to be fixing the lawn mower but was instead smoking pot in the shed, has left for days on end at times, before we had two cars so leaving my mom and I without a vehicle, once told me I was the reason he drank before apologizing for that remark, and has generally been argumentative and a liar.

I can’t pretend he’s never been good to me, when my mom was working he’s stay home and watch me when I wasn’t old enough to be unsupervised and helped my mom and I when I moved away to college, but it just doesn’t justify everything else.

About a year ago, he was diagnosed with colon cancer. It was stage 2 and as of now, he’s doing okay. (Well, as okay as someone whose brain has been fried by alcohol can be.) And although finding out was hard, it didn’t have the emotional impact it should have had. Nothing really changed. And I never worried about him dying. Maybe it’s because he’s been saying that once I graduated high school, he’d stop taking his pills and let nature do it’s thing ever since I was in middle school, but I was not very impacted. I also never miss him when I’m at college, just my mom.

I feel guilty for all of this, considering he wasn’t abusive or anything, and I don’t want to harbor these negative feelings for him, but I don’t know what to do. How can I bring myself to forgive him for all of this?",08Oct2018,1
13,"So this is about an old friend that I used to be friends with for the last 10 years. Well, he just became very weird and started acting more and more creepy after college. This and because he was just so sneaky is the reason why I cut him off completely. So this post may get long but its important to understand his progression. 

So things started getting weird with him when he would creep out any female he would try to pursue, to the point of nearly getting a restraining order, he would casually brush it off and tell us that it was because she was crazy, (the girl did look a little off so me and my friends basically thought nothing of it) but now that I think about it with what I know today he probably did stalk/creep on her. So lets fast forward a few years past college, he became pretty odd and started going on a video chatting website (lets call it NB) a LOT. I mean the guy would just sit in his house and stay on NB all day. Well anyways, I come to find out the guy would be sending weird sex-related messages to people on the site, he thought it was funny (we're like wtf bro that is weird). Around the same time he started watching a lot of Disney shows like iCarly and that Ariana Grande or Demi Lovato show I think. This is a 25-28 year old man watching these shows btw. He would always find someway to not make it weird by saying things like ""my little brother watches it blah blah"". So pretty soon after that he starts talking about and to 15-18 year old girls on NB. I find it weird but he makes a joke out of it so I don't think anything of it and soon after he stops talking about it because you know I'm into women my age and can't really relate. 

Here is where things take a drastic turn, he starts talking about his NB activity because Id ask him wtf he does on the site for so long all day. He starts casually telling me about friending 15/16 year old girls and saying he's like an older brother to them (eventually texting them like everyday), I was pretty taken back by that and told him that its not normal to do that and what if he had a little sister and some 25/26 year old did that to them etc. He got defensive and stopped talking about his ""little sisters"" with me after that. Then a few years later, he talking about NB again and how he saw children being exploited on there and saw child porn on NB. I totally freak out and tell him that he needs to report that type of activity to the cops because its disgusting and shouldn't be on there. He tells me that he just skips the video chat every time it comes on, I am mind blown at this point bc this is the first Ive ever heard of this stuff and he describes the age of the girls etc.. I'm completely freaked out but I would have never thought that he would possibly be a predator bc I've known the guy since I was a kid.

Eventually I come to find out that he's got a bunch ""little sisters"" around the world, even one that is currently going to the same HS as us (creepy af). I stop hanging out with the kid as much bc he's just weird at this point, he's social inept and his mannerisms just got way too odd for me. There are too many stories on his weirdness and older brother bullshit that I can think of but that for another day. Do you guys think that he is possibly a pedophile? I just get a very eerie feeling thinking about how he described those girls on Omegle bc I could tell that he didn't think there was that much wrong with it. People that prey on children are scum of the earth and deserve to get caught, Ive just never dealt with this kinda shit before. Based on what I've wrote, would you guys report him? Do you think he's a predator? (the girls he usually choses to be a big brother to seem to have a lot of issues in their lives) ",08Oct2018,1
14,"I’m 25 years old with a degree in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. I have a job in the insurance industry. 

Sorry this is long...
tl;dr I hate my job. I got passed over for a promotion when I was already doing the job. I can get my masters for free, but really don’t want to. I want to work in marketing. How do I switch careers? 

I got hired at my agency a couple of months after graduation. The job I got hired for was basically just paperwork. It was an entry level position. After about 4 months, I got promoted to my current position. This position has a lot of math involved in it. I was to assist my coworker in whatever he was doing, which was mostly statistical analysis. I was very excited about this as he was cool and a great teacher. I felt I could learn a lot from him. A month later, he quits. In the two weeks that he had left, he taught me everything that he could (which was not much given I knew nothing about Medicaid a month before and had a lot to learn). When he was leaving, he told me that our supervisor asked if he thought I was capable of handling his position and he said yes and recommended that they give me the position (the position involves a good amount of programming that no one else knew how to do, so they just had to take his word for it). Over the next couple of months I take over his job duties (without a raise or promotion). This included handling a huge project that we have a couple of times a year. I worked a lot of late nights with my supervisors and did all the programming work by myself with literally no one to guide me or answer questions. I wanted a promotion to the position that I was already doing the work for. 

I got frustrated that I was not getting credit for doing the work of a position that got paid significantly more than I did and was a management position. I started applying to jobs and got a job offer. Once I told my boss this, she agreed to match the offer if I stayed, so I did (mostly due to flexibility with time off and great benefits). She also proceeded to tell me that they filled the position I wanted. Which means they did interviews and did not even give me a chance at it. 

The new employee is nice, but can be condescending. I don’t think that I can learn from her (especially seeing as I’m the one teaching her how to do some stuff right now). Honestly, I am also bitter. Their excuse for not considering me for the position was that I didn’t have a masters degree (something that was never mentioned before and was not a requirement in the job description). 

Lately I have been getting more and more frustrated. I have had almost no work to do and mostly sit in my office reading news articles. It is driving me crazy how little I have to do. I try and teach myself how to do various tasks by rewriting code or reading through old code. I gave up a great opportunity to stay at the agency and I regret it everyday. I live in a small town and there’s not very many companies to work for, especially in the insurance industry. 

My “dream” job is to work as a marketing analyst. I want to track finances for a company based on marketing campaigns, or something like that. There’s a great marketing agency in town and I have a friend that works there. I applied and she put in a good word for me, but they didn’t interview me because I didn’t have experience in the field. 

I have the opportunity to get my masters for free. My two options (since I work full time and these programs are geared towards part time students) are a masters in business or a masters in risk management. I don’t want to get a degree in something that I’m not happy with. I also hated school as it was very stressful for me and don’t want to go back if I have other options. 

What do I do? How can I get into the marketing field? Is a masters in business sufficient? Was I dumb to not quit on the spot when I did not get the promotion?",08Oct2018,1

I was in a relationship for about a year that turned extremely toxic because of my partners actions. It led to my complete mental breakdown. She had one as well, along with her multiple suicide attempts after I ended the relationship. One time she broke my sliding glass door, took one of the pieces, and started cutting her wrists while saying to me ""why are you doing this to me?"" And I had to physically intervene. It really fucked me up. The situation spiraled and it ended up involving my entire family, cause I needed help being pieced back together. So they hate her, for obvious reasons. Her actions and emotional manipulation almost ruined me. Like I said I'm cutting out back story, but even she agrees with this. She knows she broke me. I forgive her, but it doesn't change anything. 

I went away for a bit to be alone. When I came back in town her and I met up to exchange things, I had a moment of weakness, she saw that, we had ""good bye sex"" and the rest is history. She said she was on birthcontrol. I pulled out. But she is still somehow pregnant, and apparently it's mine, and she's keeping it. I'm in my early 20's. Lifelong believer in never wanting children of my own. I'm dealing with crippling depression and anxiety and then I get this news.

 Some members of my family will disown me for getting her pregnant. I can hardly manage to get out of bed before 5pm most days. I work nights so that is possible, but my whole life is work, sleep and just staring at walls. I am starting therapy this week to try and get my shit together, but I just don't care. My point being, I am well aware of how unstable this situation is. I know I'm mentally unwell, as is she, and even at my best I never felt like I had enough love to give for children. 

I know I have to man up. I am not asking how to ditch the girl or the kid. My bed, I'll lie in it. Even if I hate every aspect of my life, I don't have it in me to ghost my kid. I get it, so save the condescending comments like ""what did you expect when you had sex.""

But the thought of kids doesn't do anything for me. They sound awful, I get no happiness from this news. As a person I already feel like a waste of space and bringing a child in this world to just follow my shitty footsteps makes me feel worse. I've always believed people got value from what they did for the world as a whole. Otherwise what's the fucking point? Therefore I have none. And now I have a kid? Its like I peaked at this shitty point. The rest of my life is just going to be me trying to keep my head above water and out of debt. I watched how hard it was for my parents, and they actually loved me. What if I don't love  this kid? What if I resent it? 

I need a way out of this hole. I find myself fantasizing about death a lot now. I don't think I could ever actually kill myself, I couldn't do that to my mom or my sister (ironically she's the one to disown me), but it still sounds nice. 

I used to be a pretty happy and positive person. I used to have goals and ambition and it's just all gone. I'm quickly losing my desire to even try and improve. Like I said, I'm at a loss. If anyone has any advice that'd be awesome. Thanks for reading.

26,"*Very long story with possibly unnecessary background details* 
This story all takes span of 2 weeks , with it beginning on the 23rd of September but some background info is that she had seen me at a competition my school hosted and she had originally thought I was cute but did not talk to me until I texted her first

So, to begin this short novel, let’s begin with me and this girl.  We’re both seniors but she’s  from a separate school, hers being an hour away from mine so it would be a struggle to see each other.  Both me and her are in JROTC which is how we followed each other over a year ago on instagram but we never took notice of each other until recently (23 September) with her posting a photo of herself and friends in uniform on Instagram in which I replied since I had thought it was my school originally, but she had cleared the confusion and then we started taking , in which we really hit it off. We traded Snapchat’s and began texting for a few days , sending selfies and such to each other starting off so cute and innocent. She then gave me her number so we could talk more often so she could reply faster as she has doesn’t often have reception. Still continuing , we would have more cute dating talk and conversation and flirt through texts , sometimes having multiple references about sex despite both of us knowing we wouldn’t do that especially since we haven’t even seen each other in real life. 

*This is where the first major event happens. 

 While we were sharing our memes , I had sent one about my disregard for non virgin females in which she had replied through memes how she was not one and had lost it. Because of prior relationships, I chose to not date any non virgins as I myself am one and because of personal preference, but Reverting back to the main point, I said how I don’t affiliate with non virgins and was on the verge of no longer talking to her. I did not want to place myself through events that had happened in the past... shortly after I had said that, she had replied to a Snapchat of mine and I had noticed that she was crying. I called her and after having basic conversation with her , she was moping and sobbing drastically in her bathroom so nobody would hear her ... it hurt my own heart when I heard the sorrow, and sensitivity in her voice.  I didn’t want to be responsible for ending a relationship that never began so I apologized for my actions. She said it was fine and that she’s just on her period and sensitive. It was from that point on that we had began talking but with a stronger connection,  but I thought about that moment from time to time. That was just the second or third day of us talking, so I still felt guilt. We continued past that point

We’d text everyday and talked about shared similar experiences or just shared how our days were and how life was. She’d constantly comment how cute i am which I appreciated greatly as I’m very confident about myself but have hidden insecurities about my looks. I’d of course return the compliments about her beauty and her funny personality. We’d talk everyday and share memes still through instagram and Snapchat and our connection grew stronger throughout the days. Every day I’d fall deeper and deeper into feelings with this girl I haven’t even met yet. I guess you could even call it love is what I felt for her , because she had me feeling some way that my ex’s could never give me. 

Her school recently having an upcoming event, she invites me to Homecoming. I gladly accept as i would love to spend the day with her and at the dance so i say yes and meet up with her friend to deliver the money since her friend is closer to my house than hers. That week was a stressful yet so exciting week for me because I knew that it would make us closer to an official couple. The only problem throughout the whole week was transportation. Her living an hour away made transportation so we tried to ask her friend if she could take me(no car problems). The friends parents are really strict so it was a stressful week since they didn’t give a clear respond until 2 days before the event which was a huge save for us. To the days leading up to the event , we would get more flirtatious. The high point in which gave me the most hope for us together was when she called me asking if I wouldn’t mind coming home late with lipstick all over my face and shirt from her. Of course I felt flustered and euphoric and giddily agreed that nobody would mind. That basically shows how interested she is.. right? 
Something similar happened a few days later in which I went for a late night walk to clear my head and get some fresh air, texting her of course and me and her shared an amazing interest of simple things that people take for granted like a walk at night , with no cars or lights on the streets or simply the stars shining bright or the fluorescent glow of the moon. We spent the rest of that night talking about nature and interests in hiking or dreams of traveling. The most memorable point of that night was her complimenting my soul and how she knows it’s beautiful and wants to see it’s true colors one day. Those are loving words.. right? 

Fast forward the day of the dance. I get up early in the morning and get to the friends house, and then we get to the apartment where we all meet up (the girl , friend 1’taxi’ and friend 2 ’house owner’). As soon as I get there I meet the girl for the first time and I was so happy and cheerful and enthusiastic to have met her. It was like I was hit by Cupid’s arrow , I was head over heals for her and it’s not even an hour I’ve met this girl. Throughout the whole day , leading up to homecoming , we spend the day together in the apartment talking , chilling, relaxing, and sleeping. We did things that only a couple would do which is why I’m so love struck for her , like laying down on her lap and just relaxing , or cuddling and sleeping. All of this being the first times doing this, it was amazing for me and I could’ve lived in that moment forever. 

*The downfall*  Fast forward to the dance, and this is when I start noticing her changes. We arrive early at the dance and so we wait there out in front of the school with everybody. She goes to answer a phone call from an old friend so she takes a step away for 20 minutes. After the phone call , the group of us get in the line to go inside the school. Throughout the whole time I attempt to start a conversation with her but it’s as if she’s uninterested, which was strange because she wasn’t acting like this the whole day which made me wonder what the phone call was. While waiting in the line for the next 15 minutes , she just gives basic responses to any questions I was asking or to what I was saying to try and initiate something. She was more interested in pointing out other friends in the line or her phone while we were all waiting. 
We finally get inside the school into their courtyard and take a seat on the sidelines near the back. We wait for the other friends to make it inside and we all meet up. The beginning of the dance starts terribly, the DJ was not playing any music worth dancing to so we couldn’t really dance at all which I I found annoying. The main thing that I kept on noticing the whole night was how much she’d look at her phone. The whole night she would check and she was more interested in the phone than me which she hadn’t done he whole day before the dance.. the whole night constantly checking Snapchat and texting someone. I knew it was a guy and I was very jealous and scared so when we sat down after dancing , I asked her if I could ask a few questions. I didn’t want to tip-toe the subject so I asked her directly a few questions I’ve had for the night , first is if she even wanted to be there because it had seemed like she didn’t want to be , to which she had to think about but she said yes just because it would be her last homecoming. Secondly , the most important question I wanted to ask was if she had originally wanted to invite me or if her friends had pushed her. I mentally prepared myself for this answer so I wouldn’t feel crushed by whatever would be said next whether it was good or bad. Her response was worse than I had thought. She already had a date to go with, but they stopped talking so she just invited me instead since they had distanced themselves. I wasn’t sure what to think at that point because I didn’t know if that was a good or bad thing so I had to ignore my feelings and disregard the response and said thank you for her answering honestly. To move on without , I asked her to dance which she responded not at the moment because of her heels hurting her. We did eventually dance for the last 30 minutes but the whole time she would check her phone every so often and text that one person which kept on making me think who were they. The event ended with a slow dance in which I held her close and thanked her for inviting me and that I had an amazing day with her. 

Fast forwarding to the next day (today) All my texts had been responded to at a longer time than usual , and all were basic short replies that had no flavor in them. No compliments today or such had been returned thus causing me to worry and fear the worst has came which caused me to start listening to sad music to make myself feel even worse instead of doing the opposite, and instead listening to cheerful music to brighten my spirits. It was only two weeks and a half but I don’t know whether or not if she’s going to break things off with me  or if I’m just overreacting to this all and if she’s just having a lazy Sunday like I am but Ive spent over two hours writing this and sharing my experiences and shedding tears , something I haven’t done in almost a year from a traumatic breakup. I really like and care about this girl despite not even knowing her for 3 weeks. I feel as if she’s beautiful and perfect in every way , loving her imperfections and missing her beautiful voice and infectious laugh.  She made me smile so bright and feel so cared about in a way that nobody has ever done, looking past my mask of jokes and attempts to draw laughter to bring out the soft side in me which I never show. This girl is everything to me, and if she were to stop talking to me then I would be completely crushed. She made me see the bright side in dating girls again and gave me hope in having a partner through it all. If she were to leave me then I would no longer have interest in dating for a long time to cheer up from a broken heart. I suffer too much from codependency and accidentally placed all my happiness and joy to another person , and want to go through another part of depression in life.

34,"I haven’t been great at friendships what seems like my entire life. I’ve attended 6 differently elementary schools, 1 middle school very briefly and home schooled until high school. I met me daughter’s father a month before turning 14 years old. I didn’t realize I was in an emotionally abusive and controlling relationship until it ended. Pregnant at 19, he left me at 20, 2 months before my daughter was born. Once pregnant we moved to an entire new state. I had to completely start over without a support system. 6 years later - I did it. I have a great job, been there for years. We’re finally stable and her father has grown up enough to have one weekend a month visitation. (When he left, he moved back home while I remained in the new state.) Long story short - I’m still struggling to create and maintain a community of loving, understanding people. I grew up without a father and don’t have much of a relationship with my mother. I grew up what seems to be as isolated. I don’t know family beyond my immediate. Some days I feel so empowered to be where I am today.  But others, I feel so betrayed. The friends who I have allowed to come into my life, to be around my daughter, always seem to drift away. The pattern is undeniable. In the beginning, it’s great but as time goes by, I suddenly don’t get invited anymore, no one reaches out to me, they seem annoyed of me and then they are gone or half half ass there. To the point that I don’t feel like it’s healthy so I let it go. I work 40 hours a week sometimes more as I work a side job as well to keep things comfortable. It’s hard for me to balance raising my daughter as a young mother, with no other parents to turn to, no support system, while “keeping it all together”. I feel so alone. My mother didn’t have friend - am I destined to be her? It’s heart breaking some days and I’m becoming fearful of letting anyone in. Is anyone out there dealing with this? Thank you for reading.

35,"Hi, my dog Epi is a 5yr old male mix breed dog whom has developed serious pollen allergies in the last year. Which means when we go outside or he is exposed to pollen in any way he gets itchy to the point he constantly scratches  and licks his paws, to the point his feet get fungle infections and become raw, red, and painful. He barely sleeps at night due to being uncomfortable and itching. He doesn't want to play anymore because it seems to aggravate his skin and he has to lick/scratch after being touched. I  also have to put him in the cone of shame when I am not home so he doesn't lick himself to the point of it being painful. I have tried everything from bathing him several times a week with oatmeal based shampoos, wiping off his coat after walkes with a damp rag to remove pollen, washing blankets and vacuuming frequently and taking him to the vet for monthly Cytopoint injections (an allergy shot) that seem to work less now. Which I was warned by the vet would eventually happen. I love my dog like he is my child and it hurts to see him so uncomfortable. I was wondering has anyone else been in this situation and if so have you figured out how to manage the symptoms so your dog has a more comfortable life? ",08Oct2018,1
36,"Long story: I was pulled over by police last week for a simple registration error. I was abroad for two years and moved back home. My dad registered the wrong car and put that sticker on my car by accident, so the car I was driving was unregistered and the registration sticker was registered to a different car. I was pulled over at midnight due to a cop running the plate (all traffic laws were followed). It was a 45 minute stop and they questioned me to try to get me to admitting guilt, told me they could arrest me, lecturing me about the seriousness of the crime, etc. I was so confused and they were not pleasant. Being arrested for me is scary because I'm a T1 diabetic and it's scary to potentially not have great access to sugar and/or insulin, which might not be accessible in jail/custody while being detained. At the end, they realized I was confused and cited me twice and told me what steps to take, but it was traumatizing and I was so nervous, I've never shaken like that in my life.

Now I'm just so scared of being pulled over when driving home at night. I drive late at night (12am - 3am) sort of frequently, 2-4 times a month. I live an hour from the city where my friends live and I enjoy concerts, which I stay out late with them sometimes. The roads are littered with cops trying to catch drunk drivers, so it's normal to be tailed by cops, which makes me nervous, but I make sure to follow all laws. 

But now I'm nervous to drive home. I'm never too impaired to drive and always drink responsibly with friends. If anything, I'll have 1, possibly 2 drinks over the course of 4-5 hours. It's just easy for a police to make a reason up for pulling someone over (""swerving"") and then accusing you of being drunk or smelling drugs. I don't do drugs but I wouldn't consent to a search out of principle. But I'm scared of being accused of being drunk, because I'm scared of failing those roadside tests because of nerves. I was so nervous when pulled over last week, I was completely sober and I bet I couldn't balance at all because I was so shaky. But on normal occasions, I drink 1 drink responsibly and if an officer asks if I've drank anything, I'm scared what to do or say, even if it's just 1 cider over 4 hours.

It seems irrational because I follow laws, but I'm scared because cops are looking for DUI. I'm nervous about getting a corrupt cop looking for an arrest and then taken to jail where my health would suffer. I've literally been paralyzed with fear this whole week, I skipped two concerts already because I was scared of driving home at 3am.

tl;dr: Drive late at night sometimes, scared of a corrupt cop pulling me over for DUI when I'm not impaired. Scared of being arrested because I am a T1 diabetic. How do I get over this fear?",08Oct2018,1
37,"Tl;dr at bottom

I am a 19 year old boy and I’d like to preface this a bit. I am aware that I am young and it’s normal to worry about what i am going to do for a living, but I have such little drive for anything. So little that I am scared of becoming worthless as my issues with being driven increase exponentially with time. Joining the navy is a decision I’ve been struggling with for many months, but only recently have I been deeply depressed with my current standing as a person.

I graduated from high school in 2017 and I have taken 2 semesters of college. I failed one and am in the process of failing another. I have scored above average in most standardized tests in high school. The reason I’m failing is because I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I have no motivation to focus my energy on my studies when I don’t know what I’d like to do. I am aware this is my personal issue of lack of a drive. I’m not shoving responsibility. The military can give me the responsibility and discipline I desperately need. I am so scared of joining because the thought of giving four years of my life do doing god knows what with no outs scares the hell out of me. What if I’m miserable (if my job is miserable I convince myself that every fabric of my being is miserable, I am genuinely scared of feeling this way) There will be nothing I can do. My father is sixty and works at a steel mill 18 hours a day six or seven days a week. I’m also scared I don’t have much time left with him as he hasn’t been to a doctor in 35 years. If I left and he died while I was gone I would certainly never forgive myself and I’m scared of what I would do in that case. My girlfriend is supportive but my mom would not be pleased that I’m even considering it. She said when I was young “I’d lock you in the basement If you tried to join” (she is a great mother, just passionate). I need to find a way to be at peace with the decision I make and I have nobody left to turn to.

Tl;dr I’m desperate for something I can do to make myself a more productive and driven person. I am terrified of future guilt and the idea of being locked into an agreement that I may find miserable. I have never felt so worthless in my life and I need to take action.",08Oct2018,1
38,"(Buckle up, because I talk a lot.)

I have been dealing with anxiety for a long time, but it isn't anything new for my partner. Whenever I ask them about their experience, they have said that there are times they definitely feel anxious, but that there's a point they realize what they're worrying about isn't worth being so upset about and is able to bring their self down.

There are a few subjects that when brought up, it throws me into a tailspin as far as anxiety goes. For example, it's becoming more apparent that I may not be able to pursue the career I've been working towards, putting my high education towards, and dreaming about for years. It dredges up a huge perfectionist complex and reminds me of how far behind on my goals I am when compared to my peers. Whenever something goes wrong, I kind of just freak out and start speaking hatefully about myself, and my spouse tries to present solutions for my issues or treating them in a logical manner. The problem is, I am swallowed up in a panic attack and shoot down anything they suggest or have to say. It feels so unintentional because normally I'd never talk to them in that way or talk about myself the way I do in front of them.

This isn't about my own anxiety/depression/issues (I'm working on them in therapy). This is about trying to give tools to my spouse on how to help me when I act out like this, while I myself am trying to find healthy coping mechanisms. They usually stop speaking to me and ignore me when I keep acting negatively, and that sends me into an even bigger panic. I usually try to come back when I feel better, and talk about ways we were both right and wrong in how we handled the situation, and what led up to it. My spouse is so put out and emotionally exhausted that I can tell they aren't willing to try anything I suggest. Eventually, they set boundaries but I still feel scared and anxious and really just need their support. I respect that they need boundaries, because I know I can be an emotionally draining person. But I'm really at my wit's end, because I just want my partner to try to understand where my anxiety comes from, and I'm trying to give them ways to help me when I get in this anxiety-brain-fog and can't make heads or tails of what is normal and abnormal.

39,"First time posting so sorry if it’s not in the correct format. 

I usually just come here to see funny memes and whatnot but decided that I just need to get some advice. In March of this year I decided to move from Texas to Florida. I come from the extreme desert part of Texas and city life galore but DH and I decided to move to Florida to a small (7,000 people small) and wildlife and green everywhere type town. The first few months was really good. I was extremely happy and enjoying everything Florida has to offer. Then end of June/early July, I started to see bugs inside the house. Beetles, spiders, drugstore beetles, and recently sugar ants. With so many bugs showing up, I went from entire house cleaning once every other week to once a week. (I sweep entire house every night and mop it every other day, dishes done every night and counter tops clean at the end of night. Washing walls and cleaning bathrooms every weekend now) every time I see even a moth come in, my mind goes haywire and I feel a rush of anxiety flood my body, and I start thinking how the house is infested and I re clean EVERYTHING, poison AGAIN and still the anxiety just goes up and up. I cry to let it out but nope. I’ve tried breathing exercises to calm down but nothing. It’s getting to the point where I want to move back to Texas where I know how things are but financially that is impossible. 

So my, I guess, plea for help is this. How do I calm down from that extreme anxiety? I know I might need medical help and tomorrow I’m going to call my doctor so I can see a psychiatrist but I would still like to get some advice on how to self manage this anxiety I’m having. ",08Oct2018,1

41,"I've been working in my field for 5 years, with a degree for 2 years, and in my role for 2 years as well. I'm also currently in a master's degree program that is specific to my job.

A few months ago, I approached my boss about a merit-based raise, and he said it was out of the question without really giving an answer as to why, but he let me know he would tell me if I was doing a bad job.

Since my former boss quit, I've absorbed a LOT of job duties that I did not originally agree to, and now I do work well outside of the scope of my current job duties list. I revised my own job description list and took it to my HR department, and they said I should look into formally revising it, having my boss sign off on it, and possibly adjusting my salary given that I'm doing so much more now. The kicker? My job duties now almost 100% match the duties listed in a different position where I work - and the person they hired for it is making 15k+ more than me. However, she does have about 5 years of experience on me.

So, I've done my research and have drafted a new job duties list to submit to my boss. But I am terrified to turn it into him. This is partially because I feel like my boss views me as a child (I'm in my early 20s while everyone else is older than me by 10+ years.) He already thought I was nuts for asking for my own office a few months ago (my work area was literally a dark cubby in the hall without AC and heat in it, and we had several vacant offices). And while I ultimately got a different office, the atmosphere at work was pretty terrible for a while because of my request.

My question is, how should I approach my supervisor about this? I don't want him to think I went over his head and directly to HR, but he had already incorrectly explained how pay raises work. I'm also afraid that it might be frowned upon because I've only had these new duties for a year - but I taught myself the necessary skills to make sure the job duties previously done by my former supervisor would be tended to.

How can I approach this without being scared/intimidated?!",08Oct2018,1

And that was about 6 months ago, so after that I just thought she wasn't interested and moved on.

Now my family is debating on finding a good home for him or keeping him. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",08Oct2018,1

59,"Okay. I'm in a pickle with both of my jobs. I work two part time jobs to support myself. Dominos and Gamestop. I have had gamestop for a while and I'm a manager there. I love the people and I really want to grow with the company. My manager there has told me that either she needs to demote me so she can hire another manager or I need to open up my availability for the holidays coming up. Shes unsure if she could repromote me. Shes made it clear it's nothing against me and shes given me about a month to decide. But it's coming up really soon when our holiday season starts.

I also work as a manager at Dominos but I'm not being paid as a manager since I havent gone through the tests to become one. I started about a month and a half ago and was hired on as a manager. So I'm making minimum wage and not bonusing like I should be. I work the weekends here. 

I've thought about quitting dominos so I can just work gamestop but I'm not sure they will give me enough yours to sustain myself. (I could get 30 to 40 during the holidays which is what I need but other than that I get around 15 to 20.) I would feel really bad quitting dominos but I don't think they can or will switch me to weekdays. 

I've tried searching for full time work to quit both but I'm in a small town and not much full time positions are available during the holidays. I'm really stuck on what to do.",08Oct2018,1
60,"I’m a 14 year old anti social nerd/weeb/geek. Oh and according to YouTube vids and anything else I’ve heard online, I have depression.. 

So imagine me, a nerd with no social life except a few kids from gym class whose dealing with depression. I also have no self confidence at all. Can’t hold a conversation. 

I’ve been keeping myself happy and busy by wasting away in front of a screen all day playing video games or watching anime. But lately that’s all been changing... I don’t find the same fun and escape from reality anymore as I used to. I can’t find anything fun to do and I’m awful at any conversations, no friends. Seriously haven’t invited anyone over or went to someone’s house for the past year and a half. Now it’s winter here in Canada and i don’t want to go outside in the cold. 

So yeah, that’s my story up till now. I have almost zero friends, I question everything but never confront it. I believe that everyone judges every single thing I do. If I hear someone laughing I’ll automatically think I’m doing something wrong, and get away as fast as possible. I feel like I’m wasting my life(which I probably am). Btw i come from a pretty poor family, both parents work full time, my dad a custodian at a church, my mom works making window frames and doors. I can’t start any expensive hobby’s, I’m a quitter.

63,"I dated this girl for 6 years. I fell in love with her and the relationship itself was pretty good. This  girl was someone I idolized and talked highly about even after we broke up because she was an incredible human being. Little did I know she deceived me, and I found out 8 months after she ended it.

Every time I talked about her, it was always with praise. I never talked badly about her even though she broke my heart. When she broke up with me, she said it was because she didn’t want to live her life wondering about what she could have been doing if she didn’t commit to me. We were young and I understood that. It was easy to conceptualize, but I didn’t know that part of the reason she broke up with me was because she cheated on me. From the moment she broke up with me until the day I found out, she took advantage of me. 

Had she told me that she cheated on me the day she broke up with me, I could have just cut her off and moved on, but no, I wanted to learn to love her unconditionally. Just because we weren’t together romantically, it didn’t mean I couldn’t still love her through friendship. It took me a long time, but I learned how to do it. She took that opportunity to let her go away from me. She knew I’d be there for her after we broke up, and I think she knew that if she told me she cheated on me, I wouldn’t be. 

The night she cheated on me was her birthday, but I obviously didn’t know that. I remember that night I got her flowers, a cake, and one of her favorite meals. I called her over a dozen times, but she didn’t answer. I was fucking worried as fuck and couldn’t sleep because I stayed up wondering if she was okay. The next day she told me that she was driving around because she was going through a hard time and she apologized that she made me worry only to find out recently that she fucking lied to me and was fucking some other dude instead.

A month after she broke up with me, she got with some dude, but not the dude she cheated on me with. She had problems in that relationship and when she did, she reached out to me. I tried my best to be there when I could and be there for her when she really needed it. After 7 months of them dating, she asked me for advice on how to break up with him, and I was there for her and tried to support her anyway I could. I comforted her after her breakup with no intentions of wanting her back, but just wanting to be a friend to someone who needed company after a breakup. We started hanging out like friends, and I was pretty stoked about it. She told me about how she was low on funds, so I meal prepped her food for a week so she wouldn’t have to worry about when the next time she could get a decent meal. I did all this without the knowledge of her cheating on me, and I dont fucking understand how you could let someone show you love like that knowing you hurt them. What’s pathetic is that she says she cares a lot about me, and she made me believe she did, but I don’t get how you could do that to someone you say you care about.

Before I found out that she cheated on me, sometimes when we would hang out, she would talk to me about the guy she cheated on me with and say shit like yeah there’s this guy I met. He’s handsome and super cool and she would talk hella giddy about him. I was supportive you know cause I knew this is what she wanted. She recited poems to me that were inspired by him. She showed me a pic of him and asked my opinion on how he looked like. She talked so openly about him to me all the while I didn’t fucking know that this was the guy who she cheated on me with. 

The day I found out, I went ballistic. I didn’t understand how she could be friends with same person, continue hooking up with same person, you used to hurt the person you say you care so much about. She literally asked me for advice about this guy. I can’t wrap my head around it. I understand that there’s no justification for cheating, but I try to be an understand person and I understand as humans, we make mistakes, but how could you talk so openly about the person you fucked with and cheated with to the person you hurt. Her justifications were, “when it happened, in my head, we were already broken up” and whatever, I get the disconnect and maybe I could forgive the cheating aspect of the situation, but I can’t understand her wanting to still be friends with him if she wanted a friendship with me to work out. It’s like there has to be consequences you know? She fucked up right? Is it wrong to say that there has to be consequences?

I wanted to kill myself the day after I found out because I felt like a fucking loser. I feel so shitty and so low. I feel like an idiot, but I just try to be a good person because I feel like everyone deserves love. This is going to make me sound even more pathetic, but I even tried to compromise with her so that I wouldn’t have to cut her off. I never wanted to be the person to give ultimatums or tell someone who they can and can’t be friends with, but I told her the only way I could make a friendship with her work is if she cut him off because I wasn’t okay with her being friends with someone she hurt me with. She told me she couldn’t because it wasnt his fault so and that I should consider his feelings because he’s a human too. Like what the fuck right? 

After a long argument, she said she’d do it, but I felt shitty afterwards. Was I asking too much? Was I being inappropriate for asking her to do that? I realized I was, but I couldn’t help it. It’s just how I felt. Is this me being weak because I’m trying to find a way to make this work? Should I just cut her off? I can’t even talk about this to my closest friends because I feel so embarrassed. I literally always talked good about her. All my friends that know her say she’s hella sweet and I always showed her off when we were together. I’m literally in my own mind right now, and I don’t know how to deal with it. ",08Oct2018,1

66,"My dad passed away on Saturday. He was only 50 (as of September) and had been fighting gastric cancer since very early 2015. He was given three months in late August, so it wasn't exactly unexpected, but it was still very sudden - from his ""normal"" to hallucinating to ""I think I'm gonna go"" in a matter of 6 hours.


I'm so lost. Nothing feels real and I don't know how to handle things, we've never lost anyone this close to/in our family before (except pets, and even then not many); we lost my husband's great-grandma last year and while it was definitely sad we weren't extremely close and she'd had an amazing life (93 years, 70+ years of which she spent madly in love with her husband) so it just feels really different. Everything I've looked up online focuses on ""big picture motivational stuff"" like ""learn to let go"" and ""focus on the people still around"" and that. Which I'm sure I'll understand and appreciate eventually but does nothing right now.


I don't know how to do stuff like... What do I tell my boss? Do I tell my coworkers? How long is ""normal"" time to be away? What do I say when people tell me they're sorry or offer condolences? How do I talk to my friends? How do I be there for my family when all I want to do is just sleep forever? What are missteps that I should avoid when handling this situation?


I'd appreciate any advice anyone can offer about this. Thank you for reading. ",08Oct2018,1
67,"A bit of a scattered story ahead: 

I'm a college student who works after class to pay monthly rent. I wake up at 7 am or 6 am some mornings, go to class for hours, go to work until 5 or 6 pm, drive back to my apartment, study or do homework until 9 or 10 pm, take a shower, and then sleep. Rinse, lather, repeat.  I don't even have many people that I talk to during the day to make it more fun. That routine isn't actually an exaggeration, not even the estimate on homework. I have hours of it every day, guaranteed. 

Of course I only realize a couple of months after signing a year long lease and moving out of my parents' house that I'm exhausted. Completely exhausted. I feel as though I am genuinely headed toward some sort of mental breakdown. 

I really don't want to do this anymore, but I appear to be trapped in a situation of my own making. I know what options people my age without a degree have, and they are limited. I can't drop out, I can't stop working, I can't move to Alaska, I can't just decide not to do my homework or my gpa will suffer. 

*But I also can't keep up this routine.*  

Maybe I'm overreacting. I get Saturday every week off, guaranteed. I technically don't have to work more than twenty hours a week if I don't want to, but that's still until until around 5-6 every day.  I have it easier than a lot of other people and easier than even I used to have it or deserve now.  I used to work in fast food without breaks and now work elsewhere with my friend. 

But my friend is visibly unhappy that I'm there - despite offering me the job - and so I feel like an awkward, undeserving addition. It has been more miserable than I expected as a result. I also live with this friend and thus I feel like an awkward, undeserving addition in my own home. 

Is there anything I can do? I really don't know how to keep my head above water at this point. And it will only get more difficult the longer it goes on. 

TL;DR: Whiny bitch ass college student has bitten off more than she can chew and no amount of coffee in the world can prevent an impending mental breakdown.  (She would still like advice.)",08Oct2018,1

71,I talked to this guy for 10 months &amp; we were abt 500 m away. 8 hrs. Idk why I’m sharing this but I guess I just need some other thoughts on this. We met online lol &amp; talked ever since. We had pretty good communication &amp; he genuinely seemed like he really cared about me so I thought. Our biggest issue was him being really selfish. In ways where it would create conflicts about us not talking enough bc he would always have something going on where he felt as if he didn’t feel the need to update me before not responding for hours. He knew he was the only person I really had that I opened up the way I did. We got really ahead of ourselves he talked about making me a citizen of the country he lives in so we can be together &amp; I can live w him bc I stressed so much about how shitty things are here &amp; we kept talking for so long bc he convinced me that we were gonna be together. We stopped talking about 2 weeks ago &amp; last night I messaged him how I felt about everything &amp; I asked him how he felt about me as a person &amp; totally disregarded what I said &amp; said that it was more of a he loved the feeling of being loved &amp; wanted. &amp; that the kept talking to me because he created an image in his head of how perfect everything could be together &amp; then realized that he couldn’t bc were both not in the right position to be with each other. I took it as he just didn’t wanna be with me. Everything he says is always about him &amp; never once went on about how much he appreciated me as a person &amp; everytime I’ve been there for him in ways he didn’t think I could be there. Conclusion I’m just really lost &amp; confused that we talked all that time made all those plans for him to just say fuck it &amp; not even be bothered over the fact that we stopped talking. Idk why I’m so bothered over this bc we never met but I guess more so I got to know this guy for 10 months &amp; got my hopes up for something that was never going to happen. ,08Oct2018,1
72,"So I've been talking with this girl for like a month now. We snap/message everyday. I feel like it's going well because she always sends back pics of herself laughing because I make her laugh. The same for me because she makes me laugh. She is also very comfortable with me, I know because she said so.

The thing is that...whenever I flirt with her...she kinda ""avoids"" it? It's not even like hardcore flirting. It's like small things like saying I enjoyed my time with her or one time we hugged and when I brought it up she said something else. 
However, when we're together...her actions don't match our messages. She's playful, touchy, and always joking with me. She's always smiling

I get that this is kind of weird like who doesn't know what it is they feel but i'm still hoping some one can help me see what I can't. I met this guy maybe three or four years ago when his family moved in next door. my first impression of him was that he was scary and i'd never want to talk to him but I did hit it off with his younger brother and so his brother and I started to hang out. Things stayed as just me and his younger brother hanging out only occasionally seeing him up until a few months ago. We have a small park sort of thing near where we live I was having a rough day and went to hang out on the swings. frustrated, I began to cry and then fell asleep all whilst still on the swings. I had only woken up when the guy called my name asking if I was asleep. Since I have a disease called ""Dumb"" I replied saying that I hadn't been asleep which made him laugh. one thing lead to another and we began to talk I'm not quite sure what about but it didn't matter because before long I had forgotten all about my horrible day. everyday after this we would go out to the swings and just talk for hours about all sorts of philosophical things and our lives and we'd just help each other out. then when summer ended and we had to go back to school and stuff I started to see less and less of him but for whatever reason I felt compelled to go to the swings and wait. some days I knew that there was no chance he'd come but I just sat there hoping to see even just a small glimpse of him but on the days we have seen each other we have hardly talked for 20 minutes and often get cut off. While this may all seem straight forward and seem like I like him for some reason I don't think that's  the case because I don't feel like I could ever be with him or anyone for that matter. Besides I've never liked someone or at least felt the way people say that you feel when you like someone. I'm moving soon and while i'd like to say that i'll be upset not ever seeing him again I Know from past experiences that i'll get over it quick but for know I just wish I could know how I feel right now.

74,"These nightmares have been ongoing for about four days now. When one ends, the next will pick up where the last left off. I never feel scared in the events of the nightmares, I recall just feeling extremely uncomfortable. The middlemost subject of the dreams is about a 6 to 7 foot man with rabbit-like facial structure. Atop his cranium are two really jagged and scabrous textured ears. I can’t establish whether it’s truly a mask or not. The mouth opens and his jaw pops as the bottom jaw veers to the left. He also has a very grotesque way of walking, his right leg from the knee down is completely turned outward. His clothes are unidentifiable, I think maybe they might’ve been really poor quality rags with tattered ends. He smells of bleach and Ammonia, and I can still smell these aromas upon awakening. He does things like verbally harass me, bound me to either a bed or tree, or just to my own person. He licks my face with an inhuman, forked tongue and always leaves a trail of grayish saliva. His voice reminds me of satan from that animation called “The Mysterious Stranger”. He kills rabbits and forces me to sit in the piles of their decaying corpses, they also smell like ammonia and bleach. His teeth fall out and there are even occurrences where he forces me to eat them whilst staring in a mirror at my own distorted figure. And when these types of sudden scenes are happening, they’re always in places I personally know.  He knows my name but only uses it when trying to persuade me to “stay”. He pulls on my hair when I show signs of not wanting to, and when he is trying to coax me into staying, I can’t speak. Any other time I can. I’m not entirely certain what to make of it, and mind that I never feel afraid during these nightmares either entirely numb or uncomfortable. Though I wake up in a jolt. ",08Oct2018,1

I've consumed way too many clickbait articles and videos and value imaginary internet points for way more than what they are worth. This has also taken a toll on my sleeping schedule and has caused plenty of procrastination on my essays and classwork. I don't mean to sound like r/phonesarebad but I feel attached to my phone and think something is wrong with me. I still have problems with time management and moderation when it comes to video games and other mediums as well. However, I could feel my life withering away as I refreshed twitter for the 25th time today. I've tried plenty of solutions in the past but they didn't really work. For starters, I permanently deleted my Facebook account and deleted my Snapchat app since they were the two social media sites that I cared the least about. It only took me two weeks to reinstall Snapchat again. I've tried permanently deleting my Twitter account three times over the past couple of years only to reactivate my account again each time. The problem of not using my phone is that it's unrealistic, even in moderation as it just sits in my pocket, waiting to be used. I've tried pretty much anything, not sure how to fix my behavior. Every day is pretty much the same, and I've always wanted to turn my life around several times to no avail. Do you guys have any tips?

We are terrified that she is going to get our dogs. We generally do this anyway, but we are making it a point to stay outside with the dogs when they need to go out. 

Can she legally do this??",08Oct2018,1

So here's the thing, we've known each other for about 5 years now, and have liked her for 4 years. She is one of my best friends, and I really don't want to lose our friendship. I'm like 95% sure she knows I've had feelings for her in the past but I'm not sure if she still knows or not. For the past 2 years I've been wanting to tell her, but chicken out every time. I know the feelings aren't reciprocated but at this point I'm just tired of it all and just want to let it out. So the question is, should I tell her? Have any of you been in similar situations? How was your reaction, or the reaction of the person you were telling? And finally, do you think it is a good idea to tell her?

Thank you for any and all responses.",08Oct2018,1
87,"I'm currently a freshman in high school (14F), and I'm taking the hardest math course there is for my grade. I knew it would be difficult coming in; with my teacher, half the students got C's and dropped out after first semester last year, but I never counted on having her hate me. I'm usually a good student, despite never raising my hand due to my social anxiety. She quickly discovered this and constantly began to pick on me to answer questions every day, and I'd end up blanking out, saying an incorrect answer, and embarrassing myself in front of the whole class. (There are plenty of other quiet people, but she chooses to always pick on me for some reason.) This has been going on on every day for about three weeks now, and everyday I come home embarrassed, crying, or just feeling like shit in general. To make matters worse, about two weeks ago she accused me of cheating on a test (even though I wasn't) and made me sit in the middle of the front of the classroom where everyone could see me. She STILL makes me do it for every test or pop quiz we take, so now everyone thinks I'm a cheater. It doesn't help that my grade is extremely low either. I've tried everything and even involved my parents, but nothing changed. Right now I'm just waiting for the semester to end so I can drop out, but I don't know if I can take it for that long.

And now he's under the impression that I only like really muscular guys. (keep in mind this is somewhat my fault I told him stories of how sexy some of the guys I've had crushes on and how hot they are.) he's a big guy and has muscle just not very toned at all and honestly obviously I would love love for him to be ripped but I love his personality and this is a huge buzz kill for him and he's vocalize that.

96,"For context, my friend is getting married in March next year. They've been engaged for just under two years. I'm a bridesmaid and we've been friends since high school, were very close between leaving highschool and before she met her fiance but we're still friends now just not as close.

The wedding destination has changed to a location that's a 3 hour drive from where I live, a 6 hour round trip. 
Since I'm a bridesmaid she wants us to come the night before and share a 9 person bedroom so we can get ready together the following day. After the wedding the reception will be at the mother of the groom's home where anyone drinking can stay for free or, alternatively, stay at the hotel another night.

One night at the hotel is $410 with two nights coming to $820. My partner isn't coming so I'll be in a bedroom with 8 people I don't know very well or find irritating. The groom's parents are nutcases (the mother recently tried to starve the groom's younger brother a nonverbal autistic 7 year old, father tried to molest the groom as an adult while drunk and both recently got in a physical fight with each other where the mother attempted to strangle the father to death)

As much as I would love to support my friend and I know she is really wanting this wedding to happen, the amount of money it will clost to stay, time and petrol it will take to drive to buttfuck nowhere with no reception, and the people I'll be sharing residency with for two days makes me really hesitant about going. 
Let alone the fact that my friend has a one year old daughter and the place will be swarming with infants which I'm not the biggest fan of. 

Am I a bad friend is I don't go to this? I'll have to take time off work most proberly and I'd literally rather do anything else. My partner thinks this whole situation is ridiculous and says I should not go but I wanted an outside opinion.",08Oct2018,1
97,"Hello everyone, I'm looking for an advice for the situation I'm going through but first I'd like to clarify that English is not my main language so I may have some errors.

Okay, so recently I decided to tell to one of my friends that I like her because I couldn't handle keeping it secret anymore. I know her for 8 years and I had a crush for her when we first met but nothing happened cause I stopped seeing her, and recently I bumped into her on college again. We became friends instantly, and I thought the feelings I had for her before weren't coming back, I was so wrong. 

I tried to hide this feelings so our friendship could keep going, but these feelings kept growing, and I couldn't handle them anymore so I decided to tell her to see if I had any chance or just keep being friends.

She rejected me and I was okay with it, when I did this she even opened up to myself and told me something really bad that happened to her, I was impressed cause she never tells me this kind of stuff. She had to leave cause it was getting late so I told her to talk later (not necessary about what happened) in a ""we are still friends"" type of tone. 

Two days later I saw her and we hang out with some friends, she was acting strange towards me so I thought she was feeling awkward because of what happened, so I decided to tell her to do not feel awkward and we can keep being normal friends but before I could say the ""normal friends"" part she replied: ""I am not feeling awkward, I feel annoyed"". I asked her why and she said that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore so I stopped talking about it. 

I don't know why is she feeling like that, I don't know what to do. I'm afraid of my friendship to end just because of some feelings, I never asked her to be my girlfriend I just wanted to say how I felt and I didn't even bothered her later after we talked about it the first time. I said to myself to never talk about it again and treat her like always. What do you guys think? What should I do?

Over the summer I made friends through small talk with one of the screeners who takes your blood pressure  and asks you the questions. This was a girl I will call Heather. Heather was really nice girl I wasn't into her romantically just wanted to be friends. Everyone at the center loved her. She was named employee of the month after winning a contest on the plasma center facebook page. Then a couple weeks ago I find out she suddenly is fired and the post congratulating for winning the popular contest on FB was deleted. Over the past couple weeks I have been asking around. I first heard what happened to her from one employee who eluded to there was some type of sex scandal. Now today I donate there and a guy in the back tells me she was caught steeling money and adding it to her boyfriend and her's card.

I live in a fairly large town in California (~100,000) people in a subdivision near a main road. I have this neighbor who is, let’s just say, not a nice guy. My wife and I have had no problems with him until we picked up a surrender puppy last year. Being surrendered he has some separation anxiety. We did not know the extent until about a year ago when our neighbor started sending me aggressive texts about the barking. The barking seems to only happen when we are gone and it’s dark outside. We try to keep him inside when we leave at night. However, there’s times we’re gone later than expected - like tonight. We got a text at 7:30 that read ""I have never had such inconsiderate and disrespectful neighbors. I’m tired of the dogs barking. You need to fix it or I WILL!"" 
Is he threatening to off my dogs? What do we do?! This isn't the first aggressive text and when we approached him he acted like nothing happened and that he is just a cranky old man.

I’ve worked with a variety of populations and have grown to love working in medical social work.  Currently, I work inpatient psych and find myself so stressed that I’ve actually made myself sick. I’ve also been adjuncting online for extra money but it’s become more of a burden than anything else. I’m not renewing my teaching contract after this semester. 

For this same amount of time (12-18 months), I’ve driven most of my support system up a wall with thoughts of: “should I go to medical school for psychiatry?”, “should I get a fully funded PhD?”, “should I go to law school?”. I’ve basically given up on becoming a nurse. The only reason I considered it was because of money/shift work and I have a true admiration and love for all the nurses I’ve worked with or known personally. 

I’m over $200k in student loan debt. I have a bachelors and two masters degrees (social work and human sexuality education). Currently, I make $50k base pay in the Northeastern US. I can’t afford to live on my own and have been grateful that friends have let me rent rooms since I graduated from school. Financially I’m screwed and feel like I will never get ahead not have the ability to retire.

112,"I'm a college student at Berkeley and I've decided, along with my parents, to withdraw for academic and personal mental health reasons.

They've been surprisingly supportive and I will likely be leaving this week. I say this because they are very Asian and traditional, and I believe that there's still a lot of mental health awareness that needs to be achieved in the AAPI community.

They have never been sympathetic to feeling depressed before/doing badly in school because of mental health, but suddenly they were fine with it.

I've just been dealing with a lot of impostor syndrome, depression and anxiety, and it's been very difficult to live, let alone attend school and do well.

I've decided, yes, but I have many reservations about this.

1) How can I stop feeling like a disappointment to my parents and myself for admitting defeat and leaving this term instead of pushing on?

2) What if I drop out of college again for another semester and never come back? I've decided that no matter what happens in future semesters, I'll push on for the sake of not having to stay for a bajillion years. I'm determined to at least earn a college degree at the bachelor's level. C's get degrees, after all, and if I have to take C's in the future, then so be it. But this is still a worry I have.

3) How will this affect my possible med school/grad school apps?

Honestly, applying to college and looking ahead to my years at Berkeley, I didn't anticipate this ever happening. My parents always pushed me to do well in school/academically, and I did too. My whole self-worth centered around getting A's and getting into exclusive things. I've learned that at a school like Berkeley, you can't base your worth off of getting A's.

I got mostly straight A's in high school, 5s and 2 4s on 10 AP tests, and I thought that I would do at least decently at Berkeley--or that at least I'd never have to withdraw for a term. I have a 3.65 GPA right now. It's okay for my major (biology) since the average is a 2.9 GPA, but it's not impressive.

I don't know how to deal with this. I know that maybe I'm not that smart and that the world is full of more resilient and talented people. High school isn't the real world, after all.

But I decided to W because even if this keeps me out of med school or whatever, at least I'll be a better person (which is what I will be pushing myself to do over the break) and more equipped to handle life, perhaps.

I know that maybe this isn't the most appropriate subreddit, and I'm willing to move it if that's the case, but I've always been close with a few high school teachers and they've always been willing to give life advice.

114,"Hello!

Made a throwaway for this for some reason even though all the people in question don't use reddit. Just to be safe I guess.

Anyways. My mom is about to make a pretty bad decision in my opinion, and I want some advice about how I should go about convincing her otherwise.

Here's the situation. I live in Orange County, California. It's expensive as heck here. My mom is a single mother with 2 younger kids (our dad has split custody, but she has a single income household), and she has a really good paying job (160k a year). She also lives in a very large house; it's 4 bedroom, 4 bath with 2 living rooms, and the mortgage is very expensive. She has some more expensive tastes, though not awful, but she goes out to dinner and drinks with coworkers more often then most. 

Because she's a single mom, I help out by picking up and driving my brother and sister to school every day, and I work from home and can work around anything she needs with my schedule. On top of that, my grandmother and my uncle and aunt are here all the time helping her out, my dad has the kids half the time for custody. 

Despite all of this, she supposedly ""has no money at all"" and is ""living paycheck to paycheck"". I don't have any reason to not believe her because her mortgage is expensive for a place like this here. 

TL;DR: She lives way above her means and relies on the people around her a lot

Now here's the issue. She got job offer across the country to Denver, CO. She's convinced this is going to solve all her money problems. The job pays 10K more salary than she makes now and she'd be doing the exact same thing for a very similar company. 

This is just a horrible idea for everyone involved though. No one, not even my dad wants to go with her, and she wants to take my brother and sister there full time. She wouldn't have anyone to help her out. She complains that she's stressed enough as it is (to the point where she temporarily got Bells Palsy from stress) but now she wants to just get up and leave everything behind across the country to a new job with no one to help her like they do now? She HATES snow and cold weather, and honestly Denver seems like OC 2.0 and nearly as expensive. The worst part is the job wants her to move there by January!! How is she going to get all her affairs in order, move the kids schools, mover her whole house across the country by January when she's lived in the same general area her whole life? 

This is just all happening too fast. She hasn't had any time to plan it or figure out if this is a good idea or not, and she just believes the the geological cure will solve all her problems. I think she just sees a quick way out and is taking it without thinking about the consequences, but she's very bullheaded and I don't know how to convince her that this is just not a good idea. 

Everyone in my family talks behind her back saying it's an awful idea and in a few months she'll be crawling back, but no one is willing to tell it to her. If now one does it, I want to be the one to do it.

I want to convince her that if she's having financial troubles, she should just sell the 4 bedroom house and get something smaller! She has a LOT of equity in the house so she could sell it and buy a more affordable 2 or 3 bedroom house or  move into a condo or townhouse. I checked and her mortgage is 2x-3x the price of rent at some of the nicer condos in the same city we live (some even closer to her work!). There's no reason she should be financially struggling with the income she makes. I think she needs to cut out costs rather than starting over again.

115,"Before I start. I just want to go ahead and say that I don’t know what it’s like to have a gambling problem, so I face difficulties thinking from her shoes. I apologize if I offend anyone. 


This has been going on for years. My mom has debts to pay yet she goes out and blows off her money in pachinko slots staying indoors for long hours. It’s so bad that from time to time, she would go into our wallets and take ALL our working cash or beg my dad for some too. When she disappears, we can’t keep in touch with her because she doesn’t have a working phone. Because she didn’t pay for her phone bills, she hasn’t had a phone for 3 years so we can’t contact her when she’s MIA. You don’t understand the frustration of not being able to keep in touch with your own mother especially when you need her for abrupt situations. She has 3 kids including myself and she lies straight to our faces when we ask where she goes or why she can’t have a phone with her. 

For example, 
Yesterday, she left at 9 AM and came back at 11 PM. She told me she’s going to my grandpas place to help him move. But she never went to help him move nor even saw him. What were you doing outside for over 10 hours then? When she comes back, her technique is to change the subject when we try to condemn her. She asks questions like: did you eat? Did you shower? We beg her to tell her or admit she has a gambling problem yet she NEVER EVER EVER admits it. Why is this? Why can’t you even admit to what you’re doing? Why do you lie or try to avoid the situation when you do the same thing just a few days later? Why do you lie to us where you are? I get so furious and angry that when I yell at her she just guilt trips us trying to be the “victim.” 
Even though I love my mom, she’s a liar and I despise liars. It pisses me off when she disappears not knowing when she will come back. I’m sick of her not owing up to her mistakes and even if I explode, she won’t do anything to help herself.

121,"I am 21 soon to be moving on to college for my four year degree in about 6 months. My father has always been about helping people which I have always been thankful for. But for about the last year since he retired he has been inviting random people to live with us in our home. We have a small ""inlaw house"" in our backyard where they have been living, but recently people have started to pitch tents in our backyard and park their vehicles to sleep in our driveway. 

Currently there are 4 of them. Now the couple Living in the small house outside are genuenly good people. Hard workers, nice enough, fun to be around, good people. But then there is the guy in the tent and the woman in the car. The guy is supposed to be fixing up the car that was taken apart by another guy who was living with us who then couldnt put it back together. He is blatantly taking advantage of my parents and is just kinda a scumbag. Then there is the woman in her car who is just crazy. Me and my mom are pretty sure she is stealing stuff (LOTS of tools have gone missing) and we are afraid to tell her to leave because she can get violent. My dad has taken a liking to her though so she stays anyway.

We have tried putting rules in place like ""dont be in our house after 9:30"" only to find them rummaging around at 2:30 in the morning. Nothing gets followed.


Me and my Mother are tired of this all. We have tried talking to my father but he just does not get it. I am genuinely scared for my life at times because the woman is so unstable.

123,"I moved home after two years of uni burnt me out, and I’m living with my best friend of 12 years. She’s practically my sister, I’m closer with her family more so than my own family. This summer she was living in her parent house and I  moved in there for the summer when my mom kicked me out of her house. I spend all summer hanging with her and her bf and it was like we were all old friends. But two-three months ago, she bought a house which we all moved in to. It was fine at first but I remember having a feeling like “this isn’t going to last long.” And it didn’t. It’s been weird, I get anxious and can’t talk or look at people. With her bf and his friends around, my anxiety went through the roof just because I wasn’t use to any of them. The thing with my anxiety though is that it goes away with some (a lot) time. And Ive know that, and I’ve tried telling them that. But it got weird for me because I felt like I should’ve have been telling both of them and I should just been telling my sister, but I live with both of them and I’d like to be friends with her bf so we can all coexist peacefully. 
The three of us had a night where some unfiltered feelings came out. My sister was crying about an insecurity that he was going to “fall in love with me.” To which he responded that I was attractive but he loved her which I truly do believe. I just feel like there’s something they know that I don’t? She also said, “I’m just not for that,” which really weirded me out because I’m not looking to share her bf and I really hope that isn’t an idea in his head that she  is keeping from me.

125,"Ok so this is gonna be way long winded. 

I don’t even know if it’s a real problem or I’m just in my head too much.

I’m 26. Boyfriend is 29. 

I have been in quite a few relationships, last one lasting 6 years. Through every relationship, I kinda became “placeholder’s girlfriend.” I wasn’t me anymore. Just someone’s girlfriend. 

Speaking of my last relationship I was in, we were both gamers. I played mainly fighting games and he played mobas. He started playing fighting games with me and got really good. I decided to join a local “fighting game community” event and went alone a couple times. I got a few people to play with me but they got up after a couple matches. My ex came with me once and everyone flocked to him. They invited him to play over and over again, played one guy for 2 hours. And I went around talking to people, asking if they want to play, but no avail. It was like I was smelly. 

He got a ton of names to play online with these people and he started regularly going with me. This went on for 2 years. I made a couple friends but everyone was always excited to see him. 

So fast forward 2ish years. No longer with my ex. Still playing fighting games. I moved to a different state and joined another local fighting game community. They have regular tournaments and around 50 people show up every time. Same thing happened, it was awkward hopping in. Most of these people have been in the community for years. I’m the “new person” and I have to prove myself. 

I placed pretty average in in a tournament. I get 8th in a tournament that had 21 entrants. It wasn’t bad. I’m not a really good player, I’m always asking people to play online with me or to come over.

One of the guys I met there showed a lot of interest in me. We played similar characters, same games. I met the producer of one of the games and showed him a poster I got signed blah blah blah. He soaked it up and I found out he was a really good guy! 

We went on a few dates and we clicked really quick. We started exclusively dating a few weeks ago. 

So it began, they started calling me “soandso’s girlfriend.” The people I played with stopped playing with me. People stopped coming over. 

This last tournament was difficult. People would only really talk to me if my boyfriend was around. I’m in the same room with these people for 14 hours throughout the day. No one came up to say hi (except said bf.) I was kinda looked down on I felt. Sorta felt disrespected.

I have been practicing so hard the past 2 weeks for another tournament the end of the month. Tonight there was an event where a group of these people get together and practice. It’s an open invitation. My boyfriend said he was going, and I mentioned how I might go too. He seemed off, said, “You know we’re not gonna be able to really hangout at this thing. We’re just going to be playing games.” 

My first mistake: I didn’t say “oh I know. I’m wanting to go there to practice too.” The way he said it really made it feel like he didn’t want me there. 

My second mistake: not telling him how I felt “left out.” When I say “left out” it makes me feel like I’m his little sister wanting to tag along. Nope. Just want to get better. 

My third mistake: I didn’t go. I just stayed home and practiced by myself. Friends were busy, no one answering their phones. Had an “off” day so to speak. I just stewed about it. 


So now it’s 11pm and he’s still having fun. He can’t read my mind, I know that. I keep second guessing myself about even bringing it up. I decided to not participate in this months tournament. I’m really bummed out about the whole thing and still a bit peeved thinking about how I was treated at the last one.


TLDR; feeling excluded because I have a boyfriend. Or maybe it’s my personality. Or maybe I’m just stinky. ",08Oct2018,1

127,"I asked my grandfather where was he going with the glock. He responded in a smile, ""Nothing.""

My grandfather would never harm me, as I'm the most precious thing in his heart! Though I think out loudly at times that I feel his emotions are irrational, and unjustifiable without reasoning things first for the sake of all parties involved. He doesn't plan out as to what the best course of action would be, and it might be due to where my family is from - the Philippines, a place where higher intelligence isn't as valued. It's also a thing in other countries, by the way. 

A stranger in a window-tinted vehicle parks up in our apartment parking space at the evening hours of between 8 and 9 PM. My grandfather asked what the stranger was here for, the stranger replied, ""I'm waiting for a friend."" My grandfather stated, ""You do not live here, you are not a visitor, and this is not a public parking space."" My grandfather demanded that the stranger or stranger(s) leave the premises immediately. 

He then pointed the concealed glock, and the strangers drove rather quickly. That may be something worth looking into, and I perhaps should have noted the license plate at the time.

I was not present, nor able to chat with the strangers, because of my grandfather's unplanned course of action and inability to adapt diplomacy. I told my grandfather that it was best not to point the weapon unless we have clear evidence they are a danger to our well being.

I then thought it best to ask my grandfather what did the stranger look like. He answered, ""Spanish."" That is all he gave me. I can forgive it since Filipinos tend to be brought up with a perspective bias on culture. I was hoping to gain more insight and context to picture a profile of said stranger. Sadly, I do not have concrete information to decipher. It is also due to the fact I was unable to interview the stranger, because my grandfather drove them away. 

I gave my grandfather the facts and questions I have to make him a prospective detainee, ""You didn't think they were lost or something? Did you ask if they needed any help? Did you have any evidence to prove they were infact a danger? You did not stop to think and consider any of this, but you pointed a gun without any basis of providing lawful self-defense. We do not have any signs saying our apartment is private property, and the gates are open. Because they were Hispanic, you found it proper to treat them the way you did. Do you not see anything wrong with the situation?"" I don't imagine any good outcome to begin with, by waving around a glock so recklessly. Grandfather was smiling too, probably contemplating I have potential to be a lawyer someday, because a few family members know I want to study law in the future, LOL! I don't hate him for it, but I hate his lacking in rationalizing a scenario. A situation that could be diffused the kindest way possible at that!

It is not needed to add a match to slippery gasoline, for it will make a disastrous fire.

Now, the other side... Yes, almost everything about the stranger seems shady. Tinted windows, why they're parked specifically here, and they've been waiting for almost over twenty minutes. However, any possibility of crime is at the moment, circumstantial. As I see it, I do not see any intent of deliberate harm to our household. I do not see they have any weapons of the sort. They are not in masks or hoods, and there is no recorded data to insists unlawful activity. I want to give the benefit of the doubt, afterall. It does bug me a bit, how quickly they drove. In the end, there is no evidence to imply the worst possibilities are true. 

In my mind, the best plan was to engage them the friendliest way. Without aiming a gun at them. Without showing any form of subtle violence. Just in case, I would find it favorable to contact the police out of any suspicious nature and have the exchange recorded should anything go wrong. Our best option was to be tacky, and have my grandfather with his gun behind his back near me. Even if I was killed in open space of witnesses, the court would prevail in lowly murderers, and sentence them to boundless regret. In that moment when a judge sends them off away from civilian life, they will break down, people will have no sympathy, and everyday my kindness would haunt them as they live behind bars. When they're free, no one will want them. Fortunately, that did not happen!

I don't want to be wrong, nor do I want to be smarty pants and right for reasoning things out. 

What would you guys have done? What things in the future should I consider? =)

I've never cried or been depressed, but I have pain deep inside of me and sometimes it feels like it's ripping me apart.

131,"I have a friend that was fired from his job.  He was a department supervisor and he dated one of the girls that worked in the department with him. 3 weeks after they broke up he was fired for it. The girl that he dated says she didn't do it, and only 3 people knew about it. the 2 dating and one of the other girls in the department. the 3 of them went to dinner and a movie with a 4th person and while waiting for him to arrive, the friend took a pic of the 2 dating on snapchat and sent it to them. the 3 of them had a group chat and were texting each other and the 2 that was dating were saying I love you to each other.

My friend and the other girl got into an argument in the back one day about her not wanting to work and him favoring the one that he dated. This was after they broke up. She threatened to tell the store manager about the situation and 2 days the girl he dated was forced into the office and was read text of my friend talking about how he loved her and that she dumped him. She admitted to the relationship when her job was threatened and 2 days later my friend was fired. He was told there was texts and a picture proving they were dating.

He still cares for this girl, even though he was an absolute ass most of the time after the broke up. But he is afraid that after what this other girl did to him, that it will drive her to do something drastic when the girl turns on her next like she does to everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to make her see that her friend is the one that stabbed them both in the back or should he just let it play out and not worry about what could happen to her? I think he should still be concerned for the girl, because obviously he still cares about her.",08Oct2018,1
132,"So I just want to put what's happening with me in the universe and have someone give me their thoughts. I never delt and processed my abuse the way I should have, because I didn't know I was being abused. To cope with what was happening I forced myself to forget a lot of the abuse. Now, 7 years later, I'm with someone who I hope to marry, but my past issues are coming back to haunt me. I recently had my first ""relapse"" (I honestly don't know what I could even call it) to my victim self when I was in an abusive relationship. In the 7 years since leaving the relationship I never once felt the way I did when I was being controlled and manipulated. Then, something my boyfriend said triggered me, and I became the powerless person I once was. Once I came out of it... it took me a while to even realize what happened. I was scared and confused. Then I finally realised that I was brought back to my trauma. I cam to the realization that I never processed that abuse and trauma... 

So now... here I am 7 years later trying to remember the abuse I forced myself to forget. Has anyone had anything like this happen to them? 

It's also hard because my boyfriend doesn't understand any of this. He's trying the best he can and is being supportive but he doesn't know anything about the effects of trauma or abuse. He feels guilty because what he said was the trigger, and it's hard to get through to him that it wasn't him, it could have been anyone. 

I just wanted to put this out there and get people's thoughts. See if anything like this has happened to someone else. I thought I had resolved and come to terms with the abuse... but now I know that pushing it into the dark isn't the way to process it.",08Oct2018,1

135,"Throwaway - people in my life know what my actual username is. Sorry this is SUPER long, but I feel like my spirit and heart and everything is in a really bad place.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: We had a thing for \~a year. A lot of happy times and memories, but tumultuous. I'm not in the best place with my mental health, and I did some things to hurt him. I was apologetic and owned up to the things I did, and we stopped talking for a while in April. I should've just cut it off completely then - but I was so in love with him, so I chased after it. We started talking again in May. There were so many red flags. He would talk badly of his exes a lot, say how the sex was bad but they did it all the time....if you keep reading you'll see why now I wonder if his victimized his exes into sex. It's all too haunting for me to think about right now.

&amp;#x200B;

He wanted commitment SO BADLY (side note: we actually stopped talking last November too because 3 weeks after meeting, I turned him down asking me out because I didn't want to move too fast. He got angry and said things to insult me. First big huge ass RED FLAG). In May I told him I'm really struggling generally with life/narcissistic family/college, and I needed some time to not date while I'm in therapy, and he mutually agreed and said he would be around to support me. Until 2 weeks ago, he seemed okay and happy with just supporting my mental health and we were getting along swimmingly. Until he blew up when he asked me again ""to date him, and that I could just fix my issues while dating"", I said no, he said I ""was treating him poorly for not dating him, everything's your fault, you strung me along, etc."", and we stopped talking.....this time it's for good. Thank God.

&amp;#x200B;

In general, he was physically rough. He always said he didn't know even when I told him, but he would like to grab my boobs in public all the time, and make up the most bullshit excuses like ""oh I thought that was your stomach"". I'm just not the confrontational type but looking back on it, why didn't I do something more?! He would pull my hair when he kissed me and would touch/grab me really roughly, but whenever I EVER approached him later telling him about it, he would get agitated and say, ""you didn't tell me when it was happening, so that's on you to tell me"". He would make ""jokes"" whenever I would say things as part of other conversations, such as ""oh that sounds dumb"" or ""that's kinda gross"", and he would say ""you sound really dumb"" or ""you're gross"". I told him to stop but he never did.

&amp;#x200B;

But as I'm reflecting on everything now that it's all said and done....I think he sexually assaulted me. Multiple times. It's not even in my vocabulary to say it happened to me. There were 3 major incidents, but there's honestly probably others I've forgotten.

&amp;#x200B;

1. One time he wanted to make out in a very public building in our college. I thought it'd be a quick kiss but he pulled me towards him really roughly. I couldn't pull away but I was visibly trying to, and I was trying to tell him ""hey I think we shouldn't do this now"". But before I could do that, his hands were underneath my shirt and my bra and he was squeezing my boobs. I tried to say ""no"" and I know he heard me but it wasn't until I said it again a 2nd time that he stopped..... he said he didn't hear me.
2. We were messing around one time and our clothes were off, and I had made it clear earlier that I'm not ready to have sex with him, but when we were cuddling, he tried pushing himself inside me. I got really irritated and he laughed it off.
3. The WORST one for sure. We went to a party and he had left his stuff in my house. We went to drink after the party and it was late so I said he could stay over instead of having to come back, grab his stuff, and still have to transit back to his place. I had really bad allergies for some reason, so that night I took my medication - but it makes me really groggy and I can sleep sometimes 12-14 hours after taking it. I told him this, and I went to bed. Around 7am or so I feel something, but I'm in this barely awake state, so basically still asleep. I'm 100% sure this happened though. His hands were underneath my underwear and he was touching me, and his hard-on was pressing against my leg. I was SO tired from the medication, I didn't say anything. To this day I don't know why I didn't say anything. I confronted him later, and he denied it. He FINALLY owned up to it and admitted, ""oh, but we messed around before so I thought it was okay."" I WAS ASLEEP!

&amp;#x200B;

My mind is A MESS. I don't even know - it's hard to fathom that someone who looks so good on the outside, and that everyone loves, someone I trusted so much - sexually assaulted me. I don't even want to call it that because it makes me feel so disgusting, vomity, and so sick to my stomach that I didn't do anything or say anything when I had the chance to. Even when I texted him this morning to try to get closure, again he made it sound like everything, the way it turned out, was my fault that I ruined it. Sigh. I just needed to get this off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Guy I was seeing had a real problem with boundaries and was physically rough although I told him many times about it, and he was rude to me. Sexually assaulted me 3 or more times and I'm finally coming to terms with it and I don't know what to do/think. Where do I go from here?",08Oct2018,1

Today, I had the scariest episode yet. 

I was pumping gas, and it was taking a particularly long time to read my card. As I was standing waiting, I lost my memory. Everything was gone. I looked up in horror as I couldn’t remember where I was, who I was, what I was doing. My fiancé was in the car and I turned around, terrified, and didn’t recognize him. I snapped out of it and couldn’t form words. I couldn’t think and I felt really faint. He realized I wasn’t okay and rushed to my aid, and took over for me. 

I cried a lot after because I was so upset that I forgot my fiancé of all people, as he’s the most important person in my life. 

I drove back for classes tomorrow but I can’t stop thinking about what happened. I feel like I need serious help but I don’t want my grades to slip.

139,"So i just turned 21 last spring and everything has been going fine till about a month ago. Recently my parents asked to loan some money from me to get some food for the house pay on some bills, etc. so i ended up loaning them what eventually turned out to be almost 500 dollars(i'm a full time worker trying to save money for future purchases and just live and have fun). About a few weeks ago one of our cats got sick and because of their bad reputation with the local vet they couldn't take the cat to the vet without paying for treatment upfront. Needless to say they came to me to ask for another 170 dollars just for that. The cat ended up passing later in the week. In the midst of all of this they kept mentioning to me how they didn't know how they were gonna pay the water and electric bill. My mom which had just lost her job to a recent passing of an elderly man she had been taking care of for a couple of years now had found a job right after she lost the original job. They had ended up then borrowing money from my Step-dad's father to pay for a little on each of the water and electric bills. Obviously i have not seen any of this money so from what money i had saved in the past few years(which was little because like a young person i like video games, going to events, etc.) i had hardly any left. Then this week had started off with my parents telling me that the phones were going to be shut off and they weren't going to be turned back on. So now i must get my own phone plan which for as young as i am isn't cheap because i have no credit thus far. I have a girlfriend almost three hours away at college which understands my situation, but i feel she shouldn't have to be not talked to when i'm not on wi-fi especially living that far away alone mind you. So i conclusion to this cluster of a situation i ask what should i do? I have no idea. They would be little help considering they dont know what to do to get on the right track anymore i guess.

TL:DR: Me and my best friend had a falling out because of some stupid relationship confusion, she proceeded to demonize, abuse my emotions, and physically threaten me, so I cut her off with equally harsh words. Was I wrong in what I did?

(Note: the TL:DR is very watered down, theres much more to the story)








A little bit of background, me and this girl have been friends since 10th grade, we are now 12th graders. We had become really good friends with a complete trust in each other, telling eachother things that we wouldnt normally talk about, like how I was crushing on one of our friends, which I dont like to talk about much. I wont mention the secrets she talked about because its private to her, but they were deep. I thought I knew her so well. This sort of thing didnt happen much, as I am an awkward, introverted loner who didnt really appreciate being touched, which is an important detail for later. She had revealed that she had a crush on me, which I was happy about at first, because I felt the same, or atleast I thought I did. I decided that id try things out and see if they worked, but I was still a bit skeptical, because of how independent of a person I was, I didnt know if I was ready for a relationship. She knew this, and knew I was very reluctant to accept. On that same day, it was full of tight squeezes, constantly being together, and a 40 minute phone call not 1 hour after school ended, I was beginning to feel overwhelmed. The next day, it gets worse, and she told me something along the lines of ""She was having panic attacks and the thought of being around me was the only thing that calmed her down, and that she had been thinking about me the whole day."" I had always been one to care about others, but that made me greatly uncomfortable, and I wasnt sure I could do this. I told her multiple times that she was going way too fast and that I was feeling pressured, and she said she understood, but never slowed down, thats when I knew I wanted to get out of it. I told her that id spend the weekend thinking it over and come to a final decision, but before I could, she texts me later saying that she could tell I wasn't comfortable, and that we should pretend none of this ever happened. I quickly agreed, and told her that I felt the same, but was trying to figure out how to say it without hurting her. I guess that was the wrong answer. She then moved on to say that she was really frustrated that I led her on like this, and that I should have just come clean from the beginning, and that she would see me again monday after she cooled down. I said I understood and that I was sorry, I was ready to take the blame, because I did deserve it. However, the next day I get a phonecall out of the blue, and when I said hello, she calls me an idiot, and asked me why I picked the phone up, as if I was supposed to just let it ring. I knew she wouldnt be cool on monday, so I decided to give her until Teusday, and spent monday with my other friends. She responded by showing up in my parking space after school, and sitting on my Motorcycle to prevent me from leaving. I asked her wtf she was doing, as I was all geared up and ready to leave, but she wanted answers. She asked a few questions, and I responded truthfully:

""Why were you avoiding me?""

Me: ""Because I figured you werent going to be ok to talk today...I guess I was right.""

""Why did you lie about saying you liked me?""

Me: ""I didnt, I told you I felt the same, and that I was willing to give it a shot.""

""Then why did you act the way you did?""

Me: ""You were smothering me, even after I said things were too fast.""
(Also I forgot to mention, even though we were a thing for a few hours, she proceeded to tell her parents and our friends we were a thing, despite my protests)

""Oh, so its my fault then?""

I proceeded to stand there and try and think of an answer that wasnt me just saying ""Yeah, it is your fucking fault, and now your here keeping me from my Motorcycle.""

""Of course its my fault, its always my fault""

I couldnt respond to that before she continued.

""You know what you did was really shitty, I dont think I can trust you for awhile my dude. You are kind of a shitty person.""

Me: ""Are you angry with me?""

""Im trying really hard not to hate you, and if I did hate you, id probably be hitting you right about now.""

I wasnt worried about her hurting me, im a much bigger person than she was, and I could shrug it off. At that point, I was starting to consider just cutting her off then and there, but I kept holding on, this was my best friend were talking about. I went home and brought it up with another friend who knew about this because she was a friend of both of us.  our mutual friend said that what she was doing wasn't right, and that I should cut her off, and I thought about it longer, and decided id do it, after all, a friend wouldn't call someone shitty for being confused about his emotions, and wouldn't threaten to hit him over some 30 hour relationship. This is where I start feeling a little guilty, I knew exactly what to say to hit her hard, and I did it, wanting my message to get through. I told her to leave my life alone (bonus points for whoever can identify the song I was quoting, ill give you a hint, its a Scorpions song.) and that I was very displeased with how she didnt take any responsibility, and didnt appreciate how she was treating me, completely disregarding my feelings. I guess this is when reality hit her, because at first I got a few confused texts, then I got texts of her begging for me to forgive her, and that she was sorry. I reinforced my words, saying that I dont believe her apologies, as I was told by our mutual friend that her blocking my exit to talk was supposed to be an apology, and that I didnt care about her or her problems anymore, I know that was the line that really hurt her. I get a text from her mother, saying that her daughter was afraid of losing me as a friend, and that she knew I was a good person whod do the right thing in the end. I texted the mom saying I was insulted by her getting involved, and that if her daughter actually cared, she would have thought about what she was doing before doing it. I get one final text the next day saying she was apologizing, and said it was because of her insecurities about herself and being loved. I still came through with harsh words, saying that all I read was her making excuses, and that its not ok to use her insecurities as grounds to abuse my emotions, and told her that she never once stopped to think about how I felt through any of it, and told her once more to get the hell out of my life. I haven't spoken to her since, and its been a few weeks. She cut our mutual friend off because they didnt immediately demonize me, and I heard from others that she had gone from quirky and cheerful in her classes to flat out depressed. Many people are opinionated about this, some saying I was right, many saying I was wrong, so now I come here, to the land of unbiased strangers to give me their honest thought, am I in the wrong? Was I too harsh with what I said?",08Oct2018,1

We dating 3 years ago and she has remained a good friend through it (also she is still on my phone plan so it's hard to cut contact with her). We used to get into BAD fights that a few times resulted in physical abuse. I am the kind of person that forgives stuff easily and I see her only as a friend. I told my current girlfriend pretty soon into the relationship and we have been fighting ever since. She thinks that my ex is still manipulating me and I can't get through to her. It doesn't come up at all until alcohol is involved, then every time it becomes an all out screamfest because we are too stubborn to change our options on the matter. We always come to the resolution about ""talking it out sober"" but then end up ignoring it entirely. This has been the only thing we fight about but it is exhausting and has caused our relationship to fall apart. ",08Oct2018,1
142,"long story short i knew this kid who in 6th grade was like every other kid and was smarter than average. in 7th grade things got a little worse and changed like most kids do, got a bit more mature and doing bad things. in 8th grade is where things really took a turn, he started drinking and smoking which isn’t out of the ordinary but he had developed a very addictive/sociopathic personality and just got worse and worse. lots of drugs involved and for unrelated reasons i moved schools (still in the same city, parents just didn’t like the high school). so he turned into a drug dealer and tbh i’m not really sure how bad the extent of things are but i do think that he has done harder drugs since then. so he went from a friend to a drug dealer. around mid summer i sent him like 100 dollars and at this time he already owed me but i thought since i lived near him he couldn’t do much to scam me. weeks pass and i keep asking him where my stuff was and he kept making up bs excuses that i obviously didn’t believe. fast forward and school starts, since it’s only 100 dollars i don’t mind too much but i tried to get in contact with him but he’s blocked me on snapchat. i call him, no response, try all other social media’s and he blocks me there too. i finally get him to pick up but since my school ends earlier than his he’s in school and he says i’ll call you back later. understandable. now he is completely non responsive. in my situation, where my parents are pretty lenient in general, what should i do? i’ve thought about handling it myself by kicking his ass (another story, i have a location tracker on him through i message lol). i can’t just leave the house though because my parents will ask me about it. i could make something up but i don’t want to risk it. should i just let it go? it’s kind of ticking me off but it’s not THAT important. i really want to smoke(weed) and i don’t have any connections other than him. i have social anxiety and i don’t want to fuck with adults. can you guys help?",08Oct2018,1

144,"Today, I was volunteering at a concert. I had a small cough but nothing Serious. We got in the car with my dads friend and some friends of his friend. One of them was pretty cute too. I was in the back of a van crammed with seven people. And driving down the highway all of the sudden I lost my breath completely. I couldn’t breath at all. I kept coughing and coughing, any time I’d try to take a breath I would barely get a small one in before coughing some more. And I threw up twice. All over my shirt, my pants, my bag, seatbelt, inside my bag, my things I got at the mall while we waited for the concert. I was so embarrassed and I still kept coughing my eyes were watering I couldn’t even take a drink. And after like 15 minutes it stopped. And I was so embarrassed I was on the verge of tears... we got there and someone laughed and said it looked like I sneezed all over my shirt. I cleaned up most of it with a paper towel. But I was trying not to cry all through the concert and I don’t think ever be able to talk to that cute guy again.... on top of that there was an issue with our volunteer tickets and we went to 3 doors had to wait 30 minutes and mid concert my dad bought me a new shirt because I smelt like vomit... it was awful. My life has been pretty crap lately, my mom abandoned us, 2 of my friends pets died, no matter how hard I try I can’t find a job, my brother failed his driving test, everyone in my house is sick, my sister got all the way to her friends homecoming dance and they wouldn’t let her in because her friend never turned in the paperwork. I was pretty embarrassed and practically on the verge of tears the whole time. And I don’t know what I should do... he is the first guy I’ve liked in a long time... and now I feel like he will think  I’m gross... I wouldn’t have went but I felt fine it was just a small cough.

146,"The only advice I can find for dealing with “toxic” (I hate the word) people is to cut them out. I know that’s obviously a huge part of it, but even when I cut contact with people who are abusive or manipulative, I still find myself ruminating about them and what they did to hurt me. It can ruin my mood for hours or even days. It’s especially hard knowing that they are still out there influencing people’s opinions of me, probably spreading my secrets, and treating other people the same way I was treated. 
Is there any way to process and move forward from this? Some way to lessen the anger? Does it just take time? I’m not expecting or asking for an apology from the people in question because they don’t care. ",08Oct2018,1

I chose and art class because I like creating art (when I get around to it). 
Well, the art classes are once a week for 3 hours and I hate going. I've only been to 4 so far and I can hardly get through them. Im so bored and impatient in the class. Part of me wants to stop going because I dont enjoy it, so what's the point? But then I worry that I'm failing again and giving up too soon. I fear that if I sign up for the IT program, I will flunk out of that too.

149,"Here’s the story : I work with a woman who claims she has a stalker and tells anyone with ears about it. She likes to find people at the office who are not busy to complain to and tell them about her “stalker”. At first I believed her but one time she said the stalker got into the building and she freaked out the security guys, they reviewed footage and checked everyone’s badges, had us on lockdown a few times and they found no one coming in that wasn’t an employee and didn’t have a badge, they even set up a camera to view her desk for two weeks and there was no one that went to her desk like she claims. 

Ive had to wait for a bit for my husband to pick me up on a few occasions and I was at my desk once, I heard her walking down the aisles talking to herself and I put my headphones in and turned my back to the entrance of my cube looking down at my phone, thinking it would save me from getting stuck with her and nope she continued to say my name and then tapped me on the shoulder, when I didn’t turn around she pulled my headphone out and proceeded to complain about her stalker. I was pissed, it’s after work and I didn’t want to hear her rant. 

I literally have to run and hide when i think she is around and especially if I’m on my break or lunch. If I’m on lunch and she sees me, I will find the nearest bathroom and hide in a stall, what does she do? She goes in there calling my name and if I don’t answer she knocks on stalls! She leaves after like 5 minutes of no answers but that’s 5 minutes I’ve wasted of my lunch time avoiding her. She will NOT leave me alone. Any advice? I don’t wanna be rude because she will FLIP out. She will IM me first thing in the mornings “are you here? Are you there?” If I don’t answer her she will come over and confront me about why I didn’t answer her when my messages pop up on my screen. 

It’s to the point I have to hide, it’s not just me either, it’s everyone at work. I have heard she has a mental illness but I don’t know for sure, but I really just want her to leave me alone. Any advice on how to be nice about it? Although I think to get the point across to her I will have to be somewhat mean about it :(

I love not just clicking on some poor enemy's head and and instantly killing him, but actually having to out play them and be dynamically superior not just aim and positioning. But as I came to find out the game was published by Ubisoft. I normally dont care who makes a product if it's good and made morally. I believe in the separation of art from its artist. Of judging something by it merits and not just its history. But in the case of For Honor I just can't. I've always disliked the idea of being able to buy something that puts me at an advantage over other players and a pvp sense. Star wars battlefront 2 was a perfect example of this. I thought it was despicable that a company would lock being the best behind a separate paywall. Dont get me wrong, I love games like Warframe and Payday 2 despite being able to buy easier gameplay. The way they monetize their game doesn't affect anybody but the player who purchased it. But in a case like for honor it seem kind of scum to allow for a nobility of sort amongst players. Having a higher group of people who can always have something more than me they just bought and didnt earn just isn't okay in my book.

163,"I met an incredible guy and we were inseparable from the moment we started talking, for about three weeks. We talked and hung out almost every day and when I went out of town for a few days, we would facetime each night for hours until we fell asleep. We connected on a deep level and had so much fun together, talking until the sun came up.

He had some pretty big changes transpire in his life; his dog died and he switched jobs into a new industry. Eventually, our time together faltered. He has admitted to being a bad texter, but he would take 4-8-24 hours even just to reply to one text, despite being busy at work. 

I am in college and he is taking a break from school to work. I communicated my desire to have him take me out to dinner for my first day of classes or make me breakfast which he eagerly replied yes! to. The day came and went with no meal together to debrief this big day and I don't think he even knows what classes I am. 

He consistently told me how much he liked me and why. We didn't define our relationship but I know he was not talking to any other girls. (He deleted his Tinder and said, ""You're the only one I want."") Since he has been so hot/cold, I have been talking to and trying to amicably patch things up with an ex so I can pursue this boy. 

I am afraid I care too deeply and love too fiercely, as if I gave him all the eggs in my basket without him giving me a single one. I would make him dinner each night after long days at work, make him lunches and write him sweet notes which he claims to ""love and reread all the time."" I think I might have smothered him with love without much reciprocation. 

After abruptly not talking for a week, I was getting anxious and reached out to see how he had been doing. He replied ""Great!!!! How about you?"" (After 4 hours hahaha). My laundry machine broke and he did a load for me so I asked if I could get it, hoping to see him. He wanted to drop it off that night and hang out although I was frustrated with him for being so distant so I told him I had plans already and the next day would be better. When I texted him the following day, he did not reply. I tried one more time, with no prevail. He has viewed all of my snapchat stories and has yet to text me back. I still have a collection of his things he has left here and I am eager to get my clothes back myself. 

This weekend, I reconnected with my ex and all I could think about was this boy, he is the one I want. I'm worried that he is jealous of my ex (even though he has not addressed the status of that relationship) and it is pushing him away. He broke up with a long term girlfriend in Aprilish and the only other cause for his distance that I can think of is he is not ready for a new relationship. If a guy likes someone so much, why do they hesitate? I hate the limbo and I would like some consistency I'm just not sure how to achieve that.

My bf smoked weed pretty often during high school and still gets shitfaced a few times a month with his friends, which of course I was totally okay with. I didn't party at all in high school, never drank or did any drugs but now that I've graduated I go out usually only two times a month and have some fun. I don't do anything crazy, just drink a little and smoke weed. I've never been black out drunk or anything like that, I've only ever thrown up from drinking once. I always ask my bf if he's okay with it before I go out and ask if he wants to come, and he'll say of course he's fine with it and no because he doesn't like my friends.

Whenever I get home after a night out my bf will insist I come over to his house. I usually don't because I'll be too tired or not sober enough to drive, and he will get very irritated and not talk to me until the next day. And then when we see each other the next day, it's like he's interrogating me. He makes me tell him exactly what I did, who did I talk to, what did I eat, what time did I leave and get back. After I tell him whatever happened he just starts berating me, saying that I'm disgusting and that I shouldn't be acting like that. He says my friends are stupid and they're all idiot stoners and I shouldn't be hanging out with them. He swears he's not mad but still acts super pissed off.

It's  almost been two years (!) but it still stings when I see her face or  hear her name. Today, I made the mistake of checking out her Facebook  profile for the first time in more than a year or so.

Well,  let's just say that she's far, far from the screaming, abusive,  narcissist person who I left all that time back. She's living in Paris  and really living it up, as they say. Fancy, glamorous pictures (with  the guy she cheated on me, btw), win even fancier locations all over the  France and Europe. Money was never a problem for her (her dad's a  Fortune 500 CEO) but it seems like she's really starting to spend it  lol. The reason I mention this is that she's technically still a student  (as was I) so it seems a little strange to me.

In  addition, she's also doing great professionally. She's got an  internship at one of the biggest banks of the city (something which  virtually guarantees you a job when you graduate). She also started a  new college group at her university and passed the CFA level 1 exam with  flying colors.

Look,  I know that life is not a competition and it's silly to get worked up  over this. Yet, it's just that for all the progress that I've (seemingly) made, it seems like I have nothing to show for it. I am so  much more fitter, happier, and mature than I was two years back. But I'm  not the type to brag about it on social media or make my posts public  (as she's done, she's not my FB friend). I also did a long internship in  Copenhagen and got great reviews from my boss(es). Granted, it's not as  glamorous as Paris and I look like a moron in pictures, but it was a  great experience. I also completed a few certifications in a number of different fields, and that was the highlight of my time in Denmark. I've come back home now, since I only had a temporary  contract.

This is where the problem lies  for me... I know I didn't fail, but coming back to my hometown while she gallivants around  Europe with her fancy job and boyfriend make me feel  like crap.

In addition , what bothers me is that she often used to say stuff like this when we were together in university -

1. ""you're one of the stupidest people I've ever met""
2. ""you do nothing all day but sit on your ass""
3. ""your parents are old and don't know shit about how they should raise their children, and hence they raised a moron like you""

Objectively,  it wasn't true.  It seemed like she had a superiority complex over me  or something like that. I had better grades, more achievements, awards,  you name it. I played sports, was in the orchestra, had my own band,  etc. Yet, all these thing REALLY hurt. They still do.

Now,  because of her 'other worldly' achievements, it seems like her words  were true, you know? Maybe I wasn't 'good enough' for her. She often  used to joke saying that she only dated me for my looks but now it seems  like that's what it was. Trust me, that's not a good feeling at all.

I  just feel like shit, honestly. Coming back home has been like the  biggest anti-climax of my life and this shit doesn't help. Would you  guys have any advice for me? Other than to not check her profile (lol)   


Even if it's extremely harsh, I could do with it, trust me. I would really, really appreciate it. Thank you.",08Oct2018,1

I cannot I stop dreaming about my ex-girlfriend. I don't remember my dreams clearly that often, however when I do remember, I always recall her being there. The dream usually consist of us happily spending time together, This happens about 3-5 times a week, and we've been broken up for over 6 months now.  I think the reason I still think about her is because I still loved her when I broke up with her. I didn't want to end my relationship with her but because of how her depression was severly affecting my life, I realized that it wasn't good for me and I had to break up with her. After months apart, I met a new girl at work and we hit it off. However, now we are at a long distance relationship and dreaming of my ex-girlfriend almost daily really makes me question my own feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

I came here to get some advice from you, as many people come for that here.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I noticed that my life doesn't have any sense. By that, I mean that I feel that I don't deserve my life (not a suicidal thought). That many more people would appreciate the place I am now way more.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22 years old, I have a job, apartment to live in and a loving girlfriend (I can no filter with her which is really nice). Still, I feel empty or dead inside. I feel like my life is just a circle I'm walking in. Wake up, go to work, spend time with my GF/friends, sleep and repeat. My life is just a circle without any goal.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger I wanted to be a music producer/DJ. I was happy to work on music as much as I could. In that time I was in school so I came from school and started working on music. 5 years passed away and I was considered as one of the best electronic music producers in my country (at least DJs and producers told me so, even the most famous ones). I know my craft isn't that good as they are saying. But for 2 years I haven't been able to produce a single thing, I have just emptiness inside my head. Tried to learn new things, approach music from different sides, nothing seems to help.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure where I should go in my life now. I don't want to just be here, do the same things every day and then die. How I can get any happiness from my life again? Should I visit and psychologist or psychiatrist?

&amp;#x200B;

Have a nice day everyone!

176,"I was visiting some cousins with my mother over the weekend, and during the course of conversation she brought up the fact that my little brother was an absolute monster of a bully to me, his older sister. This is the first time she has admitted it to anyone outside of the immediate family or publically acknowledged it in any way, and she brought up some extremely unpleasant memories that I had forgotten.

I don't blame my little brother for the things he did. He was too young to know any better and by the time he was old enough to and realised his behaviour was unacceptable he was devastated and extremely apologetic.

I blame my mother and father for never teaching him all of that was wrong. They take zero responsibility for his behaviour even now and that just infuriates me. 

But I should be over this by now. It's been at least 13 years. But it just reminded me how everything that is wrong with my mother's life is never her responsibility.

My father has behaved unacceptably in a number of ways too, and I don't ever want to see him again. But in order to hold our family together, I need to forgive him somehow. I haven't seen him in several years but may not be able to get out of doing so later this year.

I'm trying to balance money and personal fulfillment, although I'm not sure if that even exists for me. I love to write, but getting a degree in writing/english/etc. could financially cripple me for years if not decades, and that's assuming I am ever able to comfortably sustain myself on writing alone. I've thought about careers in the medical field, but I'm in community college for a reason; my grades in high school were painfully average. Medical school is insanely competitive, and I feel like I'm way too behind in subjects like chemistry, physics, and math to actually stand a chance. Math has never been my strong suit at all, so that makes me think that even trying to get into the medical field would result in me dropping out.

I don't want to waste my life away wanting for money. I want enough money to be happy while at the same time enjoying my career. There's no way I'll never pick up a trade; jobs like that hold no feeling of fulfillment to me.

She constantly asked me for money and made me feel guilty for having a better life than her even though I worked for it and she opted to collect disability checks. 

Every few months I’d get a phone call that she was in the ICU from an overdose or a manic episode where she didn’t sleep for a week and fried her brain, and every time I’d drop whatever I was doing to be by her side for as long as she needed me. She’d promise to stop doing drugs and not to stop taking her medicine, but inevitably she’d relapse and end up back in the hospital. 

Earlier this evening I was informed that she’s been diagnosed with lung cancer and has some sort of surgical procedure scheduled on Tuesday.

Now I understand I broke rule one of arguments, (never argue with a drunk person), aswell as rule 2 ( don’t argue while on a Clannad marathon)  but I did so it all went to shit. Anyway we continue talking and me and another friend tell her that we are worried about her as she has a past with depression, anxiety, cutting, etc... and we thought that her choices weren’t the best that she could make and she assures is that she is fine. Then I (stupidity) keep pushing that she should really consider that what she is doing is not good and can lead to other serious problems. I also (again stupidly) begin to ask her medical questions like if she’s still on her medication, and how much she drank.  She continues saying that she’s fine but I’m really worried about her because I’m my eyes if I was in a dark place I would want my friends to come to my rescue (even though I was just making the situation worse) anyway it continues like this until I start to get angry and decided to tell her what I actually thought about her habbbits and it went somewhere along the line of  “why do you even need drugs, they are an absolute waste of money and they aren’t getting you anywhere... blah blah blah... how are you even getting the money to afford this... blah blah blah.... you’re such a kid, your mom leaves for a week and the first thing you do is get fucked up, and for what.... blah blah blah.... you always call me stupid but I guess you can’t even look in the mirror.... blah blah blah...

Blah blah blah... and then I ended up with ‘ok I’m done, just go to bed’”. I’m really worried about her, she has not been making the best decisions lately and I understand that I’m just 18 and I might not know what I’m talking about but I do know for a fact that drinking and smoking weed at our age when the brain is still developing is not ok, especially when that person already has SEVERE mental issues.

187,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. My fiance and I have been together for six years. It has been mainly good, except for a few small hiccups. One thing that hasn't really changed is we have never been financially ok. That is finally changing, which is good, but leads to this. First of all, my fiance has a big close family (lower middle class at best), and my family is extremely small and not very close, due to events that happened while growing up. We recently moved from Wisconsin to Washington. We also are engaged so it leaves one major question. Do we get married in our new home state, or have to fly back to do it there. Reasons why we would do it in Wisconsin, is all of her family is there. If we did it in Washington, very very few, if any of her family would be able to fly here unless we paid for it. Problem is, as mentioned money has always been really tight for us. Now that it is going to get better, it's really hard for me to justify spending a few thousand to get married, as I'd rather put it away. Also doing it back in Wisconsin, we'd have to fly home multiple times (at least twice if we did once for the marriage license and once for the actual marriage). She wants about 10 people at least there for her wedding, but going through a possible guest list, it balloons to over 50, with only 4 people that I want there. We have already accepted the fact that however we do the wedding, we have to fund it 100% ourselves. I have discussed eloping, but her mom did that, and always regretted not having her dad to walk her down the aisle. Because of this, I feel like my fiance wants it a certain way because of the regret her mom has, and always mentions. As we start to talk about a possible date, and start running possible budgets, I cringe because I don't feel it's smart to spend thousands on one day, and would rather put that for a trip or down payment on a house.

190,"I (30f) moved in with an old coworker (31m) over a year ago. I was living with my ex boyfriend and needed to get out of that type of living situation. Before we signed the lease together I made my standards for a living situation very clear. It was not to be a party house, he needed to respect my personal space and the fact that I work early mornings and need my sleep during the week, and to pull his weight. I also told him I didn't want to live with him after the lease was up. He agreed to all of this.

Long story short, he has been a nightmare. He has not cleaned a single thing in this house in over a year. Not a toilet, the shower, he's never dusted or used a vacuum. He drinks my booze and eats my food. He leaves the front door unlocked constantly when no one is home. He rages at all hours of the night. I have talked to him about these things countless times and even though he acknowledges it he doesn't change anything. 

Here is where it gets long so bear with me. 3 months ago our year lease ended and it changed over to a month to month. I sat him down and told him I don't think that we work as roommates and that he needs to move out. He acted understanding and said he would start to look into it. Instead, things got much, much, worse.

He started getting blacked out drunk and sleep walking. We do not have locks on our doors so imagine the terror/shock when I was awoken at 3 a.m. to him, a grown man, busting through my bedroom door COMPLETELY NAKED. I had to physically push him out and I was screaming at him and he had no idea what was going on. As a female, that type of behavior is frightening and I just sat on my floor and cried for the rest of the night. 

The getting naked and roaming the house drunkenly has happened so many times now that my (current) boyfriend refuses to let me sleep in this house without him. My roommate told mutual friends he knows I can't stand him and that my boyfriend hating him over his behavior is comical. He sees nothing wrong with what he does and states my boyfriend is a, ""psycho"" for getting mad about it. 

Now, he has moved his f buddy in. She doesn't pay rent, she's a slob like him, and she's not on the lease. I never gave permission for her to move in. She has been here for over a month and I've told him countless times she needs to go. He agrees but then does nothing. Her stuff overcrowds our house and I feel like I'm trapped in my room because they constantly take over the communal space. 

Icing on the cake was him telling me he would be late on rent last week, then going out partying and spending money the same day. 3 days after that? He announces he quit his job because he ""might"" get a promotion at his second job in a few months. I was at my wits end. Or so I thought until I got home this afternoon..

I went to a friend's house with my boyfriend to watch the fights and because they live kind of far we stayed the night and drove back to my house around 11:30. I get home and the first thing I notice is my cat is m.i.a. and her food bowl has not been touched. I go knock on his bedroom door to see if she's in there and he and the f buddy get real quiet and refuse to answer me. I turn to go into my room and I see a, ""you're about to get pissed"" look on my bfs face. I enter my bedroom and my bed was insanely messed up, my shit was on the floor, my window had been opened, and there was some type of liquid on the carpet. I threw open his bedroom door and he and the girl both panic and I started screaming at them demanding they tell me where my cat is, who was in my room, who the hell had been in my bed, etc. They refused to answer me with anything other than, ""I don't know"" while hysterically laughing. I found my cat a few minutes later locked inside a closet with no food, no litter box, nothing. They both snuck out to hide from me for the rest of the day. 

It is so hard to find a spot in this city that isn't insanely expensive and local to my job. Moving out is my last resort because I paid the security deposit and I know he won't give me 1600 dollars if I leave. He doesn't have that kind of money. I reached out to my property management and they basically told me, ""we can't do anything about obnoxious roommates. Sorry. The owner isn't looking to renew another lease right now."" I told them he has a squatter living here not paying rent and it's a violation of our lease. I feel so helpless. 

I'm mostly venting but any advice would be nice. If you're just going to be insulting or say, ""move out"", you don't understand what it's like to have to move every single year for the past 6 years and feel defeated about constantly losing money because of other peoples short comings.

To begin this dates back about 2 years ago, so I would've been 20 years old. I had my life on track was doing community college, was in a long-term relationship, and was currently working part-time in IT which was / still is my passion. My gf at the time broke up with me for another guy which really fucked up my mental state, it caused me to stop eating, violently vomiting, called out from work for 2 weeks, pretty much stopped going to class, basically became a potato, I never knew someone could even hurt me as much as she did. On top of that my supervisor at my part-time IT job hated me and attempted to get me fired any chance he got. Even went as far to sign up my work email to a lot of gay porn / sex toy catalogs. I always had bad run ins with this supervisor which would eventually contact our boss and i'd have to have mandatory talks with our boss about them. I did contact our boss about my supervisor several times and we held meetings about him.

To kinda wrap this up I ended up just flaking out of community college and took a stupid IT Certificate they offered because I just don't think college was for me and I also just couldn't keep neglecting my classes. Also at my job I was talking to a fellow coworker about work related activities and was waiting on him to finish up something so we could continue on our task we had from the previous day and our boss walks in and literally asks us what we've been up to, which in reality was nothing. In my heart I knew this was the final straw. At the end of the school year (Worked in IT for schools) he handed me my performance sheet and I was marked to not be recommended the following school year, handed in my work badge, he did encourage that I could still talk to him, and use him as a reference, and I left.

I've been fortunate to have an understanding/sympathetic family that have allowed me to essentially rot away in my own room for 2 years. All I have to show right now is my one year of experience working in IT, CompTIA A+ Certification, and my community college IT certificate. I've been looking for IT jobs around my area but everything requires a car which I don't have and I just can't swallow up my pride to work in fast food/retail. There's a lot of things about myself i would like to change but I don't know where to begin. I'm pretty skinny and weak I would like to workout, I know I need dental work because I'm not confident in my smile because I have some chipped teeth a gap between my upper front two teeth. I'm desperately trying to dig myself out of this situation. It's so mind numbing to sit in your room for 2 years and all the things that kept me distracted from the real world have pretty much vanished. I'm stuck with my own thoughts for majority of the day now.",08Oct2018,1

Sorry if this is too long:

Dave (not real name) and I have been best friends since college, we have the same last name so that was a plus. After college he moved to another city for work.

His parents live in the same city as I and they have rental properties. During the year when they travel, his Dad usually gave me his cellphone for emergency contact.

One day I received a phone call from an unknown number, I picked up and said ""Hello"", to which the other end reply ""*Hi, Mr. LastName, this is Jane calling from XXX Lawyer's office, your divorce document is ready for pick up*."" I didn't know what to say, so I just replied ""Ok, I got it. Thank you"". Then hung up.

Now this happened a few months ago and I did not bring it up to anyone. Dave's dad is still on vacation. But when Dave reach out and vent about his relationship with his Dad and stuff. I mentioned to him about my encounter. Now he seems adamant to confirm and find out the details. He asked me to call the Laywer's office and pretend to be his dad, so I can find out more details.

I still have his dad's phone. Should I do it? Will I get in trouble?

202,"My heads all over the shop, and I’m not sure how to explain this or where to begin.

My boyfriend and I’s relationship is in a tough spot at the moment. We hadn’t had sex in about a month or so, and I couldn’t help but feel progressively guilty, like I owed him. He never pressured me during our away off from intimacy, but I knew how badly he wanted it. The pressure came from myself.

To give some context, I’m a rape survivor. So whilst I’ve recovered significantly well thanks to therapy and being kind to myself, my relationship with sex still affects and confuses me sometimes. My boyfriend and I are very open, he knows most details about my life and my history. He knows how I am with sex. 

Last night my guilt got the best of me. When we were making out, things naturally progressed. He was touching me but ultimately I told him to stop, that I just couldn’t go through with having sex. He explained (genuinely) that it could be worthwhile and beneficial for our relationship. 10 minutes later we were at it again, i was touching him, and (out of self inflicted obligation) I offered sex, and he said yes. I said okay, but I’m not into this and I’m only doing it for you, so you will have to do all the work. I understand that I gave consent, I practically forced myself to do that because I guess I just wanted to give him something. 

The thing that’s making me feel messed up is that he went ahead and spoon fucked me whilst I laid there like a dead weight staring at the wall. We didn’t touch or hug or kiss, it was completely mechanical. He finished and I just laid there, wondering why the fuck I just put myself through that. I know I’m to blame, and I haven’t stopped hating myself all day for it. 

He feels awful too, and I feel horrible because I feel as though the entire thing is my fault. I don’t know what to do or think or feel. I don’t even know what that was. I know it’s not rape, but it feels so awful and wrong. Before this night he’s never put a foot out of place in this aspect. He’s always respected me and we have made beautiful love many times, I don’t know where we went wrong. Even though he was under the impression I was ‘okay with it’, I now just don’t know how he could’ve enjoyed it.

Also want to add we’ve had a conversation about it tonight where he admits to knowing it was wrong and not okay, but did it anyway because he thought i didn’t care.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Surprisingly she replied and we began actually talking and having a proper conversation. she said she was my age and went to a school nearby. i have a friend who attend that school so i had her confirm this person was for real and not some pedophile.

I panicked as my parents might've wanted to check my phone/instagram to see what i was up to. in my panic i quickly cut ties with this girl. it was a terrible and shitty thing to do and i understand that, my only excuse was that i was not thinking properly as i was super paranoid and panicked.

208,"So... this is gonna get deep, and personal, and emotional, as I’m dealing with a lot lately and I need some good advice.

This is a lot, so skip to the three horizontal breaks to get to the meat of my issue.

I’m going through my freshman year of college right now, first semester, and lately I’ve felt... lost. Lost about what I should be doing, what I’m actually capable of doing. I’ve always known I’d go to college. It’s what my family expected of me ever since I was a wee little child in the gifted/talented program at my elementary school. “You’re gonna go to college and do great things and be famous, I just know it!” And that followed me all through elementary, middle, and high school. It wasn’t something I wanted to do, it wasn’t something I was really looking forward to, it was just... something I was going to have to do. The next step. That’s what everyone does, right? First school, k-5, then middle, 6-8, then high, 9-12, then college, get a degree, start a career... that’s what everyone does, that’s what was expected of me and what I knew my life would end like. But now that I’m here... I enjoy the freedom, yes, but the schoolwork is... crushing. Things have always worked out in my favor one way or another in the past, but... now I know they won’t. I’m not doing well in classes, to put it lightly, and I know I’m not going to be able to pass. And besides that, lately, wherever I am... I long to be somewhere else. My hometown is within driving distance of my campus, about 47 minutes one way, so it’s not hard to go there and back on the weekends. But lately, for the last couple weeks, when I’m home, I long to be back on campus, with drinking and smoking and adventures and finding out who I am with all my new friends. But when I’m on campus, I want to go back home, to simplicity and an easy life with no responsibilities and friends I’ve had for years and years and years. No matter where I am, I want to be somewhere else, someone else. Not someone that sits around, ignoring his email for fear one day the, “you’re doing so bad you have to move out of your dorm and drop out” email will show up, running away from every ounce of responsibility beyond household chores. Not someone that cuts friendships that have lasted for years over three mistakes. Not someone that... doesn’t do anything. Someone that runs away from every problem in their life. But that’s who I am. Do I want to be someone that will get a good amount of rest, go to class, study hard, but still have time for friendships? Yes, of course I do. Do I want to be someone that can maintain good money sense and a job on top of college work to ease my debts? Obviously. But I’m not that person. So here comes to the point where I need advice.

***
***
***

I want to drop out of college after this semester, move in either with my parents again or with my best friend, save up a bunch of money working, maybe start a gofundme for extra supplementary money, pack up some of my things, and hit the road, driving from place to place until I’m finally old enough to stop, sit down, and look back without regrets. I know it will cost a lot, in gas, food, shelter, water... I know it goes against everything I’ve grown up to be... but in a way, it fits me. I’ve never felt more at home than I do behind the wheel, and I’ve never felt more myself than when I’m running away from my problems. So what better way to spend my life than doing exactly that, driving far away from all that worries me until I’ve run far enough away that it can’t worry me anymore?

I really want advice on either A) how can I go about pulling this off, B) what should I expect for finances and problems, C) how should I break this to my family, that expects so much of me, and D) how stupid am I for wanting to waste these opportunities I have to go driving for the rest of my life?

in my 5th year of high school i would normally pass,but midterm december i got called out and i had to go back to the 4th year and redo it, the committee at my last school had let me pass to the course i wanted even though i didn't succeed and i was thankful for that,but it came back to bite me. Eventually i gave up and i just repeated my 4th year and so on until i graduated. I met many wonderful people in my last high school, teachers who cared for me and a mentor who got me through my last year, if it wasn't for them i doubt i would have passed.

I followed a course that focused on computers/programming and economy,since i naturally loved computer related stuff since i was a child. That kinda changed as i saw what programming and so on involved, i saw Visual basics and C# to some extend and a little of html, This was in high school.

I sucked at programming,but as long as i made progress and showed that i made effort and my programs were half decent my teacher told me i would pass,he was one of the people who helped me a lot and stayed often to give me extra lessons. Eventually i passed but he gave me some serious advice:"" Don't go into programming,until you're 100% committed.""   


I was pretty fazed by that, i had always wanted to do programming or at least something like it, game designer or developer or something alike, and to hear that it crushed my dreams, and i pretty much gave up on it. During those years i saw all my friends move on, some even graduated already, and to this day i keep reminding myself of how much of a failure i am, still comparing myself to them,this only gets worse with my asperger's that makes my mind go cray cray.

During those years in high school i was very school sick, i just wanted to quit but i managed to get through. After i graduated, i had 2 months or so to make a choice on what course/direction i wanted to go in. I ended up selecting a random community college with my mom's help and select a Course named multimedia and technology that had html,photoshop along with some hardware section classes, math and another software(no coding though) related class. 1,5 years and i could get access to go for a bachelor,but i wasn't motivated at all, hated the classes and all of the people in it, now i am at a point where i just want to quit. To clarify i don't see myself using photoshop,designing websites nor any of that stuff.I just want a successful job where i wont hate myself and that i can enjoy for a long time.  


duo to stress, i skip a lot of days,my stomach just cramps up and i get vomit vibes and a slight case of social anxiety, each time i start to think about all of this stuff, especially when i think of going to school.

219,"Note: You can see my previous post for more background on this

So basically since my last post me and my girlfriend recently “broke up”, she neglected me for too long and didn’t care enough about me, she had no problem moving on, she didn’t seem bothered by it.

Literally within an hour of us breaking up she was talking to someone else and since then, she spends every minute she is awake in contact with him.

This hurts me lots to see because I thought the world of this girl, she meant soo much to me.

Now she is gone I don’t want to do anything, I don’t enjoy things that I used to do with her and we did everything together, it feels wrong to even try and do anything on my own.

She made me choose her over all my friends so they don’t want to be around me now, our other circle of friends heard her side of the story and she made me out to be a monster, so they don’t want anything to do with me.

When I’m not at work I just lay on my bed wondering what is so wrong with me, I don’t want to get up, I just lay there sobbing wondering what I could’ve done more, but nothing comes to mind.

About 2.5 months ago I had sex with a friend of mine ( friends with benefits)... previously she had 2 boyfriends who have slept with multiple girls

I didn’t really worry about stds and thought she was clean.... few days ago I did a std test for hiv and syphillis and others because the university I’ll be going to required it. And at the same time j noticed a small sore like thing in my Penis which is a symptom of syphillis so I’m kinda sure or scared I might have it .

My worry is if I do have it my mum will find out as the test results first go to her. In her eyes and our culture usually one has sex after marriage and I know she’d me mad and disgusted and upset at me.... I don’t k ow what to say or explain to her.... should I just say I only kissed her.?

I don’t know who it is, but I have locked myself in the living room out of fear of someone coming. I’m so fucking scared right now. Is it the police? The teachers? The commune? Fuck, I don’t know. I may be overthinking this, but I’m afraid to even get close to the door now.

235,"I've been friends with this guy for 4 years now. We were really close for 3 of those years, but this year things have been going downhill fast. It started when he started trying to assume full ownership of a Teamspeak server we started together two years ago. I didn't think it was fair that he was trying to take over something that we had both payed for and started together. We didn't talk for a while until I initiated a conversation with him trying to resolve things. He said that he was sorry and we resumed co-ownership. Until this year when the exact same problem came up again. This time it took a full awkward week of ignoring each other at school to get the conversation, which I once again initiated, to happen. This time things were a lot more ugly and I found myself becoming depressed over it and so, despite feeling betrayed and angry as I was, I attempted to cool things down and I eventually succeeded. I knew after that that the friendship was one sided and that I mattered less to him than he did to me. I feared that things would change after that and sure enough they did. Since then there has been ongoing tension between us, despite what it might look like to an outsider. I found myself starting to resent being and talking to him and we started fighting over stupid things a lot more and being unable to agree on much. The cherry on top is what inspired me to write this post. We are both in our final year of school and every year some people from the grade volunteer to make a farewell video for the valedictory ceremony. We volunteered to do the project together and that was that. Now, just before the video is due to be completed, we have not managed to agree on what to do. He is insisting that I allow him to make it by himself which I find horribly unfair as we committed to this project together and he is trying to back out only a day before it is due. He refuses to co-operate with me despite my best efforts and feels like the only solution is to make it himself. The problem is that we have a lot of the same friends and are part of the same groups that go out together so I can't really avoid him unless I'm willing to stop going out altogether. I am more or less certain that I want to terminate the friendship next year when I leave school but until then I don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",08Oct2018,1

237,"Hello I'm a man im 20 I use a wheelchair and  have aspergers syndrome and I've never had a girlfriend . This year I had a operation to help me improve my walking, and was given a physical therapist to help me with my rehabilitation. I had known her for 2 to 3 months and has sessions in a pool with her every week , and long story short I became infatuated with her. She was everything I wanted in a women she was beautiful funny very sarcastic, which I liked because Im also very sarcastic she was also 8 years older then me . In the first week I had one on sessions with her everyday. Im usually very Shy when meeting new people, I usually have to know them for a while before coming out of my shell. But when I first met her she said, something about how I made one of the other physical therapist laugh. So I decided I would be as confident as I could be try to make her laugh. It worked the more I spoke to her the more relaxed I became, soon it became easier for me to talk to this beautiful amazing woman, then it was to talk to any other women. We spoke about TV, religion, family, we were different races and from different countries so spoke about what it was like growing up. We were always joking around and making fun of each other constantly.

In that first week she off handedly told me she had a boyfriend while talking about something else I tried to let go of my infatuation for her but couldn't. After that first week I had to wait 5 weeks for another appointment with her in time she was all I could think about. I didn't have much of a social life because I had taken a year off from college to have this operation. I couldn't go out any and the two best friends I had from high school were always busy but we always talked online. When I finally got another session with her it was great when I was with her however, I had been moved to group sessions and didn't get as much time with her. My life revolved around filling time until I could be with her again. And over the course of those few months I realised that although we got along the attraction and the feelings were one sided. She only sure me as a nice patient and probably saw me as a kid. It hurt I mean it really hurt knowing she didn't feel the same way, but whenever I was with her race religion age non of that mattered, and I always fooled myself into thinking she liked me back.

Near the end I was getting more and more depressed about the situation and even the joking around wasn't enough, I know it was irrational but when she would joke or poke fun at me in a flirty way I'd resent it and her. It felt like she was playing with my feelings even though she had no idea how I felt because I never told her.

I felt worthless near the end because I didn't have many friends at the time much of a social like compared to her 

I felt like I could never compare to her boyfriend I'd never met I was short I couldn't walk I was still living with my parents I was probably the opposite of what she wanted in a man she was out of my league. 

She told me she was transferring to another hospital its been a month since she left. I was crushed for a long time and still am.

I stated studying computer science at college and I realised not only did I hate the subject which I had some idea of because I have done abit in high school but there were no girls in the class. 

Because I used a wheelchair I couldn't sit in the stands with other students and I had to put extra effort in to try and make friends. I was fine with this but not with doing a job I hated with a class I didn't really get along with and having zero chance of meeting women.

 I dropped out this week and I'm going to retake a few exams privately and decided what I want to do career wise.

But my biggest fear is that I'm never going to find a girlfriend get married and have a family.

That what I felt for the physio therapist won't be reciprocated by another girl. ",08Oct2018,1
238,"**A little bit of backstory** : She's not my biological sister, but a family friend of ours. We got to know each other back in high school, but met later again in college. We both are single kids, so she decided that we both stick to being siblings to fill the void in our lives. 


We both are 22 years old now, and things went to shit 3 years ago when we were in college. 

Things were fine in the beginning. We were in the same college, but different classes. We used to spend some quality time together whenever possible. She used to drop by my house almost every weekend unannounced just to spend some time with me. She was so loving, caring, just like any other sister would be to her brother. 

2 years go by, and somewhere in the middle she started to change. She started hanging out with the wrong group of people - junkies, fuck-ups, and god only knows what kind of people, but definitely not good. Now, as like any other responsible brother, I confronted her because i was worried about her well being and told her to be careful who she hangs out with. We go back and forth, and I tell her times and times to stop hanging out with those wrong group of people, but she wouldn't budge. 

I was going through my own share of problems, and i didn't want to get deeply involved in her matters, so i stopped meeting her or maybe talking to her altogether. 

2 years go by, we graduate from college, and i get a job. I was happy with my life, and truth be told, I forgot about her very existence. I had too much on my plate anyway. 

After a few months, she pops up at my place unannounced which caught me in a moment of surprise. She started crying, cursing, and made a huge scene. She even went as far as slapping me. I try to calm her down, but she wouldn't. She started talking about the past, and asking the reason as to why i stopped talking to her. She told me that i'm nothing more than a self serving brother who's obsessed with the pride of keeping the spotlight all to myself, and keeping her in the shadows forever. She then told me that she lost all her friends in these two years, and that i was never there for her when she needed the most. She started abusing me that she cared and loved me, whereas i never really cared about her at all, and that she always hung out at my place, and I've rarely dropped by her place and whatnot. Drama ensued to put it in one piece. 

Just to make her happy and to calm her down, i apologize for everything over the years of treating her like a piece of shit. 

I even went as far as spending time with her on her birthday two weeks later. Things were fine, and i used to take a couple of hours every month to spend some quality time with her at her place. This ensued for a couple of months, until i found out that she's still hanging out with those assholes, so i decided to stop going to her place. 

I thought, maybe if i stop going to her place, she'll come around my place, but she never did because she knows that i know that she still hangs out with those people even today. 

It's been a couple of months now. She called me twice about meeting me but she never came.

I spent my early childhood in a city opposite side of the country and left when I was 7, I spent my first 2 years of school (and preschool) there and had quite a few friends with common interests (most of their names have since drifted out of memory but I was still able to recall a few), when I left to a whole different city I left them all behind and haven't had any contact since.

About a week ago I was shuffling through old school photo books and the names and faces of my old friends flew right back in my memory and I decided to do a quick search of them on Instagram, to which I'v certainly found the profiles of the friends I left behind many years ago, I haven't followed or interacted with any of them but I'v kept note of their usernames.

I have always been keen on any kind of photomanipulation and general graphic design. Well, I have also always been kind of good at Maths.

In high school I've learned that it's not necessarily true that if you are good at something, you should do it then. I started disliking Maths and Physics and I see no place for me in those kind of fields. However, I started thinking seriously about taking digital art as my future career. The problem is that the exams for those are in June and I am not really the best in neither drawing nor painting. I used to go to drawing classes but the woman that had been teaching us, went abroad. And the other school in my city was closed. Thinking about going back to tech subjects makes me furious and I really can't see myself going through 5 years in a tech uni.

I've been looking online at apartments in my price range and area, as well as paying attention to reviews, and I've found a few that I think I could make work, though nothing makes me really excited. 

I have a few questions.  First, I probably won't move out until late December, early next year, once this semester ends. Does it make sense to contact possible places now and ask for tours, or should I be waiting until the move in date is closer?

What should I be checking for on these tours? I've been reading online reviews, and every single complex in my range has both positive and negative reviews.  I've already eliminated some because of issues that popped up in multiple reviews, but I haven't found a place with all positive reviews. ",08Oct2018,1
256,"I'm supposed to do an industrial placement for my degree in management. I've applied to over 100 companies now, I've gotten to interview plenty of times; I have a decent amount of work experience/volunteering for my age so it helps  me out quite a bit in the early stages.

&amp;#x200B;

But once I get to interview it's a different story; I pretty much forget all my preparation and barely perform. I am really  self-conscious about how I look, doctors say I have Body Dysmorphic Disorder. All I can think about in an interview is that I look like some kind of freak and there's no way the employers can take me seriously. I work as much as I can on my flaws, being strict with diet etc and I plan to get some cosmetic surgeries done with the money my internship makes - I've been trying to use ""just get through this year"" as a motivator to not care about what people think but I guess it's not working.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't even know what advice I expect I guess. Feel like I'm probably the last guy looking for a placement that has to do one, really just fucked.

Okay, so hugs.

I don't trust my family, hugs, they put you in a vulnerable position, I only hug people that I trust, or love enough to put the trust thing to the back of my mind, and I don't love my family (Except for my auntie)

Touching, hugs involve touching, which is another reason I refuse to do them, I hate it when people touch me, I'll put up with it if it's a kid, kids aren't dangerous.

I hate being touched, I hate it so much.

Kissing, everyone tried to kiss me on the lips, I don't mind kissing kids on their forehead or cheeks, but on the lips, no that's gross, I see kisses on the lips as a romantic thing, I'll only kiss my girlfriend or boyfriend on the lips. I will not kiss someone anywhere if they want me to kiss them on the lips.

I have made my discomfort with kissing, touching, and hugging, known every single time, but they still try and do it. Especially my mum, she tried to get me to give her a kiss ON THE LIPS not long ago. Like no, it's gross, she tried to BLACKMAIL me into doing it.

She got grumpy and annoyed when I said I gave my auntie a kiss and a hug, but I gave my auntie a kiss and a hug because I love her, and she's never wanted to kiss me on the lips.

Yet everyone just keeps trying to, and it's getting too much, I swear to god I will HURT them if they do it again, if only to make them stop, since my words just aren't getting through. They won't listen! How am I supposed to make them stop without violence if they won't listen?

I can't afford a place by myself and  I've tried living with random roommates before and both times it's been an awful experience (two Tim's that wore body paint, didn't shower for months, walked around naked and slept together naked. And a guy from India that refused to pay bills, rent on time and had someone cook for him, leave the house a mess and leave). So I'm not interested in roommates, I'm also a loner. I have no siblings, no gf and I don't live with my parents who split years ago. 

My goal is to save enough to go to Germany and if I like it apply for a youth mobility visa. 

Rent is obviously my biggest expenditure as I don't really do anything outside of work. I need to cut my rent to save while still being able to make other through winter (or else I'd just camp in a tent).

265,"So I chickened out for some reason so I’m posting this now...

It’s hard to reduce a relationship to bullet points so here it goes... every time I spend I significant amount of time with my friend I feel deliriously happy and confused.  If this were just a friend I happened to like I’d ask her straight out but she’s so tied into my life I’m not sure what to do.  I’m worried about cutting her out cold turkey because of my own emotions.  I haven’t been stick around as a friend because I wanted to sleep with her, I really really like her as a person.

So here’s a rough outline of everything

1. We’ve known each other almost 2 years, but only got close over the last 8 months or so.
2.  We always go out on romantic dinners, she refuses to do anything casual with me like lunch...she’ll bring up the fact she met one of our mutual friends for lunch, but never ever wants to me me for lunch, only dinner, drinks or at her place and no she doesn’t take advantage she pays sometimes too.
3. She out of the blue asked me to plan a vacation for us to go on together...jumping from that when we still haven’t ever defined our relationship even though it’s clear we both like each other to some extent.
4.  I’m planning to move, and regardless of exactly where it was going to be closer, but she’s been pushing me to live really close walking distance or more like fall down the stairs and there you are.
5.  Every time we go “out” it’s incredibly awkward and not just me, she becomes really unlike herself and then gets more comfortable as the night goes on. So do I.
6. The only issue and it isn’t an issue is that she’s polyamorous, and I thought that would put me off but it hasn’t...she’s included me in lover’s only get togethers...really confused me when she invited me out to dinner with two of her other lovers, and fortunately or unfortunately I get along with them and find she has really great taste in people.
7. I just plain like her as a person, will never hate her, I don’t think she owes me anything.  She’s given me so much happiness and helped me to grow as a person.  I’m just finding it hard not to have more with her right now.  Every time she giggles or plays with me it just turns me on and revs all my emotions.  The women that I’ve dated never really made me want to be more than I was.

TL;DR: Have feelings for a friend. Think she’s getting to be such a big part of my life that I can’t cut her out without lasting repercussions like a severe depression,  I really want to keep her in my life but lately we just seem to getting infinitesimally closer and it’s sorta unbearable.  Do I initiate a conversation with her? Do I cut her out now?  I feel like I’m planning for way to far ahead.  Messages and perspective appreciated.",08Oct2018,1

Leo is my GF, “mommy” is her mom, and “Leo” was her boyfriend at the time.
She gave me permission to post this I won’t say names but I just don’t know how to support her in  this situation. Here it is please tell me what you guys think 

“As I lay here petting my baby Leo for hours lost in thought...this thought kept coming and going, how much I loved this cat laying with me... my god I could never ever ever let this baby hurt as long as it was in my hands... I love him truly like my 1st son... omgggg he is my heart!!!!! (Kisses kisses kisses!!) and this story played through my head... as I related it to a situation of my own... and this is how it goes... kinda... lol” 

➖ Leo, A Squirrel, &amp; his mommy: 

	⁃	So my son leo... he has this squirrel... his 1st and favorite squirrel... Mommy loves this squirrel too.... it feels a loving, Devine energy towards this squirrel and heart feels sad knowing what’s going to happen to this squirrel... mommy LOVES her baby Leo more than anything else in the world she wouldn’t want Leo to ever feel upset or sad or anything bad happen to him ever!!! But mommy just can’t help but think this squirrel is too cute she HAS to have it for herself despite how heartbroken her baby will be. 

Unfortunately Mommy can’t help herself and decides to take the squirrel for herself.... 

Poor Leo sat outside every day waiting for his 1st squirrel to come around to attack... patiently, eagerly waiting for him to come around eventually thinking he did something to push away this squirrel, or Leo wasn’t good enough for the squirrel, Leo starts to feel so sad...

Meanwhile mommy knows exactly where the squirrel went... she had him the whole time... watching Leo destroy himself trying to figure it out Day by day... 

But mommy broke her promise...
Mommy let Leo get sad, and upset; she did it to him herself. 

And now Leo will never be the same trying to hunt a squirrel again... Leo hesitates every time because he remembers what happened to the first squirrel and gave up on himself... 

One day Leo finds out what happened to his squirrel friend and finds it in mommy’s room while she tried to hide it... Leo felt so betrayed but not just normal betrayal... a betrayal and pain so strong he couldn’t comprehend how mommy could do this to him.... his whole world flipped upside down that day. Leo was almost in denial for many many years peeking into her room just to see if she really did have this squirrel after all this time... sometimes hated her, but forgave her because it was his mommy and how could mommy ever do something like that to him. 

Until one day... mommy told Leo the truth about what happened to his his squirrel friend and how she couldn’t help herself and couldn’t watch Leo take him and have his way with him... she had to protect the squirrel herself keep him for herself. 

Now... how do you think Leo feels inside? How many different emotions inside that baby boy? One that was once so innocent,  now tormented by his own thoughts and emotions beyond his mentality or control... something that very few kitty’s have dealt with before... not many people to talk to or know how to deal with or help poor Leo because Leo doesn’t even know what will help him himself... he’s not the same kitty... and is very fragile. He is a lost, misunderstood kitty with a bad temper now that many can’t control anymore... everyone’s given up on Leo after he attacked many that tried to help, because of this anger and pain built up inside of him because of pain that mommy created in him.. and yes Leo can’t blame his miserable years on what happened..... or yet, can he....? The question is what would you blame it on if it were YOU in Leo’s shoes...

272,"Sorry for the long text but I want to give some context even just to show my faults: 

When I was 17 I moved to a different country for my studies. Shortly after I got together with a beautiful girl and we loved each other very much. We were together five years but over the last few months I was becoming more and more depressed. I felt very lonely and like I didn't have any friends. All my group of mates were her friends and they were constantly making fun of my accent and my country. Due to a series of disappointments and bad situations with my accommodation I was becoming more and more sad and I started saying shit like I wanted to kill myself and that I wanted to go home. After five years abroad I was really missing my country and I started asking her to move back with me. This was going to be our plan all along, we had often talked about it and we often went to my city together on holiday. The only reason I stayed abroad so long was because of her, I even went to a university close by so I could be with her. After it was clear she wouldn't move back with me I asked her at least not to move in with this friend of ours (he was our best friend and someone I really looked up to but also the person that was teasing me the most about my country and generally making me feel like I was worthless), to which she said yes. Shortly after I discovered she had already signed the contract and that she had lied to me about it. I felt like the reason she did that was because she already knew she wanted to dump me. Later I also found out her mother had been manipulating her into not coming to my country with me, not even on holiday.

Eventually we broke up and didn't speak for a couple of weeks. When I reached out to her she had completely flipped and it was like talking to a completely different person. I had never seen her like that and it was a huge shock, she was the kindest, sweetest, most loving human being I have ever met and now she was the coldest and treating me like I beat her up or something. I was devastated and the hardest part was that she wouldn't take my calls and only answer via text. Eventually she stopped replying all together, I kept messaging her once in a while for a few months, asking her to give me some sort of closure because I felt stuck in a limbo. Like I had this hope that we could eventually get back together and not hearing a word from her was driving me mad. 

During my time abroad me and her family had gotten really close. They really liked me and I was even living at their house for a year (the only accommodation that made me feel 'at home' during those years). I spent so much time with them that they had becoming like a second family to me, I valued their opinion more than my own family's and I loved her little brother and sister so much. I spent so much time with them that they thought I was their older brother and I generally felt like part of a family for once in my life. 

It's now been a year since we broke up and I have never heard from her since. I haven't healed at all even though I've been going out with other girls and friends. Life is just not the same and I stay awake every night thinking about everything I've lost for being dumb. I miss all of them and my life abroad so much and I'm not comfortable sexually or emotionally with anyone else because all I think about is her. Regardless I've been trying to heal up and look forward, but..

...the problem is that her family keeps messaging me quite often. They are really sweet but every time I see their texts I am reminded of everything I've lost and the days I get their texts are not good days. They keep saying they miss me, they send me videos of her little brother actually calling me ""brother"", saying he misses me and stuff. It's fucking heartbreaking for me and I don't know how to tell them that hearing from them yet not a single word from her is really fucking with my head. They casually avoid talking about her and if I ask how she is they act really vague and change the subject. This is really weird for me because even if we broke up I would still like to hear that she's happy and that she's doing fine. I'm the kind of person that likes to keep in touch and be friends even after a break up. But hearing from her family pretending like she/us never existed is just infuriating. 

They are the sweetest people, what do I do? 

Thanks guys, I'm rll sorry for the long text and sorry if it doesn't make much sense. ",08Oct2018,1
273,"Months ago, I decided to head to the bar after work with a number of coworkers. This was one of many after-work outings that I had always attended. In fact, I don't remember declining an invite in all my five years at this place. Unfortunately, I just had been placed on a new anti-depressant before this particular outing and had not been informed of how badly it was affected by alcohol. Needless to say, the alcohol and medicine caused me to enter some unstable, manic state. Before the evening was finished, I ended up groping a coworker and blacking out. Very much out of character for me, not to mention morally reprehensible.

When I was informed of what happened, I was mortified and deeply ashamed. I immediately went to my physician and had the new medication stopped. I then profusely apologized to the coworker involved and ensured them that I would be addressing any and all causes of this incident. Knowing what happened and how many people were present to witness it, work became incredibly quiet and awkward for me. I kept my head down, spoke only when spoken to, and focused on my work-related tasks alone.

During this time, I went to a therapist to re-evaluate the decisions I had made up to and following the incident. My hope was that I would be able to uncover any problems that were previously unseen. The chief driver behind this was the insistence of a few coworkers that I had a ""drinking problem"" and needed help for it. It felt odd hearing this only after one serious incident, but I wasn't about to dismiss any possible issue. My therapist and I delved pretty deeply into my background and actions. As I had informed her of all the steps I had taken after this bar incident, my therapist reinforced that I had done everything that I could. My therapist also concluded that this one event was not enough to declare that I have a substance abuse problem. She told me that substance abuse manifests as a series of behaviors that intensify over time. With this being such an isolated event with no warning, she determined that this was not an issue for concern.  

Unfortunately, this ""drinking problem"" was being subtly shoved into many of my work interactions. It got to the point that I insisted my therapist give me a substance abuse assessment. Once I took the assessment, I found out that I not only did not have a substance abuse issue, I scored the FARTHEST from having a substance abuse issue of any kind. While I was assured that this horrible incident was a rare, one-off anomaly, I felt incredibly unsettled that everyone seemed to have a variety of uninformed, juvenile theories and judgements about my behavior. I would get lightly chided for choosing to continue visiting bars with my friends on my personal time, patronizingly told that its still possible to have a healthy relationship some day (I should add here that I'm a loner and have no dating interest of any kind), receive almost sickeningly sweet yet patronizing comments about how I was always welcome back out, and got glowing recommendations for things that were well within my capability and required no special effort on my part.

Eventually, everyone started acting like this sexually aggressive incident never occurred.

Given all of the previous behaviors of myself and my coworkers, I determined that I had let my personal and professional life blend far, far too much. All of this could have been avoided by taking a hard line stance on fraternization outside of work. That's on me. I take responsibility for this getting out of hand. However, I have since fixed this issue. I've stopped any and all communication with coworkers outside of our official channels (i.e. no texting, no social media, no personal emails, etc..). I have completely disabled all social media accounts save for any professional accounts such as LinkedIn. I have quietly ignored casual invitations of any kind while refusing to rsvp any company sponsored events. These actions have erected an incredibly strong firewall between my personal and professional life, making my job more manageable and my personal life much richer.

While I am doing better now, I am getting quizzical looks and questions about cutting myself off. I've tried explaining the situation to a few people, but they insist that I've gone too far. I certainly do not see it that way. If anything, I feel that my actions, while shameful, have simultaneously highlighted how judgmental and patronizing my coworkers can be. Why would I want to associate with people who have such terrible personalities and behaviors? How did I miss all of this awfulness in my first five years? The thing that bothers me the most, though... I feel like they've let me off FAR too easy. I'm a victim of sexual assault myself. I am fully aware of how awful it is to live through. I CERTAINLY would not allow my actions to go unpunished under any circumstance. I don't understand why these people value themselves so little as to let me off so lightly. I feel disgusted by the lack of consequences.  

In summary, I feel that my actions, though deplorable, have helped reveal my coworkers' true colors. Though I have made a clean cut from any fraternization, I still have to work with these people during the week. How do I tell them that while I can function with them as a coworker, I have zero desire to associate with them as ""friends"" from this point forward?

tl;dr Groped one coworker outside work, but I got off lightly and am getting patronized / told that I'm an alcoholic by the victim as well as the witnessing coworkers. How do I tell this group that I think it would be best if they are no longer in my personal life?",08Oct2018,1
274,"So my girlfriend and I have been having rough patches for quite a while now. I went over to her house and sat her down to let her know how I was feeling. I told her that I still want to be friends and that I just feel that I still have a lot of growing to do and that I can't have the pressure that a relationship provides for me to fully grow. But in the middle of the talk, she asked if I would still go on the vacation we have planned with her parents to Savannah, GA starting Wednesday morning through Sunday. I looked up what others have said about breaking up before/after trips and almost everyone said before is the better option. However, she said that it would mean the world to her if we went on the trip together and then I can still end it after the trip if I feel it is a good idea.

275,"I’m in California. I’ve been working at a company for almost a year as a contractor for an entry level position along with four others. The other three work on a different project, therefore have different teams, work, and bosses. My boss was promoted and asked to design a completely new team that took on more work and responsibility. He recently was told he was allowed to hire someone and told me he’s been training to take me along with him as a junior, because he thinks I’d excel on this new role.

His job req goes out and all four of us apply. We interview and HR is pretty adamant telling me I won’t get paid a cent more than I currently am if I were hired because one of the other contractors has more industry experience (~5 years compared to my 1). I’m being paid $42k/yr and my more experienced co-worker is being paid $52k/yr through our contracting company.

A month later, I’m extended the job offer for $44k/yr and told it’s the best they can do since their range is $38k-46k with a hard cap being $46k. When I asked how they’re able to pay contractors significantly more, they said it’s because they don’t have to pay them benefits. HR justified I won’t get the cap because someone who didn’t get hired has more experience in the industry despite her actually being on another project and me actually proving I can do the tasks related to the new group for the last few months. After our discussion she reminded me it’s illegal to be discussing wages with co-workers. It’s not illegal.

I’m a bit frustrated my he minimal pay increase that’s going to come with an increase in responsibility with this role and that she got red in the face and adamant about how this is the best I can do and telling me I can’t discuss with others (which is illegal on her behalf). 

Is it better to just accept the offer or is there a way I can haggle with her a bit more?

I do want this job. I enjoy the people and work. I have been offered $10/hr more at other companies, but am willing to forego it for these reasons. I just wish I was making a bit more.

276,"Ok, this is a really weird one.

I go to club every week, and there's one guy who is... unanimously not very well liked. He's rude, pushy, and utterly dull. 

I thought it was just me + one of my close friends who I walk home with, but recently he missed a week, and about half the club and I had a sort of impromptu (and kind of rude) bitching session about him for about half an hour, basically saying we were glad he didn't turn up and laughed about a few anecdotes of him being annoying/rude.

Anyway, ever since then, he's been really distant and withdrawn, missing more sessions, turning up late, and going home early. A SMALL part of me thinks he might have heard about the bitch session from someone who was there but not part of the conversation, but on the other hand, he'd not really missed any weeks before that bitch session, so it could be that whatever made him miss that one week is making him miss more.

Anyway, having lived with depression before, I can sort of notice some potential signs. I'm legitimately worried about him, despite my opinions on him.

So I kind of want to check in on him, but there's a lot of stuff to unpack, here:

- Would checking in on him be dishonest, since I really don't like him that much?
- If he DID hear about the bitch session we had, that I was involved in, would it seem even ruder for me to check to see if he's feeling ok?
- Is it even any of my business? I know I could just let it lie, but I don't want anyone to feel alone if they ARE depressed.
- From what I know about him, he struggles to make and keep friends (though I can obviously tell why), so even though I'm personally happier with him not showing up, I'd actually be worried for his mental health if he stopped showing up altogether.

I dunno, am I just being totally stupid? Should I just ignore the issue?",08Oct2018,1

278,"Grew up with my dad, when he would get mad (which was often) he would take it out on me. Allow me to clarify: my dad in no way abused me. It was more of a verbal thing. He would scream at me over stupid stuff, say hurtful things and use a lot of profanity. I guess that kinda instilled in me that your loved ones are meant to be ‘punching bags.’ Most relationships I’ve had have been toxic and it turns out we’re both just trying to win by hurting each other. Who can hurt the other more? Especially when I wake up like this. I guess I take my aggressions out on people I care about, which is the norm. I almost have this attitude where people who love you should be there for you to be mean to or take your feelings out on, I guess... because that’s how I was raised. I guess it’s an immature mentality. 

I just feel like lately I don’t have quality people in my life. I feel like the “friends” I have do the bare minimum almost as a requirement but not because they actually care. My ex and I still talk and it’s the same toxic go round. This morning, again, I woke up just ... angry. Mad at the world and my life and how everything I want seems so far away or even unattainable. I’m just over it. I’m over feeling alone and hating my job and where I live. I feel stuck everyday which I guess could be why I’m mad at the world. I don’t really get much help with this stuff from people in my life. And then when they can’t handle me when I’m upset and I guess being rude they leave which to me is a piss poor quality.

A week ago I had an operation (I'm England based..).  
My GP signed me off work for a month to recover, (my job is pretty physical in a factory, I had a hernia operation)

When is the right time to quit? When NOT to quit your job? 

There appears to be two schools of thought here. 

1 -
You absolutely should not decide to quit when things are going badly. Don’t quit when things get hard. 

2 -
If things are going badly because of things that are out of your control, then you’re putting faith in someone (in this case, the clients) who may not have your best interest in mind. You’ve stuck it out as things have begun going south, but you need to cut your losses before there is nothing left.

286,"I'm gonna try to get some things off my mind and hopefully someone could help me with some advice or something. I feel like I'm slowly going crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

First, there's this guy at work who kind of sexually harrassed or power-harrassed me right when I had started my current job. I recently heard that he was out of office because he got a baby. So when he was ""flirting"" with me, his wife or gf or whatever was pregnant because it's only been 6 months since it happened. I couldn't talk to anyone about the harrassment then and now I can't talk about how these news made me feel. It didn't feel that horrible when I thought that he was single and just a bit creepy and drunk but now that I know that he was gonna get a baby and he was out there with me and did that. I tried talking to one friend and she said it was my own fault cause I shouldn't have gone drinking with my male coworkers (yeah, kind of difficult cause it was a welcoming event for me and a couple of others). So I don't feel like opening up about this to anyone if that is the response I'm going to get.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's not my fault but I still kind of do because, pretty much everytime I go out i end up drinking a lot. I get really talkative and interested in people around me when I'm drunk and also because I'm so lonely and don't have much social life outside drinking. Some people might take it wrong, but then I can't really tell guys to get off me, because even though I'm drunk, I'm awkward and scared.  I feel like the harrassment, and most of the harrassment I've faced was at least partly my own fault. But drinking and talking with people is the only way I can feel just a little bit happy.

&amp;#x200B;

But still, I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to for real. Especially after this weekend I feel like all the people I thought would want to listen and hang out and be there for me, they just ingore me if something better comes up.

&amp;#x200B;

Especially this one friend (the same one I mentioned before). She just kind of ignored me last weekend when she first asked me to come see her because she needed to talk, I thought she was having something bigger going on and got worried and went to see her even though I was tired and kinda had other plans. And then she didn't reply and I tried to call so many times, then at some point she said she was home already and not even a single sorry or any kind of apology. What do I mean to her? She doesn't respect me at all, not as a friend or my time or not even enough to pretend to be sorry. I don't know why I still care because she obviously doesn't, and I don't know what to do. Also, she told our common friend not to hang out with me without her. I don't understand what's going on. So if I ditch her she is going to make me lose all my other friends too probably.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been typing with my pointer fingers since the age of 13. I have done a lot of typing in my lifetime, and spent more years on a computer than many. My lack of typing skill and speed is starting to really hinder my performance at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel the urge to reach out to you all because my struggle is causing me to feel a lot of doubt and anxiety - but logically I know that A) I am not going to achieve my goal of typing like a courtroom transcriber over night and B) this problem I have with learning new things without shitting on myself runs deeper than my typing skills. I am not dyslexic, but I had an adult learning assessment done that concluded that I have mad ADHD and kinda low processing skills. Yet I have nothing to compare to the experience of learning to type. So I have no idea how to learn something with so much dexterity, and I'm trying not to tell myself it's just because I'm a dumbass that I can't touch type by now.

293,"&amp;#x200B;

I've worked for this company on and off for about 3 years. My boss has always been condescending and hard to work for, all 3 years worth of knowing my boss I have spent many days at my desk upset, crying, and feeling pissed off and hurt. I haven't even thought of leaving the job until now. I love this job, it brings me fulfillment and pride. I never imagined that this would be where I ended up finding the most joy in my life, but it is.  I've never had trouble getting out of bed in the mornings to come into work, that's how much I enjoy where I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I volunteered and interned here for a year and a half before I was offered a position. The position was not full time to begin with but I was led to believe that one day soon I would be brought on full-time. 9 months later I'm leaving, because my boss hadn't even told the CEO I wanted full time. I literally stood in front of the CEO a month ago while the CEO asked, ""Do you even want full time?"" while my boss stared at the floor. I expected so much more from my boss (I know, you shouldn't expect things from people). I don't think its irrational to at least expect my boss to mention that I wanted full time to the CEO.

&amp;#x200B;

I will say that I am young, and so maybe I don't deal with situations the proper way yet. I don't think I'm perfect and there are instances where I deserved some constructive criticism. However, I also know how to treat people. I don't walk around treating people like they are scum on the bottom of my shoe, for no reason. There have been multiple occasions where my boss has condescendingly spoken to me over absolutely nothing, because I've asked a question and my boss was busy, because I spoke out of turn in a meeting, even simply because I asked my boss to come speak to someone at the front desk.

&amp;#x200B;

I never fought back, which is absolutely out of the ordinary for me. I am not a woman who allows people to walk all over me and I never have been. Somehow though this position has taken enough of a toll on my psyche that I didn't fight back. I never felt that I was in a position to, considering the fact that I wanted full-time. When someone that mean holds your future in their hands, how do you fight back without fear of repercussions?

&amp;#x200B;

After talking to the CEO last week and explaining the real reason behind me leaving, the CEO suggested that I should have a set down meeting with my boss and tell my boss that they hurt me, that they've taken away something from me, and that they should have been advocating for me like a good boss would have. I agreed with the CEO, but after a week of self-reflection and really thinking about how to approach such a conversation. I'm just not so sure that it's something I want to do or even need to do. When I handed in my letter of resignation I was already done with the entire situation. To me that was my way of saying I'm done. I don't feel that there are benefits to letting my boss know the true reason behind me leaving, I said it was because I wasn't on full time yet. I don't feel as if setting down with my boss and telling them that they are mean spirited and to hard to work for, or that when you speak to people the way they have spoken to me that it take an emotional and mental toll on them, will change anything at all. I'm already leaving so it doesn't change anything for me. My boss has been this way for as long as I've known them. I also kind of feel like the CEO suggested this so that it wasn't such a shock when the CEO has to set down with my boss.

&amp;#x200B;

I've talked to my mother, friends, other family to see what they think. I usually am not one to beg for advice, I typically would just handle my shit and move on. However, in the recent months I have had a hard time controlling my emotions and keeping a level head. I don't feel as if I owe anyone here anything though.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to know what the ""right"" thing to do is? Do I have a face to face meeting, do I write a letter, or do I just let karma take care of business and move on with my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sad I have to leave, it's very hard to get over the fact that my boss has taken something that is such a huge part of me away. I really want to just move on and be done with it so I can heal, but I also want to do what is right?

295,"Hello everyone. Please be patient as I open up before you and present my background so you can give me your judgement and advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my early twenties, no education, no job, living with one of my parents. I moved to a different country a few years ago and lost all my friends and all my connections. Starting from scratch gets to you real quick and before you know you're in deep depression, seeking peace of mind in video games, cigarettes, weed, alcohol. Everyone I met here were disappointed in me because I'm not quite the average guy, people tell me I've got a very pretty face and I think that makes people expect much of me, but then they start noticing that I'm walking funny, my posture is a little hunched over and they start to push me away. That put me into loneliness, depression, addictions, generally very big low.   


I luckily got a job 2 months ago (I dont work there anymore, sadly) and was able to make some money to last me for a few months. During the time I was working I felt great, I felt useful and had a purpose, was finally doing something productive and it felt great. I started thinking about moving in alone and devoting myself to living in a schedule.  
So I started looking for an apartment through facebook groups and I've been contacted by this guy, lets call him Jack.  


Jack's friend had a free apartment and he asked Jack if he needed it, Jack said ''no, but I could perhaps find somebody for you that needs it''. And so Jack messaged me.  


Unfortunately, and Jack made it clear directly, the apartment was ready for viewing once the owner of the apartment came from his summer break (it was about 2 months ago so I thought it was reasonable).

I thought that's a little too convenient as the owner of the apartment needed to know that Jack trusts me and can guarantee for me, so that would be the perfect time to get to know Jack a little closer. He seemed like a pretty genuine guy when we talked on the phone so I thought okay, let's meet.

&amp;#x200B;

During the meeting we click together very fast. We both are musicians and generally are the romantic type, we talk about lots of stuff and are pretty open with eachother. Fast forward a week, we hang out pretty much on a daily basis, he's always there for me, woke him up in the middle of the night and asked him to give me a ride home and lo and behold Jack comes and drives me home on a shitty rainy night when the bus fares were cancelled.  


Here's the moment when I'm starting to feel uneasy:

&amp;#x200B;

I tell Jack that I don't work anymore as the people I've been replacing are all back from their summer vacation.

He says he could try and see if he could help me out with a job. Unfortunately all the people I've seen him with are looking kinda shady. He meets them in three most shady areas of the town as well.

Since he keeps telling me I'm so sexy and beautiful and he never met anyone as pretty as me I'm very concerned he might be setting me up for something very bad and I'm stressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked him where he works. He's currently helping out a friend who owns a shady as fuck bakery, filling a spot for a worker that got fired. Other than that he's got a few apartaments that he rents rooms in. He also worked white for a few years here so he's eligible for monthly payment from the state. He works black in one more place and that's the place I'm supposed to get a job in as well. It's a package delivery/moving company. We are currently waiting for the boss to provide a truck so that we can work conveniently as the workplace is a few good kilometers away from us.

&amp;#x200B;

See this from my point of view: I'm broke with no friends or perspectives, depressed as fuck every day, suddenly a white knight appears and I have everything. I have money, people to go out with, a place to stay (he said we can definitely sort something out in terms of the apartment) and most of all a chance for an insanely well paying job (I would be working black but at this point it can even be fucking pink just let me have an income). Am I retarded for having concerns?  
Little things like his friend covering his face with his hand when he pointed the facetime at him and his ''youre so sexy I want to bite you haha no homo'' attitude and all of the above are really bugging me. He also told me ''Bro if I tell the boss you're going to work you have to be 1000000000% sure you are going to work at least 6 months there.

&amp;#x200B;

His facebook profile dates several years back, before he even moved to the country im living in. He's been working on some high positions with big businessmen, throwing seminars and lectures. His profile is full of pictures of his family. He seems professional, good dresscode and everything. He seems like a very positive person who's also religious and tells me all sorts of good things like ''Max to me youre perfect, dont give a shit about fuckers who say you're this and that because how you walk or whatever you think you have wrong''.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I stupid for thinking he wants to set me up? For the entire time ive been in this country I havent heard a single good word about me and i completely lost trust with people and I'm sure that's the reason I'm having this dillema but please give me your own judgement.

We need a paradigm shift with regards to diet or a more blatant acknowledgment about how food affects the environment. Too often am I ostracized simply for BEING a vegan. Even when I don't talk about it. In fact, I hardly even try and convince others to become a vegan in my day to day life, yet I'm still harassed about it. Of course I laugh these instances off to be friendly but it's become increasingly annoying, especially when I see reports about how the last generation of great-grandparents may be living right now.   


I feel a need more than ever to spread the word that while veganism was originally primarily a cause to save the animals, or to live a healthier lifestyle, it's become something far more important than that. I won't go through the effort of linking all the sources which support my argument because I've done it before with abysmal responses. It's just not worth my time going through the effort for Reddit. At least not until a dialogue has been started with interested parties. The fact is, people need to research these things themselves.   


I don't want to be a militant vegan, but I don't want to keep my mouth shut either pretending I don't support a cause that has drastically changed my lifestyle for the better. The thing is, if more people did it, it wouldn't be so out of the norm anymore.   


Going vegan is the number one thing an average human can do to try and combat the detrimental effects of humans living modern lives on this planet.  


Isn't it about time we care?  


Veganism used to be about saving the animals. Now it's about saving the people. Saving the world.

298," I've been living with my boyfriend for 4 years. 2 of those years were spent sharing an apartment with his mother because she was broke and going through her 3rd divorce. During that time, I witnessed her try to manipulate his every move, sometimes successfully- from what he eats, what he drives, where he works, even things as minute as our shower curtain
..she tries to control with guilt and textbook manipulation tactics. I dealt with very passive aggressive and sometimes outright crazy behavior from her. Her favorite move is to pretend she is on the phone with a friend while loudly trash talking me, calling me a whore and a thief usually. She told our whole apartment building that I cheated on her son, she told her sister I have STDs, just constant lying and gossiping about me. She's done it all, from name calling to trying to physically attack me when I called her an alcoholic (she is an alcoholic, btw) She also did shit like taking the dishes I just washed out of the drainer &amp; rewashing them, vacuuming the floor 5 minutes after I did, refusing to eat anything I cooked, resetting the washing machine to different wash settings as soon as I started my laundry...she's a very rude, condescending, know it all type. She did all of the more obvious stuff, like spreading rumors and name calling, when my boyfriend wasn't around...so when I told him, he'd confront her, she'd call me a liar. Endless cycle. She also loved to go into our room and reorganize our things without permission. She has no idea what healthy boundaries are, or maybe she simply does not care; as a result, her son didn't really understand boundaries in the beginning of our relationship either. He was very all or nothing, either totally closed off or oversharing. 
  Things came to a head when I overheard her bragging about having an affair with a married dentist who was giving her money during the affair. I posted about it online. I know it was wrong, I regretted it and apologized. BUT I also told her she knows exactly why I was so mad at her to have shared that. This is when we stopped cohabitation. She denies EVERYTHING. She won't apologize, or admit to her son that she actively antagonized me for 2 years every chance she got.
  She's been in her own apartment for 2 years now, I avoid her if at all possible. But back in April, her mother died, so I helped plan the funeral. Prior to the funeral, I got a typical ""non-apolgy"", she said ""I'm sorry about us and I'm sorry if you perceived things differently than I meant them."" Then at the graveside service, one of her friends remarked that I looked nice...her response? ""Well looks aren't everything, some people are trash."" 
  Last night, she and my boyfriend were planning to go to dinner together. He invited me but I told him that even if I'm invited, I don't feel welcome when I'm around his mother. He was upset, but understanding. 
  He has tried to speak with her about her behavior many times, but she always twists the truth, denies ANY wrongdoing and points the finger at me. He's used to her acting like this, she's been this way his whole life.... so he's sort of resigned to the fact that it will always be this way. I want him to cut her off completely, she treats us both like crap, uses him for cash loans and emotional support while giving nothing, and she's just a hateful person in general. I think he sort of wants to do that too, but feels guilty because, since her mom died, she has nobody else. Her siblings want nothing to do with her, she has few friends (the ones left are all drunks), no partner. I don't want to try to force them apart, but her being in our lives is a huge negative force. She's also the ONLY thing we ever argue about. I honestly think she hates me because, before I was around, her son was a ""chronic bachelor"" type and she sort of thought she could manipulate him into taking care of her financially and emotionally for life since she can't keep a husband around....truly, I think she sees me as some random bitch who came along to steal away her meal ticket. I've been at my wits end with her for some time, hence my not speaking to her...but now it seems like my boyfriend is getting to that point too. 

I don't know what to do, any suggestions are welcome at this point. Thanks in advance.

304,"I was driving to go get a coffee this morning and after about 5 minutes of driving 60mph I hit a town so I had to slow down to about 25mph. That’s when noticed a burning rubber smell and a small amount of smoke coming out of the side of my car hood. All of a sudden smoke was pouring out of every vent and filled up my car so I rolled down the windows, parked, and popped the hood.

There was a small fire/embers on the underside of my car hood, not my engine, that I put out. And a layer of what  I thought at first to be ashes coating everything. But, after the smoke cleared, I think it’s actually ground up rubber or something. It’s like black pencil shavings.

Over the past week, I've been encountering problems while we were talking, and this isn't the first time this has happened. The first thing that happened was her coming to me and telling me how she feels like everyone is avoiding her. I explain that our friends are busy, G and M with being in a new city without internet, B with his college midterms and many tests, C being antisocial as always, and me with my overnight job who gets home and sleeps, and if I am up, it's usually to watch youtube videos before I sleep. She took that to mean I care more about youtube videos than her. Of course I correct myself so things don't escalate. I get this as a response: https://i.imgur.com/1Y9HZ7U.png 

The next time we talk, she's venting about her job and how she wants to see the people she delivers pizza to hurt and/or tortured, going into some details about it I didn't find comfortable. Mentioning this, she deletes her messages about it, telling me it's an odd thing to bring up out of the blue. The next day, I'm greeted with this: https://i.imgur.com/tMpAB7H.png So that's fun.

We talk about how I woke up feeling a little miserable since I am not the healthiest person out there and that I would feel fine in the afternoon.

311,"Hey so I know this is pretty tame compared to other posts but this has been going through my head ever since school started. Also for the sake of simplicity since I’ll be referencing them through this whole thing I am gonna call my APUSH teacher Mr. H and My AP Gov teacher Mr. J

So the reason I am mentioning Mr. H and Mr. T is because they both taught APUSH last year, and after taking the exam, we did a survey and after asking around I roughly saw that 75-80% of students felt ready for this class, however Mr. J’s kids only had 30%, and I think I found out why,

Mr. T was a very no nonsense, study, get your work done kind of man, and that pressure really did help us pass the test, however going into Mr. Js APGOV class hasn’t necessarily done anything except watch Trever Noah, Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers etc. as well as talk about how the Trump Administration terrible. The only reason I haven’t put this topic up is because people I always refer to consistently say “It’s AP Gov you’re supposed to talk about trump and politics” and honestly I find that bullshit cause to be granted it’s something we should topic about and mention but it shouldn’t be the ONLY thing we talk about, Mr. J also refers to our phones as a binky, and as of writing this we’ve only read into the book once and that was the first chapter. And we’re 6-7 weeks into the school. 

Going into this class after seeing how fast we can learn in one subject after one month is mind boggling and I know you could say that every teacher is different but constantly watching videos on someone showing me something I already know about isn’t how I view a classroom going. So it’d help if people could lmk if I am overreacting and this how usual APGOV classes go or alternatively lmk if I am right in my assumptions and what I can do about it

TL;DR I feel like my teacher treats us like idiots since we only watch videos and talk shit about Trump ",08Oct2018,1

314,"My sister's love affair with John Mayer began after she saw him live in concert in Vancouver about 10 years ago. She describes this event as a spiritual, transformative experience that redefined the course of her entire life. After the concert, she quit her fairly cushy marketing job and decided to pour all of her energy into becoming a photographer, writing, and shooting short films.   
  
My sister has always been a very fragile person, and about 11 years ago, she tried to take her life, so because of the timing I think discovering John Mayer represented something of a ""rebirth"" for her. She struggles with feelings of abandonment and seems to have something resembling borderline personality disorder.   
  
For the longest time we didn't realize the extent of her obsession with John Mayer, because she sort of kept it secret. We knew she was a huge fangirl who exclusively listened to John Mayer and wrote John Mayer fanfics. We knew she lived on rice and beans so that she could save up money to fly out to John Mayer concerts. We all teased her about it because no one else in my family cares for John Mayer, but at the same time we were happy she had found new meaning in life through him.  
  
However, during the last few years it started to become clear that this went way beyond simple infatuation. She started writing letters to John Mayer on her public blog in which she raved at length about his indescribable beauty and creative prowess (which would sound hilarious to me if this weren't such a serious situation). It became evident to us that she structured her entire life around John Mayer, dedicating poems and short stories and music videos to him. She wrote and published online a short story about a struggling artist who met a famous writer when he was on a book tour in her small mountain town, and they bonded through their shared appreciation for art and creativity and fell in love. This was very obviously about her and John Mayer and she made a video about the story that actually has pictures of her and of John Mayer as the protagonists.   
  
After a while, she began to claim in her blog that she spent hours a day talking to John Mayer on the phone. She talked about their huge plans for the future and the names of their future children. She wrote a long, ranty post in which she expressed concern that her maltipoo would not get along with John Mayer's labrador. Mayer is apparently very active on Twitter, or at least used to be, and she reads herself into every one of his posts.   
  
Earlier this year, she self-published and printed copies of a 500-page book which was largely composed of letters she had written to John Mayer and pictures she had taken for him. In the book, she talks about John Mayer almost as if he were a religious icon. It is truly mind-boggling and I was shocked to find out that my sister was capable of this level of insanity. But it is clear that she sees herself as in an intimate relationship with John Mayer, whom as far as we know she has never spoken to or met.   
  
At various points, we have tried to confront her about the whole thing and bring her back down to earth, but when we do so she completely breaks down screaming and crying. She doesn't understand (or does, but doesn't want to admit it) why we're suspicious that a famous musician who has flings with Jennifer Aniston and Katy Perry would be interested in an amateur photographer living in a one-horse town on the other side of the country.   
  
Now we're at the point where she isn't talking to any of us. However, I am still her friend on Facebook, and lately she has written a series of despondent posts about how John has been too busy lately to keep in touch with her and that she sees no reason to live if she can't talk to him every day.   
  
I am scared for her but I have no idea how to help. I know she needs professional help but I live in a different place and don't know how to get it to her. She does not respond to any of our calls, texts, Facebook messages, etc., and we don't really know anyone in the area that could go by and do occasional welfare checks. I imagine she has close to zero income so even if we convinced her to get help, it might be too costly for her. I'm just at a total loss for what to do. I know this all sounds far-fetched and I can provide some proof if necessary, but I'm hesitant to do so because I do not want my sister to face online harassment from strangers -- it would be too much for her.        
  
EDIT: Another concern of ours is that she may actually be talking to someone who is masquerading as John Mayer and possibly scamming her for money or using her in some other way.

**TL;DR** Sister's entire life revolves around John Mayer. She thinks she is in an intimate relationship with him but we are 99.9% that she has never met or spoken to him.

316,"I am new to this sub, so pardon me if I'm not going about this the right way. 

A friend has approached me seeking advice on how to deal with her husband who she just found out is using drugs (again). More on that in a bit. She has written up a letter with questions she wants to present to him and is asking for my feedback. I think it's great that she's getting her feelings down on paper, but in all honestly, I think she's going about this all wrong. But I don't know if it's my place to tell her that. Knowing she's hurting, should I tell her I think she needs a different approach or should I just support her?

Ok, some backstory. This is a great couple! They have 2 little kids. He has had some drug use ""issues"" in his past. By that, mostly I mean he'd done coke at stressful points in his life. Weed has crept in there too over the years, which isn't a big deal. EXCEPT that where they live, weed IS still illegal. That means it COULD affect his job, her job, and her kids' lives if he were caught. But the coke is the big factor. I have no idea if he's addicted, but he does seem to do it off and on (according to her and some weird behavior once in a blue moon that would suggest it) when he's stressed or when he's peer-pressured into it. He seems to be easily influenced. Like I said, super guy, great dad. But he has some machismo issues that come out when with certain bad influences. 

She has been aware of this twice before in their 10+ years relationship. It initially broke them up when they were younger. They got back together and seemed perfect, then he did it again when the pressure of having another kid came through. She gave him an ultimatum then and he cleaned up. Now it's happened again. And it seems to have coincided with a friend of his coming back in his life who recently got out of jail. 

Back to the present problem. Her letter to him comes off as argumentative and includes ultimatums - follow my rules or our marriage is over kind of stuff. I feel it's definitely the wrong way to go. I think she should be coming from a place of love, not a place of attack. He's likely to become defensive himself and not be open to her complaints. But I also understand the dangers of his behavior to her and their children. I don't want to pick sides here. There is fault in them both. Should I just tell her to seek counselling? I am at a loss as to the right way to help her.

319,"Hey guys :)

So, I came back from Austria on Saturday. I went there by myself for 6 days and had an incredible time. Met lovely people who I enjoyed wonderful times with and saw beautiful places!

Anyway, the first night I went out with some roommates from my hostel and I met a guy there. He’s from Vienna. He’s 30. He was playing pool with a friend. I was giving him the eye and said hey, but wasn’t being eager as I usually am. He would come over and talk to me when he wasn’t playing pool but couldn’t kiss me or touch me because a girl there was apparently “obsessed” with him and he didn’t want to annoy her. Apparently she’s always there and they have a drink together or whatever but it’s a case of she’s in love with him or something. I did press him on whether they’ve got a past because as a woman, there would be a reason why she would act like that but he was insistent that was the case, so I left it.

Anyway, I stayed with him for 3 nights whilst I was in Vienna. On the first night, he drove me to the hilltop to show me the whole city and it was so pretty. He drove me home the next morning. To keep it short, he had some sexy fun but couldn’t have proper intercourse because years of conditioning from my Dad saying “don’t give your body away to random men” has stuck with me and I’ve had numerous attempts but it hasn’t properly worked. 😂 I went out with him with my other roommates a couple nights later. We had so much fun. I spent most of the night talking and dancing with him and sometimes my roommates. He even drove them with us to clubs! He was really sweet. We were texting a lot whilst I was there and it was great. He said he wanted to take me to this great club on Friday night. It was a swank, expensive place and he knows the owner so he got us a VIP both. He spent a lot of money of me and just dancing the night away. We had to cut the night short because I got carried away and drank too much and was sick in his car, but that still didn’t annoy him too much cos I stayed with him and he took me to lunch the next day. He also said he wanted to talk me to Hermesvilla because he knew I’d love it, and wanted to show me around there and the museum before he drove me to the airport train (which he offered!) 

It was perfect and it was literally like having a boyfriend. When we said goodbye, he said we’ll still text and he’s in London in a couple of weeks so said we will see each other then and I can stay with him. Kissed me goodbye, gave me a hug and watched me walk down to the train. Called me when I got to the airport to make sure I got there on time because we were cutting fine for time to get there and he was really stressing out haha.

This is where is gets a bit... odd? I’ve been back home for a couple of days now and even though I had to reason to think this, I woke up yesterday morning to that horrific hit of intuition (that feeling you know when something isn’t right) that he wasn’t gonna talk to me again. I messaged him saying like “hey I’m home! Can you send me those pics when you can please!” He took loads of pictures of me when we were out and there’s even pictures of us kissing and at the club posing like a couple. He’d taken some and let me take some to. He was always a relatively quick person to reply but I noticed hours were going by and he didn’t respond. I was like right, this is really starting to spike my thoughts that I was right that he wasn’t gonna talk to me. We speak on iMessage so I checked his WhatsApp and he was coming on and offline every hour or so, so I was like great I actually am being somewhat ignored. I tried to call him and he didn’t pick up (he would call me a lot when I was in Vienna, so this wasn’t weird for me to do this). Again, had come on WhatsApp but didn’t return my call. I finally thought “fuck it” and sent him a “?” And he replied within 10 seconds saying “hi yes I can (send the pictures)😊” and I then said “thanks how has your day been?” And he replied but then when I sent a reply back, he didn’t answer. I then messaged in the evening saying “we will meet in London?” And once again, replied quickly saying “yes 👍🏼😘”. I didn’t reply. This morning he sent me a message saying “hi” and I replied but once again, didn’t reply so I sent a “?” And he replied saying “I’m fine and you?” 😘 ... that was an hour ago and I just thought fuck this, do I even want to reply to that?

I spend yesterday crying in bed for ages and just feeling so empty and confused. I don’t understand why someone I met would literally go out of their way to take me places, drive me around, spend money on me, buy me lunch just to go, not cold, but distant as soon as as I’m back home. He’s replies are okay, they’re not cold, it’s just the fact I literally have to send a “?” To get a reply. I just feel so deflated from this whole experience. I even told him I stayed at this other guys house on of the nights (but we didn’t do anything) he got quiet annoyed and said he “liked me”. 

Sorry that it’s so long, really need some perspective here!

320,"A bit of background information about my dad-- he constantly insults me and often for no valid reason, he stole a fuck ton of money from my mother and I, he repeatedly threatens to beat me up and he avoids responsibility at all costs. This applies to my mother as well but to a lesser extent since he is aware my mother has more power than I do (obviously). Also my dad has awfully high expectations, he pressures and forces me to read and study (in some situations I had to do this for 6-8 hours straight, no breaks), etc. I'm not saying this lightly, by pressuring I don't mean saying stuff like ""you should study"". And he genuinely fooled me into thinking that it was my fault and that he was good for over 10 years. I've only really woken up to the truth this year. I can hear them yelling in the kitchen right now. My dad constantly tries to act intelligent, always provokes everyone, always tries to disagree. One time he lectured me for more than 2 hours, basically just trying to tell me that he is smart and I am stupid, uncultured and undeserving of everything. Which admittedly might be true.

And for my mother, I hate to say this but she isn't the brightest either. She refuses to get me any sort of mental help, despite me telling her about some of my problems. Every time she just kind of ignores it then shames me. I understand this may not be the worst of problems but it's still terrible. My mother has been abusive before, but it's been much more rare. She's thinking of divorcing him but at the same time she can't. She feels bad for him and always makes up an excuse for my father's actions no matter how nonsensical they are. In fact, she often sides with dad. When I tell her not to talk to dad about some of my issues, I don't mean it lightly. Of course my dad would freak out and fuck me over, did my mom not expect this? If I can't talk to my mother about anything, I don't wanna sound too rude but she might as well be worth as much as my dad in terms of parenting. Also my mother gets shitted on by my dad a ton, they argue every time.

324,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit. Please direct me elsewhere if need be :)

I’ve been on my own and doing relatively fine since I graduated college in 2013. I am 27, I met a man 2 years ago and we got engaged. Long story short he turned into an abusive addict and I felt threatened while we were living together. Talked to my parents honestly about it and we agreed my best move would be to move in with them for a bit while I got my shit back together after the mess he left me in. I did not have enough money saved up to get my own place.

So I come home this past May. I get a part time job while attending therapy for major depression, as well as daily TMS treatment (magnetic stimulation in the area of the brain that controls mood) for the depression. Parents and I agree that once I complete TMS I will pursue a full time job and save up a bit to move out on my own. I’ve always struggled with depression, so this isn’t anything new, but has definitely been exacerbated by the recent events with my ex fiancé.

Two months ago I injured myself accidentally resulting in nerve damage in my leg. Completely lost all feeling in it and was unable to walk, and then about a week after the injury I fell and tore my hamstring with a second degree tear. Very painful, my dudes. Had to quit part time job as it required standing for 6 hours a day. Leg has since gotten better with physical therapy and while I still limp, I feel I am now able to return to regular activities, although I am unable to run or walk quickly.

So I have been aggressively focusing on getting a job lately. In fact I have an interview today, and another on Wednesday! I feel I have made great strides with my mental health, therapy is definitely helpful.

I’ve tried to be as helpful as I can around the house because I know no one wants their almost 30 yo daughter with mental issues moving back in with them. I cook dinner frequently, buy groceries with my own money, keep the house clean for them, etc. I don’t have people over, ever, I’m not loud, I don’t drink, I don’t go out for hours and come home at 2am. I’ve thanked constantly for their generosity and kindness for supporting me emotionally and helping me get back on my feet. 

My parents are well off, I saw my dads w2 recently and he makes $350,000 a year which is rather decent IMO. Mom doesn’t work, just hangs out with friends and goes to book club and the ymca.

I KNOW I SHOULDNT HAVE SNOOPED BUT I COULDNT HELP MYSELF. mom was out and left her iPad out. She has an app that links texts from her phone to her iPad. So naturally I read though them. Countless texts and emails between my parents, talking about how disappointed they are with me. How ashamed they are. How I haven’t been doing anything productive. That I’m lazy. That my mom likes th dog more than me. Texts to her friends about how I act like a ten year old. How hard it is having me here. Texts about being more proud of my 16 year old niece who is a life guard on the weekends.

And it just all made me feel really bad. And it feels unfair. I know having me here isn’t easy but ive honestly tried my best to be a courteous guest while making strides on my own goals and self improvement. My injury set me back significantly so I can understand why they have these thoughts, as I was unable to do much more than sit on the couch for 6 weeks in pain. But during that time I was searching for and applying to jobs online.. I just don’t know what else to do, to help them see me in a different light, to make this easier for them and less of a burden with my existence. I guess all I can really do is keep doing what I’m doing regardless and prove them wrong. I don’t know. I want to get in my car and drive west until the road runs out.

TLDR: parents think I am lazy and a burden when I am trying my best to make my life different and better.

325,"I have been in a relationship with a woman who has 4 kids (oldest is 5) for about half a year. All the children have the same father. Their dad has physically and verbally abused my girlfriend in the past. Her walls are filled with holes from her head being smashed into them. It was pretty serious and he served only 6 months in jail for it. He still verbally abuses her. They are still in contact for child support and visitation purposes. Court still allows him to see the kids half the time but he doesn't. She was with their dad off and on for nearly 10 years. He will call her (sometimes drunk) once in a while saying that he misses her and wants to get back together. She has told him many times that they'll never be back together. 

Their dad lives with his mom currently and doesn't have a car since he lost his license due to DUI. His mom almost never wants her grandkids over so my girlfriend will let him visit them at her house and she'll come over to my place while they're visiting. 

Their dad told my girlfriend that he wanted to take the kids to the pumpkin patch but he doesn't have a car. The closest one is half an hour away. My girlfriend asked me if it was ok if she could drive him and the kids to the pumpkin patch and spend the day together. I told her no and she accepted that. She said she can't stand her ex but would be willing to put up with him so her kids could spend time with him. She said she didn't want them to be deprived of seeing their dad. It's a little tricky since he doesn't have a car and not many have cars large enough for that many kids. Mind you this is a man who still has feelings for her. He even admitted the next day he only used the pumpkin patch as an excuse to hangout with her. He has told her recently that if I wanted to adopt the kids he'd be perfectly fine with never seeing them again. 

Am I right to be upset that she would suggest spending time with her abusive ex? 

I told her that if she wanted to drop the kids and their dad all off at a local park and then come home I'd be ok with that. I just don't want them hanging out. She says he makes her really anxious and doesn't like to be around him.

334,"My (19M) girlfriend (18F) who is bipolar keeps telling me that she wants to kill herself and I am really scared of her doing something to herself. Usually when something goes wrong I assure her that things are going to be okay and do my best to calm her down - this usually works and we figure out a plan to help her get back on track. Her mental health just gets the best of her sometimes and I always try to be there for her no matter what so that things are okay. We have been dating for almost 2 years now and I don't and won't ever feel like she is burdening me - I love her and I want to do whatever I can to help her out.

She is in college right now and although she is very intelligent, struggles to attend every class due to mental health and is failing one class because her lecturer doesn't take late submissions. This has gotten her very depressed for a few reasons - she thinks this will be her only chance at proving herself in education and her mother gets very angry and will hate her if she doesn't pass. I've been doing my best to make sure we spend time together to do homework and assuring her that she has plenty of time to get through college, but I can't make her lecturers be more fair to her or stop her parents from being angry at her.

To make matters even worse, she was planning to come stay with me in December (with my family) over Christmas for 2 weeks. We're both very excited and I am even planning to quit my (disposable) retail job and find a new one just so I can have the time off with her. However, her mother bought her the tickets and keeps hanging them over her head to be pulled away if she doesn't pass her classes. Recently her mother has threatened her that someone else will now be accompanying her to my country (despite me visiting them myself not even a few months ago) and this is going to disrupt all our plans as well the fact that my family is not prepared to take in another person, effectively ruining the trip. 

I've told her that we can make things right and that she can only do her best, so she's set up a meeting with some advisers to see if she can make a deal on the class she is failing. However, her mother has found out about this and is not as understanding - this is driving her to a terrible state. This breaks my heart because I care about her more than anything and all I want to do is make sure that she is okay - we both love each other very much and have a mutual end goal to be together in the future after we are done with school. Things are bad now and are set to get even worse for her and I feel completely unable to help her out.

Also, according to recent studies people with foreign sounding names face a lot of discrimination in all facets of life, for example when applying for a flat or a job, or people just assuming you're of lower intellect etc.. My first name already is German so that one isn't a problem. 

Even though I'd like to get rid of my last name by translating it into the German version, I'm having a few doubts. Changing my name would kinda imply I'm a self-hater that is ashamed of his migration background and ethnicity and is desperately trying to erase any trace of his non-German identity. My parents are African immigrants while I was born and raised in Germany so there was always a huge cultural divide and I did have phases where I would flat out reject African culture in order to assimilate. Germanizing my last name would do exactly that. Changing the name in order to evade prejudice might be like bleaching your skin so you can evade racism. It really makes you look like a desperate self-hater and I don't wanna make the impression that I'm a white-worshipping loser. 

On the other hand, our last name also sounds really ugly and is, like I said, unpronounceable. 

Another option would be to just wait for marriage and then take on my husband's name, which would most probably sound a lot better than mine. That way I wouldn't look pathetic because everyone does it.

&amp;#x200B;

2018 has been a really difficult year for me. I'm 28 and was dating someone long distance, which didn't work out, but it was amicable and there was limited collateral damage. About a week later, I went out with some friends (I live in a city) and drank too much. In my stupor, I managed to get to my car and drive home. I hit a guard rail. Nobody was hurt, neither was I, and I am so grateful that my ridiculously stupid and dangerous decision didn't injure anyone or worse, end a life. I was immediately arrested for an OUI, went to court and took the medicine. I participated in a class and went to AA meetings as mandated and learned a lot about my coping mechanisms and why I was partying on weekends so much in the first place (I drink much less now, usually reserved for weekends, and take only Uber and public transit as my car was a loss).  


All year, I've felt immense shame and guilt for what I did. I finished classes, paid off my fines and I will have my license back in a week (my suspension ended months ago, but I have been using other forms of ID and have limited need for a drivers license right now).

&amp;#x200B;

After I wrapped up my legal/court obligations, I was feeling so desperate and unlike myself that I decided I was just going to go on a few app dates to just meet people that knew nothing about me. I thought it would help me feel normal again to just go and chat with some new people and I wouldn't have to feel like this shameful monster. My first date ended up going really well, and we began seeing each other regularly, and I held onto the guilt of my secret for a few months before telling him. He was extremely understanding and wasn't remotely judgmental or weird about it. We continued dating happily, and I felt relieved. It was the first time I had dated someone in about 7 years that I had genuine feelings for and thought we had something different than my past relationships (I've causally dated on and off in that period of time, countless first and only dates on apps but nobody gave me the same feelings I had with this guy).

&amp;#x200B;

We dated all summer, and about a month ago I was laid off in a company downsizing. I was completely devastated as I loved my company and had just moved into a pricier apartment. I felt the rug had been pulled out from underneath me and had no idea what I was going to do next. I've been applying nonstop for jobs in my field, and related positions online to no avail. I'm very lucky to have a great support system with family and friends, and the guy I was seeing.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved two days after the layoff. I suffer clinical depression and have been managing for years, but after my layoff I've just left all my stuff in boxes and have basically holed up alone in my apartment because I feel shame, dread and guilt over where I am at now in my life (unemployed with a criminal record).

&amp;#x200B;

This past week, my parents let me know they will be selling my childhood home, which further contributed to some irrational sadness (I'm happy for them, but sad to see my childhood home go). A few days later after six months of consistently seeing each other, the guy I was dating abruptly ended things over the phone after a 40 minute normal conversation about what we each did out with friends the night prior and other normal conversation we usually have. He pauses and says he has something to tell me- which is that he feels like he's been putting on a ""mask"" with me and can't be there for me 100%, He also apologized for doing this given ""surrounding circumstances"" in my life. It boiled down to me that he wasn't as into the relationship as I was, and my personal issues were more than he had perhaps bargained for. This was after he was away for a work trip for a month and we had limited contact, but he had come home and we seemed to fall back into place for a few days (wasn't the case, obviously).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing this sitting at my parents house because I couldn't bear being alone this week. I finally cried over everything that has happened this year as well as the sting of rejection and further feeling I am out at sea emotionally. I have no idea where to go next in my life, and I'm not even sure I want to still be here anymore. My friends and family have been nothing but supportive and stood by my side through everything, but I'm having trouble finding it inside myself to carry on. Today I sent my resume out to 10 potential employers, I got a good nights sleep last night and have had minimal tears today. Maybe this isn't the right thread to post on, but I'm wondering if anyone else has had a never ending parade of bullshit in a short amount of time and has any insight.

I have a daughter that was a victim of sexual battery in our school district. Nothing was done and we are currently in the middle of a lawsuit with the school district and their mishandling of the situation. I was able to get a 504 disability act filled out for her that outlines her touch of PTSD she received from that incident at the school which has helped mitigate things regarding schooling. She's currently on MAOI's and a handful of other medications to deal with her depression. She has had counselors however they have all been very bad. One even tried to push her to religion. I noped out of there fast. However, it has left her with a distain for counselors. She refuses to go to any. I am a single father which doesn't help my situation a lot. I handle things dealing with her by myself and thankfully my company is understanding of my situation.

Because of what happened, my daughter cannot handle anything dealing with school. She never finished the 8th grade and she is currently in 9th. I was able to get her into a digital independent study program (Thanks for the 504 disability) at the school where she can work at her own pace. She has lost contact with a lot of her friends that she had (she doesn't attend physical school anymore). She does not get out of the house much because she is depressed.

The problem is she will not do any work for the school. I have even logged into the portal and told her to tell me the answers she wants to write. However, she will not sit and work with me in this.

Every time she thinks about anything with school, she freezes up with anxiety and gets depressed. She can sleep for 12+ hours during the day and just neglect to do the work. She is very far behind and the school wants to remove her from the independent study program because of the lack of work she has put in. I have tried to talk to my daughter about it but the anxiety of everything has left her paralyzed and refusing to talk about things. I am not sure where to go in all of this. I have reached out to the school and they are only able to help so much. The teachers and principal have been supportive but when it comes to the work.. it has to be done. So far, I have done what I can to make things as easy as I could for my daughter but it's been stone walled for her. I have come to the despairing conclusion that she will not graduate at all. 

The school system sucks. My daughter refuses to do any work. She will not talk to any counselors.

I am reaching out asking for help. I don't know what to do. She is about to be kicked out of school and we will have no place to go afterward. I cannot home school because it's just me.

356,"Hi, I'm new to this sub, but I don't know where else to post this.
This might be long winded so please bear with me, as I'm also on mobile.
Over the past year and a half of dating my boyfriend, I've found that we don't have as much in common as I thought. This isn't a bad thing. I like that we're different. And part of being different means trying new things. We have almost a ten year age gap so there is plenty to explore as far as our favorite shows, movies, childhood pastimes, etc. 

So I guess I'll get right down to the point of why I'm here. He flat out refuses to watch certain movies or shows with me. He insists that the types of movies I'm into that I have tried to get him to watch with me (mostly Wes Anderson movies) are quote, ""garbage hipster movies, that pander to people who think they're cool, but are just a bunch of hispters.""
In the past, we have marathoned old movies that he loves that I have never seen. They weren't particularly my favorite genres of movies, but I enjoyed seeing a new movie and watching the movie with him. He seems to take it personally that I would even ask him to watch these movies. It's all very weird to me. I have given up trying to watch certain things that I like, because i generally don't have time to watch things by myself. He says I can always say no to watching the things he wants to watch, but I'm not generally that picky. Or if I'm not into it, the cellphone is always at hand. Which is what I'd at least expect of him. 

So having since given up on my boyfriend watching any ""hipster"" movies. I also recently suggested a movie to my co-worker. He watched it over the weekend and this morning when he told me he had watched it I was excited to talk about it with him. But all he said was ""it was dumb"". I was hurt by this, surprisingly. Considering it is one of my favorite movies. I told him, I can see it wouldn't be for every one, and that I was sorry to hear he didnt like it.

One more! Way back in highschool I was also upset by my best friends making fun of the movie I picked out for movie night. It was my turn to pick, and every one spent the entire time poking fun of it. I ended up leaving early without the movie. 

So that's it. I'm worried I take these things too personally. I understand they're just movies, and it's irrational to think people would be this way to intentionally hurt me. Can someone give me advice on how to have thicker skin? Or at least how to convince my boyfriend to give the movies I like a chance? Thank you in advance. I know this is all silly.",08Oct2018,1

Hours later I come home to my dad's house to go to bed. At 1 am I felt sick again so I grabbed a garbage bag and threw up in it and I pass out like actually pass out and the bag was left open. My stepmother knocks on my door asking what the smell is I wake up and tell her I threw up in a bag and passed out. She starts to freak out on me about how I'm not responsible and how there are kids in the house. I told her the whole story and she thinks that I shit in the bag and kept it in my room. I tried to tell her I threw up the room smelt like vomit not feces. She decided that I shit in a bag which has never happened to me.

367,"Hello, first I’d like to thank you for reading and any advice.

This is for the job of: law enforcement officer

So my honest employment history is as follows: 

worked for a grocery store for a year and a half. Left on good terms (2 weeks notice, almost no call-ins) for better employment as a bartender. Wanted more money, probably my biggest mistake.

Worked for Applebees as a host, then bartender for a year with good attendance.

Left for military service

Came back to applebees and moved to a server position (manger hated it, but I felt over-worked and underpaid as a bartender) Worked here for maybe another year. During this time my work performance deteriorated. Took on too many jobs. I was military, a police explorer, did part time volunteer work for the local PDs tavern unit, went to college, and worked at applebees. Eventually got fired (partially unfairly after being told my shift was covered during a state-wide explorer event) in the end, my fault. I learned to not take too much workload at once and moved on.

Worked for panda express for a year. Loved it til I got a new manager. He expected too much from me (working on days I could not due to military or school). I eventually had to quit in fear he would fire me like he did another employee who genuinely did nothing wrong but turn him down to work extra shifts. I walked in to work, saw he scheduled me 5 days, most of which I could not work, and walked out. This was the 4th week in a row of explaining I could not work those days, and he would always hold this against me.

Worked for menards for a year and a half. I liked it but due to a problem with a recurring ingrown nail in both big toes I was out of work for 2 months, not consecutively. It was largely a problem due to an ER problem with the doctor unable to get it right the first time. They really didn’t like this, my main department boss told me he hated that I called in too much, but I had no choice cause of the toes. I felt awful, but what could I do? I also did not get along with a manager who said very provocative things around people during shift to a point where me and other employees were told to put in complaints against her. She hated most people, but still has the power to give a statement if utilized. I put in a 2 week notice but did not complete it (again, due to another toe issue) they said this was fine, but sounded extremely aggravated. They asked for a note, which I provided for the upteenth time from me, but claimed they never got the fax I sent them when I saw my manager months later.

I worked for 1-2 months at bestbuy, but got called for a deployment and rather than making them hold my position after already being short-staffed, I quit on good terms. All was well.

Worked for a temp-agency with perfect attendance to fill that small gap then deployed. Felt the best route so I didn’t screw up anymore of my work history.

I have called in to shifts due to being sick or such, not much, but sometimes over the course of 8 years of working. Most, if not all, had a doctors note.

I have perfect on-time attendance. Never late for any shift that I can honestly remember.

I have many sworn police officers, and military supervisors, on the departments I’m applying to, or that I volunteered under, who can verify I am a great worker. But my one-time firing and some managers who I didn’t always get along with deter my self confidence.

368,"Just moved into university accommodation with 5 other random people from all over the country, we all get along well as a group. All of our house has similar interests and we spend a lot of time together as a group. There are 4 boys (including me) and 2 girls. Since day 1 I have had a crush on one of the girls but I didn't really think too much of it. As the first 2 or so weeks progressed we started spending a lot of time together, including stopping up late just the 2 of us talking.

We even joined the same sports team, just because we enjoy that sport meaning that we end up spending even more time together. It was on a social night out with the sports team that when something happened with someone and security I panicked but not for myself but about whether she was ok. That's when I really realised how much I had a crush on this girl.

In fear of causing friction between the group I pushed myself away trying to distance myself from her but it's impossible. I'm 80% sure she doesn't like me in that way or even know that I like her like that, one of the guys figured out that I like her and I admitted it but I just don't know how to progress from this point is it wrong to try and act on it as it would make things awkward?

370,"I am sixteen, a 10th grade student and I get too anxious sometimes. Sometimes I get too excited for something good that might have happened to me. Lemme elaborate with a few examples. Firstly I am kind of addicted to my PC. Whever something even as minor as an extra file in the system folder occurs to my PC, I kinda get urged to format the whole Operating System to remove that one file which I know is sick. Another thing is that if something good is to happen to me I get so excited that my innerself urges me to break some glass and windows. I have not done something like that yet when I am happy or excited but I have done it a number of times when I get even a little offended or triggered. If you want to trigger me, that's so easy. I get easily angry over issues as small as a false allegations about a broken vase or a misplaced pair of scissors. At school, I know I can't behave like what I behave at home in front of my parents. so i control my anxiety and this gives me shivers. I have hit my father who is suffering from oral cancer right on his tumor just because I was offended by that he shouted at me. I pushed my mother so bad that she was about to hit a metal tap that could even kill her. Worst part is that, once when I came back after school after performing badly in a test, I blamed it all on my phone and destroyed it with a hammer. my parents were at first happy wit my decision because they thought I am getting serious about studies but their happiness was ruined when they realized that after quitting phones, I have been a couch potato of PC. I totally stick on the PC and I can't get off it and focus and study. Even if I take out my books, I keep thinking of the upcoming tech events, Google Products, My PC's specsheet and how I can enhance it, blah blah blah. It's all crazy. My parents have asked my a lot of times to see a psychiatrist because I don't want to be declared mentally ill and let my friends know that I go to psychiatrist. Because after that I will never be able to be comfortable with my friends even if they don't judge me. my symptoms are not normal. You can't believe how far I go when I am angry. And I take all the blames for it. I also remain stressed all of the time because of my lack of focus on studies. This makes me even more enraged when I am shouted at. Especially when I am told to study more when I already know I should study more and I am not. Please tell me how can I overcome this huge problems. I don't want a dark future with no respect in life at all. I used to be once the most intelligent person of my class but now I am just an insane asshole who doesn't being surrounded by people and doesn't even attend the school regularly. I often skip school, like 28 times in a month. you know that's so bad. Please tell me what kind of problem I might be suffering from?  


  


No need to tell that I am a devil. Nobody will hit his cancer suffering father right on his tumor just because he shouted at me.

Okay..this will be a lot to digest. Please  read the whole post before judging me or hopefully giving some advice on  how I can move forward, this is really hard for me and I have not  spoken to anyone about it.

Since I was  about 10-11 years old I found on my left testicles had some lumps around  it. I don’t remember what I thought about it at the time but I guess I  just hoped it would go away and therefore pretended like nothing. I  continued this self-denying behavior but as I got older I started  theorizing what it could be. I didn’t think it was cancer until I was  probably 16 something, and I still didn’t do anything about it because I  was afraid and ashamed of it being testicular.

I  have gone through periods where the pain is extreme, where I have had  troubles walking due to the pain in the abdomen and back. I have stretch  marks on my back, not sure if that is a sign that it spread from the  testicle to lymph and from the up along my spine.

In  the beginning of my twenties, I discovered new lumps in my arm pits.  After that I started feeling some small ones on my neck and under my  jaw. Since 25, I started feeling those around my neck and under my jaw  becoming it bit bigger, and also discovered new around my shoulders. The  lumps on my abdomen are also on both the right and left side of my  crouth now, but so far only the left testicle seems to have lumps. The  lumps on my body sometimes seem to change shape and size, being bigger  some days and smaller others.

Other  symptoms, other then the lumps and every-now-and-then pain, is that I  sometimes see small light flashes in my vision, periods where I feel  completely out of energy. I sometimes have dull, pulsing pain in my left  testicle, abdomen and neck, sometimes the dull pain turns in to sharp  spikes of pain and then disappears.

Despite all of this, I am almost never sick with a fever or have a cold. If I do, it is only once per year or so.

The  last years I have been contemplating if I should seek help or just  throw in the towel and give up. I feel paralyzed by my anticipation of  how the hospital/doctors will react when I show up explaining my  symptoms. Terrified of how family and friends will react knowing I have  known so long but not done anything about it.

Do  I have any chance of survival if I seek treatment now? If so, what are  my chances? What sort of treatment would I have to endure?

Any  advice on how I can pull my self together and deal with it? I mean I  just feel so pathetic and weak, I am not sure how to handle it all.",08Oct2018,1
376," 

This situation has been building up for a while, but I'm reaching the end of my rope and was hoping I could receive some advice on this.

Background: My boyfriend and I have been together three years, first two of which were long distance (met on Reddit). I moved to his city about a year ago for grad school; he wasn't the sole reason I moved here, but a big part. We get to see each other about once or twice a week since we don't live together and are both in school and working.

I have always been on good terms with his mother. He is the youngest of three and is the last one to leave home (still lives there to save money), and she's a single mom, so she really relies on him for help around the house and honestly as company/emotional support. The issues started when he would stay over my place once a week (because we finally could do that!) but he would have to be home early the next morning to take care of chores or whatever for his mom. She would text or call asking where he was and when he would be home, she needed him to do this or that. She would also call him just to chat on her way home from work while him and I were hanging out on our one designated day a week.

Anyway, the ultimate issue happened about a month ago. My grandmother that lives five hours back home was dying. I was incredibly close with her, and it had a huge emotional toll on me. I decided to spontaneously drive back home to see her one last time. At first, I told my boyfriend he didn't have to come with me, but he insisted on being supportive. However, the weekend I ended up choosing coincided with a big sports game that he and his mom had planned on going to months ago. He said that was the one weekend he couldn't come with me, but at that point I had changed my mind because I was nervous about driving in this emotional state. After a ton of fighting between us, he finally arranged to come back with me. I was initially really upset because I felt he was choosing a game over supporting me, but once I saw his mom's reaction I saw why he didn't want to cancel on her... I went over their house the night before we left. She didn't say one word to me to ask how I was doing or how my family was holding up, nothing. Instead she sat there being pissy, even screaming at the dog.

Like, shouldn't she be proud she raised a son that wants to be there to support his partner?? Instead she was selfish and was upset because I guess I ""stole"" him away when they had this day planned (never mind that she has season passes and they could plan to go to another game together, just not this huge rivalry game). When we got back from the trip, she was incredibly rude to him still and the tension was unreal. I felt really bad, but he reassured me, and told her again, that he does not regret going back with me and wanted to be by my side through this hard time.

Ironically, just recently she had to have surgery and of course everyone drops everything to help her without question. It infuriates me that she gets what she needs and wants with ease while she made my life hell when my family member was dying!

So I guess my question is, do I sit down and talk to her about what happened? As I said, we are actually pretty close and she treats me like family (when it's convenient for her). She spoils me with gifts during the holidays and we've even hung out one on one. I'm conflicted because besides this big event, and her overbearingness on my boyfriend, we get along just fine. Also, it is clear that my boyfriend needs to move out of her house, which we know will be a huge battle with her. I was hoping maybe people on here have suggestions on how he could start the process and go about making this as easy as possible.

My apologies for the ramble, this has just been building up and I'm not sure what he or I should do, if anything at all. Thanks for reading if you took the time to read all of it!!

377,"Over the past few years my beautiful mother's mental and physical health has been declining. For years she was working for the school district as a lunch monitor, and she loved it. My mom has always had depression and anxiety problems, especially after my father and her divorced, and this job had brought her so much joy watching the kids grow up through the years.

Fast forward to about 6 months ago, and she contracts chronic Epstein Barr, and is out of work with Mononucleosis for weeks. Even with doctors notes the powers at be at the school got her fired. This sent her further into depression. This job is the only thing she could physically do, and even a relaxed job like this had her struggling.
Before I was born, my mom was in a pretty severe car accident that shattered her ankle. At the time her drug dealing boyfriend was driving, and was scared to take her to the hospital. She layed in an apartment for a few days taking illegal drugs to stop the pain of her crushed bones, until a friend finally picked her up and took her to the hospital. After the initial surgery involving plates and screws, she has had to have multiple following surgeries resulting in bone spurs and horrible nerve and scar damage. Years later the doctors would decide to fuse the ankle (basically severing the Achilles tendon and fusing the bones together).

Today, she's struggling with mental and memory problems, severe pain in random joints which the doctors say is most likely fibromyalgia (brought on by the Epstein Barr virus I believe, but thank god she tested negative for Lupus) and she now has seizures and flashbacks of waking up during surgery. She has memory and mental issues that we're trying to find the source of and she's also trying to maintain her diabetes, even though she's in the best shape she's been in in 20 years. We're also fighting to get disability for her since she can't work, which is a very long and frustrating road, but we can't afford legal help.

My mom lives with my grandmother, and together they have been working together very hard to try and keep bills up to date. This has been made much more difficult since my grandfather passed away a little less than a month ago due to malpractice. My grandmother's name was in the will, but somehow my grandfather's daughters (who completely rejected him and wouldn't come to see him on his death bed) fought to get every last penny of my grandfather's life insurance. My grandmother was left penniless.

It has come to the point that I think they may lose the house. My mom's savings are exhausted, and all she has at this point are food stamps. I help her with a few medicines, but I'm lucky if I'm able to even pay my own bills at this point of the year. To make things worse, her last visit to a specialist said that they want to send her to another specialist to check for cancer.

If anyone could give me some advice or words of hope on any of these problems, I would be so very grateful.

TL;DR: My single mom cannot work due to a fused ankle, memory problems, seizures, fibromyalgia, and a few other issues. I would have never imagined that my mom and grandmother would be facing eviction.
Any advice or guidance is greatly appreciated. ",08Oct2018,1

I am not against smoking weed at all, but we are having issues with our new neighbors that have only been there 4 days. The minute they moved in, its SO much weed or its very potent that it is seeping through our apartment everywhere. 

The smell is upstairs and downstairs and extremely potent. I can’t catch them in person ever because it looks like they work 3rd shift or something the past few days, but might leave a note?

We also had issues with other neighbors who were previously in there the past two months due to their drug use (worse drugs), excessive people at all times and loudness so now if I complain again on these new people I will look like some neighbor patrol person which I do not want to be.

382,"**tl;dr** don’t know if my ex felt me move her underwear when we’d hook up and want to know if this was sexual assault

Katie and I dated from October to April. During this relationship, we experimented sexually with each other. Katie was rather inexperienced, so a lot of what we did was ""trial and error"" - for lack of a better term. It first started with me trying to finger her and she expressed comfort with only over her underwear at that time. Over time, after doing only that for a while, I slowly motioned my hand under her underwear and moved my way towards her vagina and she allowed it. The same process happened with eating her out. My head would go down her legs and I'd kiss up them and she'd either move my head away (at first) or allow me to do it. Additionally, I did feel like I was moving too fast with things and told her I felt like we hooked up too much, to which she responded ""I am always down to do sexual things with you and will tell you if something isn't okay"". She truly lived this out by moving head or hands away or expressing no if she didn't want to hook up that night. She also expressed to me that she was ""afraid of sperm and that we would have sex before she ever gave me a handjob"". She also ruled blowjobs completely out for forever. Towards the end of our relationship, I started losing feelings for her and broke things off with her.

I broke up with her the week before my fraternity formal because part of me wanted to sleep with someone at it. When I got back to school from the formal, I met up with Katie because she wanted to talk. During this, she told me that ""she was going to have sex with me at formal"". So being the young, horny 19 year old that I was - I immediately started hooking up with her again because I thought she would have sex with me. I started trying to take things further with the intent of ALWAYS stopping if she expressed no or there was any level of discomfort/hesitation.

During these ensuing hookups, I would undress Katie down to her underwear and she would do the same to me. We would make out, I would finger her, occasionally eat her out, and then we would have ""outercourse"" where I would grind on top of her. I would then take my dick and angle it into her vagina over top of her underwear and start thrusting into her. It never went inside because the underwear acted as a barrier. It did hurt the tip of my dick a lot, but there was one time when the natural friction moved her underwear to the side and I immediately felt how wet it was. In combination with the friction and me grabbing my dick, I moved her underwear to the side to try and initiate sex and because it felt better and didn’t hurt. When this happened, Katie reacted in a positive way and I could tell she liked how it felt. I slowly started pumping into her some and felt a clear breakthrough, from where my dick was dry to when it was wet, into her (I think). Throughout the time I was slowly pumping into her, I checked her reactions and she showed even more pleasure and was definitely into it. I was scared that I was moving too fast or that she might end up saying no, so I only ended up going 1-3 inches inside of her. I ended up stopping because I was close to coming and didn't want to come in her. I did check to make sure she was enjoying herself and that she seemed okay with it and liked it.

In subsequent encounters, I would move her underwear when it would start to hurt my dick and start to slowly pump into her like I did in the paragraph above as to try and move things forward, and gauged her reactions, again like in the paragraph above. While I knew it was unchartered waters, I told myself ""she’s participating and enjoying it and she's not saying anything objecting to it"". There were a couple times when I got anxious that it wasn’t okay, so I stopped immediately and went back to over top of her underwear. She never seemed like she wasn’t into it, I was just anxious about it. I would even argue that when I did it, her reactions would become more intimate and she enjoyed it more. She would pull me in closer, kiss me back, moan in pleasure, and did other things that indicated she was okay with it. I inferred this change and escalation in reaction as she was expressing that she was enjoying herself and that she liked what was going on. On other times, she seemed super into it, so I would slowly progress things further. There was ONE time when she did ask me if I was over top of her underwear or not, and I got caught up in the moment and immediately used my hand to move her underwear back over top and pulled my tip out. I did say ""yes"" when it was back over, but more to confirm that it was - and I didn't go back to this during the encounter. I know this isn’t what I should’ve said, but at the moment, the most important thing to me was stopping because she expressed she didn’t want it. 

We had some dates after this encounter and some casual hookups and make-out sessions. I slowly built things back up with her sexually to see if she would be interested in sex. There was one time when we were showering together and I started to put my erect dick inside of her (about the same distance I had before) and she told me to “be careful”, so I brought it down a notch. I also slowly built things up again when we were in bed together and eventually moved her underwear back to the side after gauging reactions and not doing it for some hookups (the make out sessions above). I moved it to try and initiate things with her, but I ALWAYS had the intention to stop if I was told or if I could tell she was uncomfortable and not enjoying herself. Eventually, we got to a point where she asked to have sex, but we stopped after she sat fully down on my dick because ""it hurt her too much"". We never ended up having sex though.

If I remember correctly, I only moved her underwear and handful of times, with the time she asked the question being the middle one. I always had the intention to stop and always checked to see if she was enjoying herself - which she was. I know I would've stopped if she had said anything or acted like she did during the one time I did stop, and I was just trying to warm things up to sex. I hate that I didn't ask and was just going off the fact that she seemed to be enjoying it and wasn't saying anything. I now know that I will ALWAYS ask and not try to push things along, and will forever ask before initiating sex with any partner from here on out.",08Oct2018,1

384,"I personally think that I am a pretty calm person, and I can handle anger  pretty well, not the best, though. No where near anger issues, though.  But, I have a friend with definite anger issues. You see, we both are  vivid Geometry Dash players, and have enjoyed the game for a few years  now, but, the nature of the game makes him go into fits of rage  occasionally. 

Now, you may think it's  sort of semi-normal to rage at a game DESIGNED to be difficult, but he  takes it to the next level. He has stated that he has destroyed ELEVEN  phones over the game in the past, and has said, ""I will quit"" more times  than I can count. I can also sometimes hear him slamming his computer  or just hitting it. And, it's an issue. My  friend also told me his mother even banned him from Geometry Dash as a  game. But he still plays it, I have tried to tell him to stop playing if  he feels angry, but he rejects it.

386,"TLDR; My half-brother is a minor. His dad keeps kicking him out but I can’t support him. I can’t find any services willing to intervene with dad. 

22/F/OR

My little half-brother just turned fifteen and is a freshman in high school. This year he has been skipping school almost every day. Our local government and child welfare services are a disaster and I don’t believe they’ll ever follow up on his chronic absence. Myself and my grandma have contacted them countless times. 

His dad has full custody of him since our mom is severely mentally ill. He keeps kicking him out of his house for skipping school. I don’t see the logic behind it, but you can’t have a reasonable discussion with the man. Forget it. 

When he puts him out, my brother skateboards across the city and shows up at my apartment any random hour of the day/night. I adore him and want to provide a loving/safe environment for him, but the truth is that I’m dealing with my own mental health and financial struggles. I also work full-time and share an apartment with my longtime boyfriend. He cares and wants to help but has to also maintain his boundaries, too. 

Last night as we were winding down we were buzzed from downstairs. I knew immediately it was my little brother and he’d been kicked out again. I don’t usually involve police unless there’s an emergency but my job requires me to be mandatory reporter. When the police came they essentially performed a welfare check and moved on, stating that there’s nothing else they can do as long as he isn’t endangered. 

This morning my boyfriend was kind enough to get up early and drive him across the city to school. After many lectures, promises, and hugs we’d sent him off with hopes that he’d make it to class and stay there. I called attendance later only to learn he didn’t show. Gut-wrenching. 

Now I’m just playing the waiting game for my brother to eventually go home, get chewed up and spat out, and show up here unannounced. I made an agreement with my him—if he didn’t stay a whole day at school, he could not come back to my apartment. I reminded him that his dad is obligated to allow him back inside or I would have to involve the police again, but if he skipped I couldn’t rescue him again (obviously I’d still let him stay with me if he was put out). 

What should I do now? I feel like I’m drowning. I’ve contacted counselors, crisis workers, and several welfare services. I asked grandma to arrange a situation for him at her house, but nothing has panned out. If I wasn’t so fragile and in the early stages of sobriety, maybe I’d be better equipped to offer him time and support. Unfortunately, as cold as it feels, at this time I just can’t afford the parental responsibilities. 

How do I help my brother? It’s now or never...",08Oct2018,1
387,"Literally don't know where to start. 

&amp;#x200B;

In March I finished Secondary School and in May I finished the exams that the 5 years of secondary school have been preparing me for. I'm (or was I guess) a very bright student and I got great results in these exams without studying, without stress, and got into the best college in the country. (Context: I live in Malta, a very small island in the middle of Europe and there's like 4 colleges) After the exam came summer, and I spent the ENTIRE summer until I started college with absolutely nothing to do. Was nice the first two weeks but then it started getting very boring and depressing. I'd play video games all day just to pass time because I had nothing else to do and I did not enjoy it. So fast forward like two weeks ago, finally starting college, pretty hyped to finally start something and I'm in that generic teenager school crisis I think. (I'm 16 BTW)

&amp;#x200B;

So you have to choose 2 subjects to study at Advanced level, 3 at Intermediate Level and then you have this useless extra compulsory subject everybody hates. I took Pure Maths and Computing at advanced level. (I'm a tech enthusiast and looking to work in the technological sector when I grow up so these made sense). Then I took Physics (very useful), English (needed to get into University so made sense to take it) and Accounting (good to have I guess).

&amp;#x200B;

I knew Pure Maths at Advanced Level was something, but since I always loved Maths, always did well in it without needing to study, I guessed that working hard would get me through it. Here's my situation right now:

&amp;#x200B;

Spending minimum of 6 hours on Maths homework every day (plus a bonus revision homework at the end of the week with more challenging versions of all topics covered that week). Until today I always managed to complete it (barely) and understand (more or so) the topic. This isn't just me, all students are taking this amount of time and struggling with the work. If I only had Maths to deal with I honestly wouldn't mind as I enjoy problem solving however:

&amp;#x200B;

\- I need to deal with the 5 other subjects homework and revision.

\- 55 hours of community/voluntary work throughout the first college year (college is 2 years here) are required at places they selected because it's something students that go to this college have to do. That's 2 hours a week possibly until the end of summer.

\- I have to do that extra subject's project which involves minimum 30 hours of work and tons of hassle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Take care of my medical condition (Type 1 Diabetes)

\- Try to make new friends and build some sort of social skills that I NEED to do (which, being an introvert with social anxiety amongst other things, is a bit hard. I missed the welcome party, which I paid for, so I could stay home and finish my Maths homework last week)

\- Try to get in some sort of shape because I'm super weak

\- Take care of the dog, I'm literally arriving home and leaving her there crying and barking so she could do something after spending the entire day sitting there waiting so I could start my homework as quickly as possible and feel guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And it would be great if I can do all this while maintaining a good sleep schedule and having some spare time. Funnily enough, now that I want to play video games because new anticipated titles are coming out very soon, I'm going to have absolutely zero time to do so, I will probably barely have any time to do my work when we'd start diving deeper into the subjects.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like the problem is Maths, I could manage to do all of that and more if I don't have to spend 6 hours every day doing some homework. First 2 hours are fine, but then I'd start getting alienated and tired leading to degraded performance resulting in more stress and time wasted.

&amp;#x200B;

Literally have no idea what to do. Someone could tell me I'm gonna die in my sleep and not care. Needed to relax a bit and vent, I'd love to continue my homework but I can't because I'm stuck and really fed up at this point. Can anybody give me some advice?

388,"I want him to have feelings for me, so I can break his heart like he did with mine. I also want to make him feel horrible when he sees a picture of me and a handsome man on snapchat.

I had feelings for him and consider him as my ""ex-fwb."" I didn't expect to date him, but a year later I developed my feelings for him. I thought I was in love with him for months. A couple months ago, I saw a picture of him and a pretty girl at bar in his snapchat story 2 months ago. It killed my self-esteem, and I felt so humiliated because I didn't want to date other guys and I wanted him only. I had feelings for him, and I missed him. I tried to figure out how I can confess my feelings for him, but I felt so disgusted when I saw his snapchat story. In his side, he wasn't thinking about it and he just went out to have fun and flirted with another girl. They probably hooked up??? I felt so stupid and embarrassed!! I was devastated, and I was depressed for few months. I couldn't the picture out of my mind. I felt so foolish for loving a guy who wasn't interested in me.

I already moved on, and I no longer have feelings for him, but I still felt resentful toward him for harming my pride. It made me look bad! I experienced pains. I want him to experience the same pains I felt! I want him to know how horrible this felt! I want to show him if he likes that! When I was in love with him, I didn't wish to harm him and I never thought of that when I was shattered. Now I no longer have feelings for him and I want to take my revenge on him.

So how can I make him develop his feelings for me? My goal is to get him to fall in love with me so I will ask a random hot guy somewhere if he can be in picture with me for snapchat. If he said yes, I'll post it in my snapchat story and it will shatter him. The problem is I am shy and nice. If I talked to someone, I changed my mind and no longer wished to harm them.

390,"I have been living with very low-key depression my whole life, and I just started therapy for the first time a few months ago.  My therapist thinks I might have dystimia; basically, I have a lot of functionality, despite my chronically low moods.  Most days I don't feel much at all; some days I will feel overwhelmed, anxious, or sad without any apparent reason; on rare occasions I will feel like completely shutting down, with some suicidal fantasies but no urge to act on them in any way.  Across the board I feel a lack of motivation.  I feel like all of my hobbies and other daily activities are just distractions from stuff I would rather not feel, but they don't provide a lot of enjoyment themselves.  I am just going through the motions with as little effort as possible.

So my therapist talked me into seeing a psychiatrist.  I made an appointment, and I was really surprised by how in-and-out the process was.  I spent maybe 15 minutes taking a multiple choice assessment, and then another 20 minutes actually talking to the psychiatrist.  About 5 minutes into that 20 minute talk the psychiatrist told me she was prescribing Welbutrin, and we spent the other 15 minutes talking through what to expect from the medication.

This is where I need advice, because I am really not sure how I feel about starting the meds.  As I  mentioned, I am already highly functional.  My mood never gets in the way of work or other priorities; rather, it just makes me feel emotionally detached and generally unmotivated.  I would like to be able to feel more, have more motivation and feel more committed to living the best life, but there's not exactly a sense of urgency here.  I am not going to completely derail my life if I don't change – instead, I would just keep chugging along in my normal gray fog.  I am just not sure that starting meds is entirely justified.

I realize that asking for advice in this sub isn't going to be like getting a second opinion from a doctor, so I am not really asking people to dissect my own situation and throw in their two cents.  Really I am just asking if anyone can relate and share their own experience with starting meds for a more mild form of depression.

**Hi.**

I am 17 years old and come from Europe.

I am currently attending the second hardest school in my country in a special program for a certain subject.

Over the last few years I had trouble going out,being social etc.

I became very lazy and have no motivation to learn my subjects and get good grades.I have no real interests and I just waste most of my time doing nothing or browsing the internet.

Many times I wanted to go talk to an adult and seek professional help but I never had the courage to do so.

When I was little I was a happy and a cheerful child but bullying in the elementary school destroyed my character.

Many years I had no friends and I was very lonely.I remember my parents telling me to go outside and socialize and I just kept reminding me I had no friends and nobody liked me.

I was close to ending my life a few times and often have suicidal thoughts.

When I started going to highschool I got a few close friends and finally a girlfriend,but I still feel empty and useless.

I really do not know what to write.

I just want somebody to help me but I am to afraid people will take it as joke and will not take my feelings seriously.

I found this subreddit and hoped at least one person can help me and encourage me to have the strength to seek for help.

Thank you for any support and sorry if this subreddit is not for stuff like this.",08Oct2018,1
396,"School has always been something I had problems with, not because of grades, but because of how they teach us, how we’re supposed to learn, studying, that kind of thing. High school wasn’t too bad, I didn’t need to study to pass, even though I hated the subjects I was asked to understand. But now in college I’m forced to change who I am, who I’ve always been, so I can have a passing grade. I know this just sounds like a kid who doesn’t wanna study, and in a way, it is. I’m a kid who doesn’t want to study something she’s unhappy with. If I worked hard, I’d pass. I know I would. And I’m passing college right now, but I fucking hate it. I hate college so much. The way of teaching just isn’t for me, teachers put too much faith in me, and I just hate everything about it. Why am I studying sociology? Why am I studying knowledge? Why am I studying Chicago style? Why am I doing this? 

I just feel like I’m being a whiny kid who doesn’t want to work. It’s pathetic. 

What I want to do though, is something so stupid, I won’t make money, I won’t be successful, it won’t show my capacities and intelligence, which I’ve always prided myself on. I want to be a fucking hairdresser. What happened to me wanting to be a doctor? A psychiatrist? A psychologist? Nope, I want to cut hair! I’ve cut my own hair since I was 14, it’s always been something I found calming, something I’ve fallen in love with. I’d cut my hair as a coping mechanism, I’d cut my hair when I wanted change, I’d cut my hair when I needed to vent. 

Now I’m considering dropping out of college tomorrow, just going into the registrar’s office and telling them that I need to go. Because I think I do, I think I need to go. Working like this has always taken a toll on my mental health (a story for another time aha), my physical health, my life. I just don’t know if I should drop out of college, lose the money I invested in it, the time I invested in it. My parents are going to be so disappointed. Their star child, the one who was going places, the one who got A’s on everything she did, the one who could become a fucking astrophysicist if she worked hard enough, dropping out of college to pursue a career in hairdressing. 
What should I do? I have college a try, I really did, but it just isn’t for me.

I could feel him staring at me in the corner of my eye all class every class, and if I accidentally locked eyes with him he'd give me a weird smile. I hated even looking to that side of the classroom because from his body language it seemed to give him the wrong idea and that made me very uncomfortable. In addition to the staring, as we were walking out of class he would always look behind him, and if he saw me he would start slowing wayyy down, as if to let me catch up with him. My response was always to speedwalk past him to my next destination. I should mention that I am a guy, but a small one. He has a bit more size than me which makes it a bit more uncomfortable.

I'll always go to the library, and he'll always walk ahead and sit at a table near the entrance. None of it is so criminally creepy that I feel like I should file a report, but it is creepy enough to make me pretty uncomfortable. Like I can't even look to one side of the room in my classes because this guy assumes I'm trying to sneak a peak at him or something, and starts hardcore staring. If you're thinking this might be in my head, I should say that he did try to talk to me once outside of class, it was the most awkward experience of my life.

I don’t want to spend much but here’s where my issues lie.

I would but the standard 13 inch with no Touch Bar but I kinda of want the Touch Bar, and would prefer if the graphics card was not integrated. But what hurts me most is the fact you only get 7th generation i5, and it’s ddr3 ram, which makes me think that I’m just going to regret it in a few years time.

Now I would buy the 15 inch, which has ddr4, a 4gb graphics card and an insane processor, but it’s £2400. Which is crazy.... 

So here’s my question...
Do I invest more and buy the 15inch, or do I just buy the standard 13inch?

407,"Hello!

*Obviously, this is a throwaway account.*

I have a really bad case of throwing tantrums when I play many videos games, including but not limited to Fortnite  and Overwatch.  I also rage a lot  when playing stupid smartphones videogames  (e.g. Summoners War).

I've lost a few peripherals due to this, notably a monitor (well, a cheap one, I just scratched it by throwing my keyboard in the air, was damaged but I kept using it for 2 years), a keyboard (soon 2, my current one is not doing well after just over 6 months. The space bar has difficulties, sometimes it doesn't press at all, sometimes it puts a double space). I've also lost one of my phones, a nexus 6, that I literaly bent so much by playing hearthstone to the point the screen broke.

*Note:  I always feel like shit after throwing a tantrum, but I keep doing it anyway. It's just sudden, random, fits of rage.*

**I want to get some help to stop this behaviour for 2 reasons:**

* I worked in the summer and bought a new monitor, which is pretty expensive (600€). I don't want to damage that one, or any other peripherals anymore. I want to be more careful of what I have.
* I don't want this behaviour to ""propagate"" to other areas of my life. I'm someone that's usually calm, even when frustrated/angered in public, but in private when I play games it's another story. I don't want to hurt anybody in the future. I've never done it before, I've always been nice even when people were dicks, but I'm afraid of ""snapping"" one day. To be honest, if that ever happens, I'd probably feel like a monster and just kill myself.

I'd like to use some of my savings to get a few therapy sessions, but I don't know which therapist will help me the most. (I live in Europe, Belgium if that helps). I'm not afraid to pay 100€ a session if it means that I'll get better.

Where can I go? I already did a few sessions with a psychologist to no avail.

Also, I already tried a lot of things, and stopping playing is just not an option. I really love the time I spend playing Fortnite or Overwatch with friends, but theses fits of rage just make me feel like a terrible human being.  Playing video games is just a big part of my life. It helps me release the pressure after school, or after programming for long periods of time. One thing that I might try is lower my playtime, instead of playing 4h a day, maybe half it. Only play after 19h30 or something like that instead of always when I get home.

&amp;#x200B;

Extra details that might help you understand the situation:

* Usually, in real life, I'm not like that. I'm your everyday teenager, maybe just a bit shy/awkward.
* I can spend days without raging once. It's just random.
* Things got better in the last year, but it's still not better/liveable. I know I'll break something again, it's just a matter of time.
* Parents will be willing to help. They'll understand.

Thank you very much for reading this. Please help me be a better human!

Alright, so I just learned that my moms position got terminated at her job (which my family and I are calling bullshit because she handled a lot of the bigger companies, and a lot of them only really wanted to work with her). She worked her entire shift today before they told her (she worked with U.K. companies and worked from 3 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, she has been having some troubles with other coworkers and even a few of her bosses taking advantage of her, and she has been looking for a new job for awhile (without them knowing). She has also been unhappy, but only ever talked about it at home.

413,"Hey guys. So my mom recently found herself in a position where she now owes a number of people about 400k total. Shes a first generation here, in the U.S. and is pretty naiive when it comes to things like this.

What happened: about a month ago, she was befriended on social media by a dude claiming to be a U.N. ambassador (or something, he sent her a fake I.D. badge) and he told her that he was a soldier in Iraq who was planning to move back to the U.s (bear with me, this entire situation doesn't add up, but what's happened, happened). He needed help and some money to return to America to start his life here, or something like that.

After building up a friendship with her he told her that he only trusted her to receive a package of his belongings that he will send to her. He needed up front money of multiple transactions that totaled 400k. My mother borrowed money here and there, from friends and family, because the dude promised that once he gets his 3 million from the government, he will compensate her of the money she put in and another 400k on top of that. 

His information: the money all went to a Turkish bank under about 3 different names, almost 10 transactions total. We have his account number, the tracking number, basically all the information needed for a wire transfer. 

Being that most of the money was all sent, I understand that it will be about impossible to recover all this money. I would like some advice on some next steps. I already reported and entered all the information for the transactions on the ic3.gov site. I know our family members will be able to wait, but her friends will expect their money back asap. She promised them that she would give it all back within 2 weeks, back when she thought this was legitimate. Now, is in a state of panick and depression, not sure of what to do. Before doing anything stupid, like selling the cars and house, I wanted to see what the best options are for someone in this situation, as I know this happens frequently, everywhere.

Years ago I quit porn to try to curb it but that only helped a little bit. I usually have to wait 4 or 5 days between intercourse to insure I'm able to perform.

Even shorts with black tights he asked to see a picture of them from behind to decide if i could wear them. I get that he doesn’t want other guys looking at me but ive worked hard to get to where i am and im fed up of just wearing jeans out every night. I want to look nice. Not for anyone else but just for me? Is that bad?

We stayed in a room, went out and had a great time.  Then he left back home. We weren’t ever anything official. I was ok with that but I became attached. So I admitted my feelings towards him and he responded with “ I have strong feelings for you too but don’t know how to explain them.” I told him that I didn’t want him to say anything that he really did not feel but he insisted he cared for me and even admitted that he “loved” me. We continued to text until one night I decided to try and FaceTime him and he rejected my call then immediately text me saying “ you’re disturbing me” then I replied with “ Ok bye” then he said “ I know you want my attention bitch!” So I told him that I was tired of trying and that I was never going to talk to him again. He then replied saying that he was sorry and he didn’t mean all of that and that he doesn’t want to anyone getting to close because he’s a very sad individual with serious problems.

428,"Hello.

&amp;#x200B;

This is going to be asking advice and ranting.

So I am working at a research lab in a university as a research assistant and I am also a student in the same university. I have a supervisor who is a postdoctoral student. We both working with a professor who is just giving us a big picture of project and we pretty much carry out whole project. I am from Japan and my supervisor is from China. He is smart in a way working with like big data and running arcane programs. I have some professional career having master's degree and I am in a Ph.D program. He works full time and I work half time. He does speak English but sometimes I feel I need more detail (I even might not convey enough detail here though and I will skip or vaguely say on purpose for my security) when he speaks to me or asks to do something. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here is a problem. His working style is really not suit with me and it really stresses me out and I can't spend my time for study.

Event1: We planned an experiment with college students and during a meeting he asked me what I would do for some moment of experiment. So I told something and he criticized my idea (I was expecting though) but said if you wanted to do it then do it. I was little confused because it is team project and I don't think I can conduct my own research in the middle of team research which is run by grant. And then nothing was decided during the meeting. But this happens all the time, he always set a meeting but never sit down together and talk about agenda. He just asks do you want to say something? Then I just say something that I have done related to experiment and then he said same thing again, if you want to do it do it. I am exhausted there is no progress because he always acts like if that's what you thought do it when my opinion is not even viable to act in research. I had three meetings for the same thing which is significant points of experiments and logistics and instructions.

Event2: So I was supposed to write logistics and instruction to give our experimenters. Our experiment started on Monday and I finalized writing the last Thursday before the onset of experiment. I emailed him my writing and asked feedback. (Because I work only half-time, it is better not to show up in the lab even though I have work to do. People in my lab don't like people work overtime. But it is kind of usual that I work during weekend. :p) Anyway, he didn't emailed me until saturday night. So I sent reminder, if you don't have anything to comment I will send to professor and then I went to sleep. Next day, in the very early morning, he sent me email with a lot of comments and more work which was to prepare materials for experiment which would not complete for one day and said please finish today and sorry I didn't know there is this. I was so angry. He usually just texted me if something is emergency. But he didn't text me or email me anything about work he missed. And missing in action for a while when I asked feedback and throwing bunch of work when there is only one day to finish is not cool. Just not cool.

Event3: He looks down on me very implicit way and I don't think he even recognizes it. Also, people in lab like him. What I mean by people in here is who does not directly work with him but more like people do administration or do other research project. Okay it is inevitably true that he knows better than me. But every time I ask something, he always snorts like if I am seriously asking. For instance, does it sound like a joke if I ask how many of college students he wants to have in experiment, or if I ask comment about my writing in research paper. He always snorts at my question. And that really drives me crazy. Also, one day I needed to set up new computer in the lab and asked how to install program. He snorted again and asked you just go to install.. I was like.. is this supposed to be instruction? So I asked other people in the lab and eventually, since he was the oldest who was in the lab, people told me to ask him and asked him by themselves. And then he was like suddenly furious and kind of looked upset and said ""I told you you install can't you do the simple thing? why you make me work?""

I just can't work with him like this. The only reason I am remaining this lab is because I like their research itself. But now because of the issue with him, I am losing my motivation and enthusiasm. My professor asked me in front of him, if I like working in the lab. I said just yes because I had no choice and he and my professor had longer relationship and trust and I know I can't be a tattletale and I can't really intervene in their strong relationship.

Please advise me what to do.. I was going to tell my professor in private one time, but I lost my courage because I was worried if I got fired and kicked out from the program.",08Oct2018,1

430,"So basically i know autistic people have struggles socializing and for some reason no matter how hard i try people just naturally end up hating me 

So here is some background knowledge. I just transferred to a four year university and i literally have no friends and i really just want some so bad. I live off campus which makes it harder as well. 

I have been cool with my room mates but they have their own already established groups and i cant just tag along.

I tried yo be cool with my neighbors and they say they used to fuck with me but my neighbors say their friends dont fuck with me so it ruins their “clout”.

I became friends with a separate group of neighbors which we will call group 2 and i was cool with them but now one of them said his dash cam recorded me missing a football and it hit his car so now i cant hang with group 2 in their house cause this guy hates me.

Awhile ago my group 1 neighbors introduced me  to another group of guys down the street which we will call group 3 with i was having a great night with and they said they like chilling with me up until i got a little too drunk and call one of the guys the wrong name. Which will happen when you meet new people but he is hispanic and i accidentally called him jose cause he looks like i guy i know called jose when his name is alex. And now since i did that all of this new group 3 hates me. 

There were some girls across the street (group 4) who were chill with me and i like the bachelor and another show called love island and they said they watch those too. So i went over later and it ended up one girl spent an hour and 30 min putting on make up and lingerie to come down stairs which ya know i guess was ok but i just met her and wasnt really there for that plus i wasnt really attracted to her, so i kinda just left and now they hate me too. 

It just seems like every group of people i speak to hate me. I get that small shit happens but i mean fuck i said i was sorry for shit i did wrong i am not perfect.

431,"Yeah. It has been a very, very long story. I'll cut out everything for brevity's sake, but let's just say over the years I've been verbally and physically abused (and not because I was a poorly behaved kid)...and my most recent mess-up has made me irredeemable. Every day is hell for me because I basically have to compromise on my values of being honest and forthright. 

I don't think they'll kill me or anything, but this is the nail in the coffin, really. I've always been a mess-up even if I was a gentle child...awkward, an outcast, frightful, clumsy.    
 
I ended up developing anxiety and PTSD (diagnosed, but only partially treated) during university and eventually becoming more of a mess of a person despite the psychiatry and pills...and I ended up being academically disqualified; top of my grade in High School without trying, to breaking down before getting outside of the door every single time. 

I ended up getting the academic disqualification notice very recently and I'm afraid of showing it to my family. Their only hope for me was university...and I've basically squandered it, and their time (they didn't pay me through it, I had to find my own way, but when I didn't have a dorm one of them drove me there).  

Living as if I never got disqualified is killing me--it's incredibly unethical but I'm terrified of being honest. If this were another family I would have confessed my mess up sooner and felt secure in the fact that I could get support, work through things with them, etc.,, then go out into the world, but in the past when I had huge mess-ups (like getting a D in French, the only class I ever slipped up in), horrible things have happened (ones related to my diagnosed PTSD as well)...above all, I'm afraid of letting down my mom. She might have been cruel to me pretty often, but I wanted her to feel proud about me and god, I don't know what to do but secure my independence.

My mom's main wish for me is independence; I figure if I do move away and secure a job, etc., things will at least be more okay.  And I feel like a piece of sh*t but...for now I just need to run away from my issues. I've been stressed out and anxious living with my family, and I know I'm good for nothing, and I just want to make another life for myself.  

I have 5500$, but that's it. I have no car so I have no idea how to deal with work, etc.

432,Hi how come Facebook is showing that me and one of my friends have 22 mutual friends but when I look at their profile it only shows 14?,08Oct2018,1
433,"Hello Reddit,

For much of my life, I have had difficulty in social situations. I often feel like I'm the odd person out and don't integrate well with other people. Knowing this about myself, I have made a concentrated effort throughout the years to improve my social skills and confidence in casual conversation. Through hard work and dedication, I have mastered the art of one-on-one conversation. However, casual group conversation still baffles me. Here are some observations on some areas I have difficulty with.

1. Eye contact. When in small groups I am often at a loss as to where to place my gaze. I like to look at people and observe their actions and through my research into one-on-one conversation, I have learned that people like it when eye contact is made during conversation. However, I am concerned that I am making people uncomfortable by looking at innactive participant's heads. I often look at their heads and briefly catch their gaze before one of us soon breaks. This is an unpleasant experience for me, and perhaps also for the receiver of my gaze. I am wondering now if it is looking at people is uncouth and therefore I should be looking somewhere else. But where? I still believe it to be correct policy to look at active speakers in groups, but perhaps I am wrong about that as well. I am unsure.

2. Taking turns speaking. Some seem innately able to know when to speak up in groups. They seem to anticipate millisecond pauses in conversation and take the opportunity to give their own input. I do not have this capacity and thus either find myself waiting too long for an appropriate pause, thereby missing my chance at relevancy, or recklessly end up speaking over someone else. How does the process of selecting times to speak up work? 

3. Following the conversation. In casual group conversation, there is a high degree of unpredictability in conversations. In contrast to one-on-one conversation, where conversation can be focused and deep, group conversations seem to be superficial and lack control. This makes it difficult for me to provide my input as often the conversation will have changed by the time I have formed a thought to verbalize. Often times I will be so consumed in my own thoughts that the conversation will have shifted by the time I have something to say. How should I approach this? I do not believe it will be possible to control the conversation as this idea seems antithetical to the casual nature of the conversation. Perhaps there is a method to providing my input without having to process it so thoroughly. 

4. Reacting to others' words. I find myself less expressive than other people. I feel there is an expectation that I should have an animated response to someone when they speak to me, but I am an honest person and I feel it is dishonest to ""play-up"" my response. That is to say, if you tell me something I don't particularly care about, I'm not going to act like I care. I don't think this is socially appropriate because it can be hurtful when someone acts like they don't care about something you said. However, I feel there is a conflict here between two goals: i) I do not want to be dishonest and I want to show my genuine self ii) I want to be seen as socially capable and have friends and make connects with people which I seem to be incapable of right now. Has anyone else observed a similar conflict in themselves and how  should I approach it?

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. If anyone could give me advice about any or all of these topics, I would be grateful. ",08Oct2018,1
434,"Before you ask, yes I actually mean my friend, not me. I'm on mobile so please forgive my formatting. And lastly, throwaway just because. 

Anyway, my friend, let's call him Harry, has been going through a rough time, with a divorce on the way and no way to potentially amend things as he's enlisted in the army and is in another state. So to alleviate some stress he tells me he browsed the deepweb (I don't know if that's entirely true because he isn't the brightest bulb in the shed, and I don't know how that relieves stress but don't ask) and on there he meets a guy who says he's from hackercybernetpro (insert rolling eyes emoji). They text and hackerman tells Harry that he can pay off his debt and how he can scare off the guy that Harry's wife may or may not be seeing through hacking shenanigans. 

Well he asks Harry for his financial information and lo and behold, Harry cooperates. He tells Harry he's gonna pay off his debt (around $4,900 according to Harry) via hacking shenanigans so that Harry leaves him a good review.  Up until this point I'm rolling my eyes while Harry tells me this story, that is until he shows me emails from Navy Federal about bank stuff that I'm too dumb to understand. Then he shows me his 'current balance' and it is indeed $4,900, the amount the hackerman told Harry he would transfer. So I'm at a loss on what to tell Harry to dissuade him from continuing this, I still think he's being scammed, I just don't know what the hackerman's ulterior motives are. 

I'll link the email and some other stuff that might be relevant.

In addition he has been coming in late almost daily.  

He cleaned up his act for a few days and then started smelling again to the point where other coworkers were complaining. His supervisor spoke to me about it and decided to talk to him about it. On bad days The people in the office are really upset when the air conditioning turns on and blows his smell around the office. The new GM pulled him aside the other day and I believe he was written up for his hygiene, after that a memo/email from the head of HR went out to the entire company outlining our policy on hygiene. 

I don't want to see him get fired and this reflects poorly on me, even though they say it doesn't. People are tip toeing around the subject so as not to offend him. I'm embarrassed, he doesn't seem to be. I think his real problem is he's a gamer and is up all night, I think he gets a few hours sleep and then rolls out of bed late and goes to work without shaving or cleaning of any sort.

I have a competitive SAT score and a 4.0 GPA because I wanted to become a scientist, make a discovery, change the world.

But as I’ve thought more and more on it I realized I hate science. I guess to me it just takes away the magic of life. And after getting to shadow researchers and participate in lab work, I realized that, while I may like the lab work, I hate the rest of it. I could go into it a bit more but I’ll leave it at that for now. A lot of it has to do with the life of a scientist and the lack of payoff, economically and scientifically. 

Now I don’t know what I want to do. I thought maybe as a biomedical engineer I could design processes/techniques or tools for research, like maybe help design better techniques for gene therapy.

I have started to experience negative health effects, mainly of which is to do with my brain. I can no longer process things at a normal rate anymore. It's difficult to explain, but I will try. Whenever I watch a film, I sometimes struggle to understand the plot. This means I have to pause the movie, and rethink about what happened like 20 times in my head so I can fully understand it. This can take a minute or two, but sometimes I do spend like 10 minutes just going over what happened and trying to 100% fully understand it. The worrying thing is that it  happens to films that I watched a few years ago. I remember watching these films without struggle and without pausing, fully understanding the movie. But now, watching the same film, I have to pause it and try to go over what happened. It feels like its not 100% there in my brain. There is like a 5% that doesn't understand it, and I just rethink it over and over to fill that little bit. The annoying thing is that it's hard to know whether it's all in my head and I'm just overthinking it. The reason why I could be just overthinking it is because I do actually understand the plot, its just that there's a little 5% in my brain that doesn't fully grasp it. But I can't tell whether in the past, when I watched the films the first time, I also had that 5% in my head that didn't fully understand, but instead of spending all my time pausing the film and rethinking it over and over, I just ignore it and move on watching the film. It's hard to explain x.x

\--

I also struggle to understand real-life events. If someone tells me something, sometimes I will have to go over what they said multiple times and try to fully 100% grasp what they said. Again, I don't know if I'm overthinking it because I do actually understand what they said.

\--

Sometimes, if I have a long sleep, throughout the day I will still feel tired. I won't feel as tired if I'm on an electronic device, but when I'm doing school work, I start to feel really tired.

Hi! I’m a twenty-year-old from Argentina, here’s my problem: I’m in a private school for audio engineering, and I like it but I also feel like I’m really great at acting, I’ve done a couple of plays in high school and I always make people laugh and I’m confortable about being recorded and can be really charismatic when I want to, and if I studied that, maybe I could really improve my skills and be truly great.

Now the question you’re probably asking is: why are you studying audio engineering? Well, I also really enjoy making music and studying this is more financially viable (I can teach, work on films, music, radio or live shows, just to name a few, everyone needs a sound guy) much more than acting, and I know that acting is so friggin’ competitive and everyone thinks they’re better than most others (myself included).

Another thing worth mentioning is that Argentina is in the middle of an economic recession (I mean, in a couple of years, it’s all going to shit, and that’s being optimistic), so that’s another variable to take into account, and the school that I’m going is already kinda expensive (around 110 dollars per month) so I wouldn’t feel comfortable with paying an acting class apart from the school I’m currently going to.

tl;dr I’m torn between acting and audio engineering, the latter has financial viability and I like it, and on the former I feel I’m naturally good at and feel like if I studied the craft I could be even better, plus the economy in my country is going downhill.",08Oct2018,1

In the past, I watched this happen several times, companies go cold turkey on me because of company crises (literally one shuttered the day I received an offer letter). I’ve had companies pull out because of my sexuality etc etc etc .

I’ve gone through 3 doctors in one year because they’ve all quit the same practice and currently on the hunt again. 

I’ve dealt with 3-4 suicide attempts with my ex boyfriend and it was draining. Every day it was me worried it would happen again. 

And like I previously said, it’s something like the aforementioned everyday. 

So how do I open the door? When will my life stop sucking so fucking hard? 

I don’t want sympathy, I want out.

Ever since my parents started this divorce it has been getting worse and worse. this has been going on for 3 years now and I really can't take it any more. every time I return home my dad (who I primary stay with) is really short tempered because my mom has been pissing him off with the divorce. If I do the slightest thing such as don't check my emails after school or forget to do something he goes in a cursing and yelling frenzy. I don't even think I can trust him to vent what I have been feeling. one time I was feeling depressed and he then mocked me for it and told me that that if I act like this again he will send me to child services. I also have not been seeing a therapist because my family can't afford it. i have been trying to find time to see the school consular but my scheduled is packed when i am in school and usually by the time I get to school I can't remember the incident. and if you are going to suggest I move in with my mother that is not an option. I have even considered harming my mother but that would not help my dads case. and i have a good group of friends and I don't want to lose them because I was venting to them. and if I tell my teachers or the consular to much it will be there obligation to send me away to a hospital that my family can't afford.

467,"Okay, so I was just curious to get you guys opinions on my day game for when I’m strolling around campus and want to talk to a girl who is cute. So I’ll use my latest encounter (today)

Okay, so typically I’ll walk behind the girl, or if she is walking past me and she’s cute, I’ll let her pass me, turn around, and just make the approach. I’ll tap her and say excuse me, give her some space, and just say hey with a smile. So today, I did just that. She was on the phone so I asked if it’s cool that I talk to her real quick, and she said sure.I introduce myself and shake her hand. Me typically, I just get straight to the point. I usually just say I spotted them on the bus, or walking on campus, or whatever. So I say that, and then I say I thought she was cute and if I could get her number and if she says no to the number or if she has a boyfriend, I ask for the Snapchat. I’ll add a “how was your day” and all that if she’s actually going to give me some type of contact information, but other than that I just get straight to the point. I’ve gotten advice from older dudes that this is what you should do, because no matter what you say after you say hello will determine if you get her number or not. All of this is just looks and confidence based, unless he’s telling me different. So what do you guys think?

469,"This is kind of more of a rant, but here goes..

I'm a senior in college graduating soon with a degree in Computer Science. My intention is to go into a software-related position after college, but to be honest, I feel completely lost on where I want to orient my life. I feel like I used to have so many interests as an adolescent, but the tough coursework and intense career focus of my path/university kind of beat that out of me, and I just feel almost like an empty shell now. I no longer feel like I have any of the career dreams I did in the past. 

Honestly, the only thing I want now is to find a way that I can sustain myself financially enough that I don't ever need to be part of the 9-to-5 rat-race. Not that there's anything wrong with wanting to have a typical career, but I feel like every job/internship I've worked has been soul-sucking. Preparing for a career is soul-sucking. This isn't what I truly want. This is what I've been groomed to want, and now feel obligated to continue pursuing because 1) It's the most feasible, convenient way for me to support myself financially, and 2) if I leave this life to pursue my dreams, like traveling the world on a budget, or starting a business, then I incur the risk of having an even more difficult time trying to reenter the workforce later on (a lot of software companies question you if you have a year+ gap between employment). 

I'm don't think I'm necessarily depressed; but I'm at a crossroads and I'm scared to continue on my expected path as a software engineer because I'm terrified to look back one day and think I let my entire life slip by without pursuing any of my own personal, non-career related dreams. And the worst part is the US is so career-oriented that I feel like not only my career, but my personal life: friends, romantic partners, social events; depends on career, directly or indirectly. Sorry to ramble on, and if you've read this far I sincerely appreciate that. If anyone has any helpful words or advice, I'd be grateful for that right now.

We never go any further than exchanging greetings and pleasantries. The first summer they lived there I noticed kittens climbing on the inside of an enclosed porch through the windows. Cute. They grow up and it seems most of them were just left outside to play. This became permanent because and I know this because the rest of the summer all i smell is cat poop because they're digging in front of my porch and that's their bathroom apparently. 

The next summer at the very beginning I see another litter, same song and dance but this time I decided to remove all the loose dirt and pat the ground down. Worked for a while, then later on that summer I see more kittens on this porch. Wtf, right?

This is summer number 3 (two litters have been born but at this point it should be implied.)  of this and I finally told the guy that lives there that he needs to do something about the cats because its becoming a problem. He agrees and talks about how they're moving soon and hes going to take the cats to a shelter. 

It's been over a month and today is the day that a walk up my porch and smell cat poop, look to my right and in the loose dirt I see three heaping piles. IDK what to do, what I can do but I'm just fed up. I dont want to harm the animals because it's not their fault but I'd be lying if I said my frustration didnt lead to me thinking about it.

I have a degree in chemical engineering and have basically worked this anaylst job for the past couple years to support me and my ex. Now that we're not together it seems pointless. I don't have anyone to live with here (east coast) and a studio would be as much as the new house in California. I'm terrified of quitting my job and not being able to find something.

By saying this, I'm thinking skip college and get a full-time job and go from there. I think college may not be for me.

However, a lot of people say going to college is a good idea, especially teachers. Is it really necessary to move along in life without scratching and clawing for money?

486,"Hey, guys. So basically after several weeks of DM'ing on Twitter, apparently this was a fairly romantic thing, and she shared with him her feelings for him, then he suddenly said he only wanted to be friends and shortly after blocked her.

Context: My mom is an extremely sensitive person with low self-esteem and major depression. So that rejection/block crushed her for days, which I helped her cope with for hours. We concluded that he was manipulative and I thought we'd be able to move past this creep.

Then he unblocked her today so that they can be ""just friends"". And because my mom has no self-respect, she's not only now talking to him again but also being flirty with him. And I'm watching him fish for compliments to stroke his own ego. I hate this. 

Also, I'm only able to keep track of this because I'm monitoring her Twitter without her knowing. I'm not proud of it, but look -- when something might be threatening your mom's life, you put morals aside. Basically, what I'm seeing here is a guy who is stroking his own ego by being flirted with by a depressed woman with low self-esteem. If he crushes her again I'm honestly afraid she might have a moment of weakness and attempt suicide. And the longer they know each other the worse the impact will be. She hasn't even told me they're talking again, she's hiding it which makes things worse.

My first boyfriend prior to him was abusive physically and mentally so it was nice to be with a nice boy for once.

He had his demons - he was into drinking a lot and heroin, I was naive to anything drug related so I had no clue he was doing anything while we were together, I just knew he drank too much to my liking but I loved him, his art, and most importantly how tender he was with me. I few months in he cheated on me, I broke it off and gave him his christmas gifts then said goodbye. I later moved to North Carolina where I found out he had been messing with one of my good friends and they started dating. I was heart broken, confused, and angry. A few days after my birthday I had found a horrible message he had written me through Facebook (if anyone would like to read it let me know, I'm not sure how to attach pictures to anything.) the letter pretty much said that I should die, I was pathetic, I deserved to be cheated on, and whatever sick thing you can think of, he said it. Every time I show people the message they either can not finish it or they break down to me. I've just become numb to it, I was always numb up until he had messaged me and apologized. 

I forgave him a long time ago. I'm not one to keep anger, I just always knew I had love for him. Always.

Is there any way I can get a better understanding of the game without playing in a league, since my parents wouldn't allow me to play and just say ""Your already good at basketball, stick with that"". Or should I just play basketball.

Also, what positions do you think I would be good at. ",08Oct2018,1
505,"Hi everyone. We recently got dog! She’s 6 months old, and our apartment is well aware of her existence. We put down a $300 pet deposit for her. 

Today she tore up carpet right by the door frame. The largest width is 1 inch. The smallest width is 1/2 an inch. And the tear stretches for 6 inches. Again, it’s right up against the door, and the nail board is visible, with some obvious fraying.

Our question- do we tell our apartment complex? (Our fear is that they will want us to replace the entire room for what we feel could be a small patch job. The carpet is at least 3 years old too.) Do we hire a carpet guy to patch it? Definitely the cheaper option- we’re talking the difference between $200 or $2,000z

We are going to be in this apartment for another  2 years. Dog will be crated from now on.

I’m just wondering if anyone has been in this situation or could offer some advice.

Thanks!",08Oct2018,1
506,"I've been talking with this girl and we seem to have a kind of connection. And i really like her but i think she just sees me as a friend. for example i gave her a compliment on her beauty and she instantly reacts with thanks friend and while we're together she sometimes opens tinder and asks me to rate the guys she swipes right, we've even been on ""dates"" like going out for dinner or the movies or shopping. Should i give up or just keep trying.",08Oct2018,1
507,My dad has always been buying me things and spoils me which makes me feel extremely guilty. Even when I say no he still pays. I shattered my phone and I’m 15 (gonna get a job at 16) I have around $200 right now and want to pay for it but he says no. I feel extremely guilty and don’t know what to do. I am middle class btw,08Oct2018,1
508,"I’m a duty manager at a liquor store, I have been for a while but I’ve just been employed at the one I’m currently at for a month now. 
Problem is I’m working late starts and late finishes like 10pm, my SO has early starts at her job and early finishes (9-5) and I work weekends, so we don’t h e a lot of quality time together  which sucks. 
The job I e been offered is at a sports and hunting outdoors kind of store with similar pay but it’s 9-5 every day, the hours are so much better and the owners are family friends of my SO. 

Do I stay at my job that I enjoy with bad hours? Or do I take the new job that’s still retail (which is what I enjoy) and get much better hours? I’m so stressed because I’ve just taken this job, and leaving them would be rough because Duty Managers are in short supply in this town. 

I have pros and cons to both but I just have no idea what to do, I’m losing sleep I’m so conflicted. 

Any advice on what YOU would personally do would be much appreciated, thanks! ",08Oct2018,1
