0,"I often get trapped in this ""acquaintance"" stage and I don't really know how to become friends. Is it weird to just ask people for contact information or ask them if they want to grab coffee one day? The main problem is that everyone I meet (mainly through clubs or work) is so busy and most people don't seem interested in making new friends. Like I'll talk to people at the club event or at my job and then everyone goes and does their own thing after. Let's say I manage to get to the point where we're having coffee- even if I suggest we hang out more, I don't know how to actually make that happen. I don't want to come off as pushy or desperate. Any advice would be appreciated!",19Apr2018,2
1,"I am 22 years old and just recently ended an emotionally abusive relationship.  I'm moving three hours back home with my parents for financial reasons, but also just because I could really use a support system right now.

2,"Hi I don't typically come here but no one knows what to do. I won't expose who they are exactly but we're related. I've heard from family and family doctors over and over about how bad his ADHD is (one of the worst my family doctor has seen, he's taking strong meds for it).


He's getting old now, old to the point where people don't want to hire him, and he's always struggled to get a job and hold it because of his mental issues. But he refuses to accept outside help with money.


Is there any advice that could be provided to convince him to go on disability? We all feel it would be the best for him.",19Apr2018,1
3,"Basically I had a pretty horrible childhood, I moved away for college, and am now moving again. I know that one of my parents is going to be competently against this and honestly they are a very toxic person, verbally and emotionally abusing me my entire life and basically telling me I wasn't worth being alive. The only thing my parents have every payed for is my phone and soon I'll be getting a job and will be able to pay for that as well. Before I move I'm headed home for a few months to see some other family members and I was just wondering if anyone had any advice for cutting this person out of my life. They are really the only thing holding my back and I hate it and I'm just sick of being treated this way and I don't want anything to do with them. Am I being ridiculous? Can anyone suggest anything to cut them out of my life? ",19Apr2018,2
4,"I am a 15 year old male who lives in a party town in a state where marijuana has been legalized. I am a sophomore in high school, and I use videogames(dota 2, slay the spire, and fortnite mainly) to cope with being overwhelmed. I have also taken up smoking weed. I have always been an advanced student in school, I even skipped a grade a few years ago because I was told that ""it didnt work"" for me to only go to school 2-3 days a week in middle school, even though I completed all of the work and all of my grades were 95%'s or higher. This year, the classes that I'm taking are honors language arts, AP Calculus AB, AP Biology, World History, Chemistry, Spanish 3(the 3 just means the 3rd year level of high school spanish), and Journalism, which I only took so that I would have a break in my day. I have never liked doing homework, and I was always good enough at my classes to maintain a 95% or higher by doing only roughly 40% of my homework. This year, being the first year that I have had AP classes, only doing 40% of the homeowork doesn't really ""work"". Even though only doing 40% of my homework doesn't ""work"", I still only do that much or less. I get overwhelmed by it all and then just decide that I'm going to play a few games of dota. After a few games of dota, I generally try to start on some homework. What often happens is, I start, then I get bored or angry (at having to do homework) or just sad, then I get high. After getting high, I feel a lot better, but still don't want to do homework. I just play more dota. I love dota. I love playing dota. I love improving at dota. I hate doing schoolwork outside of school. My grades still aren't suffering that bad because in my non-AP classes the only points I ever miss are homework. My grades are currently 2 89.8's, a 79 in calculus, 2 high A's and 2 mid level B's. This is much worse than what I had last semester(I started smoking this semester) or any other year of school. My GPA is currently a 4.00. Another problem I have is that a lot of people get stressed or nervous or whatever when they are blowing off homework, this is not the case for me. When I blow off my homework, I feel sort of relieved, because I am not doing homework. This seems kinda bad to me but I don't know what to do about it. 

ps: for any of you who play dota and might potentially be interested in my mmr, I am currently 4.2k 

I just want some advice or maybe just to talk to someone about this because I feel like it isn't a huge problem now, but it could become one. I just kinda want to know other people's thoughts on the situation, as well as maybe some advice on what to do to fix this or make it better or anything, idk.",19Apr2018,2

7,"So here’s the situation. Last year I worked directly under a financial advisor. When I first started working for him, he promised that once I pass a test and get licensed to sell insurance,  he would give me a commission on top of my salary.  Once when I did pass he told me the company that produced internet leads for me had shut down, so he wasn’t going to give me a commission, just my small base salary ($30,000  a year and 50 hours a week in the Bay Area is kind of ridiculous) on top of that he also forced to me to come in an hour earlier than originally intended. I had to come in and work at 7 am, despite a 40 minute commute which is tough. He was also really hard on me, constantly yelling at me and swearing to me in front of other people in the office. I sort of took it like a soldier, and just thought “Hey work life is tough. Man up!” A few of my coworkers said they felt bad for me 

In December he let me go, due to a decision to go in a different direction, but still offered to give me a reference. I took it professionally and in stride and was always respectful.

Now here’s the kicker, where I’m finally pissed off at him. The company that gave me internet leads never shut down. I use it currently at my new job. He just decided he never wanted to pay me more. 

Obviously it’s over and done. I have a new job, he’s no longer in my life. However, it still infuriates me. I have an urge to send him an email saying 

“Hey Chris, just thought you should know that Quote Wizard the website where you promised me I could make commission off of never shut down. I use it at my current company, and have found great success with it. You said even when you fired me that I always had tried my best was a good person to work with. It’s extremely disappointing that you chose to be dishonest with me, and I believe it says a lot about your character”

I know I nothing to gain from this, but it would still feel good to finally stand up for myself in a way that’s not unethical. What do you think? Should I send the message?",19Apr2018,2

11,"Hello, thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm in a confusing situation and not sure what to do.

Recently, an old friend found me through social media. He and I ran in the same friend circle back in high school, but we (the friend circle in general) had stopped getting along and eventually fell out of contact. I was fine with that.

And now he's asking to meet up. The thing is, I don't look back on those years very fondly and have since moved on from that time of my life. And going from our current conversation online, I'm really not interested in re-kindling this.

So what are my options? It probably wouldn't hurt to catch up with him face-to-face for an hour or two, but I feel like this is ignoring the problem and might result in him wanting to hang out more often.

Should I be honest and decline the offer? I don't want to offend the guy or hurt his feelings, but I don't know how to let him down gently. He'll want to know why, and...well, there's a lot of baggage here.

Any advice/suggestions would be welcome.",19Apr2018,1

20,"So this might be long, but bear with me. Context: I'm a 24 year old girl who has never had an official boyfriend.

So I met this guy when I was 16 at my high school job. I had a big crush on him the whole time I worked there (2 years) and looking back now, it's pretty obvious he liked me too. I should say here we're both really shy. Anyways, nothing happened and we both went off to college.

Fast forward to senior year of college and we matched on Tinder. We started talking and it continued for a few weeks but eventually it faded and nothing happened. Half of me thinks he got embarrassed because he's so shy and got drunk and said some stuff about wanting to hook up but I don't know. So we eventually stopped talking. It was super frustrating though because he would go through phases of liking my Instagrams (like boys do) and making me think he still wanted to talk? I don't know.

So fast forward two years to present day and I still have pretty strong feelings for him. Like I've been pretty unsuccessful in getting him off my mind and its driving me nuts. I went on a date the other day (which rarely happens) and all I could think about was how I wished the guy was him. So ever since the date, he's all I can think about it and I'm making myself crazy so I was thinking I would text him and just tell him how I feel even though we haven't spoken in 2 years. I don't know if that's a good idea or a horrible idea but I just keep thinking of that quote that says ""Tell people how you feel about them while you're still alive"" but I don't know....this seems like a pretty big jump and I feel like he would be weirded out. So basically I'm looking for any insight into this; should I text him and tell him how I feel? Am I insane and just need to get over it? Thank you for reading all of this and any help is MUCH appreciated since my brain is so tired.

I have for you all today what is one of many, and certainly not the last, love story, well kind of I guess.
I was in Manhattan today with a couple of my friends and we stopped by a food vendor as we usually do (cause the gyros are the best), but as we were ordering a girl that looked about our age walked up with her friend to buy some food. I didn’t really notice this girl at first but after I got a good look at her I realized that she was the most gorgeous thing I’d ever seen and I know it sounds really pathetic or cheesy or maybe even creepy but I got that feeling you know in your stomach and the back of your neck that’s cold and hot at the same time and the world around you goes silent, the traffic, the people, the pigeons... everything just goes quiet for a second and you look at her and think goddamn. She and her friend were holding like 4 Victoria’s Secret bags and she said to her friend “My moms gonna kill me I spent like over $100 today” and that’s how she initially got my attention cuz 100 isn’t really that much for New York nor for Victoria’s Secret, but also because it kind was funny the way she said it. She didn’t really notice me at first but that’s when a guy and his wife came up from behind us and asked for a water and the vendor said “5 dollars” and the dude scoffed at him like damn 5 dollars for water and me and this girl laughed and we locked eyes and we just kept smiling at each other for what felt like a fucking million years and thats when my friend finally got his food and said “let’s go” because I was standing there just locked eyes with this girl... but that was it, we left across the street and I took one last look at her over my shoulder at the food wagon, and she was giggling with her friend still looking at me. I should have mentioned this earlier but I don’t live in NYC I live down in CT and go to the city occasionally to go shopping and eat with friends or family. I went back home today and the whole ride home and still right now sitting in my bed writing this I can’t fucking get her off my mind and I apologize for the run on sentences and what not, as well as the absolute cheesy garbage story but I only saw her for a few minutes and the image of her is starting to deteriorate and it’s making me pretty sad. I’ve come to the conclusion and swallowed the hard pill that I’ll probably never see her again and how I should just get over this girl who I didn’t even know the name of and will most likely never see again. I know we had some kind of connection because I just had that feeling, where this girl was one in seven billion. How do I get over (or maybe possibly.. idk, find the name of) this girl in nyc?

29,"So I've met this one guy at school who is diagnosed with OCD, Tourette's and ADD. He's a little bit weird but I'm trying to be kind to him and not judge him being weird.

The problem is that sometimes he says stuff which really cringes the fuck out of me and in my head I'm like ""WTF dude how did you come up with that shit?"". He also talks a LOT and extremely openly about sex which makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm a guy myself and I'm used to it that guys like to talk about women and stuff but this guy keeps asking questions about my personal sex life and weird and gross questions like: ""Do you think that that lady (*points a random lady*) likes to take it in the ass?"" and then he comments ""Imagine if she would't wipe her ass and a guy would fuck her in the ass and then his dick would be covered in shit"".

I think he also has some form of autism because he has trouble reading social cues but despite all this I still want to be his friend. I would however appreciate if he could sometimes just shut up and keep his crazy thoughts to himself.

30,"I have been playing football for the last 12 years. In high school I was a standout cornerback and after a lot of thought I decided to continue playing at a division 3 school. It had its ups and downs but I enjoyed it b/c I made a lot of friends, was a contributing member to the team, and it wasn’t too overwhelming (I had time to do other things besides football) Although after my sophomore year I had to transfer to a division 1 school due to my major not being offered at my previous school. At first I was looking for something to do other than school such as: meet people, extracurriculars, find a job, enjoy college, etc. but tbh was slightly lost looking for something to occupy myself other than school. My friend convinced me to go out for the football team and I was able to join the team as a walk on. I thought this would solve all my problems of not knowing what to do with myself, but it is a full time job that does not allow me to expand myself outside of sports.

31,"Sorry if this sounds like a train wreck but this is the first time I have ever posted something like this on anything.

Lately, my own mother has been acting like a complete child. I originally noticed it when she broke up with my sisters, brother, and me's father but took nothing of it.

When she broke up with our father she was depressed for 2 weeks and didn't come out of her room to take us to school or go to work. Which we all had to catch the public bus to school and the school bus to home. After that, I noticed immediate changes in both her personality and appearance. First of all, she was bubbly and more excited than she ever was which took all of us back by surprise because she was usually more commanding and always ordered us around while being in a formally serious manner. Her appearance is what scared me and my sisters and still is. She wears her long hair in some sort of side ponytails on both sides of her head and wears bright pink clothing with jeans. I've known my mother to keep her hair always in a bun and never saw her hair in anyway but in her High School Photos and she HATES the color pink. We didn't know what could've gotten into her but things went down south quickly. Last week Thursday I came home to find my mother crisscrossed on the sofa with three eaten Pizzas, A Half eaten Publix Strawberry Ice Cream Bucket and her watching NickJr. I honestly couldn't believe this was the same woman whom I felt was controlling and didn't understand me but now I feel more like the parent. I've already had to hide my mother's car keys to prevent her from going out and buying any more items. She is also sleeping in my younger brother's bed at nights complaining that ""She can't sleep"" Which I found Bizzare and hard to believe. I honestly think I am living a dream or this is a joke/test that she is doing on us. My Question is: How can persuade my mother that she needs to act like an adult?

33,"My mom and I have always had a close friendship and bond for forever. We're also close in age from having me younger, but lately, my relationship with her has been faltering. It's gotten so out of hand I'm ready to stop trying to settle things. And let things be.

(*Here are bullet points that basically sums up everything, because what I wrote originally was way too long. It's still sort of a LONG-ish read...)

- Whenever an argument or misunderstanding occurs, and later I go to her  trying to clear it up so we can be ""normal"" again (I hate holding long grudges), she makes it seem like I'm still on some ""old mess"" because she's apparently ""over it"", and I'm bringing up things up for no reason. The only reason I try to clear things up is because she always tells me her side but never seems to understand mine in the first place. Yet she says she ""knew all along"" what my point was and that I never had to go to her. I never understood laughing at me/silence and walking away as ""I got your point, you don't have to keep trying to prove it, and we're okay now""
 
       - She always says that whenever an 
       argument is ""petty and small"", she 
       wants to get it over with quickly. She.    
       doesn't care about if the other person 
        is visibly upset about it; she just feels 
        that if it's a dumb subject to HER, then 
        it shouldn't be brought up and ended 
        immediately.



- Whenever we have a misunderstanding or small arguments and I'm trying to get my point across, she's never paying full attention. Always talking to someone else, listening to something else, texting someone, or doing SOMETHING, as if what I say in a misunderstanding doesn't deserve her full attention.

- Whenever I tell her what I said above and that I don't like it, she brings up 101 ways I'm a worse/ a even worse communicator. Mostly stuff I don't do anymore (like things I did back in high school, but corrected when she told me how she felt about it). 

- She dismisses my issues as ""You have a Capricorn moon so you'll always be like this"", or blames things on the zodiac and never wants to fix the problem itself. ( It doesn't matter if Bob has a Leo rising, it doesn't mean you should tell Bob his arguments are petty and not worth it just because ""Leos are always arguing""!)

       - Or dismisses issues as ""You're too emotional"". 

- The whole time we were arguing recently (today!), my sisters were mimicking me and laughing, and constantly interrupting me, and she laughed WITH them at me while I was trying to prove my point.I I don't know WHY it's even okay to let that happen, as I worry they'll just grow up quite disrespectful. And it happens a LOT.


sorry for the long read and any errors. I am typing this on a mobile, an hour after another misunderstanding we had, and it had everything I mentioned combined.

 It's just getting too frequent and annoying, and it's making me feel like I should just not say anything if a misunderstanding sparks because my opinion won't matter anyway and it'll always be turned around in a way to make it seem like I'm always attacking her or bringing up bad things, when I'm not. I keep calling them misunderstandings because 100% of our arguments come from just that: misunderstandings... and me desperately trying to clear up my side, to no avail.

However, I'm 26 and newly single again. I do want a husband and kids one day but I'm at the point in my life where I feel this is the time to experience something new. I am in debt from school but I don't want that to stop me as I will be paying off my loan for a long time. 

I guess my question is: is giving up my high paying newish job with a great office, leaving my family , and starting over a crazy decision? Has anyone else started over in a new place and sacrificed a good job? 

Thanks for any insight or experience you can share (:",19Apr2018,2
35,"Wow. No matter what the case is, gaming, school, sports, making right judgement. I just not good at anything. For gaming, compared to my friends and many people i know, i am just significantly worse compared to them. And when i want to get better, i can practice, practice, and practice, but never any improvement. With school, i like learning things such as math, but i absolutley suck at performing it. Compared to other people, i just do the wrong things and just arent as smart as them. It absolutley frusturates the hell out of me and i dont know what to do. I know this is a pretty bad explanation but i dont even know what to say. I just suck at everything and i cant get better at anything either. ",19Apr2018,2
36,Well there's a girl I have known her ever since I started school but never really talked to outside of the usual stupid small talk anyways I have a tiny crush on her but it's not like the crush were you are dying to be with them it's kind of like ehh if we're together it would be cool. Well anyways today her and he freind sat next to me for some stupid school thing and every time I said something she would hit me and tell me to shut the hell up then called me a dick head and I took it off as a joke the she called me annoying in a none friendly way. I was the same way I always was I don't know why she would think I would act any diffrent or Why she even sat next to me in the first place her freind tried to motion to sit somewhere else lol just confused. This isn't the first time just last week she said that a kid I know liked her and she went off on me but not my freind saying how she didn't want to see my ugly face ect. I make her sound like a lunatic and she isn't around her freinds and other pepole but for whatever reason she goes off on me I am not a very attractive person being 6'2 250 and I'm not really looking for a relationship. I am however very patient and nice I get a lot of girls who just complain about there life to me. So I am not generally portrayed as an asshole ,19Apr2018,0
37,"Okay so I’m a pretty normal guy, life’s pretty good for me at the moment. There’s a lovely girl  I’m enjoying the company of, we’re not dating yet and every time we meet up it’s always good fun. I just get very anxious when she doesn’t message me as much one day or tag me in stuff.  I know very well she’s got other things to do than message me and that doesn’t bother me but I can only help but feel this way.

40,"So I'm not the person in this situation but it's someone close to me. They told me recently that their partners ex has been stalking them and it's been going on for years. Apparently she just drives around and follows behind them in her car.  She learns their routine and starts to show up in the places she knows they will be. She's even gone as far as to drive up to the front of their house and engage with the partner, (her ex), outside doing yard work. She acts like she just happened to be in the neighborhood. It seems to be slowly making my friend nuts. So my question is: what steps can she take to document the constant stalking? Is there any steps she can take with police? I also want her to document because then I can see if it's really stalking or she has just become overly paranoid. I think this is what this lady wants. To make my friend look nuts.

41,"First off I'm not at home. I'm in MN for work. Anyway, my wife called me about 20 minutes ago saying that our 4 year old claimed our 13 year old son had her touch him. I don't remember how it exactly got brought up to my wife but my daughter said to her that ""he had me touch his vagina"" to which my wife clarified ""he had you touch his penis?"" And she replied yes. This whole conversation is going on while my wife is giving our daughters a bath and our son is downstairs taking a shower. 

My wife is furious, which I understand, and it this is painful because I'm not there to play devil's advocate. So my wife calls me back and puts me on speaker phone so we can chat with him. It was very much my wife angry and asking over and over ""Did you do it? Did you have her touch you?"" He said he would never do that to her and would never ask her. 

Apparently it happened differently from his side. He claimed he was going to the bathroom and she ran in while he was going. He didn't shut or lock the door. My wife tells him, ""use your own bathroom, shut and lock the door from now on, and I don't want you left alone with the girls either at all anymore. Oh, I should point out that he was home alone watching her while my wife took our 1 year old to pick up the oldest kid from school. 

So, like I was saying he denied it ever happening and would never do that too her or the youngest.
I was pretty speechless the entire conversation only popping in to ask if he in fact did it and to please just tell me the truth (him and his older brother lie about petty things). So I left it alone. 

We end the conversation with him and she heads upstairs where I tell her that if he is lying we need to not act out of anger and that we should get him help rather than kick him out else it could develop into something far worse. 

My apologies for the wall of text and if anything doesn't add up please ask and I'll try to clarify. I'm a mix of emotions and this is honestly one of my biggest fears regarding my kids. 

Also I want sure if it needed an NSFW tag or not but would rather be safe I suppose.

42,"I’ve had two cats for 6 years. They’re from the same litter. They used to love each other but one of the cats had a complete personality change when I had a baby. She went from sweet but independent to the clingiest animal alive. She also developed some jealousy issues I think because she started fighting with the boy cat constantly. She marks everything with her paws every time he touches it. She hisses at him if he tries to get near me. It’s awful but I can separate them. 

The real problem is that she isn’t happy anymore. As my son gets older she gets more anxious around him. I don’t let him hurt her but it’s to the point that she cries like she’s dying if he gets near her. She’s started pulling out all of her fur on her back and legs. She’s miserable. 

To add to all that we recently moved and since moving I haven’t slept a full night because of her. She scratches at my bedroom door all night and screams as loud as she can if I leave her out. If I lock her in a different bedroom she scratches everything to pieces and screams and bangs anything she can against walls to be as loud as possible. If I let her sleep in my room she wants to sleep right on my face no matter how often I move her. I’ve taken her to the vet multiple times but he’s sure it’s just kitty anxiety. 

The problem is that she’s clearly miserable and it makes me feel awful. I don’t want to abandon her but we’re to the point now that I find it very difficult to like her. I feel obligated to her, though. 

What I’m asking is: is it ever okay to give away a pet? 

I know a nice older woman who will take her. No other cats. No children. Very calm environment. I genuinely think she’ll be happier there. But I always hear all the hate for people who don’t keep animals for life. What do you guys think?",19Apr2018,1
43,"I will start off by saying that this friend is very important to me, and I'd like to avoid cutting her off.

I've been best friends with this girl, let's call her Cindy, since the beginning of middle school. We're very similar and share a lot of personal details. While she does drain me socially I couldn't imagine getting through my teenage life without her. 

We're now in highschool and about to finish up Junior year, so lots of our teachers are asking if we're sure what we want to do with our lives. Whenever me and Cindy talk about the she says things along the lines of us moving in together or opening up a store together. 

This makes me uncomfortable for numerous reasons. I want to go to college, she doesn't. She wants to stay in our home town, I want to completely move countries. She's very extroverted and likes to have people around her all the time, I'm introverted and can be happy by myself for a few days straight.

Yes, we're best friends, but I could never live with her. I'm tired after just a school day with her. I suppose I always imagined we would stay friends but go our separate ways in adult life.

45,"So, I don’t want to reveal too much information here but I’m a boy and I’ve been this girl’s best friend since September but she’s really nice, funny and smart. She always helps me and we care about each other very much.  I’m thinking about asking her out soon because her birthday is in May and she doesn’t want to date anyone until she’s that age. She doesn’t know I like her and I don’t know if she likes me. Many boys have a crush on her but she’s not interested in any. Should I wait this out or act soon?",19Apr2018,1
46,"First a little background:

Our son is 14.  His mother and I have been separated since he was 4.  We did the every other weekend thing for a while, but even then things constantly got in the way, like he had birthday parties to go to when it was conveniently my weekend, just the typical bs. He's a great kid. No attitude.  Caring and lovable. All gifted classes, and is already doing college classes, so he's got a good head on his shoulders.

I've been  traveling the world for almost 2 years now, and Skype video calls and playing games over steam just isn't cutting it for quality time together.  He was supposed to spend last summer with me.  I spent a great deal of time, showing her proof on how safe it was in the EU, opposed to where they live, (Jacksonville, Florida).  By the way, just this school year alone, there have already been 3 people on 3 different occasions being arrested at his school for carrying a loaded gun on school property.  I've given her spread sheets, showing the cost of living, food expenses, etc., but she pulled out at the last minute and wouldn't allow him to come to Europe, claiming he wasn't mature enough, or wasn't aware of his surroundings enough to be trusted with me.

I want to give him the opportunity to make memories that will last a lifetime and open his eyes and mind to the world. Share with him some of these experiences that even humbles me.  I think back to my teenage years, and it was the times I spent in the Bahamas, or white water rafting down the Colorado river, camping the nights along the grand canyon, etc that really stick out with me.  I don't really remember just hanging out with my father while we sat around the house.

Here we are, inching close to summer and it seems her stance on the matter is unchanged.  My son has cried to me and even wrote letters to his teachers, talking about how much he misses me and wants to spend time with me and it breaks my heart.

Is it time I just postpone my life long dream of traveling this planet and go back to the states until he graduates high school, or do you think there's anything I can do that would possible convince her to allow him to come hang out with me for the summer?  Has anyone been in a similar situation and found a way to improve it?  At this point, it's difficult to even discuss it with her, because she gets angry at just the thought of the conversation.",19Apr2018,2

48,"Throwaway, so I'm going to be frank. An ex just reached out to me, and told me how when we were dating, there wasn't much consent in our relationship, and how I should work on that (obviously).

I 100% trust this person, and want to make changes. I also don't think my issue has ever been when I'm levelheaded that I do the wrong thing (so I'm only inadvertently a horrible person. Yay).

Are there any resources I can try to look at to work through this? I don't want a solution like ""Just try harder"" or whatever --- in other areas of life those have really never worked for me. I'm going to talk to my therapist about it when I see them next, but how can I incorporate consent better into my practices? Again, to be clear, my issue is that I want to when I'm not in the mood, but when I get in the mood I can be handsy/persistent.

Because those are (at least some) of my specific issues, it seems like making rules of ""don't do X ever"" for various ""gateway"" things might be a good start. For me, this would probably be:

Rhythmic rubbing things (like back massage type stuff, but not exclusively that). I have aspbergers, so I like this a lot in general, but I've also noticed that when I hold someone while doing this vs hold them while being still, I'm much more likely to be able to keep things under control well.

Initiating things --- making it a rule not to initiate things ever seems like it'd probably work. This might be an issue eventually, but it'd probably be healthy for me overall if people were upset with me for seeming disinterested in sex vs my current issues.

Has anyone else struggled with this and found a good system? I don't want to be this way, but I'm sure that by itself won't be enough to change, so any advice on what might help me change would be great.",19Apr2018,3

It makes me embarrassed to ask for an honest opinion and my soul is really tormented. I have a piece of information about me that is horrifying and when you google my name, it is too easy to find. When I make an acquaintance and they want to add me of Facebook, I can clearly distinguish the next time I see them because they make it very obvious that they now know too much about me and are very willing to tell their peers and harass me. I hate to say this, but my dad is a doctor who was accused of sexually assaulting multiple women, and on the internet it is clearly described and I believe it was a long and nasty battle that he lost. This happened when I was little and I remember it. The treatment I get from people once they know, scares me. I have been so desperate for friendship. I have been kicked out of schools because women students and instructors have found out and feel very uncomfortable that I am there. Recently, one of my female coworkers added me on Facebook, and immediately all my coworkers began throwing vibrational and verbal knives at me and accusing me of lying and stealing and soon after that (I work in female service) I started having female clients as soon as I begin my service jump up and start yelling at me loudly or completely hrow beating me and staring at me and after this service they tell me I’m bad at my job. And then I started getting male clients, and I’ve had them ask me questions like if I was going to take my clothes off or THEM actually taking their pants off before the service and laying under the sheet which I did not ask them to do that. Eventually I gave a facial to a policeman and he asked for an additional service that I did occasionally on feet (a foot scrub) and when he said he couldn’t roll up his jeans I guess I let him use his discretion and do whatever was comfortable with him. I know this was a cop because after the facial he told me he was and that I’ve given his daughters facials. A day before my birthday I decided to wax my upper lip with one of my works wax pots and the next day I had this disgusting rash that spread all over my chin and mout and cheek area. And it was my birthday and I had to go to work. It looked like a really bad staph infection. I was so embarrassed I told my boss and she told me in front of my coworkers that it wasn’t the wax pot, but it was the face that I’ve been doing things with multiple men. It hurt my feelings so much I had no idea that this is what she thought of me. My women coworkers are like every other woman I have ever encountered. Soon after that that they got meaner and meaner and when I would say something they would talk about me like I wasn’t there and say “wow this bitch is fucking crazy” and laugh loudly. And then my boss and lead coworkers started asking me about my mental health, telling me they were worried about me and even though I have never disclosed my mental health status, they kept talking amoungst themselves until I would cry. This isn’t the first time people have treated me like this but this is the most recent. I feel like my coworkers have spread lies about me so hard and it’s really hard to defend myself against anything. I am so desperate for someone to care about me. And honestly, I have a wonderful relationship with my parents. They are words I cannot describe. I love them. I just am never actually given the chance to defend myself, and I know my words would go to deaf ears. Women completely want to ruin my life, and men like to push my bondaries.

60,"So I recently found out my best friend lied to me about something. We had talked about us attending a concert together where they lived and it seemed like that was loosely the plan. About two months ago I asked him about it again because I was going to buy my flight tickets and he said he was too busy with work that week for me to come visit. That seemed odd to me because I had been out to visit him before already when he was busy with work, but that was what he said so I trusted him. I brought up the concert a time or two more to ask if anything had maybe changed with the work situation and he always said he'd be too busy for me to visit. A few days ago I asked him when he wanted to skype this week and he said he couldn't do to a family member being in town. Due to Facebook's lovely feature of showing what your friends like I saw a post my friend had liked of a girl I used to know showing she was going to see the concert and thanking him. For a bit of backstory, this girl used to be my best friend for years until she ghosted me, but I had introduced her to my current friend before all that and they're still friends now despite what she did to me. 

So while a part of me still foolishly wants to believe I'm somehow wrong and he isn't lying to me, I'm pretty sure that's the situation at this point. So I'm pretty sure the whole busy with work and family member visiting things are both lies. I understand that as much as it sucks it was his choice to take whoever he wanted to that concert and while I would've been hurt to find he was taking her, I still would've respected his choice. I can't respect him lying to me though. Especially since a couple weeks ago we both agreed we wanted to be completely honest and open with each other, so this is a real slap in the face.

I just want to know what might be the best way to tell him I know without seeming confrontational or accusatory? I'd like to talk things out as calmly as possible. ",19Apr2018,1
61,"Well, as the title states, I think I've grew tired of my once best friend. At first, the friendship started so strong, I thought the guy was amazing.

He showed me how to pick up women, he showed me the tricks to get rich, the guy was a genius. There was even a period I tried to hookup with my co-worker and the guy predicted everything she would do. Still blows my mind to this day, actually. I should also add in this time period I would call him constantly for advice, and he'd put up with it. I am honestly so grateful he did that, because that went on for a good three months. 

The tides turns however, when the same thing happened to him. He falls for this girl in October, the guy went nuts for her. Things fell apart around November, and we're at it's worst in December. Ever since December, I've heard him talk everyday about this girl, how one day he's going to get his revenge, how she's a druggie loser (the girl does heroin) etc, etc,....etc. 

Most of our conversations are about this girl. We used to talk about building a business together, but now I'm not so sure. My friend frequently talks about how much he loathes women, how he's going to get revenge....and I would hear this every single day, since December. The guy talks to me how he used manipulation techniques to get what he wanted, how he used ""red pill"" tactics to get women to sleep with him...

I don't know how to feel. Our conversations aren't balanced anymore. It's all about him. When we do talk about me, it's brief. I bring up the topic, talk for 5 minutes, then back to him. Honestly, I feel burned. I feel exhausted from hearing this all the time. I've already talked to him about it, but still goes on. 

Maybe this is more of a r/vent post, but I feel physically exhausted. What do I do r/advice? At this point, it feels like I'm looking for excuses to end the friendship.

Also, I should add the nail in the coffin. On my 21st birthday last week, he didn't even say happy birthday. I literally told him the NIGHT BEFORE it was going to be my birthday the next day. He called to talk about the stupid girl again. I thought maybe he said it and I didn't hear him, but lo and behold, the next day he calls and didn't even say how was my day.

I know we'll miss our family, and our son will only compound that with his grandparents. But I don't want to be on my deathbed regretting that I only ever lived in one place.

On one hand we think we should do it now before our kids get too old, and if we hate it we can always move back. On the other hand, our parents are getting older, and me quitting a great job would make it feel like starting over.

Our boss always pairs us together, and DJ always teases me like he maybe likes me back. Like one time I tried to tickle him, and he just stood up and picked me up over his shoulders like I was one of the kids we work with, suspending me in the air until I begged for him to let me go. He's constantly making fun of my appearance, to where like even though I think he's joking I try to dress nicer when I go in. 

The only thing is he's 21 and I'm 16. The guys I know are scared to take the lead on anything, it's super frustrating. Every guy I meet is afraid of me, and treats me like I'm better than them. My last boyfriend used to bring me chocolates every week, just for context. Stuff like that is sweet, but tbh it's a bit suffocating.

What should I do? 

I know nothing can probably happen, because of our age, and also because he probably has a lot of options but I still think he'd be the kind of guy who would be gentle in rejecting me.

What do you think about this?

67,"So my parents dropped me financially about 3 months ago, due to some health and academic struggles. I wasn't in a super good place at the time, so I wasn't working a ton and was living with my boyfriend while I figured out a place to live. (I decided to take some time off of school so living on campus wasn't an option last minute.)  I figured out a place to live where I'm subleasing from another girl. I'm renting her room and there are three other girls in the other rooms in the apartment, who are her best friends. It worked out for March, but after some last-minute expenses, I needed some extra time to pay April's rent. I lost some babysitting jobs because the mom was flakey, and I needed some time to find a new job. I asked the girl I was subleasing from if I could have until the end of the week, and then I got a job waiting tables. I'm making cash and so I have almost enough cash now to pay rent, but I'm going to have to open up a new bank account to deposit cash to Venmo her the money. (My old bank account is from my hometown and so I can use my debit card but can't deposit cash). I'm finally making enough money, but I still haven't paid rent. It's 100% my fault. She sent me a message last week, and I didn't respond because in my head I was going to have the money a lot quicker than I did. Today she sent me a text and asked if I had the rent money, or if I could at least pay her half right now. This is completely reasonable, but my anxiety made me freak out and I've been avoiding responding. I need to find an appropriate response.

Another problem is, at this point I've heard my roommates say a couple judgmental things about it. And tonight they came home and I was in my room and I could hear them out in the living room talking about me and how I'm so crappy for this. And I feel really bad. I know I'm in the wrong, but I also want to fix this between me and the girl I'm subleasing from and I don't really want drama. But I know whatever text I send to the girl I'm subleasing from is going to get sent around with all my roommates. I should have enough money within the next like 5 days, and I can go to the bank tomorrow and open up an account and have most of the money in there. What's the best way I can diffuse the situation with my roommates, and what's the best way I can tell the girl that I'm subleasing from that I'm really sorry but will be much better about this in the future?

I got dropped on my a** by my parents last minute and really need my leaser/roommates to understand that I know I'm in the wrong, but I'm also doing my best and I also didn't mean to hurt anyone.

Any advice would be appreciated!",19Apr2018,1

70,"TLDR: A very nice girl I worked with at a minimum wage job a few years back that I haven't talked to in a couple years asked me to fix her laptop. She is offering money, but I know she doesn't make a lot. Should I accept it or do it for free?


Long Story:

I worked with this girl at a gas station a few years back while I was going to college. She was always really nice to everyone and I enjoyed working with her. I eventually quit the job after I graduated and got a much better job in my field of study which does involves computers.


I haven't talked to her much other than a couple messages here and there for about 2 years now. She randomly reached out to me to fix her laptop that has a corrupted OS and won't boot. I offered to help and she's going to drop the laptop off at my apartment at a time of my convenience. She also offered to pay which I kind of ignored that question as of now. 


The problem is I know that she still works a crappy job and doesn't make a ton of money. Not really sure what to do, I don't mind helping, but I know it's a slippery slope to start doing IT work for free all the time. 


Thoughts and opinions please?",19Apr2018,1
71,"I realize this is a very open ended question and I appreciate any advice, or personal anecdotes. 

This is possibly the first time I have let myself express this emotion ‘out loud’ and not shut it down. I don’t believe in tooting my own horn very often, and I don’t know how most of you will receive this next statement, but I know myself to be a very giving friend. I listen to my friends’ problems, offer what is in my opinion, logical, sound advice, respect their opinions even if I disagree, and have a very ‘do anything for my friends’ attitude. I have never regretted this aspect of my personality and do not expect to change it in this lifetime.

Shutting down my own sadness comes very naturally to me and I do it quite often, despite knowing its not healthy. A small example would be; I have cried once in the last 13 years. Yet, I enjoy listening to other people’s personal problems and trying to solve them, and many times, to not get a swollen head, I’ve chalked it up to the fact that I probably just love drama. But I don’t think thats it. (I do love drama though, lol). 

Anyway, two years ago I moved 2 continents away to pursue my undergraduate degree and had to say goodbye to a friend circle I had pretty much considered family for a few years now. Ever since then I have seen them move on. At first we all tried to keep in touch. 2 skype calls a month at minimum and a phone call for sure if anything big happened. I still remember when I started dating this girl, my best friend and I talked about it for a couple of days over voice notes. But as the year went by, the conversation went down to one call in four months with only one of those friends and now, I haven’t actually talked to any of them in over 4 months. 

Meanwhile, they have gone on vacation together multiple times, partied whenever they were all home and at first it was easy to suppress the twinges of sadness I would feel, but lately I have found myself lost in thought for hours just wallowing in self pity. 

And now, finally, I’m going home. 

Before I left home two years ago, I had my 18th birthday party. Back home we make a big deal of being at our friends’ places at 12 am on their birthdays. It was basically a given we were all going to have people over, and I had personally taken gifts and cakes to my friends houses and sometimes even pushed aside important commitments to make my friends’ birthdays special. So when my 18th came around, I was so sure people would be there and probably even bring alcohol, that I sent both my parents out to receive my sister at the airport (who was flying in for my birthday), rather than let one of them stay for 12. They (being the amazing people they are) recognized I wanted some privacy and deliberately came home after 12.

No one showed up. I was alone when I turned 18. 

Thats the only time I have wept in 13 years. I was so bitter that I was glad I was leaving soon. The excuse was that they thought my birthday was the next day. I was honestly heartbroken. But naturally I pushed it down, because I was taking all of them out the next day and to confront them may have meant screwing up my 18th birthday celebration. I sucked it up but I think that day ended up changing my personality. I have felt taken for granted before, but I’ve placated myself with the fact that I genuinely enjoy taking care of my friends, so really I’m gaining something from it all. Ive felt like a secondary friend before, but the good times had dismissed my apprehensions. However, I have felt myself become more and more cynical since that day.

I’m going back now, and I guess my issue is with the fact that I don’t know how to have good times and not get emotionally attached. I know they say its healthy to cut out ‘toxic’ people from your life, but firstly, they are genuinely nice people and have been there for me before, its just that I’m not as important to them as some other people are; can I really fault them for that? Secondly, I have had a similar experience with friends I have made at university, where I’ve been the emotional dumpee, not the dumper. I feel ‘not listened to’ all the time. So if I were to cut out ALL OF these people, I would truly be alone and friendless. 

I know I sound sad, pathetic and depressed; but I’m genuinely not. I have a lot going for me and am genuinely blessed to have my life. I have a wonderful family who are extremely supportive of whatever I do, so its not like I’m alone either. This isn’t a pity party. I just genuinely feel that I may be approaching my friendships incorrectly and that if I am being able to recognize a pattern with almost all my friends, maybe I’m doing something wrong.

Thanks for reading. This was just as much a vent as it was a request for advice.

76,"So I wrote a test today and it was a test I wanted to get 100 on to boost my mark up because this is the last test before my report card comes out. 

I have a dilemma though. Our teacher lets us finish our tests the next day at lunch if we don't finish in class. Our test had 5 sections that had 2 questions of the same type. We had the option to answer both of them but she would only take the question we did the best on from each section.

Here's my moral dilemma now, and I have a huge conscience so please answer honestly, I don't wanna regret anything. I was confident in my answer to the last section so I only answered 1 of the 2 without doing the second one for ""insurance"" as I did with the other sections because class was almost over and I was exhausted from studying the night before. After the test was done my friend and I had an argument because we got different answers for that last question. My friend took a picture of the question when he was done so he could check his answer again at home, and usually I get pissed at him doing that and I still am, but I figured the test was over, and I already finished it so why not do it again and have fun proving him wrong. But turns out I did it wrong, made a dumb calculation error. 

So now I'm debating going in and doing the second question from that section because technically I'm not completely finished the test, and I'm 99% sure she'd let me, but I'm also having second thoughts about it because I don't want a good mark from cheating.. I just don't know if this is cheating or not. Because if I were to go in I wouldn't change the answer I know I got wrong, I would just finish the one that I didn't do, but on the other hand I wouldn't even be going in if I didn't check if I correctly did the question I did wrong at home.

78,"Heyo! I'm looking for some advice on how to talk to someone about something about them that's annoying. In one of my discord servers, we've got a really friendly, chatty bunch of people hanging about. Or at least, we used to, until (Steve, we'll call him Steve.) came in. For the past two months now, he's been sitting in the chat, seriously 24/7. Anytime anyone wants to talk, Steve is there. Which would be fine, we love to talk. But he can only talk about himself. If you had a bad day at work, Steve ignores your comment and talks about his previous job. If you say something funny your pet did, Steve instantly pops up talking about how he got his pet from an animal shelter. If you say that you've got a dentist appointment and love the fish tank in the office, Steve cooks up a story about _his_ dentist's office and how it's got a massive shark tank in the wall. 

He doesn't let anyone else speak. _Ever_. No matter what you say, he's there to overtake your conversation and go on about himself for literal hours at a time. Everyone has dropped out of the chat and doesn't want to come in because they know Steve will be summoned the moment they type 'hi'. He never says 'hi' back. Instead he instantly starts blasting out comments about his life events as if you're not even there. 

And when people do manage to get a conversation started, he always shoves himself in and diverts it to himself until everyone has left. I have never dealt with a person who likes to talk about themself _So much_. When I say he's there at all hours, I mean all hours. He never, ever leaves. I don't know how he does it, but he's got his stories ready every moment of the day. 

Once I asked him to hold on for a moment because I was telling a story and he said something like 'lol that's nice' and kept right on going. Just shoved me clean out of the conversation that I'd started with someone else.

82,"    My dad seems to hate most things I do and doesn't understand me as a 15 year old teenager. My dad who graduated from MIT as one of the top students, values respect more than anything else, even education and my grades. He grew up with a rough childhood, being an immigrant brought to the US through an United Nations International school, he, and my grandma who came to the US with him in the late 80's were poor. My grandma worked as a nanny during that time, and earned very little from her restless amount of work that was used to support him and herself. My dad often tells me that watching my grandma having to work like that was painful, and pushed him to work hard and get good grades to improve their situation. Eventually he got scholarship from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated with a master's. Now he works at a $150,000+ job and supports the whole family of 6. 
      Because of his successes, expectations of me are really high, and I'm always compared to my dad by my gradnmother. I work hard to get good grades and often stay up till midnight to complete assignments. I feel like this has very much over stressed me, and I feel like this, as well as getting hit, has caused me to become nearly antisocial person with nearly no friends whatsoever. At school I'm usually a very quiet child, and usually sits alone. People, including the dean and guidance counselor, would ask me if I had anything disturbing me and ask if I want to chat in private about it, which makes me feel like an outcast and a trouble to everyone.
       Also, because he grew up poor, he has the habits of trying to save money, which often translates to being extremely cheap. My parents don't give me allowance, and do not support me in any attempt of me trying to make money. I am not allowed to buy what I want, and every tiny thing that I buy must be known to my parents or approved. Even if it is something I really need, my dad never buys it for me. As I joined the boy scouts, I made many older friends, who buy clothing from a brand called Supreme, which is limited and has a really high resell values. They use this resell value to make money, and when I tell my parents I want to do the same, my parents gave me a hour long lecture about why I should not buy expensive clothing. They say that branded cloth is not nessesary since branded or not they are all the same, and tell me to stop trying to be popular, and make real ""smart friends"".             
     However, they do not understand basic fashion, and just say that I should just wear whatever I have and be appreciative. This is also another reason to why I feel like I developed social disabilities, since I often as a child got bullied about what I wore. Even if it wasnt branded, I still wanted to look at least acceptable, and not like I just don't give a shit.
    My most problematic issue however, is when it comes to respect. Whenever I disagree with anything he says, me and my dad would often get into a long debate and he would rarely even  end up threating to disown me (which I know he doesn't mean it) and lead to a very bad mood and atmosphere in the family. 
     I really want to go on and improve this whole situation, since I still have a lot more years that I have to spend with him and I don't want my memories of me and my father to be all painful.   How should I go about getting through this?",19Apr2018,1

87,"I'm going to be a senior next year in high school and am considering trying out for Varsity Water Polo, but unsure whether or not to fully commit on the endeavor. I tried out for my High School my Junior Year and ended up making JV. Unfortunately, I wasn't that good enough to be pulled up to varsity for our league tournament. 

&amp;nbsp;
I am asking this question as to know what to do during the summer. I am willing to grind for hours and put in the effort and time needed to succeed, but am worried about failing and doing so much work for nothing. Failure itself isn't as scary to me as wasting my time or making an embarrassment out of myself for being cut as a senior. My main fear however is that by not making the team, I have wasted valuable time spent training/conditioning over the summer when I could've been focusing on something else more productive or beneficial like a job or studying for standardized tests etc.

&amp;nbsp;
As a water polo player, I would rate myself an honest 5/10, and in order to make my varsity team, I would need to be at least a 7-8/10. I think I have the potential to get to that level but I need other's opinion on whether it is worth the time and effort or not. I am on Varsity Swim, which definitely helps with conditioning for polo. I can also last in the pool for a while, but my technique and positioning are the things I struggle with most in water polo.

93,"I typed this way longer the first time, but I’ve shortened it for you guys. You can probably skim this novel and have all the important info. 

Kindergarten through freshman year, I had amazing grades and honors/AP classes. Halfway through my sophomore year, with A’s and B’s, I suddenly lost all interest and motivation for no apparent reason and ended up failing two easy classes.

My sophomore year is also where I went from a fairly quiet kid with semi-frequent panic attacks over dumb shit to a sociable kid who became aware of just how big the world was, if that makes any sense.

Onto this year, my Junior year. I took all normal/easy classes so I could focus on them, but became frustrated early on. It felt like there was nothing I could do, and nothing/no one could helping. Eventually, because of this, my relationship with my family because incredibly strained. Both of these led to an existential crisis and I ended up trying to kill myself, but failed solely because I don’t know how to use a gun. I’ve changed a lot since then, but I remained depressed for a couple months. 

In December, I got a job at a local farm/feed store where I do mostly warehouse-type work, like lifting and handling heavy things. (I’ve been working a couple times a week in food service since freshman year, but all of it went to my car.) Just after I got the job, I switched from a traditional school to self-paced cyber school. This has allowed me to work about 25 hours or more a week. Working is, in a sense, what “saved” me from  my depression. It gave me a feeling of purpose in the community, it makes me feel accomplished, and it gives me money. I could go on, but pretty much: a bad day at work beats a good day doing schoolwork a million times over. And I plan to go into a blue collar field (probably HVAC) that wouldn’t require me to have incredible credentials.

On top of that, my family’s been going further and further into debt (mom just got cured of cancer and then ridiculous credit card debt) and my mom has been living more and more paycheck to paycheck. (She makes a lot of money, she just owes so much.) So I’ve been buying a lot of my own food, clothes and other various necessities. (I’m decent at budgeting)

Recently, though, shit’s been hitting the fan. I haven’t been doing nearly enough schoolwork to graduate on time, and it’s not because I don’t have time, it’s because every time I open up my laptop I lose interest and motivation quickly. It’s like I literally cannot focus on it for more than an hour at a time, no matter how hard I try. I just can’t convince myself that it’s necessary. My relationship with my mom is even more strained and I’ve entered another existential crisis of sorts. I think that dropping out and taking the GED is the way to go, as I can take it in less than a year and I’ve passed the practice tests (from the same organization) with flying colors. I’ve offered to pay rent to my mom and pay for mostly everything myself until I can move out, but she is saying that her only goal with raising me is that I graduate high school and go to college. My dad doesn’t really have a say in this. 

I could go on about how my mom is manipulative and a liar, but I’ve already typed a novel. Help

98,"This whole situation reminds me of ‘requiem of a dream’
My grandma had a lap band type of surgery. She went to one doctor who STRONGLY advised her to not have her band tightened. She was barely eating even with that, she went to another surgeon who tightened it to a point where idk... I never once saw her eat normally. She would eat food on a tea cup saucer. Never did I see her eat more than that, and most of the time she’d end up throwing it up because the band was too tight. She then got Esophageal cancer, which I’m sure happened because she had the band tightened. ",19Apr2018,2
99,"Hello, im a 19 year old guy in college. My entire life social interaction has been very stressful for me. As I get older it gets worse. Whether it be talking to the cashier at Starbucks or trying to talk to another student I am overcome with fear. My heart beats really fast and it gets a little hard to breathe. Throughout highschool in my friends group I was kinda known for being weird and gooofy. Still, every failed attempt at trying to socialize  just felt awful, it still does. I talk to myself allot ( only when I'm alone) and it's comforting. ifeel like when I talk to myself I can resolve allot of issues I have. I'm just not great with other people despite how much  I want to be. I also feel like people are constantly looking at me cause I'm Soo odd and out of place. I really hate walking in public or driving sometimes because of that feeling. On top of that in class I can't focus not matter how hard I try. I also have this quirk where I can't sit still sometimes. I can hide it tho cause my timbs are spacious enough to let me move me toes around. I've found alcohol helps allot with allot this stuff. When I'm drunk I don't care what people think and I can interact with others soo easily. Honestly I feel happy with myself when in drunk. Sorry for the rambling, replies are appreciated.",19Apr2018,2
101,"Hey all, so here's the situation. My boyfriend and I have been together since November in 2016 after we met on vacation. We spent a month together, then we both had to part ways, me back to the US and him back to Europe. We were long distance for 8 months but he moved to my state only 1 hour away from where I live. My work and school schedule allow for me to drive down there on Thursday night/Friday afternoon and stay there for the whole weekend. So pretty much, we are living together for half of the week. 

He's looking for a new place come next August and I would honestly love to live with him. He's said he definitely does want an apartment with me in the future. But when I brought up us maybe getting a place together once his lease is up, he said we should wait another year until he's finished his degree. I told him that I'd really like to have the experience of us living together as students and not being employed full time (he's supported completely by his parents right now so he doesn't have to work but once he does, it's probably going to be quite a bit. I'd honestly just love to have the time before that to grow together.)

HERE'S THE CATCH if you read anything, read this:

He is on a student visa that expires in August of 2019 unless he can get a work permit. He's gonna have to find a job that will provide him with this and I know that's extremely hard. So part of me kind of wants to be able to live with him before he has to go back, but the other part of me is like no, that's dumb, you'd move towns for a year and then have to go back absolutely heartbroken. 

He's already said getting a green card through marriage is completely out of the question which honestly made me really fucking sad, but hey, that is kinda crazy I guess. Honestly the thought of never seeing him again is exponentially crazier to me because I want him to be the person I spend the rest of my life with. I've never felt this way about anyone before and I'm not sure if I ever will in the future. Meeting him was what really showed me how beautiful love is and how it's the closest thing to magic we have in this world.

And that brings me to the next piece of advice I'm seeking. Knowing that he doesn't want to make sure I'm a part of his life makes me feel like maybe I shouldn't be so invested in this. If he can't find a work permit, which he knows is going to be very hard to do, he's accepted the fact that our time together is over forever. We will not be a part of each others lives any longer because he'll have to go back to Europe and he won't be able to find a work permit in the US if he's living there. So that's where he'd start his life and family with someone else. Wow. This is making me cry so much.

Okay but anyways, if you said no to the apartment part, do you think it's harmful for me to stay with him any longer? He has made it clear that he wants a future with me, but he can't promise me that he'll stay here. He said he's going to try his hardest and if he can, then we'll get a dog together and an apartment for sure. I want that so bad because right now, it really sucks not being able to plan on doing these things as a couple.

But the thought of us having to say goodbye forever in a little over a year breaks my heart beyond belief. I don't know how I'm going to function if/when that does happen, so I don't know if it's best for me to just start moving on now. I know this is wrong to think, but I'm thinking maybe the person who wants to make sure I'll be a part of their life forever is out there and I'm missing them right now by staying with someone who doesn't. 

pls halp, am now crying uncontrollably. Like if this thought makes me so sad, I don't know what I'm going to do when/if the goodbye comes.",19Apr2018,2
102,"I just lost my boyfriend because of my temper/angry outrages while drinking. How pathetic. I never thought it would come to this. You don't realize what you have until it's gone. This was one of the biggest eye openers of my life. I know I've have a serious issue to fix, and it's not going to be overnight, but I want to show him I'm serious. 

I will admit that I have trouble with drinking; have for a while. My bf had a great relationship. The only times we fight is when I've been heavily drinking. Living in a college town makes it so easy to binge drink. That's where I get into trouble. I start out as the happy social drunk, everything is going great until something so miniscule sets me off and then I turn into the hulk. I have this rage which is almost as I blackout and scream and say the nastiest things. Things I wouldn't even say to my worst enemy. I sometimes become physically violent. I've thrown things at my bf and his car and I even smacked him once. Im so emabarassed and ashmed of my actions. It is inexcusable. I don't want to be like that. I'm willing to stop drinking period to prove to him that I'm serious about not ever getting to that point ever again. 
I known this is something I need to do for not only us (if that's he would consider taking me back) but I need to fix myself. 

I understand I can tell him all day long that ""I'm sorry"" and ""I will change"" but actions speak louder than words, and I just need to show him I'm serious. 

What do I need to do now? I need help. What should I do to prove to him that I want to change?

I'm just feeling so lost and hurt right now, so words of wisdom, advice or anything would be very nice during this time. Thanks.",19Apr2018,1
103,"To protect his identity, let's call him Jason. I've know Jason since kindergarten and we've gone to the same school every single year. Now, we are both sophomores now in high school. I know we're young, but what's happened to him is incredible. In the past three months: his girlfriend of 15 months dumped him, he quit soccer, failed 4 classes, his acne is getting out of control, and I think he may have slight depression.

I'm not really friends with Jason anymore because he quit sports which was why we became such good friends before. He also joined a new friend group of a bunch of guys that just smoke weed all day and juul in the bathrooms. I am absolutely not that kind of person and wanted to stay away from him because of that. But since he's one of my longest friends, I can't bear seeing him like this.

I don't know how to help Jason. Tell him to stop doing drugs? He's never been the type to listen but that's what he needs to do right now. I don't want to tell his parents that he's been doing weed and vaping because then I'll be known as the snitch that told the parents. I've tried telling a trusted adult about a similar situation in the past, and all I got was shit for being a snitch. I don't want to ruin my reputation but at the same time I want to help my friend.

106,"Little background info...

I. HAVE. THE. NICEST. BOSS. IN. THE. WORLD. 
I used to work as a receptionist at a Doctor's office and David (my boss now) used to be a patient there. I left that job to work as a receptionist at a Real Estate office, which I was thrilled about because it's what I want to eventually get into -- Real Estate. I was fired a month later because no one fucking trained me so they thought I wasn't catching on...Anyways, I was totally let down. 

For a month I was trying to find another job Real Estate related and I had absolutely no luck. I started to question if this was something I even wanted to get into for the long run. For some advice I went to my boyfriend's sister who told me I should really talk to someone in Real Estate and see if it's for me. I remembered David from my old job and I knew he was in Real Estate, so, I googled his name and got his phone number, texted him to see if he would be willing to meet up to talk. He agreed to and we met up that same night. I asked him why he was in Real Estate, and why he liked it and all that stuff and I even mentioned how I was recently let go and was trying to get a job in the field. My intentions were not to get a job from him, but I mentioned it because I'm super open and idgaf. He was nice enough to say he would ask around to see if there could be something for me and I was happy enough with that.

Few days later, he calls me, and basically gives me a job. He said how I impressed him by reaching out! Which was super cool because it wasn't even my idea in the first place. Why I had to mention that he's the nicest boss in the world is because at my previous job that I was fired from, no one gave a fuck. I traveled the farthest, was always earlier than everyone else and I picked up every shift that I was asked to cover. The girls who were supposed to be training me were literally on their phones the ENTIRE time...shopping online or just talking and made it seem like a huge pain in their ass when I had a question to ask and fired me without sitting down and talking to me about expectations...but DAVID. David is so helpful, so nice, and SO patient. He even once said, ""You can ask me the same question 100 times and that's ok because on the 101st time you ask, you'll understand"" -- something like that, but here's this damn boss man who's more than willing to help me out when on his end, he has a million more things to do. I just super appreciate that so that's why I'm more nervous about asking for a raise, I hate talking about how much someone should pay me, especially with the person who's paying me. 

OK. So now the job itself. 

I started the end of January so it's only been like less than 3 months now, but I feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders, in a good way though. 

We agreed that I would start at $1,400 bi-weekly. ($1,133.32 with tax) and work 7 days a week from home.

I can't base it hourly because somedays I literally work like 12 hours, others maybe 8, weekends maybe 3 hours -- I should probably keep track

He deals with pre-construction condos where there are like literally 100 condos we're working on -- each new condo is like a whole business itself 

My job, basically, is to create content for each condo -- research the area, get facts about the development itself, outline multiple points as to why the location is amazing. 

With all the information I compiled I need to...
1.) Post it on our website (a responsibility that used belong to someone else but now is mine) 
2.) Post it on kijiji (a responsibility that used to belong to someone else but now is mine)
3.) Create a landing page (a mini website) for individual condos
------ essentially, in charge of all online marketing
4.) I also receive multiple e-mails a day regarding updates or little odd things to be done (design a sign for an event -- using illustrator which I've never ever used before) 

There's tons more, and probably with all that you can't understand just how incredibly busy I am. 

SO. I WANT MORE MONAY

1) WHEN should I ask? 6 months in?

2) Since it's not hourly, I don't even know what's an acceptable increase? Ideally $2,000 bi-weekly would be amazing. That's  $600 increase though... 

3) How would you even bring it up! I barely see him but I talk to him like everyday...I don't feel like it's appropriate over text or e-mail to discuss this?

My grandma just had a stroke. She has been having heart problems. She’s nearing 90, and I don’t think she’ll keep going much longer. We live 2000 miles apart but I try to see her as much as possible. 

She knows her time is near, and thinking about how she must feel is just heart wrenching. I have this idea of living this extraordinary life, like most want to live. But the reality is most people live a mediocre life and die alone. My grandma knows she’s almost dead, yet who goes to see her? She’s finishing the last chapter of the life she wrote, and everyone knows but still it’s not important enough for anybody to be there? 

Is this my responsibility to make everyone realize they need to call her more? Should I quit my job and spend more time with her?

On my first appointment(today) she diagnosed me with depression, and I do think this is a step in the correct direction, but I feel as if I need more from her. I am almost positive I have schizophrenia, OCD(the actual disorder and not the ""I need to be organized"" bullshit) and ADHD. Whenever I talk to her I feel scared to say anything meaningful. I wanted to bring these up a year ago when I first started seeing her, and later stopped, but instead, I bullshitted an entire half year of appointments using the excuse of some dietary problem stemming from the time I choked on bacon.

111,"I’ve been “friends” with an individual from university for a few years now. The thing about him is that he claims to be very straight forward.  He goes on and on bragging about how he doesn’t care about what other people think and says everybody else is soft. However, what I’ve begun to notice he’s actually just an asshole. 

Some examples:

1. Recently at a dinner the topic of my sister came up and I thought it was going to be the typical annoying guy talk about how they won’t to date a friends sister. But instead he starts mocking her by saying she’s super pretty. But then I look over and he mouths “I’m kidding, she’s so ugly”. Thinking I won’t see. I he it but he knows that I’m ver close with her and what really upset me is that she’s very sick. 

2. He will just say stupid shit. Damn your house is ugly. Wow you make no money per hour. It’s so sad that your parents didn’t buy you a car in high school. 

3. When something doesn’t go his way he just freaks out. For example, he’ll just yell at wait staff.

I was hoping to work extra OT this week after hours and not have to work the weekend. So if we got data by Friday, I would work through midnight on Friday just to go on this trip and be back by Monday morning.

Since we still haven’t gotten data I decided to keep on with the trip. In addition, I have put in about $500 of my own money for it. I told my boss I wouldn’t be able to come in over the weekend and would rather work extra during the week but still get the job done. She was not very happy and said I needed to tell her earlier in the week. Which would have been fine by me if she would stay in contact and respond to my messages/phone calls. Now my coworker has to cover for me, but it’s okay because they have done this sort of filing for another client already and it should be done fairly quickly.

So my question is: do I go on this trip, apologize to my boss for not being able to work the weekend and cover for my coworker another weekend?

I really want to get as much work done as possible by Friday night. Because I know the client won’t send out data on Saturday.

Is it frowned upon me to talk to the girls who will be going on stage before hand and find out what kind of music they like to dance to? I'm certain they'd rather dance to music they like cause they'll dance better and the better they dance the more money they make, which makes them happy with me as a DJ which in turn hopefully gets me called back. If it's frowned upon I obviously won't do it then.

What are some big No's for any new employee starting there?

Does someone DJ during the day? I feel like that would be a good time to start out at just so I can get the feel with DJ-ing a new type of venue and atmosphere.

140,"Hello. This year I ll be turning 24. I had a bf for the first time. It’s kinda late to have bf until this age. And I also never had sex before.
After 3 weeks knowing him (we met almost everyday) I went on a trip with him. I wasn’t really wanted to have sex with him in the first place, but I feel good when he touches me here and there. We did almost everything but sex, including outside rubbing and oral. Then after some times, he said that if he only gets straight without getting inside me, he feels very upset and maybe he won’t be interested in having sex with me anymore. I don’t really think keeping my virgin is so important that it makes him feel uncomfortable, so one day I said it’s okay. He has done many things for me, and I don’t want to be the only one who feels good when we make out.

But then again I have never done it before, so I don’t know how to help him getting inside. After a few tries, my bf got tired and he said maybe I’m not capable of sex. I told him I need more time, but he said maybe I need 10 years?? 
I like him alot, I think if we have sex it would be a pleasant experience for both of us. but sometimes I feel like he is disappointed in me. I’m not very sure, but he never use his force to get inside of me. I don’t know what should I do right now? I don’t really want to break up with him just because of this problem :( ",19Apr2018,1

So  my birthday was a few days ago and I've been struggling with some pretty negative feelings and ruminate on them which only serves to bring me further down. Here's the situation.

My parents have always been cheap but very kind, in the past when I was younger I could expect a birthday dinner and a gift. As I've gotten older its been smaller gifts and smaller outings. Last year I didn't get a gift but they took me to portos to celebrate  (which if you didn't know is a cafe sort of place) I wouldnt say it's the same as before when it would be a family dimner. This year I moved out (but still visit often) but other than a call wishing a happy birthday, I've not recieved anything...

Its difficult for me because I compare myself with my cousins who get more and my roomate recieving cards and checks from all sorts of family members.

I feel like a brat because I'd like these things... but I think on some level its how im measuring my value? Sometimes I feel if I changed my birthday on facebook I wouldn't get any happy birthday wishes at all.

147,"Background...I'm 27 living in the north east. Recently I've made the decision to pull away from the main group of people I was spending time with..they are past my shitty threshold. I don't have qualms about the decision itself, people that make me feel horrible about myself are not people I should spend large amounts of time with. 
So they're out. 

I had a major falling out with my college group of friends like two years ago. I even tried reaching out to the person who not only was I probably closest with, but was absolutely not involved in the bullshit. Unfortunately that Facebook message got seen'd so I assume he's no longer interested in hanging out. 

I have two amazingly close friends, but, they both live out of state. I'm also not single and my partner is 10/10, however I don't believe it's unhealthy at all to want at least one close non-romantic relationship, a bro if you will. They agree with me 100%. 

Profesionally I'm currently unemployed but I'm a truck driver. While it's not always the situation that I'll be out of town, it does mean I also basically don't have coworkers to mingle with when I am working. 

I've also attempted to use my main hobby as a vechile to spending time with the other people I get along with who share the hobby. Nothing ever came of it, and sadly it's not the biggest community so there being another person that I maybe just didn't consider isn't a thing. 

I've also tried my local Reddit like 6 times, and Meetups around here are rarely active or appealing. 

And...here I am. I feel like this situation is really unhealthy for me, aside from the lonliness I get stir crazy extremely easily. But, I have no idea what else to do. 

My main hobby, work, local communities internet prescense, and old friends from school all fell through. I don't like being the kind of person that looks up how to make friends on Google.

Top Boss: Tom, Line manager: Judy, Team leader: Dennis. All of whom are with company A. 
Current company: A, new company: B.

So I'm moving to across the country, I applied for a position in the new city and also asked company A about working from home in the new city. I get the offer from company B, and at the same time company A (Judy) agrees I can work from home in this new city (agreed verbally with all 3 people). So I decline the position from company B on the grounds I'll continue working with company A. (my first mistake).

Now a week later, at company A, Tom and Dennis have changed their mind and are now saying 'No' they cannot support working from out of office now. Their only offer is to stay in my location and not move, or hand in short notice to leave the company in time for me moving.

I've avoided going into great detail, but I feel quite betrayed as I've worked for this company for 5 years and given them my all.

157," Hey friends. I need some advice about arguing with friends and family for the first time. So I've recently lost my job due to the company shutting down completely. Forcing my wife and I to move in with her mother, it's about half of what we were paying before on rent. Mother and I are really cool to each other the only problem is she has five or so kids that come and go, living here as they please. The last two months have been alright even if I haven't found a job yet but that's only because four of those five kids didn't live here for that time. Unfortunately the same thing keeps happening to everyone all around us, companies shut down and we lose jobs. Some of MIL's kids have moved back in with their mom. 


  Anyways last night one of the kids, Bob, we'll call him just moved back in about two weeks ago. He woke me up by yelling and slamming our door while I was having a nap while my wife was on her phone. He screamed we're too loud at night and how we woke him up five times last night, which is almost certainly true because we (my wife and I) have to go through his room to leave ours. We always try to be quiet but I guess even we were too loud. Even to use the washroom or get food we have to leave through his room. Having just woke up I wasn't thinking correctly and threatened him by saying something along the lines of 'I'll fuck you up if you want to fight'. Bob instantly slams shut the door. I came to my senses and instantly regretted what I said as I opened the door behind him. He kept yelling how I have no respect for this house and how him and his brothers are forced to sleep on the couch and in the small rooms while my wife and I get the big room. I asked if there was anything I could do to help but he kept shouting over me about how he can't sleep or about how there's no privacy. At this point, mom, who was up stairs runs down the stairs. As she gets here she tries to defuse the situation, it only works partially as he now has two people trying to calm him down which I guess he doesn't like. The first thing he says to his mom is how I threatened him. I admitted yes I did but I'm sorry for saying that, I try to say why I said what I said but I only made things worse. I think it was along the lines of 'Sorry Bob I was sleeping, I wasn't thinking straight. I didn't mean what I said.' Bob doesn't like that excuse and neither does Mom. All mom can hear is that I threatened her son. But mom is still trying to get bob to calm down. Bob runs up stairs for some reason then back stairs, in the process he breaks a stair off and falls about five stairs down smashing his hand through the dry wall. He tells everyone to leave but since our (my wife and I) room is connected through his room we cannot leave very far. 


  Later on about fifteen minutes after consoling my wife who is crying hysterically I go into Bob's room and try to talk to him. He's calmed down now and on his phone talking to someone. I tell him I'm sorry again and suggest we clean one of the many rooms in the house that are being used for storage. He tells me to fuck off and if I was anyone else he would have beat the shit out of me when I threatened him. I start by saying I know we're not the closest but I ask if everything is okay. He tells me to fuck off again and not to pry into his life. 
  Now that we kind of know the situation, how do I handle this? Can I save my relationship with Bob? How do I handle 'mom'? My wife hasn't said anything since but she's been sleeping the whole time. What do I say to her? 


  This might be weird to say but this is the first time I've ever argued with anyone close to me, strangers sure, but family and friends is completely different. It leaves a twist in my stomach that makes me want to cry and confront them at the same time. Oh yes, I forgot one detail; My wife, Bob, and I are all mid twenties. If that makes a difference.

158,"21 year old male, living at home, going to uni, working part-time. 

Bought a used car with my own money about a year ago. Worked great at first but I've run into enough issues with it that it's getting unbearable to drive. So I'm looking to trade it in at a dealership and pay the difference to buy my personal realistic 'dream car', a car I've wanted for years and years. Went to a dealership the other day, test drove one, was everything I expected. Difference after trade-in would only be around $4000-$5000. I have more than enough in savings that I've got saved up from working my ass off at a shitty job for a year, juggling school while doing so in order to fulfill the whole dream car aspirations thing.

Problem is, father thinks my car is fine (it really isn't - AC rarely works, horrible gear grind when shifting to 2nd, 3rd gear lockout, reverse gear grind, incredibly loud rattling above 70mph, head unit is busted, driver door doesn't ""hold"" - automatically shuts when let go of, etc). Transmission problems alone would be stupid expensive and a huge pain in the ass. Bigger problem is, the title is under his name... so he has the final say. Can't just waltz into the dealership and hand them the keys without him signing the title over.

I'm performing fantastically at uni. I stay out of trouble. I've been great with my money, stuck to a hard budget for a year and a half with my shit job to get where I'm at in terms of my savings towards that new car that I've been eyeing for years. Now that I've got enough money of my own, father still can't be convinced to let me use it towards the car I want. Quite frustrating to set goals and stick to them for a year and a half for nothing.

161,"So here goes;

My partner and I have been together for awhile now and a few months back she reached out to me to let me know she has a eating disorder and body issues. Which is fine, well not fine but you know what I mean.

At first, I had some problems with it. I wouldn't say I monitored her at all, I made stupid comments like ""You haven't eaten much or today"" which I quickly learned from some research aren't the things I should be doing... where's my common sense?

I've pivoted into support mode which is where I should've been from the beginning. That said it's pretty difficult and draining watching your loved one go through this. It's ugly.

As with all relationships the focus is on said relationship between two people. Things get in the way and I understand that but you move on through those hard times. Lately I've been feeling alone, like I'm coming last, like we're coming last and the whole I need food, what can I eat, when can I eat is coming first.

We've been bickering / snapping too, over the smallest things, we move on from those. Obviously I'm keeping a lot in I know she has a lot on her plate but sometimes I say things like I feel alone (like the above) and it just seems to go unheard.. or seemingly so.

An example of this, would be a few hours ago, we went for a nice walk in the mall they have some outside food trucks, she seemed interested we stopped at a few she was on her phone doing something, I pointed out other food stalls which looked good. And she snapped at me for no reason, saying I asked to many questions (three things). Later she tells me she was looking up calories and I should've known that..

I just spoke with her about the above (40 mins later), and she said it wasn't me, she was being ""stupid"" and there was too much going on. I perceive this as she was probably overwhelmed by everything going on. This to me is a normal reaction for a person with ED (eating disorder), go research. 

She maybe could have handled it better, but hey it's nothing major, I just wish she expressed it better instead of snapping making it feel like a personal attack. But as a person with anxiety I totally understand and I've also done the same.

Our love life no longer exists, any advancements from my side are rejected or not acknowledged. Now I'm an overthinker, a horrible overthinker.. I know she loves me, I know she wants to be with me. However, our love life was so intense before this admission and has ceased to exist quickly, very ... quickly.. 

I've often thought and asked if she still loves me, if she's still attracted to me and the answers always ""yes of course"" (yippee!), that feeling though the feeling of not being loved mentally and physically is something I find hard..

I guess I'm looking for advice on how to deal with her food disorder, how that affects our relationship, herself and how to lessen the burden.. I know that more planning needs to go into dinners/dates to ensure she's not overwhelmed again and that's fine. Watching my tongue is a given.. any insights from people who've dealt with a partner in a similar situation or has gone through it would be much appreciated.

It would also just cause a lot of tension and anger in the family for me to even ask partly because, unfortunately, the man who may be my father passed away about 5 years ago. 

So I have no way of knowing for sure if my mother and he had any relations, and would rather not ever go through her or any family member to try to find out. As an uncle, he was very dear to me and I miss him every day. I wish I had thought of this sooner, when I was younger, and maybe asked him if he ever thought just maybe... But I didn't. And be died in 2013, of a botched surgery for a lung condition. 

One of the final straws in my suspicion was that I realized he was hypoglycemic, and I am also hypoglycemic. My (raised) dad is diabetic, so I figured it could be hereditary from him. But he has low insulin, and I have high. It's still possible I could get that from him, but less likely. 

My predicament is that I have no idea how to even go about getting a DNA test to find out, because he is deceased and I am not in touch with his family. Any ideas? ",19Apr2018,2

I’ve been here at the office working and I’m kind of upset that they’re having so much fun without me and the fact that she’s discovering a new city while I’m here at work. 

It’s a selfish and an immature feeling and I know I shouldn’t feel like this. It’s only a 3-days holiday and she’ll be back today. I want to be happy for her because she liked the city she went to and had a good time, but for some reasons I’m not.

170,"A while back our landlords told us they wanted to sell the house we rent. It took us 6 months to find a suitable place this time just due to the tough rental market. Where we live, tenants need to be given at least 60 days notice when landlords want to sell the house.

So on Saturday (mid April), my landlord tells me they got on offer on the house for May 31, and ask if we can be out by May 30. At this point, they can only legally give us notice for July 1. Now, I was right in the middle of exams at that point, super stressed, so let her know that I’ll try my best (and I meant that), but will get back to her after my exams are done (Tuesday). 

Well, I receive a series of very pushy text messages, trying to urge me to accept, because then “the showings will be done” (I don’t mind the showings that much so I don’t know why they thought this was a big bargain for me.) I took a decent chunk of time that was supposed to be spent studying to send in inquiries to a couple of rentals, but most weren’t available until July 1. Eventually, I sent a message back explaining all of the things I need to look into before I consent (new place to live, wtf do I do between May 30 and June 1 since that’s a weird move out day, I need to rent moving trucks, not to mention I’m graduating and don’t know what city I’ll be living in so I shouldn’t be signing a year-long lease anywhere), I explained that I spent a large portion of the day looking into this for her, and I don’t have time right now but will absolutely try my best. Again, I asked until Tuesday.

The next morning her husband shows up at my door and says a whole bunch of nasty things, like 1.) the house will never sell with us here (we keep it VERY clean, have gone away several weekends so they can have open houses, and houses sell all the time with tenants in them... with 60 days notice), 2.) they’ve been such good landlords and always respond to maintenance requests (and I pay rent, that’s my job and maintenance are theirs where we live... also they haven’t responded to *every* maintenance request), and 3.) that we’re being unreasonable (for wanting more than 1 day to secure a place to live while I’m in exams). Okay. 

I lost it at the “unreasonable” part. I dealt with a number of improper entries when they were having the whole house painted. I would come home to people in my house, with no notice, having moved around my personal stuff (dirty laundry, bras, prescriptions) when I’m supposed to have 24 hours notice. Or I would come home and they’d taken it upon themselves to lock my dog up for hours without water. I let them remodel the kitchen and ate food from the microwave for 3 weeks. Some major appliances included in my lease (ie. AC, the dryer) have died and I didn’t kick up a stink. I could have gone to our landlord and tenant board and gotten a decent chunk of cash and didn’t, because I like to keep the peace.

I listed these to him and he shoved an agreement to end the tenancy at me and tells me I need to sign it today and storms off. 

I send a massage to my landlord explaining how unfair this was since I was in exams, was only asking for a couple of days, and I could have just said no. 

She sends a half hearted apology, says it’s been stressful for them too, and says she still needs the papers signed.

I know I could have put my foot down, but I was able to convince a friend to rent out his basement apartment to me cheap. It’s a huge downgrade from my living situation now, but there’s no year-long lease. In my opinion, greed showed their true characters, and I didn’t want to stay anyways, so I texted them that I’d move out.

I’m not looking for legal advice. Ironically, I’m a law student who volunteers for legal aid and I know that I could go after them for the above-mentioned incidents. But that’s not really what I’m interested in.

I feel like they’re horrible, selfish people, who got off too easy here. Maybe I’m looking for some r/pettyrevenge ideas here, or maybe I’m hoping someone will find the words I want to say to them. But something just isn’t sitting right with me, because I think they believe they acted appropriately and feel like victims of tenant protection laws... because 60 days notice is just so burdensome I guess.

Any ideas?

172,"Long read ahead. You have been warned.

So i broke up with this girl 3 years ago whom i really liked and possibly was in love with. She is a difficult person but i got along with her like noone else before.

After 3 years we got in contact and became sort of friends. I still like her romantically and she shows signs of that too but because of her difficult nature she's also pushing me away. Now i would not mind being just friends with her but this won't have that ending.

So last week at a party i got pretty close to this younger girl, we slept together and made out but did not have sex. But man oh man she was sexy, she's got soo arousing body language i nearly couldn't control myself. And now that her period is over she wants to have sex with me. 

The problem is that when i casually told this to my ex, she got super jealous which she normally does not get or does not show it at least. So now she wants to go on a sort of date with me. It's not like i would not love that bc in the long run i'm head over heels for this girl but the way she treats me and pushes me away sometimes is major turn off and not just sexually.

So i'm contemplating on fucking this younger girl whom i don't or can't see a relationship forming with. Just to get it out of my system before starting meeting my ex again whom i feel like i have unfinished business with.

174,"Hello!  
So I've been friends with, let's call her P, for two years now. She's gravitated more into my friend-group this year because her closest friend left this year, and she got into nasty fights with her older friends (including her recently ex-best friend), so she needed new people. Since then we've gotten closer.  
So usually we're all kind of horrible to each other, but it's a known fact that that is how we show we care and love one another. We're not so awful to the point it would affect anyone really though.  
Yesterday, during lunch, she told me the food I cooked looked like dog shit and she'd never eat such a thing. I didn't take offense to this because I know she doesn't mean it maliciously enough to hurt me or anything. However, I retorted by making a joking comment about her appearance (which she constantly does to me).  
She didn't talk to anyone during lunch and eventually left early. Then I texted an apology that same day because I couldn't find her in person - she still hasn't opened my message but I know she knows I sent one. However, today, my school had a little ""Senior Walk"" thing where all the senior students get their gowns and caps and walk around the school (we're graduating soon so it's just a cool little pre-celebration).  
She didn't come to any classes so I couldn't find her again to apologize. Then, when I did find her, she told me to fuck off.  
So my friends and I went on without P and walked, and she walked with this girl who she's constantly complained and bitched about, yet she continues to be friends with.  
I'm kind of over it now because I did my part in attempting to apologize, even though she's constantly berated me about my appearance. However, I take it as a joke.  
I guess I don't really know what to do, so I'm asking for advice - we only have a few classes left until graduation, so should I just wait for her to come to me or just remove her from my life?",19Apr2018,2
177,"x-post because my emotions always get the best of me.

So I've been seeing this guy now for about 2 months. We've never actually talked about what we want from each other, but from some questions I've asked him and him talking about his future plans (future meaning 3-6 months), I can tell I like this dude too much considering he only wants to fuck me.

The bad part is, since the start, he's been very ""date-y"". He texts me every day, good morning and good night, asks me how my day is going, we've gone out to the movies, dinner several times, etc. He always wants to cuddle, and is super sweet in the mornings after he sleeps over. He'll sometimes even come into my job (I work as a barista) before the shop closes on his way home just to say hi and hope I have a good night.

But the reality is I know he's seeing other girls. He also mentioned wanting to move to the West Coast, and when I asked him last week specifically he said ""I'm thinking end of July beginning of August"" which took me a little by surprise and also hurt.

He's a good lay, for sure. And a part of me doesn't want to give that up. But I know I'll get hurt if he continues being like this. I don't know if to break it off, or how to communicate ""stop treating me like your girlfriend and more like a random fuck buddy""

tl;dr - Guy I've been seeing for 2 months is treating me like he wants to date me when I know he only wants a fuck buddy. How do I tell him to stop being so nice to me, or should I just break it off?",19Apr2018,47

183,"Procrastination, work ethic, maybe some brand of sedentary-ness, whatever it is, I've had problems doing the work that I ought to pretty much since I had work to do, definitely since the beginning of highschool (~12 years old). When work has been easy, I've been more able to keep up (a revelation, I'm sure), but a few times in the past, when the going got tough, my academic performance has suffered immensely as a result of it. 

I hesitate to call it procrastination because, although the symptoms are similar, there seem to be a variety of mechanisms at play, all compounding one another to the same effect. This is likely a reason that its been so elusive when it comes to treatment and/or help.  

It's not just work in the academic sense that it fouls up, but also in a more general sense. I don't think anyone particularly enjoys doing admin, but for me (I think) it's particularly difficult. I also procrastinate on things that I actively enjoy doing, like playing video games, where instead I'll just keep browsing reddit, facebook, twitter, youtube, or just daydream. It feels like I think 'Hey, I should do [an activity]' and then I just *don't*.

Over the years, I've generally tried to solve my problem by talking to people, from my close family, to learning support staff at school, to therapists (cognitive behavioural and regular), to psychologists, and needless to say none of those efforts were successful, and not for lack of trying on their parts.  

What I'm looking for here is somewhere to start, a lead to follow. It seems like I've exhausted all the potential avenues I know of, and I need somewhere else to start looking.

184,"I’m studying modern languages. It’s not fulfilling anymore. I want to be an artist full-time, not just as a hobby. 

I’m already halfway through my degree, 2 years left now (a 4-year course). I’m not doing badly, as I pick up the languages fairly easily without studying much.

But I want to be passionate and fulfilled, follow my dream and all the jazz. The main problems with just dropping out and going to art school, however, are:

-all my friends and my girlfriend are at my current uni.
-I’ve already dropped out of uni doing psychology before this. If I drop out again, I would have to save money to pay student fees as the government will only give me student loans for 5 years total. (So they would only pay for 2/3 years of study and I’d have to save another 9k)
-everyone I know is advising against it (apart from my girlfriend), because doing so would decrease my chances of getting a ‘stable’ job. But I would rather live life poor yet happy rather than rich and bored.

I guess I could drop out and just become an artist straight away, but I am not sure if my skills and connections are enough to make it, which is something I could gain through hard work at art school.

185,"Ever since I was about 5 years old, I was obsessed with computers. I got my first computer when I was 6, and built my first computer when I was 12. I loved preforming little script-kiddy hacks on the school, and just generally dabled in your average tech nerdiness. I had aspirations for MIT, but that was definitely unrealistic.

From K-6th grade, I attended a charter school that did not use a grading scale, but instead a pass fail system, so I never properly learned the significance of grades. By the time I learned how the grade letter system worked, I already had my first C. From that point on, I kept my 3.0 average but not much higher from there.

Throughout 9th and 10th grade I continued to pursue CS, but I never managed to learn anything more than HTML/CSS and some basic C++. However, by pure luck at the end of  my 10th grade year, I won my school's film festival in first place for my catagory. 

(https://youtu.be/fKJ5eyGE8fM)

This completely changed my career aspirations towards film, and I've worked on it ever since. However, I've noticed that some of the others that seem more destined to move on seem more interested than me. I only tend to do filming when I have to, and while I have a reputation for always doing well, I can't say I always enjoy it. 

In the world of film, I also have connections to a few tv shows and have an internship secured with NBC in NYC. I'm not so worried that I won't be able to make a career out of this, just whether I'll enjoy it. 

Currently, I'm attempting to get into FSU to pursue a bachelor's in film.

I went to the cold drinks aisle, and all I remember is looking at a cold drink and walking away...What I don't recall is putting it in my carrier bag \(not paying for it\).

As I paid for one item, I looked in my carrier bag and recognised the item I was looking at 5 minutes ago...But no receipt to account for it.

Had I not double checked the carrier bag, it would've escalated into the police being called \(they have zero tolerance\).

193,"Hi everyone. I feel like this may be the biggest decision I'll ever have to make in my life and I would really appreciate some help to weigh up my options. I am a loner and don't have friends to talk to so (I'm not ashamed of being a loner I prefer being alone with my cats and boyfriend). Anyway, I have been working for my company for four years. It's in the IT industry however I don't have many options for growth currently unless the business took off which is somewhat unlikely. I started working there on a traineeship and have worked my way up to a wage of $55k, I own my own home, car and have travelled. My partner owns property too but has a lower paying wage and has lower aspirations than me so his wage probably won't increase very much.

I have realised that I need to keep busy in life otherwise my depression overtakes me and everything feels pointless. I spend my spare time studying a double degree (cloud based so I still work full time too), renovating my home (mainly structural), dabbling in two online businesses I have recently established. I also smoke weed several nights a week before sleep which is my only enjoyable down time. My course is going fine and I'm getting high marks. However something feels unsatisfying  about life.. I'm not content, and I want more.  

I have been doing a lot of study lately into science and it's really aligning with my desire for knowledge that has been very prominent lately. I want to learn more than anything, and feel so at awe with the world and just wish I could understand everything there is to understand. I've been particularly interested in Medicine. I never considered that pathway in school although I did study sciences and math. I also never gave myself the opportunity to aim that high. I always felt average in high school and coming from a poor family (still comfortable but just poor financial decisions by my family and lower socioeconomic standing), I felt like I wasn't good enough for a career in Medicine (plus how would I ever afford it with having to be financially independent and support myself).  

Now I have financial independences I have established myself and have a house, a car, and live quite comfortably on my own wage. I feel like I can take a risk and break away from clinging to the ""stability"" and mundanity of life especially life in an office from 9-5 feeling bored and unstimulated majority of the time. 

So should I take a plunge and quit my job, lean on my boyfriend for financial support (we'd be poor but I am used to living poor and have low needs) and study full time? I would also try to pick up a casual/part time job for money to live. My partner earns around 40k a year or thereabouts which is just above the minimum wage for full time work here in Aus. I would need to do a bachelor degree in order to apply for the B. Med &amp; B. Surgery and I think doing nursing would be a better option than finishing my unrelated degree that I'm half way through. Plus nursing has more available work than what I'm studying (I live in a smaller town not a city so there are no jobs in my field here). After the 3 years I'd graduate nursing, then the Med degree takes 4 years then there is residency and so on. So I'd not be earning a full wage for at least 8 years. I would be 31 by then. I could try working as a nurse in between studying Med to get me more money. I also need to consider when I will have children because we are ready to settle down soon (in the next 1-2 years but I want a baby soonish), and we want a few kids. Could I juggle kids and study? He would be a STAHD but then I suppose there would be zero income then except government benefits. But, once I did finish my degree I'd be earning a high wage I'd imagine. So that would make up for the lost time and put us back ahead.

Ultimately I want to study and follow this path because I want to reach my full potential. It's the only way I can see myself being satisfied with myself and my life and feeling like I had gave it my all. We only live once and I want to take every opportunity I can to see what I can achieve. What is there to lose?   

I'd love your analysis on the situation and your opinions or advice. There's so much I feel I could add but I'd make it too identifiable and I'd hate my boss to know I am considering leaving. He is my mentor and I feel I owe him so much for all he has taught me and for all his kindness. Is it selfish to leave a job where I am treated well?

I'll be getting a co-signer and I'm prepared to put more money down but I'm nervous if I'll be able to find any place with my bad credit score.

207,"Last night I was at dinner with a friend and there was a couple seated next to us that were seriously being so awful to the waitress. She brought them their drinks and the guy looked at her and goes ‘this glass is filthy, is there something wrong with your eyesight?’ and made her take them back. Even if the glass was dirty, he could have just pointed that out and asked nicely for a new clean glass. 

Then when they ordered their appetizers, they specifically said they just wanted one order of sweet potato fries, and when the waitress brought out one they got mad at her and said they should have been given two orders, and when the waitress said ‘oh I’m so sorry, i thought you just ordered the one, I’ll go have them make another’ they replied ‘we did only order one but you should’ve brought two to make up for the dirty glasses, we shouldn’t have to ask you to make things right’. They also kept calling her ‘young lady’ very condescendingly. 

So then when their food comes out they call the waitress back a few minutes later and say that it’s cold/inedible, and I watched them, they literally didn’t even take one single bite, just pushed the food around on their plates. At this point you could tell the waitress was getting a little upset but she said she was sorry and offered to bring them something new, and the guy said something like ‘hey don’t act like you’re doing us a favor here, your job is to provide service and so far we’ve gotten none’. And literally shoved the plate into her hands. 

They send their dishes back and she comes back with new ones not long after and they complain about how long it took (it could not have been more than ten minutes for all new dishes). They eat some of their food and then when the waitress comes back to check on them the woman says (I’m quoting her) ‘we need to-go boxes and there had better be a free dessert or a deep discount because you are an extremely poor excuse for a server. Extremely poor’. She kept repeating ‘extremely poor’ and I wanted to go over there and stuff my napkin in her mouth to shut her up. 

My friend and I were literally speechless. We had a different server and we told him what was going on and said we hoped that the couple wouldn’t be given a discount or anything free because they were obviously just trying to antagonize their waitress. Our server thanked us for letting him know and didn’t say much more after that. But now I’m wondering if I should’ve said something directly to the rude couple or spoken to the manager myself, because these people were seriously awful. I am 99% sure they were just trying to get their meal for free, and also 99% sure they made the poor girl cry. 

So Reddit, what do you think, should I call the restaurant today and let the manager know what happened? It’s too late to say anything to the rude couple but if I’m ever in a situation like that again, I should probably speak up, right?  ",19Apr2018,30

Several weeks ago, I received an order confirmation email for an order that I did not place. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but checked my bank account to make sure someone hadn’t stolen my bank account information. No transactions were shown, so I overlooked the incident. However, the same thing happened today with the mysterious email, so I decided to look into it on google and found that it’s a common scam to phish private information from individuals. How would I know if any of my information has been compromised?  When I received the original email, I clicked on the link to view what the ordered product was, but nothing more. Also, how can I better protect against these malicious attempts? Here are the two emails I received. Any advice helps. Thanks

The little girl asked “Grandma, can I please get a milk?” The grandma was too busy playing her state lottery scratchers, and ignored the girl’s repeated question. The girl gave up, and asked her grandpa: “Grandpa, can I please get a milk?” 

All her grandpa said was: “shut up” and pushed her, yes pushed, physically, to get her to put the milk back on the shelf. This was happening as he was buying potato chips for him and his wife.

I briefly cut in and said “you don’t lay your hands on her like that, that’s not okay” 

He just got in my face, and puffed his chest to make his fat ass seem, well, not so fat. He told me that I have no right to tell him what to do with his grandchild.

220,"Hi Reddit.
I'm 19, male, midwest USA.

I've failed repeatedly at most everything I've done. Everyone thinks I graduated high school, but I didn't. I was 1 credit shy of doing so, but my anxiety and depression prevented me from going back. I've been going to community college as ""non-degree seeking"" (still haven't gotten my GED) and have failed 8 classes.
I've only just begun to better my life. The past few years, I've wasted time partying, drinking, doing drugs, etc. I got a DUI because one of my degenerate friends kicked me out of his house when I was gone off of xanax. I have no recollection of the event. (I understand that it is my fault, as I put myself in the position in the first place.)

I work 2 jobs to pay legal fees. I'm doing pretty well, although none of my colleagues know of my legal troubles. I took my 3rd semester of classes but recently failed because I couldn't keep up with the work while working 60 hours a week.
I currently live with my mom and her boyfriend. Dad has never been in the picture. Both parents struggle with addiction. Father has had 4 DUIs and multiple serious drug offenses. Mom drinks often and can't handle her liquor; every weekend sends me close to the edge where I feel like I'm going to snap and do something stupid. She also has 2 DUIs.

My grandfather has been my financial support my whole life. I have a college fund with a good sum of money it. I've wasted some of it away already (albeit not much, given that I've been going to community college). I've lied to him about passing last semester because I know he'd cut ties with me, and I can't lose him when he's the only positive role model I have right now.

I've been practicing good habits recently. It feels like I'm swimming upstream, given that my parents have either failed their whole lives or have been given everything by their parents. They've taught me nothing in regards to success, or maintaining good health. I've gotten in the habit of weightlifting regularly and eating very healthy, in an effort to improve my self-esteem and increase my levels of productivity.

I guess I just need to know I'm not totally fucked. So far, I've just been wasted potential. I know I have potential -- everyone tells me I do. ""You just have to believe in yourself,"" my teachers, peers, and grandparents have all told me. I excelled in school up until I started using drugs to cope with mental illness. I'm deemed ""gifted"" -- doesn't mean much if I don't make anything out of it.

I'm still young at 19, and I have a grasp on what I need to do to keep my head above water, but what now? I want to be a graphic designer. I'm skilled with Photoshop, InDesign, and Premiere Pro; I'm thinking perhaps getting my Bachelors in Fine Arts, and minoring in business/marketing. Is it feasible? ",19Apr2018,2

There was no future for me there due to benefits and salary scale. Also, one of the schools had a lot of behavioral issues and I burnt myself out with that. I really dislike conflict, I can handle it, but it takes a heavy toll.

Followed my passion for sports and landed a sales job with a professional sports team. Not for me, great competitive environment, but sitting all day, low pay, and no family time.

Ended up doing car sales which was ok, again a competitive environment that involves teaching and being around people, but no interest in cars. 

Lastly, currently working sales at a clothing company in the wholesale division. I enjoy it a fair amount, competitive, good pay, and travel, but the company isn’t doing very well at the moment.

226,"So I'm 17 and I attend drama class every week, which I love and get on with everyone there. Prom night is coming up in 2 months and I still have no date so I thought it'd be nice to get to know some of the girls there a little better. I'm not looking for an entirely romantic relationship, just someone nice to bring along.

Anyway, I speak to this one girl who seems nice enough. I text her on Facebook that night and we speak for a little while, she asks for my Snapchat and it seems all is going well until the conversation dies when we start texting over Snapchat. I write it off as her being tired and don't take any notice of it. I send her a text in the morning and it's ignored so this is when I accept that she's just not interested. 

Anyway, the next weekend, I see her again and we do speak so I text her that night and again, we have a conversation, but the problem is, I'm the one asking all the questions so I decide to take it a bit easier and eventually, the conversation dies so I just accept that she's not into me. Around two weeks pass, we have our yearly play which goes fantastically and she texts me saying I was fantastic in the play so I say the same to her. A few days pass and all of a sudden I get a huge text message saying how she's not interested in me, how she partly has a boyfriend and that I've done nothing wrong, but it's just to make things clear. I respond saying that I never really wanted anything romantic and that I was just speaking to her on a friend level, along with an apology for making things seem that way.

227,"Hi all,

First of all sorry if I made any mistake posting here, this is actually the first time I post something on reddit. Also excuse my grammar (or english in general) as this is not my mother tongue.

So, I'll try to be short on this. I am an european guy in my early 30's, I joined the family business 3 ayers ago after 2 years working for a multinational finance firm in a foreign country. It is something I really wanted to do and after college I was lucky enough to get a grant and an internship in this country.

The problem is that my father runs a successful company of about 30 employees. He was not happy when I told him I got that grant and that I was going to work abroad. The truth is that communication between us has never been near good. We get along, it's just we don't talk too much about serious things as he is a bit of a tough guy and pretty strict if you know what I mean. So everytime we skyped or talked always had to remind me about my low salary and how much money I could make with him or even how shitty the weather was where I was living...etc. He always had comments that actually hurted me. He never had good words or showed pride...nothing (I know I should only care about what i think about myself but after all he is my father, he has given me everything to become who I was).

So I left. The day I told my boss I was leaving I felt like I was cutting my wings off....

Nevertheless I came to work with him and took the opportunity withy open arms, I was really motivated to show I could do it very well, but after 2 months I realised this was not what I wanted for me.

Nowadays: So, after not very good 3 years I am still working here but don't feel I am growing personally at all, I'm stuck. Professionally I am, obviously, but I have the feeling I could be growing more where I was. I actually feel a bit empty, like if I am wasting my life doing something I never wanted to do (working systematically 12h per day doesn't help to look for other things to enjoy with or projects or whatever could make me happy). I need to say like a year ago I got a job in that country but when I told my parents they actually told me such an ""ugly"" and personal things that I broke down and rejected the job....

So, it took me some time with a therapist but now I believe I am ready to take the step and move back where I was really happy once and do what i always wanted to do: make my own path, but as many of you probably know this is difficult as hell .This is certainly the most difficult and complicated decision I have had to make in my whole life. It is so emotive, I fucking feel I am leaving the family, not only the business but I guess if you guys have been in my shoes you know what I mean.

The thing is that I wanted to read experiences of people who left the family business and had to deal with all of the stress and emotions that come with this decision. How did you tell them? How did you prepare yourself for such a huge step? How do you see the whole process now that you are out? I know there's a lot of people who has been in my situation but it is hard to find them so I hope I can hear your stories here in Reddit and hopefully this thread could help some others in such situation.

Thanks in advance to all of you who took the time to read this and specially answering.

229,"So I don’t really know where to start, but I know I need to be more of a positive person. My mornings are spent in at least an hour of traffic to drive 21 miles. At work I get the angry customers that drive me nuts and the incompetent ones that drive me just as nuts. And since I work in staffing I can see the most incompetent ones are making more than I do which only adds to my frustration. I struggle to pay my bills and I barely have enough gas to even get to work by the end of each paycheck. I sit next to a girl at work who is INSANELY reactive and judgmental and negative. Then I get to drive the same route, which later in the day takes at least an hour and a half to get home. At home two of my roommates don’t like me and since they’re my bfs friends he spends half his time with them. I feel like when I lived with just my bf and one of us got home, he would greet me with a smile and a kiss and we would talk about our days and have dinner. But finances happen and now that we live with his friends, I get a “hey” and I have to rely on the excitement of my dog as a greeting (which is arguably the best part of every day). 

I guess that part is a little off topic.

But my point is, I try really hard to stay positive but at some point I just get caught in negativity. The longest I can generally make it is until I get home after work, but sometimes even that doesn’t happen. I feel like my negativity is starting to ruin my relationships and it certainly doesn’t help with my fun combo of depression/anxiety/add.

The downside is that it typically drains my energy tons. The only way I'd be able to have interaction without having it drain my energy, is if I'm 100% true to myself; not forcing on a ""happy outgoing social face"".

238,"So, I've been making money doing all sorts of business activity, or services since I was in high school, in the last few years I was doing quite well in arbitraging cryptocurrency (and trading). Till now I've accumulated about $200+k. And I never stop learning about financial management and investment. I always consider myself cautious and wise about spending money, I did not buy luxurious watches or car even though I am a fan of it.

I am from a family with mediocre household income, or maybe a little bit higher than average. My mother's siblings family wasn't doing quite well though, most of them are usually tight with finance and have to budget very carefully. This is the reason why I think my mom always fight with me about how I should spend my money because she feels like ""your siblings are having a hard time, and you shouldn't spend money that way!"" - that's my personal explanation, and I think maybe it's psychologically logical?

So when do we usually got into a fight? I'll give a few examples, not long ago we got into a fight because I'm starting up a new company, and I wanted to spend $1k on logo design, she then argues with me and we ended up not happy.

My idea on spending money is, as long as I have a clear view and plan on financial management, and have active income that able to cover my expenses, I should be spending the money that give me happiness. Afterall I'm living a life with limited of years, I don't want to regret when I am too old to travel but have the money sit in my account. Just to let you know I wasn't don't care about money, I am a student of marketing, but I spend hours online learning investment management, read books from Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, Burton Malkiel, etc. I'm very careful on my money, and constantly learning how to generate more passive income.

I believe a lot, and there's fact cover that too, people doesn't learn about financial investment, and manage them, most people doesn't even know about the power of compounding interest, and think investment is a gamble, all they do is budgeting themself, limit their output, but not increase their input.",19Apr2018,3
239,"I work in a group home for children with mental disabilities. I chose this job because it’s relevant to my line of work and fits in my schedule while I’m finishing school.

Things in the group home have been difficult recently. Our management sucks, we got hit super hard with budget cuts, the children are nasty, pay is shit, and I’ve been miserable for the last two years that I’ve worked here.

Recently we’ve entered a staffing crisis. Everyone is quitting because of how horrible this job is. My coworkers agree that they’ve changed as people due to the stress from this job. To be fully staffed, our community needs to fill about 20 full time day staff. We currently have 9 with two more on the way out by summer. We’ve also lost two managers in the last month. To make things worse, we’ve been barred from taking any time off due to the lack of staff. It feels like we’re being punished for staying.

It’s gotten so bad that my boss confronted me one day as I was pulling out of the driveway to pick a kid up. She asked me if I hated my job, if I was miserable and if I wanted to quit. I was very caught off guard, and felt put on the spot. I told her it was a difficult job but my plan was to stay until I graduate, which it was at the time.  Now my plan is to find a new job and take next semester off. The stress from this job has completely broken me as a human. I’m literally paid (not even a living wage) to be abused by mentally ill children. My boss herself has said that group homes are PTSD, and it’s true. I’m also scared because the stress has made me lose 20lbs and I have a history of eating disorders.

My problem is that I feel incredibly guilty for leaving. Turnover in this job is obscene, and I’ve been senior staff for a long time. I don’t want to sound egotistical but I am very good at my job, which is probably why I’ve lasted as long as I have. I’m afraid of the state the group home will be in once I leave. My particular home will have no staff left. What happens to a group home when there are no more employees? I feel like I’m screwing these kids and my boss over and I can’t get over the guilt. I also worry about leaving the job on bad terms because my boss is expecting me to stay. 

What should I do? Do I have any obligation to stay in this job? How do I stop feeling guilty for leaving? I have no identity outside this job, and I have no idea what else I might do for an occupation.",19Apr2018,1

241,"Ok, it’s gotten to the point where I need some strangers advice. 

Quick summary: Wife and I have a chance to move from our current state (tiny town, sort of backwards, not as in line with our politics and ideals and limited opportunities) to another state and greatly improve our lives and the lives of our kids. It is also closer to MY parents. My wife’s mom lives about a mile from us here. Did all the legwork, flew there and attended job fairs, busted our asses to make this happen. We were all ready to move (both of us had secured new jobs) and on the day we flew back my MIL broke the news that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. So basically all our hard work and months of planning fell through in that instant. But I’m still unsure what to do. 

Now before you label me a monster and say that of course the obvious choice is to stay behind and be there for her during this trying time, here’s the deal: the docs say her tests look good and it should be a simple lumpectomy followed by possibly chemo, possibly not.  They don’t know yet. She may not need it. She is also a HUGE hippy and has told us already that she will 100% refuse chemo and rely solely on cannabinoid oils and other holistic alternatives if they say she needs it. My wife, her daughter, can’t seem to convince her otherwise. 

So I’m morally torn. On the one hand of course I think we need to stay behind and look out for her, be there through her cancer. But her prognosis is good, and if all goes well she should be back to normal by June.  Our jobs don’t start til August. Regardless though there’s a part of me that thinks that since she has a great prognosis, we need to look out for us. Better jobs, better schools for our kids...we can’t put our lives on hold for an uncertainty. We are still in the planning stage, so we have the ability to not do this, but I really don’t want to give up on improving our lives for her.  But my wife wants to stay and take care of her mom. My argument is that I don’t think she will need taking care of! That sounds awful I know, but it’s how I feel. 

Anyone ever been in something similar and what’s your advice?

248,"I met this lady at a New Year’s Eve party through mutual friends and we hit it off pretty well so I asked her out on a date and we’ve been seeing each other every other weekend ever since.

I do like her and really enjoy spending my time with her but I don’t think I’m in love with her - though I’ve never experienced being in love so it’s hard to say. We’re close in age (I’m 30 she’s 29) and in height (she’s almost as tall as I am) and we’ve gotten intimate with each other several times at this point, but after a few dates in the relationship I mentioned that we should share what we’re looking for in a partner.

Her response was along the lines of *“I’m not looking for anything serious, I’m just looking to do dating for now.”* I told her I felt the same way because I more or less do, though personally I would like to find a special someone someday.

I guess my problem is that I rarely get to date anyone in general so now that I have someone that genuinely enjoys my company and whom I share mutual friends with I’m not sure how long I should have it last before we either decide to get serious or break it off. Is it ok to just go with the flow for several months or a year even? Should I wait until I feel compelled to have a discussion?

I am trying to redefine my needs for friendship since I do not have success with friends meeting my needs. I don't get rid of the friends, since they are rare, but I feel let down that my needs are rarely met if ever. Simply put, these are the needs I had.

1. **I need to feel included.**  I often find myself as the odd person out where my friends has their friends and me. I am not allowed to interact around their friends or feel included as just a friend. The separation bothers me.
2.  **I need a friend who is also willing to initiate conversations and wanting to hang out.**  I often find myself as the only side of a friendship willing to start a conversation or ask for a friend to hang out. I like the idea that others want to ask me so it doesn't feel like I am pushing them to do something they don't want.
3.  **I want to talk to my friends and not just about serious issues.**  I want to know my friends well enough to be able to have conversations including random topics that don't carry as much weight as serious issues (although I am willing to listen if they need).
4.  **I need a friend who will tell me how it is.**  I like people who can be honest. I like people who don't have to lie or fake how they feel or think.

So far, most of my friends are unable to provide these needs to be. I understand my needs are selfish and pushy. I am looking to refine my needs so they can be better met by friends both current and, hopefully, future.

EDIT:  I classify someone as a friend after I have known them long enough to trust them and feel they trust me in return.

261,"I am 22 years old and my parents are 49 years old. 

Soooo... I've been into the occult for years and my parents slightly knew. My parents are VERY devout Christians and I was raised in a predominantly Catholic family and community. However, I have, for personal reasons, shifted my beliefs to Luciferianism because it fits my perspective of the world very well.

Years ago, as part of my expression of faith, I sealed a contract with Lucifer signed in blood. My life has been pretty positive and chill after that. I have been enjoying my spiritual relationship with Luce, too! I am carrying this contract wherever I go and it's sealed in an envelope with clear warnings printed that unauthorized people will not understand the contents if opened so they should stay away because I owe them no explanation for whatever they see that they do not understand.

I was waiting for my graduation rites so I went home this summer knowing that I'll be visiting home less often when I start to work... I left my bag in my room and went about my morning. My mom was cleaning the room where I'm staying and for some reason, she opened my bag and pulled out the envelope containing the contract.

She had read only a part of the contract and saw my name written in blood. She then went berserk and repeatedly confronted me about it and telling me, ""Where did I go wrong in raising you?"" and she's praying non-stop...

I tried to explain that I owe her no explanation and that it was her fault for going through my things and she continued to open the envelope despite the clear warnings. She told me that she doesn't care and, ""I did not see it"", despite the fact that she read the contents with smaller prints than the BIG warnings on either side of the envelope.

She was crying and was praying so hard and non-stop, so I offered to let her read the journal I did (especially for these situations) so that she can better understand me and my thoughts, but she wouldn't listen. She was demanding a short explanation, but I couldn't find any short explanation as to why I shifted to Luciferianism because it would be taken out-of-context.

She doesn't talk to me now and I'm afraid she might shut me out for life. I don't want this to happen. She might not even attend my graduation. It felt like her entire perspective of me changed completely - but I am still the person she knew before she saw the contract. She could either forget what she saw or accept me as I am.

Fellow redditors, this situation is new to me. I am asking for help on how to deal with it... T_T

264,"So sorry about this massive novel, and sorry if it's a bit confusing. Go easy on me, I'm not normally much of a meddler, but this is something that weighs really heavily on me. So I have a cousin (M) whom I've always been very close with. She's the oldest of five siblings. A little background on her; she was raised in a very religious home (homeschooled, no TV, music, no wearing pants, cutting hair, piercing ears, etc). They don't really associate with people outside of their church, aside from family.

Several years ago her dad had an affair with a family friend that resulted in a pregnancy. My cousin was about 3 at the time. My cousin's mom gave him an ultimatum; deny paternity or I'll divorce you. He denied the child (B) and while everyone outside of his immediate family knew about it, it was never spoken about. There was zero contact between both parties as far as I know and they cut off members of the family that were particularly close with the family friend. This is around the time that my aunt got the family really involved in the church, I think it was sort of a way for her to limit my uncles contact with the woman or other women in general.

B and I had the same babysitter and we grew up pretty close knit as well. I didn't know she was my cousin until I was about 10, when another aunt told me. I questioned my dad about it and he told me that it's true but that I could never tell M about it. B had apparently always known and after I discovered the secret we became closer. I would tell her about M and her family, show her pictures and report back to her after sleepovers and family events with M. 

As I grew up, I began to resent my Uncle and Aunt a bit. I really love them, as they've always been like a second set of parents to me, but knowing what they did to B and knowing that M and all her siblings lost the chance to know their own flesh and blood while growing up really bothered me. A part of it is that my own mother was an illegitimate child who was never acknowledged by her father. There's a whole side of my family that I'll never know, so I can relate to B in that way. 

When we turned 18, I told M about B. I felt like we were both adults at that point and that if her parents would never tell her, I would. I told her everything I knew and she confronted her mom about it who basically had a full on meltdown and forbade her from contacting B, because it would ""ruin the family"" and to never bring it up again. M backed down and didn't broach the subject again as far as I know. Her dad was never made aware that she knows. She chose not to contact B and while I didn't agree with that decision, I respected her choice and didn't bother her about it. It was only important to me that she at least knew.

We're in our late 20's now and recently M was diagnosed with a pretty serious cancer. I broached the subject one day about her contacting B, before she loses the opportunity to ever do so again. Another concern I had was that her siblings are all mostly grown now and she's never told them about B. She said she had no intention of contacting B or telling her siblings. She said that she feels like her parents did the right thing and that they would have divorced if her father had acknowledged B and that her siblings would probably feel the same way and not want to establish a relationship with her. She implied that B's mom deserved what she got for interfering with her parents marriage. I agreed that it was her choice not to contact B, but that it wasn't up to her to decide if her siblings should know. I said that if they decide not to contact her that's fine, but they at least deserve to know and decide for themselves. She took that as a threat (I never explicitly stated that I would tell, but she was correct in her assumption) and a massive fight ensued in which she told me that this is absolutely none of my business and that if I tell them she'll never forgive me.

This was several months ago. We haven't spoken since then (an all time record for us) and I'm feeling really shitty about the whole situation. I'm worried about her health and wonder if I'm wasting what precious time I have left with her. On the other hand, I feel like I should stick to my principles. Her siblings absolutely should know about B in my opinion and I know that if it's left up to her or her parents, they never will. B wants to know her family, but experience has told her that she's not wanted and can't bring herself to face more rejection on their part. I feel like some the younger siblings might not feel the same way as M, and would take the opportunity to establish a relationship with her if they knew (one sibling in particular is really laid back and open minded and I think she would take to this situation very well); which would just be so amazing for everyone involved. 

Deep down I *know* that I'm meddling and stirring up a bit of drama, but I can't help but feel like it's for a just cause. All of these people are my family and people that I care for so deeply. I just dont think any of this is right and her reasons for denying B and not telling the others just don't cut it as reasonable in my book. I mean at the root of this is one woman's (my aunt's) insecurities and an innocent child who was denied everything she deserved in life. I just can't ignore that.

Idk what I'm really asking advice for. I'm not sure if I'll have the nerve to tell the siblings while my cousin is so vehemently against it, and I'm not sure that I can stick to my guns much longer if it means I have to go without having her in my life. That said, I feel really strongly about this whole thing and I don't know if I'd be able to reconnect with her without resenting her constantly. Should I just remove my big nose from her business? Wash my hands of it all or do what I feel is right? Thanks for reading!",19Apr2018,2

I was going to email him back right now basically saying ""Sounds good, I'm looking forward to starting. However, I'd really like to know what rate you'll be paying me so if you could please let me know asap, it would be much appreciated.""

Is this too pushy? I really don't think so. Also, should I bring up that he offered me $17- $18 in the email? I think that if he offers me $16, I'll tell him sorry, $17 or no go. ",19Apr2018,2

271,"So, lil background, I'm a 17 year old female. I should be at the top of my game, right? I've suffered from anxiety and depression since an extremely young age, but I've never felt as bad as I have in the past few months. My sleeping pattern is extremely messed up, like I slept 15 hours today, from morning into the night. I go long lengths without sleeping and then I sleep a lot. I'm coping, but barely...

So, I'll get into the actual thing. 
I feel like I'm losing my sanity, I feel like I'm becoming a shell of a person.
I struggle to string sentences together, to remember almost anything, concepts that made complete sense to me before I can't get my head around anymore, even now I'm losing touch of what I'm trying to write. I feel like I'm becoming dumber.

I feel like I'm becoming less conscious, less coherent, becoming out of touch with reality. Although I don't have any weird illogical thoughts, I just generally feel like my mind is else where. Like I'm a zombie. Like I'm constantly on drugs (I don't take any medication besides birth control btw).

Mostly I just feel like I'm not all there anymore. I feel like a completely different person to what I was a year ago, like my personality has completely shifted. 
I feel completely empty, but not in the typical depressed way, I literally just feel like part of myself has upped and left. It's difficult to describe. 

My head kinda hurts right now from trying to think and pull together thoughts. I don't know what to do.
I'm going back to a psychologist really soon to talk about these issues but it's really scary and I don't know what to do about it in the mean time...
Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

274,"Less than a month ago I was sleeping in my apartment at 3am in the city, and I heard a loud noise so I look out my window and see that someone has completely smashed into my car. So I go out there and see the driver, seems intoxicated and really stupid, and his car is pinned into mine. I call the police and while we wait for them to arrive he takes off running through an alley way. The police get here, multiple cars, and they search for him with no luck, but he leaves his car and license plate. So they tow his car, and I tow mine to a close by shop. I find out later my car is totaled so I go through insurance process bla bla etc. and I get in the mail today that I have to pay a deductible and they are giving me my cars value. Problem is I was using a Buy here pay here, and they jack up the car price, so the cars value is less than what I still owe them. But I’m wondering why this is about to fall on me to pay for this shit, when we have a license plate for a car that caused the problem. I’m not happy that I am happily sleeping while someone totals my car, and it’s about to cost me money. Have they not track the plate back to someone? A license plate has to have a name on it... I’m getting no updates on the investigation. Who do I call? What do I do? This is ridiculous... do I call my county building where I got my police report? Do I talk to my insurance?

277,"I'm 16, soon 17, and I don't know if I have depression, but I can't really focus on studying and doing the work, that I know is going to be useful for me in the future. I sleep 7\-8 hours and after coming back from school I feel tired and can't focus on the things I set out to do for the day. I'm always thinking about something completely random and very often I am questioning why am I living, then figuring it out and after some time kind of forgetting it completely or just realizing that it wasn't a good enough reason. Also I keep thinking that I am living in a simulation and that every move I make has happened before, so nothing really matters or something like that. It makes me sometimes very sad or very excited in a weird way.

Basically I have only two things that, I think, might be fun working on in the future, but one of them seems really hard \(A.I.\) and the other one seems like a very ordinary thing to do \(it's making games...\). But the good part is, is that I don't really have to choose one now, because they require kind of a similar skill set. Lots of mathematics and programming.

I study, with school included, around 80 hours a week, or at least I try very hard to do that and sometimes I fail, because of the things that I described happening to me. On regular days I have 3 hours of not doing anything and on weekends I have 3\-4 hours, but during the not doing anything time I usually do sports or just read. The reason my schedule is filled with studying is because I have two\-three things that I really have to push hard in order to sort of make it to where I need to get. Basically If I don't get a scholarship I might be screwed, because my family cannot afford it.

So what could be the real reason that I cannot focus, like stick to the schedule and just study the things that I find the most purpose in doing, in the future? What is stopping me from going hard at it? Also am I depressed?

English is my secondary language, so sorry for all the grammar mistakes that I've made.

EDIT: Also I don't study the school things, that much because I get good grades from all of the subjects, but not from my native language class, so that's where I gotta really step it up, because it's the most important thing there is and I'm currently failing. The most I study, by myself, is mathematics and programming \(like 30\-40 hours\).",19Apr2018,4

279,"I'm a 23-year-old man. I just got out of a 6-month relationship recently, which ended due to various incompatibilities (it was mutual, we're still friends). It was the first relationship I've had since high school.

I'm primarily interested in serious relationships. I've tried casual sexual relationships a few times, and it's just not for me. I have OkCupid and Tinder accounts, but almost never get responses from anyone. I put a lot of thought into my first message to a person and try to get them talking about themselves, but it doesn't seem to work.

I don't think I'm bad looking, maybe a 5/10 or 6/10 at worst. I'm also very confident and self-sufficient, but extremely shy and anxious, so I have trouble approaching people on the street, or in a bar or something.

My interests are primarily technology-related things, like video games, programming (my career), electronics (circuits and stuff along those lines), etc. I'm also very into music and play multiple instruments.

I feel like the odds are immensely stacked against me. I'm still doing my best, but it's discouraging to never find anyone. It seems extremely unlikely that I'll ever find a person that I want to be with who also wants to be with me. My standards aren't even particularly high. I pretty much just want to have hobbies in common with them (namely, video games), and I want to be attracted to them.

My life feels completely fine otherwise. I have friends, family, hobbies, a career, long-term and short-term goals, I'm emotionally and financially stable. I don't think any part of my life is lacking besides my love life.

I'm also not by any means an incel, a misogynist, or anything along those lines, and actually hold fairly radical feminist beliefs. I don't blame anyone, including myself, it's just a matter of chance whether or not I meet the right people.

Am I just approaching this wrong? Does anyone have any guidance they can offer me?",19Apr2018,1

Many years ago I was the clown/butt of all the jokes of my friend group.  I was very insecure so I played into it because it got me involved, basically.

My opinion was never really considered and, because I was terrible at arguing and pretty stupid at the time (parents sheltered me too much), I would always make a fool of myself standing up to them.

Fast forward 8 years or so, I am a very different person - confident, sensitive to others’ needs and don’t stand for any bullshit.  I haven’t had a problem with any sort of bullying in a very long time.

Problem is, when I meet up with this group (rarely), the reputation I had still holds up with them and they treat me accordingly, and I cannot seem to shift their view of how they treat me.

Now usually I would just cut people like this out of my life and, for the most part I have - but I have a stag do for one of the better guys that I’m attending and all the others will be there.

How do I deal with the way they treat me so I don’t a) fall into old habits and resume the role however minor and b) react to them in a way that doesn’t cause them all to gang up on me or make me seem overly harsh?

I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 3 months now and we're very happy. I've met his family and get along with them very well, more particularly his brother, as we're both musicians and share a lot more common interests/humour. He's 17, and originally I thought he was a bit weird as he'd message me on Facebook with random meme dumps but I just chalked it up to being a lil quirky. Over time, I got to know the family better and hung around the house a lot. 

I see the brother as just another friend, who I talk to about music, philosophy/politics and joke around with. He seems to think I'm cool, and we message on Facebook fairly often- usually it's just to share memes and music but there's general chat and some off color jokes as well. 

Earlier today, my boyfriend told me he feels weird when his brother messages me. It came as a massive shock to me, because I see him as just another friend and was unaware that it was weird to talk to him over Facebook. I then asked him if he thought his brother liked me romantically, and he said no. I'm very bad at picking up social cues or hints, so his judgement is more accurate than mine I think.

I don't understand the problem. I'm going to stop talking to his brother over social media, but I don't see why I can't be friends with someone who I share interests with and have the same humour as just because he's my boyfriend's brother.

293,"CW Sexual Abuse

I'm unsure how to proceed. I remembered that when I was younger I used to have vivid thoughts about a certain family member and acts I was performing on this family member.

I have one clear as day memory of being in this individuals bed when I was very young in my underwear, seeing him standing in the bathroom urinating, he comes back and I don't remember anything else.

So I remembered recently I used to have these ""fantasies"" of fellating this individual, being under his blanket doing this and having him make me do it. I always thought these were just simple teenage horny thoughts, disturbing as that may sound. But then looking back I don't think I was barely 11 years old, and having these vivid disturbing thoughts seemed really out of place.

It's worth noting my anxiety and depression has always been bad, but I always chocked it up to the verbal and sometimes physical abuse I endured at home; that and an absent mother, and constant bullying at school. But I have always been unusually anxious, I'm a nervous wreck.

My sexuality was fucked up from the start. I don't know where it began, who did or taught me what, but I was disturbed to say the least. I experimented with a family member, nothing extreme but a bit of kissing and grinding, I'm still ashamed of this. In middle school I fellated a boy I barely knew, the Family member caught this and called me faggot for years. It seemed like sex was always on my mind and I never knew why. Another girl assaulted me and other boys when I was 10-12 I forget, but that's unrelated. I slapped a butt once and I am deeply ashamed of having done that.

So now I've got these horrible memories, I'm unsure of whether they were true or some bit of imagination, but they were seriously screwed up early on and I think it's almost laughable to assume nothing happened.

But my question is, should I face this? Or let it go because there's so much uncertainty. I feel like it explains so much of my inner turmoil I've had my whole life.

Thanks for reading.

294,"Maybe that title is a little dramatic.

I'm suffering because I asked my ex-wife questions I should not have, about her dating life - while still being in love with her. I'm asking for advice about heart-break and separation/dating.  

We separated a year and 7 months ago - we've know each other for 20 years, of which we were married 12 years...we're both in our late 30's. During our life together, her libido was just not there. It was hard for me, as a person with a (I'd say) higher than average sex-drive, and I tried to adapt to her, because I love her. Early on, she kept saying that she felt ""A-sexual"" or that it wasn't important...we both continued to try, but she just didn't want to continue or enjoy it. We did lots-and-lots of talking, therapy - but she never talked about what she wanted sexually, only to say ""I just dont like it"". She is bisexual, and before me had a few adventurous encounters. I wanted to continue that in our relationship, where she wanted. But, obviously, she never did. 

As you'd expect, arguments about sex became a large part of our life, which never helps, and pushed that aspect of our personal life farther and farther away. We did have sex a very few times, but it was... I just felt like I was making her do it. After the birth of my daughter, we stopped - that was 6 years ago. For her, our sexual aspect of the marriage was fine...for me, terrible, and it did not bother her.

When we separated, I moved into my own place and eventually began dating. It was good and I never spoke a word to my ex about it, thought she encouraged it to an extent. Other than coordinating off-times for kid-switching we never talked about dating in any large sense - other than about boundaries for our kid. Largely, she was not into dating and had only talked to a few women. My ex concentrated on her work, the kids and other non-dating things.

A month and a half ago, she began dating more frequently - which I knew, and encouraged because I also cared about her and her happiness. But something was definitely different when, while visiting the kids at her house, I noticed a hickey. My heart sank and I couldn't stop looking at it. In a year and half, the thought of her having a *physical relationship* with someone was just gone...I considered it something she didnt want to do. She had all but said ""I dont want to date.""

I made jokes about it, which she joined in on reluctantly. My heart was in my ears, my mouth was dry and I started asking questions...like an idiot. Did a guy do this to you? Do you see him often? What do you talk about? Are you having sex with him? Is it weird for you? She answered them all - I couldn't believe it. It was almost like looking into someone elses private life (I actually guess it was). But that last question...""No, it was amazing. He's 21 - its amazing. You should really lower your age thing on Tinder."" I left feeling like I had stood up too fast. She was having sex and only seeking out sex. 

Let me say this, too: We aren't unattractive people. My ex wife has LONG been a 10, even after having a kid. What is happening with this woman and the kid she's dating is hard for me to understand.

I'm eviscerated. It is like I have a fucking ropes around my chest and heart. I've cried and cried. I cannot stop wanting to ask her questions. I cannot stop thinking about her being with another man, easily and willingly and seeking it out...after our life of her not wanting to. Its hard not to take personally. I do love her, I've always loved her and am very much attracted to her. I'm not sure what to do - we're not going to be together again. I miss my family and home. A year and 7 months away have shown me that I didn't know her. 

I know this is long. This is all just now happening. I don't know what to do. I can't stop it and I'm desperate. I need to hear a hard truth. Something has been missing for 20 years and suddenly its open season for her, with younger guys. ",19Apr2018,4

My room has 2 vents (one cold air return in the upper part of the west wall, and one heating duct in the floor below the windowed north wall), a north-facing window, a closet and door (south facing), and 2 walls. I would like to see about soundproof tiles or anything that can reduce decibels, mostly on the floor, door, and west wall.

I'm on a bit of a tight budget, however I can get more money if I really need it.

299,"My sister for the past couple years, has been extremely distant from my parents and myself in terms of her sharing anything with us. She rarely ever goes to my mom for advice, to talk, to share, etc., and my mom does not understand why. My parents feel like they went wrong somewhere with raising her that has caused her to not want any type of bond with them, but I think its just all in her head.

We've tried everything, i've tried having one-on-one conversations with her about how our parents only care about her/want to know what's going on in her life (I must've had this conversation easily 5 times with her), and that sharing literally ANYTHING with them would be such a help. 
She just argues that ""nothing goes on in her life"" so therefore nothing is worthy enough of sharing. Also, she likes to solve problems ""by herself"", and in doing so shuts out my and my parents' attempts at trying to get any connection with her.

It's honestly hurting my parents to see their daughter not want to confide in them or anything of the sort. My mom is constantly worrying because she has literally zero idea about what's going on in my sister's life. She's been dating her boyfriend for about 8 months now but never shares anything about their relationship with my mom, and her boyfriend is a genuinely quiet, sketchy person (we don't really know how well he treats her). SO my mom is also stuck worrying about how her daughter is doing/what kind of influence her boyfriend is having on her.

If my sister just happens to be in an off mood (we all have those days) and my mom asks whats wrong, and my sister replies with ""nothing"", my mom is left to worry more...because she has no context at all.

We all see her, and we know her well, so when we pick up on anything about her being off but she shares nothing (no matter how hard we push), it leaves US feeling tense and worried and left only to our assumptions. It's incredibly frustrating and its tearing my mom apart.

And now she's all of a sudden wanting to move out of the house with her friend to downtown (ridiculous, she only has a part time job and is in University), but we don't even know if it's because she doesn't like it here, or if she just wants to move out, or if her boyfriend is pushing her to do it, we don't even know.
It's so tiring, and we've tried so much.

We've tried get it across to her to start opening up, by my mom going to her and saying ""we're here, its not good to keep things in"", to just simply asking if she's okay. My parents have tried intervening, saying things like ""its hurting us that you don't share"" to my mom like basically crying infront of her. Nothing works! 

I really don't know what else we can do here but my parents are drained and this is NOT typical of our family. She's clearly the one causing all this tension and this is not like her normal self. No one knows why she's like this though, she won't tell us. And when you try to ask, she gets more mad and says nothing is wrong.

This has been going on for years now and its reached the point where my mom feels that my sister doesn't like her, or our family, or anything. My mom honestly prefers she moves out because seeing my sister this way hurts my mom too much.

I know that a student isn't really qualified to diagnose someone, but I have always had some doubts about it myself, since all the other kids at the group my mom sent me to because she was so convinced of how special I was were actually autistic, and I felt like the only normal person there. I haven't used any of the facilities the university offers to people on the spectrum, and I don't really plan on using them since I don't want to have an unfair advantage of getting an extra hour to take my exams while that might not even be for me.

When I look up how and where to get myself tested though, I need a reference from a psychologist or something, but I just want to take the test without going through so much trouble. Do I see a psychologist just for a reference and get myself tested? If so, what institution should I typically go to? The university offers relatively cheap psychological help, but I'm not sure whether this is a good reason to go there.

TL;DR: I had two different diagnoses as a kid and I want to know whether I'm autistic or not. Who do I see? ",19Apr2018,3

307,"Hi

So two weeks ago I received my long awaited confirmation from the government that my name change has been accepted. And this name change would seem very random to people I know, since my name went from an arabic name, to a nordic name.

The reason for the name change is that I always hated my name, since it can be rhymed with shit, racist, which ofcourse led to nicknames such as ratshit. I also changed my last name due to me being the product of another marriage 20 years ago, and now, since my mom had a child with  her now husband of 10 years ( who I consider as my dad ), I want to join the family and have the same last name as everyone else

But how should I go about it? My classmates don’t know it yet, and I’m kind of the loner in the classroom, so that makes it extra weird. What should I expect?",19Apr2018,5
308,"So I recently found out that my friend is lying to me, at least I'm pretty certain they are. So there was a concert my friend and I had discussed attending together where they live, and the plan loosely seemed to be that I'd be flying out to attend and visit. About two months ago I asked about it because I was going to buy my flight and they told me I couldn't go because they'd be busy with work. This seemed a bit odd since I'd already been there to visit while they were fairly busy with work before, but I took them for their word. I brought up the concert a time or two again to see if anything had changed possibly since I really wanted to go with them. They kept saying they'd still be busy with work so I just left it. Earlier this week I asked them if they'd want to set a time to Skype during the week and they said they had a family member in town so they probably couldn't. Naturally I asked about the family member and he kept telling me stuff about them. Then the other night I was on Facebook and got one of those lovely ""your friends liked this post"" posts on my newsfeed. It was a post from a girl I used to know who was talking about going to the concert and was thanking my friend for taking her. Some backstory about this girl is that we used to be best friends for years before she ghosted me. I had introduced my other friend to her a few months before she ghosted me but they stayed friends after she ghosted me. 

Part of me wants to foolishly wants to believe that he wasn't lying to me, but at this point that doesn't seem to be the case. I'm assuming he's made up these elaborate lies because he wanted her to go the concert with him instead. I won't deny I'm hurt that he took her instead, but I also recognize that it's his choice to take whoever he wants and I respect that. I can't respect him lying to me though. A couple weeks ago we both agreed we wanted us both to be more open and honest with each other, so this is a real slap in the face. 

I'm just wondering how best to call him out on the lie without seeming confrontational or accusatory. I'd really like to discuss it as calmly as possible. ",19Apr2018,5
309,"Could really use some advice / inspiration here.

I finished school in December with a killer resume and a conquer-the-world attitude. I was supposed to have a job lined up working for a former professor. 

January came and the professor was not getting back to me. I wasn't worried, I had some money saved, and I live with my boyfriend who is always more than happy to help cover a few extra expenses (we normally split 50/50 - he works full time in a different industry). I find out that the job is no longer going to work out. Details are irrelevant, but it was no one's fault.

February. I buff up my resume and get several responses back quickly. I'm feeling good. I'm running low on cash, but not out yet. I lean on my credit card because with the rate of response, I'm expecting to be employed soon. That doesn't happen. (For the record, I have industry experience from two internships, and impressive references). A friend almost gets me a job at his company but they announce a hiring freeze the day before my interview.

March. My credit card is maxed. I only paid about a third of the rent. I get a job, only to show up and realize I'm going to be essentially scamming people, and I witness some VERY unprofessional behaviour, so I leave. My motivation is slowly draining. You have to understand, I am a real over-achiever. In school I had a 3.7 GPA, loads of extra-curriculars, and always held down a part-time job (through the school, so couldn't keep it post-graduation). I'm also very extroverted. Now suddenly I'm sitting on my butt all day, accomplishing nothing, on my own. I'm still pumping out resumes like crazy because the few extra dollars I have, I can buy a coffee and sit in a coffee shop to work instead of suffocating in my basement apartment.

April. My boyfriend has to pay all of the rent. I feel horrible about it, but he tells me over and over that he doesn't mind. I see that his wallet is thin now too. My phone bill comes in and I have an anxiety attack. I ask my parents for whatever money they can spare and I get $200 - that immediately gets sucked away by my transit card and my cell phone bill. I am in my apartment seven days a week. I'm getting out less and less resumes because I simply can't find the energy. I get a few calls about jobs here and there, but all of them make it very clear that I am one of many candidates, and none hire me, yet when I have my resume critiqued and practice interviews, the Career Advisor tells me I'm very hireable and just need to be patient. I go for long walks but I'm still isolated. I live pretty far from my friends, so it's hard to even get them to visit, and visiting them always costs money, at least for transit. I miss friends birthdays because I can't afford a meal out. I finally get a part-time job working the take-out counter at a diner, but I'm only working minimum wage 10 hours a week. I can't get another part-time because everywhere I apply wants weekends, which I have already committed to this job. My credit card is maxed and I'm getting calls that they will permanently shut down my card soon. May is approaching and I have absolutely nothing to pay for rent. I have $43 in my bank account. I will also reach my max on my cell phone bill soon and they will turn that off. I'm tired, anxious, and I feel defeated. I have a degree with honours from one of the best schools in the country and can't get a job after four whole months. I am out of ideas and out of energy. 

Thank you for reading this ramble. I appreciate any and all advice. (Except don't tell me to move back in with my parents - Just not an option. Too complicated to explain.)",19Apr2018,9

I've always assumed there are a ton of catfishes on Tinder \(and online dating\).

How successful really is Tinder? Does it really work for relationships? Hookups? Are the girls really straight to the point and that horny like the ones I see on the subreddit?

Roughly 3 hours later, he proceeded to blast really loud music on his car speakers and then started smashing his car front-view windshield and side-view mirrors with a hammer.

I recently went outside to check the vehicle and it appears that a physical lock that was originally placed between the side and front-passenger doors has been broken.

I did want to learn more about the biology of eating disorders but this course is KILLING me. I have lost all motivation. I should also mention that part of my loss of motivation might also be from depression and anxiety. I never had this before. I had my bad days, sure, but now I lost it all.

316,"I'm a 23 year old straight man. I've had perfectly healthy normal sex with women in my life, but it's always been women i've been connected to before we had sex \(women I dated for awhile, or knew for awhile\). I've tried the hookup scene now that i'm single and have my own place, but due to performance anxiety i can never get it going. I'm hard as a rock before the pants come off but as soon as i put a condom on, poof, there it goes. 


I like sex, i don't want to be a ""hookup guy"" but i'd like to be open to a casual encounter with a woman and most importantly to not be nervous the first time i have sex with a new partner \(which was true of the women i dated long term, too\). It's embarrassing.
 

The thing is, i don't want to create a reliance on it. i don't want to feel dependent on it unless i actually physically need it \(which, i mean, i don't know, maybe I do?\).  If I use it the first time, wouldn't I just get nervous the second time, should there be a second time?

I know this may be a performance anxiety issue, I just have heard a lot of different thoughts on this and I'm not sure what to think. I've heard that everyone uses them. I've heard that my problem won't be solved by them. I've heard that it's clear I just am not the kind of person to have casual sex.

I also don't think it's totally performance anxiety, either. When I feel horny enough to masturbate, I'm often not hard. I have to make myself ""ready"" for it. I've lost my erection when I'm literally inside of a woman before, someone who i'm attracted to and comfortable being naked around. There's been times when I've been horny, enjoying sex, and it just kind of faded away. It's weird.

I used to care about self improvement and strive to be better at anything I did. In the past couple of years, I have lost my ability to say no and my ability to truly focus on anything. It's like I stopped caring about anything but good feelings and appeasing others. I feel guilty for losing myself, but I don't feel motivated to change. I don't make informed decisions and I react based almost solely on my emotions. Because of this, I may lose my husband.
My husband and I have been together since high school and have stuck together through a lot of relationship wear and tear, but my personality change is something that is going to break us.

325,"I'm in my eighth semester studying computer science at an Ivy Leage university, taking the last few classes that I will need to graduate.  I've finished all of my computer-related classes and am pretty good at software development (I'm just taking some science and writing distribution classes now). I have a job lined up to start in a few months, and overall I'm satisfied with the direction my life has taken, and I know I'm lucky to be in this position.

The problem is that my mental health has been steadily declining over the past couple years.  I've been diagnosed with a few different mental illnesses, which work together to ensure that either I'm paralized by anxiety or I feel like everything is hopeless and I can't stop crying.  I'm seeing a psychiatrist who keeps prescribing me different medications (currently an antidepressant to take in the morning, a different antidepressant to take at night, a pill to take before exams, and a strong anti-anxiety pill to take when I feel like I'm on the verge of a panic attack), and every time I start a new one I feel dizzy/naseous for a couple weeks while my body gets used to it.

My declining mental health has paralleled a decline in my grades.  I failed one class last semester, and this semester I'm on track to fail two classes that I need to graduate.  There's a chance that I could pass everything if I work really hard for the next few weeks, but I already feel like I'm working as hard as I can all the time and still falling behind.  The stress makes everything so much worse.

I know that I can be a more or less functional human being when I don't have the pressures that the school environment brings.  Last summer I had an internship with the company that I'm going to work for in a couple months, and I got by really well with just a low dose of an antidepressant.  I still had some bad days, but even on those days I could still get through my 9-5 and then get to bed early and take care of myself.  I need to be out of school and back into a lower-stress environment.

I don't know what to do.  My vague plan is that I'll do my best for the rest of the semester so that I only fail 1-2 classes and will be mostly done with my degree.  Then I could go work for the company that has agreed to hire me (they never explicitly said that I need to finish my degree before I start work, although they did say they would do a background check).  I could spend a year at this company, doing software development and also seeing a psychiatrist to work through my issues and find medications that will work for me.  Then I could come back and do one more semester at university, which would be easier because I would only have 1-2 required classes and could fill the rest of my schedule with low-stress stuff.  At that point I would have a degree, some money saved, and job experience, which would put me in a really good place to move forward.

I don't want to go back to school next semester because I would like some time off to work through my issues, and also I've missed financial aid application deadlines for the coming semester since I wasn't planning on returning, and I haven't found any housing.

The biggest obstacle in my plan is that I'm not sure if the company will fire me when/if they find out that I haven't finished my degree, and I don't know how easy it is to find a decent job without a degree.  Do you think I can find a good job?  Should I talk to the company and try to work something out?  What should I do?",19Apr2018,6

As he went into more depth, he said that the femininity which men seek is actually inside themselves, but due to a lack of proper education we have been tricked to look outside of ourselves to seek anyone who represents that femininity. He added that he never needs a relationship, because he is already able to access the feminine part of himself when he enters blissful, mystical states. When I asked how would someone enter these states, he replied that I'd have to travel to his country to get initiated. (The conversation ended at this point).

So I am wondering what the answer is finding love within. I often hear the answer is to think positively and praise yourself, but that isn't deep enough for me. I wish I could be like this man.

332,"So, I have a lot of animosity towards my mom. A brief backstory: My mom and dad raised me, I had a good childhood, always was a daddy's girl tho. I'm 20, my sister is 18, my brother is 7. Our family was OK until my mom became pregnant with my brother. She became very depressed, she felt trapped, etc. She started going out more after my brother was born, got her tubes tied, my dad saw her less and less naturally they started fighting. My mom moved out on her accord, and that's that. The finalized the divorce last year.

My problem is since having my brother, my mother has not been a mother at all. She's regressed into a 16 year old. I've filled in the mother role, which at first was depressing to me; here my mom is, living on her own with no worries and I'm taking care of her son.  She goes on vacations, parties, etc. without us. I've gotten over it and I genuinely enjoy being around my brother, but it pisses me off that my mom doesn't even try to see him or help out. As of right now, she hasn't seen him in a year apart from Christmas when she spent 15 minutes with us and then left to get ""groceries"". Btw my dad is in the picture but he does work a lot, we've been very bad financially and my dad doesn't want to press her for child support or anything because he doesn't want to deal with her. She's very immature and stubborn, she never listens to a word I have to say and talks down to me as if I'm 12.

Anyway, she remembered she had a family earlier this week and invited me and my lil bro to a party. But not my sister because they don't like each other (and my mom doesn't care enough to try to fix that). I hesitantly agreed because I felt bad that she hadn't seen her kids in months, but the more I thought about it I realized she just wanted to show off her to her friends that she's a good mom or something. She didn't want to resolve our issues we had, or hang out just the three of us, she wanted to go to a friend's party. Then today she tells me that a guy friend was going to be with us to take us to the party. I was livid, I told her it's awkward enough that I'm going to be with you at a party when I haven't seen her in months but now you're bringing your ""guy friend""?

We had an argument, she told me that I don't have to be a part of her life but she has a right to see my brother. I tried telling her WHY I feel uncomfortable but she wouldn't let me speak. I told her my brother wouldn't want to go with out me, which is true, because she and my brother aren't close and I knew he would feel uncomfortable seeing her with another man. When I ask him about her, he calls her ""mother"" (I grew up calling her mommy) and says he doesn't want to see her. I told her he's not going and now she's threatening to call the cops on me if I don't take my brother to her door step.

The threat has pissed me off even more so now I'm DEFINITELY not taking him to her, instead I'm taking him to the park and if she wants to call the cops she can. My dad wants to stay out of it because my mom is trying to blame him for me hating her but the truth is, I hate her because she doesn't care about us at all and she spent all my college fund money (that's a different story!) but I've never been able to confront her about it.

So yeah sorry this is long af, I'm pretty much venting but how do I go about this? Should I just let her take my lil bro to the party or should I just hide him from her and hope she goes away?

334,"Hello everyone!! Okay so i start college for the first time in about a month (i start summer semester). I am only taking two classes to start. One will be online and the other M-W 9AM-12PM. I work full time (5-6 days a week) as a CNA on first shift (6AM-2PM). So obviously that would collide with my school schedule. I am unable to work third (nite shift) due to my medicine. Second shift is pretty full already and it would be too much to work 2PM-10PM because i really wouldn’t be able to study. I do need to work full time (somewhere maybe stay here) because i have a few bills to pay and i am paying cash for college so i have to save up for fall semester too. 

I have thought about working at the hospital TH,F,SAT 7AM-7PM. That would be just three days a week and still be considered full time. Which would be ideal at the moment but when i take more classes i might not have 12 hours for three days a week because i might be in classes 5 days a week (my fall schedule is unknown atm). So i don’t want to start there and then have to find a new job in the fall. 

My boss MIGHT work around my schedule if it can fit in their schedule for work (say like work 12 hours the three days i’m off). But, i’m not sure. I’m trying to plan ahead in case that doesn’t work out but i do enjoy where i’m at. 

Obviously i don’t have to stay in my current field as a CNA but i have almost 2 years experience. I could work two part time jobs somewhere at like a restaurant or book store or something but i don’t know if it would pay enough for all my monthly costs. I did look at being a caregiver on caredotcom but there’s nothing in the area in my schedule so,,, i have no clue.

Any and all advice would be awesome. Thank you so much!!!!!! ",19Apr2018,1
336,"I want to start by saying, I love my wife, I love her with all my heart... Without her I'd simply feel no need to exist, which is why this suspicion has me in knots.

&amp;nbsp;

When I first met her, it was through said best friend (now a mutual best friend to us both, and the best man at our wedding).  He had told me, before her and I began dating, that he found her attractive and on several occasions after stated I was ""a lucky guy"" (for having such an attractive spouse).
&amp;nbsp;

They've always been friendly, to an extent that they'll talk and get on like a house on fire, and I'd have no worries of any animosity to deal with.

&amp;nbsp;

Roughly over a year ago, just after we'd gotten married, our circle of friends began having a lot of fun on Snapchat, and eventually became hooked on keeping snapstreaks going.   At a specific milestone, she excitedly revealed to me in casual conversation that he'd sent her what was essentially a nude, but with a sticker just covering any incriminating parts, and she had responded in kind, as if this was nothing to be concerned about.  I told her I was annoyed at the fact they done this, and even though they'd protest ""you couldn't see anything"", in my eyes it was suggestive and I believed they had intent in interest.
&amp;nbsp;

I put this incident out of my mind and thought no more of it (until later, soon to be explained instances).

&amp;nbsp;

Not long after this happened, my wife who was previously against sending me any lecherous images, suddenly began sending me them quite frequently via Snapchat.  Initially I thought this was great, but now in hindsight I can't help but wonder if there was more than just I as a recipient.

&amp;nbsp;

Skipping on a few months, another mutual friend of ours and I had a brief falling out at the time I was putting a lot of work into battling a bad depressive episode, and was not willing to give power to potentially toxic relationships, so I left that friendship on hold until I was better resourced to state my feelings.  In this time, my best friend randomly began asking me was there something up between this mutual friend and I, to which I replied, specifically requesting that if I reveal my feelings and view of the incident that it only be between him and I, as I didn't want any drama to unfold when I wasn't strong enough to deal with it.  He promised that would be the case, and I shared my experience.  Coincidentally, no more than 30mins later, our mutual friend messaged me to clear the air about the incident, and to work out what happened.  Immediately I suspected my trust was breached, so I very politely asked my best friend, had he said anything.  Again, he swore he had only kept it to himself.
&amp;nbsp;

I later found out from my wife that he had indeed gone straight to the mutual friend and told her everything I had said to him in confidence.  I respect that maybe his intentions were good, but the only thing I can take away from this is that I can't trust him anymore for going behind my back, then lying to me outright when I asked him about it afterwards.

&amp;nbsp;

Skip forward again, to only a few months back.  My wife and best friend are now at a stage where they text eachother daily every few hours. This particular Fri night, my wife is visiting her parents in her family home while I remained in our own house, and we're having a conversation via text.  She's in the house alone as her parents had gone out and was drinking, to a fairly tipsy state.  I was feeling a bit of an urge and asked if she'd send me a Snapchat to sort myself out to.  She did, then messaged to say she was going to bed, which I did almost immediately afterwards too.

&amp;nbsp;

When I woke in the morning, I noticed a Snapchat text notification from my best friend sent at about 3am.  When I read it, I could see it was not intended for me, and it was in response to something he'd seen/read that had made him 'horny' so he'd 'have to go to bed'.  I questioned him, obviously concerned about a) who my wife had sent her Snapchat to and b) who he was replying to.  He told me he was drunk, and when he woke in the morning, saw the message and explained that he must have sent it in his sleep without knowing.  I was very skeptical, and never responded like I believed him or not.
&amp;nbsp;

In the meantime, I messaged my wife asking if there was a possibility I wasn't the only person to have received her Snapchat, and she assured me she'd checked it not twice, but 3 times and it was only me getting it.  I told her I was asking because I woke up to a 'very strange Snapchat text from our best friend that morning and I was concerned as to what it was about, not revealing anything he had said, only saying that I was sceptical of his story.  She said he was probably embarrassed he'd sent it to me, and it was nothing to worry about.  I questioned whether she'd spoke to him about it, directly and she said no because she assumed she wasn't supposed to know.  What followed for a few hours later was messages from my wife, being very 'over-caring' about my well-being, saying she was concerned that maybe I was slipping back into a depressive state and she didn't want this to happen, after doing so well, and being happy again.  I make a point of saying this as she isn't usually as mild in her approach, and would normally ask in a more stern tone - ""What's wrong with you?""
&amp;nbsp;

Later that day, my best friend messaged me again (on Snapchat which was odd), saying he had just sobered up and had now realised what happened the night before - he was on a Skype call with a close female friend of his (not my wife), and had gotten very drunk and had to go to bed because he was feeling horny, then somehow while messaging her, accidentally messaged me and was too embarrassed to admit it.  He apologised for lying and said he should never have thought that was a viable thing to do to his best friend.
&amp;nbsp;

This is where I get very conflicted, as I still do not trust him to tell me the truth and he used a very similar reason for acting suspiciously about it, that my wife had suggested to me earlier that day.

&amp;nbsp;

Skip ahead now to present day.  My wife and best friend are texting every hour, or couple of hours and I'm growing increasingly paranoid about what they have to talk about that's kept a chat so interesting that it has become ever going, I on the other hand won't get a text from either of them usually unless I text first, and at that, it's a short stub of an answer that does not carry a conversation on.
&amp;nbsp;

I have overseen my wife texting him, and I've asked in casual conversation who she's texting and she'll lie and say it's another friend of hers.  I've been beside her when she's texting someone and a message will come in from him as a preview at the top of her screen - she immediately dismisses it. Once she has openly replied to the message she was typing at that point, she then moves away from me and/or tilts her phone away from me to angles that aren't even practical, for no other reason than to hide the screen. I can verify each time that she's replying to him as well.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I have explained that the frequency at which the two of them speak makes me paranoid and concerned, and my wife has said I 'have no need to be paranoid' and I'm just 'being silly'.  At the point I said that, I was unfortunately not in a position where I could explain the reasons above adding together to make good cause for paranoia, but now I'm starting to doubt if maybe I am just being silly.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope someone out there has managed to stick with me through this story, and can give me their honest opinion on the whole thing.",19Apr2018,7
337,"Two of my best friends started dating, which is really great, but things are just off now. I’ve written on here about the guy, Jack before. Honestly, Jack and I are really different. We have almost nothing in common, and ever since we stopped smoking weed, it’s like, what do we do when we’re hanging out? On top of this, he’s an ass. I feel so guilty saying this, but the recent times that I’ve left his house, I’ve regretted going in the first place. He talks down on me. Maybe he’s joking, maybe it’s unintentional, I don’t know. 

It all really started when Jack and my other good friend, Amy, started dating. Amy isn’t ever rude to me, not intentionally anyway. But, when I hang out with them, I become less and less involved in their conversations as the night goes on. To specify the way I’m treated when I go to Jack’s, I’ll give some examples: It can really be as small as making fun of my nose and the music I listen to, which normally isn’t that bad, but I’m already the third wheel with them. But, the things that really bother me is how racist they are. Amy knows it bothers me and doesn’t really talk about around me anymore, I’m sure she does without me. Jack is always saying the N word, and I honestly feel like it’s gotten worse since I’ve expressed how it bothers me. Clearly, he doesn’t respect me. Then when I don’t as much, because I’m bothered, I’ll be called a bitch or something. After all of this, Jack will ask me why I don’t come over as often. 

You’re probably wondering why I hang out with them at all. For a couple of reasons: 1. Jack and I have been friends for so long and it’s really hard to just let that go and 2. I don’t have a lot of friends and I don’t want to lose some of the only ones I have. ",19Apr2018,2

I HATE drinking and drunk people, so I don't want anything to do with pubs or bars or anything like that. Most people my age just want to do that, and I fucking hate it.

I'm not really a guy who people would like to be friends with. I have learning difficulties and I have major issues learning things, so I can't talk about history, science, or politics, and my hobbies are ones you do alone. I also hate talking for too long, it makes my head hurt to talk casually, so I need friends who are OK with silence. 

I've looked at meetup and similar sites, and they're all full of much older people and most of them do meetups in and pubs, which I hate. I want friends or a girlfriend my own age and I'm really sad that I'm not good enough to get either. I'm in my 20's and never really had a friend and I'm still a virgin.

341,"This is a very long story....
I am currently taking GCSEs in England, doing the OCR computing course, the course work part of the course (coding) was discredited due to someone leaking the paper. 
Many schools chose to still do the course work but without the limitations (e.g allowing students to collaborate and look up problems) mine was one of them....

After completing the course work and handing it in I had discovered that someone I sent my code to, to help them resolve a problem, had sent my hard work to someone else. Who ever this person is had the audacity to send in my work completely unedited with my comments and exact spelling mistakes.

I didn’t think of it much until today when I was called to see my teacher who, to make this less long winded, basically said that I would have to spend a Sunday at school for 7-10 hours rewriting my code. Understandably, this to me is not an option, I have exams right around the corner I need to prepare for and I simply don’t have the time.

As the work is sent into be moderated the school can’t submit two identical pieces of work so something has to be done, their solution is to make both of us redo it, however I am not at fault and am still being punished.

Any advice would be so helpful even if it’s just to destress me, thank you!

P.S this has currently only been back and forth with the teacher and no other staff, I am debating taking it higher however I don’t want to worry about it/ end up with higher up staff disagreeing with me and making the matter worse.",19Apr2018,1
342,"So, story time. First, sorry for the editing as I am doing this on mobile.

I am 14. I just had a Sunday football match against another team (for the sake of privacy). On the way home, I get a call from (A)'s grandfather, who had taken him to the match and back. Apparently, one of the opposition's parents blocked them from passing using their car, got out, walked over to (a)'s car and opened the door. This kid's PARENT started giving this poor kid (a) Abbas, saying that he was going to smash his face in and calling him a plethora of things that I do not wish to share. 

So we (me and my dad, my dad runs the team) Hear word of this, and advise to go to the police about it, my dad speaks with someone high up in the children's FA and they agree.

Back story: the opposition was a rough bunch and were very aggressive towards us as a team (you know people who are like that) To the point where the referee had to red card their midfield for swearing at one of our parents and then at the referee. And that's like barely ever happens.

And also, (a) Was not aggressive towards any of the opposition. It seems like there was no reason for this kid to be annoyed with him

So I get in touch with (a) And he is not sure hitherto ring the police. I understand that if he does and something goes wrong, there may be repercussions for him, but if it does work out then that is good for everyone. What should I say?

TL;DR after a scrappy game of football, one of the opposition blocks off my friend and gives him racial abuse, for no apparent reason. Should I tell them to go ring the police? Is there anything I can do to help?

343,"About a year ago, I messed up a friendship with an awesome person. Now I look back on it, I was struggling with mental illness and seeing everyone as an enemy. I've had treatment since then, and can see the situation much more clearly.

My tightknit friend group was drifting apart, and the last and longest standing member ended up having a messy fight with me over them not telling me they were LGBTQ+, despite coming out to over 400 people on Facebook. It was a stupid fight, and I could have done a lot of things better.

Recently, I found out this former friend got thrown out of their parents' home. They're very conservative Muslims and she was caught dating a guy. She's been placed in safe housing. I'm extremely worried about her.

I've thought about sending her a card to apologise for my actions and offer her support, but I'm worried about being turned away even further, or exacerbating the situation.

Since last year and losing this friend, I've been desperately lonely. I've dropped out of school and lost my last IRL friendship after my friend group fell apart, albeit with a toxic individual. Losing my longest friend, however,  has left such a hole in my life, but I worry they might not want me to come back into theirs.

346,"Hi there... community? Any help would be greatly appreciated &lt;3


Without going into too much detail, I'm in my mid 20s, I've been out of work for 4 years with some intermittent working here and there through family connections.


I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder &amp; anxiety and currently have another physical medical condition present that interferes with daily activities/ability to function normally without being emotionally stressed at every moment.


Yet, I've hit a point in my life where I realize I have no choice but to move forward (other option being stagnant and slumping into decline forever). My next required step is to get the ball moving slowly... but I need some advice with how I should build a resume/cover letter, whether or not I should reveal details about my mental health issues, etc.


Prior to leaving work, my work record and relationship with all my employers were upstanding. Almost always 10-15 minutes early or on time at the very least. Didn't slack and put in as much effort as I could. The problem is the gap between the time that I worked and where I am now.


My work experience is quite minimal in terms of ""climbing up the ladder"" though. I worked as a cashier @ mcdonalds for a year, as a retailer for a couple years, I've done administrative stuff, did my apprenticeship and 1st level trade... but that's about it.


The job I'm looking for is a simple one that's local and quite ""homy"" if you know what I mean. They've had a HELP wanted sign for awhile now and 2/4 of the positions seem doable. I'm prepared to put in extra time if I have to, to learn the shit I need to do and do it properly in the case that I'm too ""slow"".


My fear is that I no longer have as much confidence in my ability to perform at work in comparison to before. Even with my insecurities, I always flipped a switch when I was at work. I knew I was semi-competent, enough to not fuck around and to put in an earnest effort. Now though, I'm scared shitless inside.



Lastly, my current responsibilities may or may not contribute positively, but here goes nothing... I get enough money currently to just cover rent, utilities and eating a meal or 1 1/2 meals a day. It worked out anyways because I didn't feel like eating, stomach shrunk, then I didn't need to eat much even if I wanted to. I do live on my own and have had roommates who helped pay half the bills, but that is no longer the case and isn't a viable option for me in terms of my faintest wishes to move forward.


I pretty much do ""traditional"" housework. Cooking, cleaning, laundry (I've been getting better I swear), etc. In the past year specifically, my minimal progress has been the upkeep of my apartment so it looks nice &amp; tidy whereas before it was somewhat of a shithole (although still nowhere near as bad as a lot of places somehow). 




I think that's it for now... Ended up being much longer than I wanted to ._.""

347,"So I just broke up with my fiance of 2 years. We were trying to remain on good terms until one night he asked me to procure some Xanax (I don't do it myself, but he figured out I had been stealing it from his personal supply so I could cut down on how much he was taking, using, etc). I refused to and he blew up at me. Said that I was never there for him, (I called him the previous night to talk but he ignored me completely), called me a lying, cheating piece of shit. (the only thing I lied to him about was being happy in the relationship until I couldn't lie anymore and things broke off from there, I NEVER once cheated on him, the cheating he was referring to was emotional, when I missed the friends I cut out of my life for him, one that i had happened to date for a month almost 9 years ago). He had been possessive, and rough with me at times. Had me turn away from my family and friends so my life just revolved around only him.  There was a lot there and I wasn't happy so I had to leave.
He was able to procure the Xanax anyway. He likes to drink and drive. He's admitted to taking a Xanax pill a patient had returned that was supposed to be disposed of. He's taken it before driving so he's almost passed out on the road. I want to turn him in before he hurts someone. But my thing is, it's all hear-say. Also, if I DO call his place of employment, he will know that it was me and with his violent temper, might go looking for me to retaliate. I don't like the thought of him, especially in his current emotional state, drugged up or drunk, out in the world. He's going to hurt someone, either himself or one of his patients. It hasn't happened yet, but I feel like its in the horizon. I don't have solid evidence against him since I didn't think at the time to record our conversations. What should I do?

353,"(please help me and bear with me)

Here is my roommate story and I am going to leave this up to you to judge: I have been struggling with this for some time. I live with three other roommates, all of us international, all of us are upper years but this year we got placed with a first year. (she is considered a first year but she is actually 21)

when this first year came in (lets call her El) we knew she would have a cultural shock because we are from the same culture and we knew they placed her with us in the first place because we would ""understand"" her. so everyone of us was and still is completely understanding...

first time we four sat together for the house roles agreement and alcohol and having pre-gaming was brought up, she just completely said NO. i thought reasonable but lets talk about it, she just literally said ""i do not want to see the sight of one single drink in the entire suit"" so since we drink every a few months in the dorm we said well (and not in a crazy way i swear) lets compromise, so we said on the agreement that we would not allow a sight of a drink in the common room of the suit and we would drink outside or inside our rooms, she kept rejecting that but then none of us wanted to be told to not drink inside our rooms so that was the compromise.

then she said she does not want a single guy presence in the dorm meaning that not a single guy is allowed to walk in the dorm, we said hold on one of us has a boyfriend, instead of saying ""no"" completely to a guy stepping a foot in the suit, how about we inform each other if we are to bring a boy over? she kept saying i do not know i want to ask my parents. so the compromise was that we have to inform everyone before we bring any guy over to the dorm. we also agreed on quiet hours and what i mean by quiet hours is that no one is in the common room but in their rooms, so we agreed 11pm in weekdays and 1/2am in the weekends days, meaning that at 2am expect us to be returning from off campus event or party and eating and briefly chatting in the kitchen (not screaming or doing anything loud)-we all agreed

However, since that agreement, she threw it in the trash and just started to control the dorm's in and outs as she would like. she would give me shit and furiously text me when a guy would (just) knock on the door to get food, medicine or a book from me or my other roommates saying that she is uncomfortable and she wants the guy out (Although the guy would be only asking for food/medicine/a book) and making a small conversation and then leaving (i can't predict when my guy friends are going to come over and ask for stuff/books and therefore can't text anyone that they are coming up) --- i have to mention that i myself do not bring many guys over and i do not have many guy friends so i dont even bring guys over night or something like that...then i thought the issue was only with guys.. but no.. she started asking my girl friends to leave the dorm.. everytime I or my other roommates bring over female friends, she would furiously text us to ask them leave..

i swear to god that one time i just opened the door for two of my females friends before they even stepped in the dorm common room she furiously texted me to ask them to leave... and when we do bring our female friends, most of the time we sit inside our rooms not in the common room (and i dont think there is any problem in sitting in the common room).. a few times when we were chatting in the common room, she actually came out and kicked my friends out (they were all females) and it was early in the evening (wasn't even 8pm yet).. so most of my friends stopped wanting to come hang out in my room because they do not want to be told to leave. and she gives no reason for why she wants everyone out. (the dorm is a suit that has 4 single bedrooms with a common room and a bathroom and a kitchen)...

lately, she has been instructing me to leave the common room and go inside my room or leave the dorm to chat with my -other roommate- (who lives in the same suit) she would literally ask us to go outside or go inside to chat (and again it would not be even late)... we are very quiet dorm 99.99% of the time, we do party although not inside the suit every a few weeks and sometimes every a few months (we only dress up and do makeup and play nice music and that is what we call ""pre-gaming"" and then we leave the dorm to the event/party and do not come back until its late and then we sleep (on the weekends).

i have been feeling like i am being chocked and lately her demands have been only going up and up (i swear that on this friday it was 8pm and i was in front of my room's door talking to my other roommate who was inside the bathroom and she asked me to go talk inside my room and close the door) we were not even laughing or talking loudly we were just chatting about our day..(and my room is in the opposite direction of El's room). i tried to understand that she is from a different culture but i also am from the same culture and we do not behave like that plus she has been only asking stuff from us and all sorts of demands but she does not care about when she makes us uncomfortable... i dont wanna mention everything she says and does.. but she really says very judgmental things to me because i live and go places on my own and i don't involve my parents in my life and because i am not religious. she treats me like i am a complete idiot sometimes and preaches on me often",19Apr2018,1

But, as the cliche goes, this is the first time I have ever felt this way about a girl. We have never met, though we pass by each other a lot around campus and occasionally do the typical 'hello' and smile whilst walking passed each other.

I have constantly been gnawing myself to ask her out whenever I pass by her. I have it all planned -
We would walk by eachother and I stop to say hello. I would then say something along the lines of: ""hey, this might sound crazy and a little straight forward(it's actually very straight forward) but I was wondering if you wanted to go out some time? I saw you around campus and I thought you look very pretty and I would love to get to know you better.""
This plan seems fairly easy. I mean, if she says no, then no hard feelings and I can move on, and if she says yes, great!

There have been so many opportunities for me to have asked her, I'm talking about perfect times. We would pass by each other with no one around, which would have lessened any embarrassment. And there have been times where she was alone and I could've just walked up to her. But every time I am in those moments I just chicken out and avoid her. Then feel disappointed that I didn't ask her, then build my confidence to ask her the next time we see eachother, promising myself to not chicken out. And then I chicken out again.
I have never asked out anyone before. How do I get over this and just simply ask her? Im not really sure if I am just not confident enough or am actually afraid of rejection, even though I like to tell myself that I am not.

Need some advice... Or just send cupid. ",19Apr2018,1
356,"Hi! I'm a college senior who lives with two other seniors (M and J) and a freshman girl (A). Until December, A's sister (E) lived with us and then she graduated and moved out. 

Our lease started in August and is ending at the end of July. However, since three of us are graduating, we're all moving out earlier than that. M and J are moving out at the beginning of May and I'm moving out at the end. A will be there all summer. So here's my question - are we expected to pay utilities for the entire summer even though we won't be there after May? My mom says no, and that does seem to be in line with the precedent that's been set. E hasn't paid utilities since she moved out, and when M and J moved in, they moved in much later than us, so we only made them pay a portion of the bills for that month. I feel like it's a dick move to make A pay the entire two months by herself, however, that does seem to be the standard that's been set before.

Also, I'm not financially independent, and can't pay the utilities without my parents' help, so regardless, it really is up to my mom. But what's the standard here? It's not in our lease, but I don't want to totally fuck her over. J is on the same page as I am and I haven't talked to M about it.",19Apr2018,1
357,Hi. I screwed up in high school and failed all of my classes. I didnt go to college and instead immediately went to work. I currently make 50k.I want to go to college so I can get a good job and start a family. Time is moving very quickly. Im currently a freshman at a low level community college. Is there any chance of advancing? Im currently studying finance. Is it a waste of time since im in a bad school? Is it a waste for me to go to college at all?,19Apr2018,1
358,"So I'm going to start off by saying that I don't think he meant it in a bad way, and I love him very much. Nonetheless I was really hurt by it, and it continues to effect my self esteem.

Basically he commented on how my breasts were saggy, and told me there was a condition related to it. Even casually suggested plastic surgery to correct it if I wanted to. I told him that I didn't believe in plastic surgery, and we had a long debate as to when plastic surgery was 'ok'. For example, having one boob removed due to cancer, or being born with a cleft palate. This just made me think he was comparing my breasts to a very noticeable deformity and now I can't help but feel disgusted with myself.

The whole thing really just blew me away, especially since i've been in eating disorder treatment for 3 months and have struggled with body image issues for years. I never even noticed that they were saggy, but now I do and even looking at boobs that aren't make me cry because in my mind I think they are more attractive to him. 

He feels bad about what he said, and he tries to reassure me that he doesn't care and that he is still attracted to me, but I just can't believe it right now.

Any advice on not to feel horrible about myself over this? How do I stop feeling bitter than he basically created a new insecurity for me on top of all my other ones? How do I let this insecurity not effect our relationship?",19Apr2018,1
359,"15m here, i often see a random girl i really would like to talk to (like someone with cool hair, im a sucker for dyed hair) but never do because its too weird and awkward.



How do i start a conversation without it being weird?



I have couple of ideas in mind



1: ask for directions and try to work out a convo from there



2: be random and shit, something to make her laugh and get her attention and make sure she knows ur not serious, like picking up girls with trebuche facts video and work it out from there or just say ""i liked you and just wanted to talk to you, whats ur name?""



3: approach her and say hey ur attractive, can i have ur number? (Which is fucking weird in my opinion)



4: for example if she has dyed hair, i just stop her, tell her i like her hair/shirt (if its merch of a band i like or smtn)/ something else, ask whats her name and work it out from there



What do you guys/grils think? Which one is best?",19Apr2018,1
360,"To get home from school, I have four options: having someone drive me, walking, taking the bus or taking Uber. 

If I take the bus, it takes me 30 mins to get home, not saying that I have to wait for the bus as it leaves every 30 mins on weekdays before 6:30pm (no bus on weekends). If i walk, it takes me 50 mins, too long. I tried a few times and I am done with it. If I take Uber, it costs lots of money and I would rather walk. Anyway, if someone drives me, it only takes about 7 mins.

At first, my host parents would drive me everyday after school. Then they stop driving and ask me to take the bus, even when they are free. Sometimes I got home and they are doing nothing but watching TV. I know I shouldn't complaint about them not driving me but obviously it's much faster (15 mins both ways) and they don't do it free, I pay to get here, study and live.

I thought it was fine so i agree with them to walk (it has been a few months). But the thing is that I intend to take a job after school, which means I will be home late (around 7:30pm) and there is no bus. I can't walk 50 mins or pay tons of money for Uber everyday from then. 

Should I ask them to drive me home? If yes, how should I say?",19Apr2018,1
362,"Well to start my moms a narcissist and bipolar who constantly bullies me (sometimes she's nice but other times she keeps saying "" I wish you die"")but that's another issue as I've gotten use to it. 

The main problem is my 28 year old brother who lives at home and can't keep a job. He always tells me how I'm useless etc, sometimes hits me aswell but I don't really care about that as he definitely has some anger issues, I had to call the police on him when I was 12 as he went crazy and locked me and my parents in a room (having a crazy mom pushes him over the edge a lot).  

The main issue is he thinks he's my dad and gets mad when I say stuff that upsets him because I'm not perfect and can't control my mouth when he goes off on me every time, he's just so hypocritical it's funny.  For example he took me on a car ride and was yelling at me for 30 minutes on how useless I am and how my ""whole life's an excuse"" and I had enough and said something back and then he slapped me and said what right do you have to talk and went on about how he took care of me when I was a baby.

Anyways I received and Xbox for my birthday a few years ago and have bought everything else for it myself ( the games, new controller, live).  He's been playing on my Xbox all day now and whenever I ask to play on it he threatens to take it away. (He's taken my phone which I need for school because I don't have a laptop on numerous occasions).  

We're also moving houses soon because we can't afford rent here anymore after 5 years and when I told him I wanted to put the Xbox in my room he got all mad and said no that's not happening. Today I got home and went straight to basketball practice and he was on the Xbox all day and he asked my mom (who doesn't have any money and hasn't given me lunch money in a month) for 40$ to buy his friend food because he bought it for him last week. [Keep in mind this is the guy who had a spaz attack on me because I asked for a 2$ slice of pizza cause we had no food at home and then went on about how he can't even afford gas and to pay for his car( he bought a $50k sports car)]. I told him if he doesn't let me on the Xbox in half and hour I'd get a lock for my room and put it in there in the new house, he got pissed and said he'll take away my Xbox then ""what can you do"". I just went to my room.

Sorry for blabbing about the other stuff I've just wanted a place to vent for a while as I've kept it to myself forever.  I have an idea on what to do with the other stuff (as soon as I turn 18 I move out with my dad somewhere as he's done so much for everyone and just gets shit from my mom in return and I feel so bad for him but I'm currently lost on this Xbox situation. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks if you've read this far sorry for going on so long, if you have any questions about anything else I'd be glad to answer.",19Apr2018,1
363,"I recently graduated with a bachelors degree in Linguistics. Growing up, I always knew what I wanted to do for my career and I had no hesitation whatsoever because I knew I had some sort of talent with languages so I decided to go along with it. With the degree, I wanted to approach a career that involved translating or interpreting for English, Chinese, and Korean. However, it's been almost a year since I graduated and I cannot seem to find a job that will take me anywhere. I've applied for interpreting jobs, translating jobs, office jobs, small companies, part\-time jobs, and I still have no luck. I've had fights with my parents whether or not I should go back to school because of this. After countless arguments, I feel like the main reason why I can't land an interview/job is because it turns out doing what I like does not necessarily mean I'm good at it.  At this point, I really don't know what to do in life and I feel hopeless.

TLDR; I graduated with a Linguistics degree but I can't find a job because I'm not good at what I want to do. Should I just find something else to major or go back to school?",19Apr2018,1
366,"So my school has a program for film scoring, and I'm taking courses for it right now. Basically my problem is, is that I am just unable to write any music right now. I used to love writing music, and now it's just become a chore and I can't even find any motivation to do it. I can't for the life of me write something I'm satisfied for these two projects that are already late and it's starting to freak me out. This has been a problem for about the past year, but I don't want to take a break since I'm so close to graduating. I've had issues with depression in the past, and I think I can feel it starting to emerge again, for all I know it can be why I'm feeling like this. Everything is starting to annoy me, even small things like my phone going off make me really pissed off because I can't keep focus on what I need to do. 
I'm planning on talking to one of my professors about it tomorrow.

I am also financially unstable I can't seem to manage my money or do as well at work. I have been accepted into a PTA program and it makes me nervous that I won't be able to do well or complete the program due to everything going on like the divorce needing to be there for my child and paying off my debt while working. I don't know if I should start the program or skip it and work to pay off my current debt / divorce fees that will arise.,19Apr2018,1
368,"I am writing this emotionally drained. I work in a Safeway deli (not my dream job but for the time being I can't find anything else). I get unpredictable hours and I bust my ass at work for very little pay/respect. I get it, I'm young. But I am tired and sometimes I feel like I never get to have fun. My bosses push me extremely hard and I feel that I try my best. I don't know why I take their criticism so seriously. But when I am in trouble at work I feel so anxious and upset. Sometimes I feel like they take advantage of my low self esteem.

On top of that I can't stop emotionally investing in my coworkers. I am constantly trying so hard to keep relations good between me and my coworkers, and when they try to take advantage of me I take it very personally. If I don't feel like I'm on good terms with a co-worker it hurts me and I think about it constantly until I make it right. I think about their personal lives and if they are doing ok. I worry.

Sometimes I feel like my over emotion actually ruins all my hard work and relationships. The stress ends up making me mess up in the end. How do I stop being so sensitive about work and coworkers? I feel broken.",19Apr2018,1

Basically, I was diagnosed with like a manic personality disorder, anxiety , depression, the whole shabazz, so things in my family have been lowkey tense.
I’m kinda not allowed to yell, or get angry, or get nervous, because every time I do, they ask if I take my pills, .
Hell, sometimes my sister locks me out of of our room( we’re kinda broke) and that pisses me off so much, 
She can pretty much yell and so can my mom and so can my little sisters for obvious reasons, but I can’t and I’ so frustrated and I just. I just wanna know how to deal.

370,"A super nice guy I worked with just posted something on fb saying stuff about 'how he will never find a girl' then in the comments he goes on to elaborate some more sad sounding things, like his grandpa died he wishes he was alive because he was the only one who gave a shit and his hours are getting cut back at work he could barely pay his rent. 

We talked at work he knows I'm married and we were never flirty. I always found him to be very kind and polite and easy to talk to. He is one of those people who are just so so nice but a little bit socially awkward. Like myself so I just really feel for him and how sad he is.  

Because the post is about him being sad girls seem to ignore him I'm hesitant to comment just because I don't want to give off the wrong vibe and make it weird. Also I never interact with him I quit the place he works at like almost half a year ago. 

What I was thinking of posting says along the lines 

Hi soandso I'm sad to hear your sad. Working with you I saw that you are a gem of a person. I admired your kindness and the way you treated others. I hope good things come your way friend.

371,"I’m a 16 year old and both of my parents are alcoholics. They are possibly on other drugs too. I’ve reached out to extended family and adult family friends and let them know. Some are very on the ball about trying to get this resolved and some are going about the wrong way to get involved. Regardless, I am basically a babysitter for my family and the only voice of reason and after my mom had an outburst at 10:00 or so the other night saying my dad hit her, I wasn’t getting involved and got an extended family member to pick me up. To sum this whole thing up without boring anyone about this increasingly sad and seemingly hopeless situation, my parents are both mentally unwell (frequently rewriting history in their head and manipulating conversations to avoid what’s going on as well as straight up lying at times), it’s affecting my ability to focus and help myself (my grades are suffering along with a horrible brain fog) and my two sisters have their own array of problems as a result (anorexia, having to be medicated, etc). They are gone “playing tennis” for most of the day and come home almost always drunk. The bottom line is that I don’t feel psychologically well and at times physically safe in that house. Its a real possibility one of my physically weak parents will attack me (something that’s happened before that I unfortunately have no evidence of and that was able to be diffused before anyone got really hurt) and I will be forced to defend myself. I’m trying to just emancipate myself to leave in my grandmothers back house (she’s approved) yet my parents can zone in on a conversation and a genuinely incapable of doing so. Who do I talk to about pursuing this goal to help myself? This is an alcohol drenched unstable environment for me and everyone in that household. I can’t let this ruin my life in the future. If I call child protective services, I feel like they are just going to have to legally side with my parents since they are my incompetent “legal guardians”. Could they both be admitted? Who do I talk to about genuinely getting things done for my well being along (possibly with my sisters too). My parents truly do lack and credibility besides they legally “own me” as they would say. 

I have videos and stuff of my mom and dad along with recordings of these conversations go down. I have a myriad of people to call to confirm what I’m saying along with my sisters who are too mentally unwell, intellectually weak, and in the depths of denial to truly articulate how severe the situation is for everyone’s well being. If I am able to achieve reaching out to someone, could they just sit down with all three of us (parents &amp; me) and get a feel for the lies, manipulation, and coverups at play along with maybe just drug testing them and give me clearance to live on my grandmothers property with the help of extended family and friends with support or are they just stupid government workers who would make me even regret contacting them? Is there a way in which I can have a lengthy conversation with one of these workers who will be comforting and realize how detrimental this is. ",19Apr2018,1
372,"A good (former?) friend of mine went ape-shit after a party last night and said really mean and nasty things to (and about) the people who care about him the most. He did this via text and facebook messages, and made quite clear that he doesn't want to see any one of us ever again because we are awful human beings with huge egos and yada yada - and after some of the more hurtful things he said, many of us don't really want to talk to him either atm. Recently he's been drinking from when he wakes up until he passes out, lashing out at people for minor (often imagined) offences and talking shit about everyone around him - last night was all of this times  fifteen, and he kind of burned some bridges. I care about him greatly but have no interest in talking to him or seeing him right now.

373,"So this semester starting from the month of march for the first time I live with someone I don't know. When he came to my room, he introduced himself and he seemed that like a ~~nice guy~~ . Our semester will end at June 9th and I won't have to see his face again. Now here I want to talk problems that I am facing with him because he is being annoying about a lot of things.

1. Of course as a first time I have to live with someone I had my share of bad habits and I usually repeat them but when he tells me I clean it up immediately like I don't clean up after myself, for example I usually throw away clothes everywhere but now I am way better, now I clean up after myself but when he used to find things out of place he gets really angry because it happened more than once because it was a habit I know I am at fault here but he doesn't need to get that angry which doesn't help at all.
2. This is the part where I think there will be a fist fight over if not solved I sleep in the normal human hours at night and wake up at day like normal human beings and if you will live with someone then that should be an unspoken rule, but no, he opens the phone doesn't want to decrease the brightness and he is using a broken laptop where the sound of the fan is heard and many times I told him you are being too noisy for the eyes and the ears because his phone and the lamp desk that we both have is VERY bright no matter what angle you are trying to turn it away from and his response is ""This is my room I can do whatever I want"" he is not even trying to respect that he lives with someone

In conclusion, I have proved that I am trying to fix my mistakes and bad habits as much as possible. I have everything that is annoying to him about what I do written in a piece of paper, but he is not trying to respect my requests and I tell him that he is creating disturbance for the ears and the eyes but doesn't respond to what is considered an unspoken rule where you study during the day and sleep during the night and he responds with anything that I do wrong in an aggressive way.

Edit: I just don't know how to deal with someone as thick headed as he is",19Apr2018,1
