0,"So I've recently started a diet, which consists of mostly fruits,  vegetables and meat, totalling between 1000 and 1500 calories.  I'm a 20 yr old female, 6'5 at 132lbs.  Over just the summer I gained about 10lbs, and none of my clothes fit anymore( I don't really have the money to empty and refill my closet).  I really just want to get back to what I was a year ago, about 117ish.  I felt healthier then and I was happier with how I looked and felt in my clothes.  The problem is that when I'm eating around my friends, they make comments and when I explain what I'm doing, they act like I'm doing something bad to my body.  Does this really seem extreme? How should I respond to what seems like diet shaming?",08Sep2018,1
2,"When she found out I denied it.. because we were never exclusive, but when I asked her “okay what if I was hooking up with another girl?” She responds with “it is what it is.. I just needed to know” and she left.

6 months later, I add her on Snapchat &amp; I tried telling her how bad I felt for how things ended and I still denied her accusations of me seeing someone else and she said “I would’ve respected it more if you just told the truth.” I wanted to meet up with her to talk things out and she said “No, sorry. I don’t go backwards.”

It was her birthday yesterday and I texted her telling her I got her a bday present and to let me know if she wants it. She said “I’m not falling for your boobie trap.”

What is she talking about? Should I keep pursuing her?

3,"Been pretty burned out, on the 2nd week of a breakup which I’m not devastated about but definitely bums me out, friends have been either letting me down or just very wrapped up in new relationships right now and I feel unmotivated to do work hard at my degree while dealing with it.

5,"I'm 24. I've been depressed all my life.

Was picked on and teased through out school. Never had friends.

I am a virgin and have never been in a relationship.

I used to touch women inappropriately on buses and crowded places. I quit doing that. But the guilt and shame is there.

I masturbate daily to humiliation porn. I get off on humiliating myself in diapers and dresses.

I'm hooked on antidepressants since I was 14.

I also once touched a 6 year old girl inappropriately. Didn't touch her vagina or breasts, but I did touch her. This was my biggest regret.

So I have a ton of issues and problems. I feel like I'm never going to get better. I've been going to therapy and nothing is working.

Why shouldn't I kill myself? Aren't I piece of shit that should just die and leave this world?",08Sep2018,1
6,"Earlier today on the school bus ride home I was sitting with my girlfriend, this 13 year old wouldn’t stop kicking the back of the seat, she told him to stop and he did it harder and started poking her head. I’m 16 but I’m only 5’5” and 135 lb. He honestly wasn’t much smaller than me and I wouldn’t have laid a hand on him anyway but I lost it screaming, I don’t remember what I said but my girlfriend said I didn’t threaten him. I scared him into being calm and respectful and pretended like I was perfectly calm and fine afterwards. I haven’t actually yelled at someone in anger since middle school and I can’t stop feeling bad about it. Him poking her just sent me over a line and I’ve been told by everyone I was in the right and I even apologized (while still telling him he needs to stay respectful). Why do I still feel so bad?",08Sep2018,6

I've looked at all the clubs but for the most part I don't feel passionate about any of the stuff they represent. Does anyone have tip to what I should be doing or where or should be going for an opportunity to meet new people and make friends at and around school. I have some high school friends still but many of them are leaving for school very soon so it has me worried I'm gonna end up bored out of my mind this year.

10,"Let me just start out by saying this: my girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. At one point she lived 24 hours away from me; she recently relocated and is now around 4 hours away from me. 

We didn't meet (or even become close to official) until she moved nearby-ish. I drove down to see her and sparks flew, enough said. We've driven up/down to visit multiple times during the summer, but, because we're both in college (and classes had started), that next Monday I had to drive back home so I could make it in time for classes on Tuesday. I've driven down to see her multiple times, and I've met her friends there, they honestly are great people.

My problem is not romantic jealousy, it's platonic jealousy. During the summer and when she lived far away, we'd facetime for extended periods of time and just talk about our day. We'd share youtube videos or watch movies and just talk about life. Now that she's here and has friends, I dont see talk to her nearly as much. I'm not expecting to talk to her 24/7 or anything, we're both busy, but now I may be lucky if I talk to her for an hour or two before she falls asleep (and she's not sober the entire time, so it doesn't feel like \~quality\~ time). 

I'm glad that she has friends, genuinely, I just wish I could be there more because I do love her. How do I go about either 1) overcoming this jealousy, as I want to do it in a way that ensures I'm not being manipulative because, well, that's just common sense or 2) talk to her about the fact I'm jealous of all the time she spends with them. I want her to be with friends (honestly, she deserves to finally have real, good friends), I just also want to talk to her sometimes and I feel like that doesn't really happen anymore. Any help/input/ideas would be really greatly appreciated.",08Sep2018,1
11,"  

r/advice, I need your help. Or rather my friend does. Let’s call him Justin. 

Yes, I am aware of the trope of “my friend” when you really mean yourself. But no, this is not actually about me. This is about Justin, who has been a good friend of mine, and who is honestly one of the nicest people I know. 

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**

Justin and his girlfriend (let’s call her Tess) have been dating and living together for about 7 years. They recently took a break and Tess moved into a new apartment with her friend (let’s call her Ricki). 

Now there are some things you need to know about Ricki. She also recently broke up with her boyfriend, and she and Tess got this new place together. She also has a special needs son who has a developmental disorder where he requires a lot of extra attention. 

Justin and Tess decide to get back together. Justin is still living in him and Tess’ old apartment, and the lease is about to be up, so he decided to move in with Tess and Ricki. They are all happy about this at this point. 

Up until this point Ricki has been gone most of the time. She drops her child off at her mothers, then goes to her boyfriend’s house. She would often be gone for days. 

It is a town home style apartment with three bedrooms, 2 baths and all the like. Ricki has her own room, Ricki’s son has her own room, and Tess and Justin share a room. 

\------------------------------------------- 

Now that we are caught up, let’s get into the problems. 

Ricki has turned out to be a nightmare. After Justin moves back in, Ricki starts to spend considerably more time at the apartment. She also decides to get a dog. 

She now spends all of her time with her boyfriend on the couch, essentially ignoring the child and the dog, both of whom are VERY loud when ignored. 

As you can imagine, this is driving Justin and Tess insane. But it gets worse. 

Ricki tells Justin and Tess that she wants to split the rent three way now that Justin has moved in. Justin and Tess do not like this as Ricki has 2/3 of the available bedrooms and they believe that if anyone should be paying more, it should be her.  

On top of that, when Ricki leaves for work, she brings her child to her grandparents’ house but leaves the dog locked up. The dog does not like this and barks, all the time. Justin and Tess do not feel like it is their responsibility to take care of this dog, so they refuse to let the dog out. (Ricki refuses to train the dog and it goes to the bathroom inside of the house whenever and wherever it likes, much like you would expect from an untrained dog). 

Now Justin and Tess being the genuinely decent people that they are (well, at least Justin), spoke to Ricki about the noise of the dog and her not letting it out. They told her that they would help with the dog if she at least potty trained it. Ricki did not like this, and considered it to be an attack. She refuses to do anything. She told Justin and Tess that it’s her dog and she will do as she pleases. 

Since then she has gotten considerably worse. She is leaving messes everywhere, refusing to clean up after herself, her dog, her child, and her boyfriend. She is still insisting that they pay 2/3 the rent, and is purposefully creating a hostile environment. She has loud parties on nights that Justin and Tess have to work, eats their food, and continues to not train her dog.

Justin and Tess have had it. They don’t know what to do. They can’t move out because they are on the lease. They have talked to Ricki about it and she refuses to do anything to help. 

 Please help them. 

TLDR: Roommate with untrained loud dog refuses to act like a human. ",08Sep2018,2
12,"I'm a fifteen year old boy who just started my 
first week at boarding high school, and it's been hard.

13,"I am consistently juggling the idea that I’m stuck in an unhealthy relationship and I’m not even noticing it. From the outside, things can be quite obvious. I’m battling my own head on this. I need y’all’s opinion. 

Long story short, I am in a LDR. I have a pretty busy schedule with school,  but I do my best to say good mornings, be there after my classes to talk about my day. Sometimes I’m gone for a couple hours to do work/studying, I ALWAYS come back for night. I don’t even truly disappear. I’m living my tangible life. I truly do my best to communicate these things with him. 

I have this feeling that he isn’t really understanding that I can’t be glued to my phone all day. It’s like we have completely different expectations and whenever I confront him about it he just beats around the bush. He will come up with feelings saying I’m not there enough. So we had a talk and I told him I’d be there more. It was going really well for about 4 days, I had a really busy day a couple days ago, I barely slept the night before. When I got home from class I did homework and ended up just knocking out. I wake up to a text from him saying good night so I tell him to have sweet dreams and he says “mmmmmmmmmmhmmmmmmm”. I ignored this and just went on with the goodnight. After the fact, he messaged me ten minutes later and says “I love how this day goes by in a flick on the screen” (talking about the shortness of our chat log).  I flipped shit, not gonna lie, because I’m really tired of dealing with this. I want to cut him off in a way but I feel so fucking guilty and also I care about him deeply. He ALWAYS say it’s because he deals with problems in a shitty way but it’s not fair to make me deal with that. 

I understand this doesn’t provide a lot of insight on our relationship but I’m really starting to think this guy is clingy as shit. Please help. ",08Sep2018,2
14,"Hi, r/advice! I recently met an amazing person through work, and we added each other on snapchat. (S)He has made quite a bit of effort so far by adding me and sending a fair share of messages about interesting things (s)he had done that started some conversations. Unfortunately the last snap that was sent effectively killed off our last topic. I want to keep talking with this person, but I just can't think of anything interesting to lead with / make a story out of and unfortunately it seems like Snapchat isn't the best platform to send messages like ""hey"".

15,"Okay so here's the thing....there's certain people, usually actors or just sorta famous people where sometimes, I start getting this immense hatred for their faces. 

It's not usually tied to their personalities necessarily, or a general dislike of them. I might have a mild annoyance of little things they do but it's just intensified by their face for some reason (like if someone you hate were singing it might be annoying vs someone you like singing). But it's mostly directed towards their face, their expressions, and just overall how it looks. 

My husband says it's certain features I don't like, which could make sense. It's just even seeing their face very quickly will make my blood boil, so I'll want to either turn off what I'm watching or scroll past it as fast as possible. Like, j don't want to kill them or anything crazy, but I'm honestly getting super freaking annoyed just thinking about all the different faces I hate. Like, it's ruined shows for me, music, YouTube channels, whatever.

Is this normal? I don't like that I have such a strong and frankly, unpleasant reaction to certain faces, I try to ""get over it"" but I just get so infuriated I have to look away or turn it off.

If anyone wants to know my list of hated faces that I can think of for reference are as follows:
Amy Schumer, Link Neal, Shane Dawson, Adam Scott, Laina Morris (overly attached girlfriend except when she is doing her normal face).

I know there's more but I'm drawing a complete blank right now.

For reference, my world is a world where the Axis Powers won WWII. The only strong remaining Allied power to survive WWII  is the United States, and the US has already lost literally half of its territory to the Nazis, who rule the eastern half of the country under the name of the Nazi American Republic, a territory of the Greater German Reich. 
Operating within the NAR is the American Revolutionary Corps/ARC, one of the largest and strongest anti-Axis rebel organizations in the world on par with the British Homefront Army, French National Resistance, Eastern Free Army, Free Australian Forces, United Free Indian Forces, Korean National Army, and the Chinese National Front Army, with the ARC being the largest, most powerful and wealthiest rebel organization in the entire Western Hemisphere. 

Anyway, the American Revolutionary Corps has been fighting as a professional paramilitary rebel force ever since Colonel Broker of the US Marine Corps and the 5th Marine Division organized the first few armed resistance units in 1943, a year before General Dwight D. Eisenhower defects and reestablishes contact with the remnants of the scattered US Federal Government, starting the Patriot’s Insurgency against the Nazis. 


So, how should I come up with a good rebel salute or gesture meant to symbolize rebellion and revolution against the Nazis? I’m rewatching Hunger Games: Catching Fire and the District 12 salute used as a gesture of rebellion has always fascinated me since it was small, simple, easy but had a powerful message. I want to come up with another salute similar to that but I obviously don’t want to outright rip it off. 

So, how should I go about making a unique and simple rebel salute? ",08Sep2018,1

18,"I sold a couch about two weeks ago on Facebook that had a compartment and cupholders.  Inside that compartment was about 400 dollars in electronic accessories i.e. Wii u pro controller, 3ds and 20ish games.  The person I sold it to was actually the one to realize this as I had forgotten about them.  The person I sold the couch to lives about 45 minutes away and they said the next time they were in my town they would stop by to drop it all off which would be in about two weeks.  In preparation I sent a message a few days ago to them on Facebook to figure out a time, but no response.  They haven't even seen the messages, but I am getting a little anxious.  I am not sure how to approach the situation since the only way to get ahold of the person is via Facebook, but they don't seem to be responding at all.

20,"To give a bit of a background there was a girl who use to be really mean to me in high school. There was one other who was worse then her but she was still so nasty to everyone. I wasn't the person she tormented most, but I still greatly dislike her. Flash forward 4 years and my best friend of 7 years and I join a stupid group on Facebook. I'm not super into Facebook (and maybe this is why it bugs me because I use it differently, I won't friend anyone unless I know them personally because I post about my kids) but she is really into this group, she posts a lot. A bunch of the people added her, including my high school bully. She didn't realize who she was when she added her and mentioned her later, when I heard her name I advised her not to be friends with her since 4 years ago she would backstab, trash talk, and do just about anything for attention.  I looked through her posts and she really doesn't seem to have changed a whole lot based off what she posts but I could be biased and get. It's her life she can be friends with whom ever she wants. Well,  She constantly posts on my best friends posts now,  including pictures of my kids that I'm tagged in or posts about us going out together. In the joint group we are in shes made comments about my bff saying she knows what's going on in my bffs life and that they are friends which for some reason really irked me but I rolled my eyes and let it go because it's not right for me to dictate who she talks to. Today my bff made a sarcastic comment along the lines of ""oh look,  your best friend likes this picture you took"" and for some reason it really hit me that it bothers me that she would stay friends with someone that was really mean to me for 4 years.  I told her that and she rolled her eyes at me and said I was being ridiculous and it's just Facebook. She said she wouldn't care if I was friends with her high school bully and she won't delete her because it would hurt her feelings.  It's extremly stupid that I'm kinda upset about this.  I don't even know why it bothers me but it really does.  She's been my best friend for 7 years and she's never once mocked me for feeling a certain way.

22,"I'm introverted to start off with, but you would never know. When I'm around others I'm outgoing and talkative to a certain extent. My point is, I'm not some shy, awkward introvert.

I am able to make acquaintances pretty easily, but it never goes further. I just never feel this ""connection"" to them. There is always this disconnect from them and me. I just can't seem to get past that disconnect. We know each other but we really don't. I just feel like I can't be my true, goofy, weird self around any of them.

I see all these extroverts who have these best friends. However, when I really look at these ""best friends"", they would only be considered acquaintances or friends at best for me. They seem fine with it, though, and seem to really enjoy this other person's company. For me, though, I can't stand friendships like those. They seem so flakey, superficial.

I don't really know whats wrong with me. I really want to hangout with people. I honestly really do, but at the same time, I don't really care to because no one peaks my interest.

I just keep meeting these same kinds of people over and over. It seems that they don't have this ""depth"" to them. It's like some people are shallow lakes, some are deep lakes, and some are oceans. And I'm not going to say that I am some super interesting person, because I'm not, but I just feel like these people I meet don't have this certain quality that I can't put my finger on. When I meet someone with it, I can pretty much instantly tell. I don't know what is is, but I think it might have to do with being super conscious of your own thoughts, feelings, actions, etc. It's like emotional intelligence, maybe?

Anyways, I don't know what separates me from these other people. All I need is one person to whom I can connect. I have two really good online friends who I have this connection with, but they live in separate states. 

I really want to meet people like this, but I can't seem to find anyone in my real life who has these qualities. I know I probably sound like some shallow person saying everyone else sucks, but that's how I feel. 

I don't want to party. I don't want to do drugs. I don't want to drink till I blackout. I don't want to go to bars. I don't want to go out to eat just to talk. I want to go on some super hard hike and smoke weed when finally finish it. I want to go on adventures exploring the states. I want to try rock climbing. I want to chill at home and play some games. I want go swimming in a lake because why not? I want to go camping and just listen to nature.

I don't really get it. What do I do? I don't think it helps out that I look like an absolute frat bro.

I feel so lost, and so alone. I'm longing for connection, but I can't find it. I'm a college student, and I don't really know where to look at this point. I could join a club, but I know if I don't find anyone interesting in it, that it'll become a chore for me to attend. And the chances of that are pretty high.

23,What does it mean when a guy takes long to respond but insiSTS that the conversation continues? Like he’s said multiple times “we can never let this convo die!” and also misunderstood a joke i made as me saying bye and he got all upset and was like “you can’t just end it like thAT without warning/i’d need time to prepare myself!”. But he’ll just take like 2 or 3 days to respond sometimes (rarely responds instantly usually 6 or so hours later but lately a day or two) and he recently started college which i know is stressful so i just assume he’s busy but sometimes he’ll view my story or be on social media but not respond and idk. If he gave one word answers I’d know he wasn’t interested but when he finally responds he’ll give a decent length reply/ask a question to make sure the convo continues. Since we don’t see each other every day anymore maybe he doesn’t necessarily like me like that but just wants to make sure we keep in touch since we’d likely drift apart if we didn’t?? but still who’s that eager to stay in touch with a girl you weren’t super close to in real life if you don’t like them like that? (We’ve been keeping a steady conversation for 3 months which I’ve never done with any of my friends before) like I’m usually good at reading people but this ones got me stumped.

1.) I just graduated last month with a degree in history from Texas A&amp;M University. I moved to NYC 3 weeks ago, and I have not been having much luck in the job market. 

2) I applied for an “Entry level marketing position” with a certain company (I will omit their name just in case). When I went to their website, it states that they are a start up marketing firm that focuses on “face-to-face advertising”

3)Interview: 
 
  My first interview was via Skype, and I had my follow up interview this morning. The location I went to was a “temporary location because their office next door was still being built”

A lot of what they were telling me just didn’t add up. They say you will start out making $600/week, but you will be moving up to a final position in 40-60 weeks to a position that they claim will pay around $100,000/year...

The really hit hard on a certain client they had, an energy company that I will also omit the name of. However, when researching that company, there’s hardly anything to be found..


The point: Why would a marking company hire a history major with no major marketing experience for a job that 1 year from now will pay $100,000? They never ran a background check on me, and the fact they had a “temporary location because their office is still being built” just really sketches me out.  All of this just seems very very fishy..

Any help or advice on this is very appreciated, as I don’t have many people to talk to about this.

I tend to chainsmoke and work on my dissertation at the pub; she tends to socialize and generally make an ass of herself, which I find endearing.

I've noticed a passively mutual interest between the two of us, marked by coy and fleeting eye contact.

This evening, she insisted on sitting uncomfortably close to me while I unassumingly read and wrote, until her male friend talked her into following him into another room.

She later returned to the same room as me.

At that time, someone commandeered my ashtray, so I made an origami lotus to use as a temporary replacement. She loudly complimented me on this (this time from across the room, presumably because seats near me were occupied), but left shortly after to go with friends to watch Star Wars, with the caveat that she might return later tonight.

In general, she tends to be near me while speaking vacantly and exhibitionistically to weirdos who she later complains about (which, again, I like and find strangely attractive). 

I'm just not sure how to begin a conversation with her and, after that, how to make it clearly romantic.

Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated.

Fwiw, I'm deeply introverted, tend to intellectualize, love cannabis (which she smokes at said pub), and this is an ""old man"" pub, complete with no wi-fi and no music.

Finally, I would be happy just to talk with her, in spite of my romantic interest - I like her as a person, and would like to know her better (that, in-itself, is enough of an erotic delight with this particular individual).

Also, ask me to clarify or elaborate on anything.

Thanks!",08Sep2018,2
34,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a cross roads in terms of my career, and I really need advice. I am in media planning and buying by trade and have 10 years of experience. I have a vast skill set with strong managerial skills/experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a full stack marketer with strong experience and certifications in multiple ad platforms. I am also a self taught full stack engineer. I even launched a mobile app that's currently available on the app store (it's called air-heart, a travel optimization tool that helps you travel smarter). I'm also a senior level (digital media) analyst.

&amp;#x200B;

I have strong interpersonal and communications skills. I'm usually always the lead point of contact for all client matters, and have received very strong positive feedback throughout my career.

&amp;#x200B;

With all that said, I've been unemployed for 3 months and it's been incredibly difficult to find a job. I love advertising and marketing. I believe it's my calling in life. I have more passion, skills, and experience than most people but I'm not sure why I keep getting passed up for opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I don't know if I should continue to pursue media, or to look elsewhere. I guess this is the advice I need. With my current skillset, what other careers/jobs can I pursue, where I can fully utilize all my skills and be challenged - without starting as an entry level candidate. (I know this is asking for a lot, but any direction or guidance is very much appreciated).

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much in advance!

I have maybe 3 or 4 'friends' but I never hang out with them outside of school because we don't seem that close. I feel like I can't talk to any of them about emotions. Plus I am feeling extremely insecure and worried about my future. I don't know if I'll get into the college I want and all of my friends are so much smarter than me. 

Because of my lack of friends and the lack of any romantic opportunities I've started having feelings for my English teacher. I could go into the whole psychology of it but that would be an essay. The crush has actually last for over a year because I had him as a teacher last year too. It just breeds self degrading and hopeless feelings.

37,"First there’s a few things I need to list:

- I’m a bisexual male
- I want to be a woman (MtF)
- I think I suffer with dysphoria although nobody has diagnosed me, so I won’t say for sure.
- I’m 18
- We’ll call the couple Fred and May

A couple years ago when I was around 14 I was in a bad spot, I had recently “decided” to leave my mum’s house (split parents, two houses) and move into my Dad’s house due to the constant abuse between my stepdad and mum, and I had had enough. The police escorted me to collect my things and I moved in with my Dad.

Around this time two of my best friend’s who were a couple broke up and I was basically forced to pick a side, either I stick with Fred or I stick with May, I ended up staying on Fred’s side because I was terrified to lose anyone else, I defended him till the death of me, and I think that was due to my fear of isolation, he was all I had, my only true friend who I felt might actually care for me. And I ended up being extremely rude to May, which I regret.

I took care of Fred, I was there when he was upset, when he needed comforting I was there, I spoke to him when he wouldn’t speak to me, his heart was broken and I wanted to mend is so so badly. It’s in this time where I started to fall in love with him, I had never had this type of intimacy with anyone before.

Fast forward a couple years, I’m 16 (Legal age in Britain) and I start getting flirty with Fred, bare in mind I don’t even know if he’s bi or anything, but it’s obvious that I liked him, he knew that. We ended up exchanging flirts and ended up getting down on each other. Thing is, he doesn’t consider himself bi, I’m the “exception” I suppose.

Fast forward a few more years to recent times, I’m 18, and me and Fred still fuck to this day, but it’s become more intimate, I tell him I love him, he tells me he loves me too, he says I have an incredible body, he says he loves to kiss me and hug me and things seem to be getting pretty serious right?

Well apparently not, because I confess that I loved him nearing the end of last year, it was obvious that I did but we never really spoke about it, and he says he doesn’t feel the same. But then why would you tell me you love me? Do you love me in a different way? Everything we do seems to be relationship-y to me, I tell him I love him when I say goodnight, we constantly send kisses over text, I guess I don’t understand what I am to him? Am I just a quick wank? Is my crippling fear of isolation and lack of intimacy making me continue to do this stuff with him?
I don’t know.
But recently, after that, he told me he made out with a girl, and it fucking infuriated me. After all I’ve done for you, after all you’ve told me I am to you, you said you loved me, you said I’d helped you so much, we fuck, we kiss, we hug, we do everything a couple would do except you haven’t established that.
And then he meets another girl, and he says he’d marry her in an instant but she’s interested in someone else.
And then it hit me, it’s because I’m a fucking guy, if I were a female then we’d be together, there’s no goddamn doubt in my mind.
This rocked my dysphoria like the titanic, I’ve never felt so shit. I already want to be a woman and now the only person I’ve ever fell in love with is restricted from me because I’m not one.

I am mostly worried that if I tell them, they will kick me out.
     If I told my mom, I think she would take it somewhat well. She says that she wouldn't mind if I was, but every time I walk to her about any of my friends that are gay, lesbian, bi, ect., she either says, ""They're not trying to ask you out are they?,"" or, ""You need to make new friends."" Talking to my dad is a whole other story.
     My dad HATES anyone who is even a little bit different than him. If you are not a straight, masculine, baptist, man, or a straight, feminine, baptist woman, then he will either hate you, judge you and everything you do, or make fun of you. My dad ESPECIALLY hates the LGBT community. He believes ""those people are nothing but a bunch or freaks and perverts."" Most of my family believes this. My brother is not much different than this. The only difference is that he will openly call LGBT people ""faggots"". (I hate that word.)
     As for anyone else in my family, I don't know. All my uncles are the same as my dad and brother, I don't know about my Aunts, and as for my grand parent... They are even harder to figure out.

Around that time I can remember the evening rather blurry, but I knew we had fun and at some point I ordered a taxi home. So far so good. 

Next time I saw my friends, two of them thought it would be fun to make me believe I was making out with one of them while being drunk. Which in itself would not be tragic because we are both single. But the fact that I had a blackout shocked me because I thought I knew all and had always everything under control while drinking alcohol. Of course I could not remember anything about it, but they were so dead serious when they told me, I believed it happened. At least one hour my lovely friends helped me to reconstruct the events of the evening right down to the kissing. I became more and more worried about my own behavior and went home totally irritated. 

Luckily, my best friend was still there when the two broke up the situation. My other friends were just as surprised by the story as I was. They didn't now about the prank either. Later that evening, my bf sent me a message explaining why I could not remember everything and that she's not supposed to tell me this, because the others thought it was sooo funny and wanted to keep up with the story.

The first moment I read the message I was angry, because they saw me having all these self-doubts, feeling really bad about myself and they still kept sprinkling salt in the wound. But my second thought was that there is so much potential in this!!! They don't know I know and they still want to stick to the story. But instead I could be the one pranking now! The problem is I really don't know how. Every scenario I think of, could eventually hurt someones feelings or become mean at some point and I don't want to ""prank"" anyone like this. They may feel a bit bad though :)

WTF. I️ know that we did not. We both are out of the house from 8-5 so unless our dogs are taking rotating shifts flushing the toilets and turning on the sinks out of spite (we have a Furbo so I️ know this is not the case) we cannot fathom how our meter registered 8,000 gallons. 

We called the water and sewer company and they said the meter reading was right. We check all the toilet caps and faucets, nothings leaking. We watched the meter for five hours without using water, it only moved 1 gallon. We aren’t really sure where to go from here.

This girl is a real piece of work who is suspect to be either Aspergers or somewhere on the autism spectrum. She follows me everywhere and is incessantly obnoxious with no kind of concept of personal space. She barges into people's rooms at random without knocking and refuses to leave. Some of her worst kinds of harassment so far include: refusing to leave my room even at 4 am when myself and my roommates need to be sleeping, constantly touching me and forcefully grabbing my hair, screaming across all of campus that I have a little dick and am balding, eating any and all food she can find in my room, literally stalking me on Snapchat through the map function to find where I  am at any given point ( I have since disabled my location for the app), and so much more. I have honestly told some people who really should be understanding about this (aka people in authority like a guidance counselor) and they take it as a joke because I am a guy and I should be able to just tell her that I do not want her to be around me. Like I haven't tried that already. Everytime I tell this girl, lets call her E, to leave me alone she treats it as a joke and thinks I'm being hilarious. Because of 'E' it feels like my time at college has been ultimately ruined because people avoid me like the plague. No one else can tolerate her either, but since she is constantly following me around we are being treated like a set. Everyone I know runs the other way when I see them and it makes me feel like I am not even a person. I try to be extra nice to the point where some people may consider me a push over, but I have to do that now so that people will try and be nice to me for a few days before E gets to be too much. She has tried to steal a key to my room in order to make a duplicate so that she can get in anytime she wants. One time when I was asleep in my room she came in and took my phone and tried to go through it while I was passed out. Also, I would like to point out that I did nothing to provoke this. BY that I mean that I did not lead her on or anything of the sort. From the moment we first met (she randomly entered my room when a roommate left it unlocked, and then I walked in) I have made a point to tell her to leave me alone, but she refuses to.

One final note. If possible, I would like to handle this personally without getting the police or my college involved. I am willing to go that far if I need to, but I honestly feel that she might not be particularly mentally 'alright' and I don't think she is doing this out of malice or anything. It kind of feels like she has some kind of mental disorder/disability that is just preventing her from understanding social situations. Therefore, I would like to get her the help she needs rather than make this something she will get in a lot of trouble for. I have already found out some information about the mental health services on my campus and am considering anonymously saying something to them.

62,"Hi, so I’m not really good at making friends; it took me until junior year of high school to find a group of girls to be friends with. Now that I’m a freshman in college, I have to start the whole process over again and it’s making me really sad and lonely. 

So my floor had a bonding event, and during it I got to talking with three girls (A,B,C)  who all knew each other and were friends already, but I felt like we all hit it off. 

We added each other on Snapchat, so later that night I asked them if they were going to the football game that Saturday. They were, so I invited them to go eat with me beforehand, and they all agreed and said they were excited. Long story short, the game was cancelled and we ended up just watching a scary movie in my dorm and ordering in pizza (it was only two (A,B) of the three girls though). Afterwards, we all agreed that we should hang out again.

So today, about a week later, I invite them to go thrift shopping with me. The entire past week I hadn’t heard one peep from any of them, except for when I would run into them on campus or on our floor. Still, they agreed to go and seemed excited about it. It was only two (A,B) of them, plus two other girls that they knew (one of their roommates (D) and their roommate’s friend (E)). 

After thrift shopping, they invited us (my sister and me) to go eat at Chipotle with them, so we met up with the third girl and two of *her* friends (F,G), and ate. 

It was going okay, but I felt bad because my sister was going on her first date that night and she was nervous, so she would not stop talking about it. I knew it was really annoying, but I couldn’t exactly tell her to stop. So I felt like that might’ve discouraged them from being friends with us. Also during this, I noticed that they were texting each other secretly. 

Shortly after that, two of the girls (B,C) and their friends (F,G) leave, saying they’re going to go get ready. (They didn’t say for what, but I knew it was for a party). So then it was just me, my sister, one of the girls (A), and the roommate (D) + roommate’s friend (E). 

A little while later, as we’re leaving Chipotle, I asked where B and C had gone, and A said, “oh, they just went back to the dorms.” Which I knew wasn’t exactly true. 

We go our separate ways back at the dorms and at some point I go to the bathroom and run into A, who is holding party clothes. She says “hey” kind of awkwardly, like I had just caught her and she felt weird about it. Then we went our separate ways again.

I don’t know what to do. I want to be friends with these girls but I feel so confused. On one hand, whenever I invite them somewhere they agree to it and actually follow through, but on the other hand it’s only me who invites them anywhere. It’s not like they don’t have any opportunities to invite me places, it’s just that they choose not to. They’re really nice girls and we have fun when we do hang out, though. What should I do now? Keep inviting them places hoping that they’ll start to do the same, or take the L and keep crying alone in my dorm on the weekends? ",08Sep2018,1
63,"Last semester I was in a 6 person internship group with my classmates. We spent 20+ hours a week in a small windowless room literally sitting shoulder to shoulder working for free. We became very close and I thought we were becoming good friends. I tended to talk mostly to the 2 guys in the group, share memes, talk music etc because they sat closest to me and also because 2 of the girls were friends from high school and were always talking about people they know etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have social anxiety and am very much an introvert, but once I'm comfortable I talk a lot. I got comfortable with them. Maybe too comfortable. I started to feel like maybe I was talking too much. I was going through a tough time personally. Working 20+ hours, intern 20+ hours, school etc plus lots of arguments at home. I actually had a panic attack although I didn't recognize it as that at the time. The only thing that was really keeping me together was talking to my intern group everyday. I really did like the group. I usually hate group work, but we functioned very well together.

&amp;#x200B;

Toward the end of the semester I began feeling like they were getting somewhat sick of me. I began noticing the girls excluding me a bit, maybe not on purpose. The 2 guys planned a trip to Vegas together over the summer. Our supervisor and the girls had little happy hour things, but I couldn't go cause it conflicted with my schedule plus I don't drink. I was hoping we would keep the group text going over the summer, but that didn't happen. 2 of them took a math class together. Then I saw our supervisor invited the other girls to her birthday party, but not me. I see them tagging each other in stuff on Facebook, but not me. Even when it's related to school topics. It's just disheartening.

&amp;#x200B;

It was weird seeing everyone again when class started a few weeks back. They all save each other seats, but not me. I run a bit late and when I get there they're all sitting together and I have to find somewhere else to sit. I would like to get to know other people in our class too, but we had to sign up for semester long groups again and I was gonna try to branch out, but the topic I wanted everyone in my old group signed up for so we all ended up together again. It just feels uncomfortable now. In all honesty there's no other people in the class I want to be doing group projects with because our group is the strongest academically. It's hard to get to know the others because everyone is cliquey at this point by racial group specifically. I'm the only person of my ethnicity in the class too so I'm just a loner on all accounts

&amp;#x200B;

I feel myself wanting to distance myself because I've been rejected by them, which really hurts because I actually opened up to them. They know the real me and they still rejected me. That really sucks. I tried talking to my therapist about this. He didn't help a lot, but we determined that distancing myself is my go to, to protect myself. I have to work with them the rest of the semester so I have to keep it cordial, but should I keep being friendly or just back off? I don't know what to do. It's hard to watch them continually shut me out. I don't think they dislike me necessarily, they just like each other more. Sorry this is so long. Any advice? I'd appreciate it.

TL;DR: I have to continue working with a group of classmates that I thought I was friends with, but have now been excluding me. Should I back off or act like nothing's wrong?",08Sep2018,1
64,"So i have been with my boyfriend for a little over a year, but I've known him for a long time. We got pregnant early on in the relationship, and since i have been around 6 months pregnant he just doesnt seem into me at all. I know the feeling of when someone is actually attracted to you, and when they are just there, you know?

Anyways i can tell he isnt physically attracted to me since i got pregnant and had our son, but he is too much of a nice guy to admit it. I think its because he feels bad for me. I dont want to be in a relationship where im basically being held onto because hurting my feelings isnt his way of going about things. I also know that if i ask him about it he is not going to admit it either. I just feel really sad when i am around him because there is no love there at all. Were basically just roomates raising our kids together. 

I dont know if anyone has any advice? Should i just end it for both of our sakes? Should i stick it out for the kids? ",08Sep2018,2

68,"She's an adult and her parents are extremely controlling. They read her texts. They tell her when to be home and when to go to bed. They do literally everything they can to control every aspect of her life. Here's the kicker: They threaten her that they won't pay for school if she doesn't do what they want, but wait, there's more: They won't let her get a job to save for a car or her own tuition. So she's literally trapped there. 

We have strong feelings for each other and after they found out that I used to drink and smoke, which I haven't done in a year now, since I cleaned up my act, became top of my class, and got a great paying job while going to school; they told her that they don't approve of my life choices, never want to meet me, and that we can never hang out. It's completely irrationally judgemental and an excuse for them to use to have all of their control. 

Every night I google like a teenage girl on how I can overcome the situation. It's absolutely destroying me emotionally to not be able to be with her outside of school, between classes for 30 minutes at a time. It's literally causing me so much anxiety that I even resorted to venting on a forum with an anonymous name! I don't do things like this! I don't know how much stronger these feelings will get but they are getting out of control. I literally might do something crazy. I can't let her go.

They go to events and fun trips with each other or with their other friends and rarely even consider asking me to join. I guess I've sort of hinted to them that I've been having trouble making friends from my classes, so I would assume they would have picked that up and invite me out more. But unfortunately, I just get left out of their plans. I mean when we do hangout we're pretty close and have a lot of fun and I can tell my friends do like and enjoy me being there. I just don't understand why there always just seems like there's a distance between me and my friends. Looking back, it's kind of always been like this, and I'm honestly getting tired (and upset) of caring a lot about someone to then find out my name doesn't even come up when they make fun plans.

I feel as though ill be tempted or seduced into being her ""friend"" again and hanging onto her for validation. I didn't just block her out of the blue.

77,"A little background to this situation.. I have a bestfriend of 15 years. We've known each other since we were 6/7 years old. We are both 21 now. We grew up together basically. She has a key to my home, hell she even has a key to my parent's home. We are family, or so I thought we were. 
About 2 weeks ago I found out that she slept with my brother, who is 2 years younger than me. The thing is it happened months ago, and more than once, yet neither of them felt guilty enough to tell me themselves. I found out through messages and screen shots of conversations. The messages I saw made me sick to my stomach. I trusted this girl, I trusted my brother, to never betray me. And when I confronted her, she tried to lie about it and tell me I was exaggerating. I made her the God mother of my child. How can I trust her with my child if she can keep something like that from me.
My brother has been living with me and my husband, rent free, all he has to do is buy his own food. I kicked him out. I cannot face either of them. I'm just so hurt. 
I ended up blocking them on all social media, told them to leave me alone for a while so I can process everything. That have both been trying to apologize but how can I ever believe them or trust them if they could pretend nothing ever happened these last few months. They had so many chances to come clean, I couldn't even tell that they even felt any guilt, it makes me wonder what else they have lied about.  
I just feel so betrayed, does anyone think I'm exaggerating? How would you handle this situation? Right now, not talking to them or seeing them is helping. But every time I think about them or someone brings them up I just feel so hurt. I know they are adults and can make their own decisions, but it's like I wasn't even considered in all this, instead they tried to hide it from me. Idk, I'm just so confused on what to do next. I feel like your bestfriends sibling should be off limits, isn't that kind of like a rule that you don't need to come out and say. Especially since she grew up calling my siblings her siblings too.

82,"I (20/f) have a fiancé (23/m) and we’ve been together for 3 years.  I love him dearly. We have a 2 month old baby boy together. I love him even more.


Recently my fiancé and I have been having a very rough spot in our lives. We live together for a while and I’ve been loyal to him. He bought a phone recently and put a password on it and never opens his phone around me so I’ve been suspicious as fuck. I’ve been able to see his messages every once in a while. Usually nothing’s there but about 2 months ago the day of my due date, I saw him messaging another girl saying she looked sexy and to hangout with him. That same night i knew he was with his guy friends and I knew that cause the other messages made it clear that he was. we got into a big fight about It and i was seriously hurt but he gave me the explanation that him and all his friends messaged her at once to see who she’d say yes to just as a joke. I told him those jokes aren’t funny and I don’t want it to happen again. 

A month later he’s talking to his friend. He’s a carpenter and he was making a Pool house for one house but they had asked him and the other workers to leave because the daughters wanted to go in the pool. He then told his friend to meet up with him because of this, and said “they’re hot mamis but we can’t see so I gotta leave work early” that made me even more mad. When I confronted him about it he got really defensive. 

Now today I saw his messages again, and he had a conversation with a girl that he admitted months ago that he had a thing with years ago before he was with me. I opened the conversation and he immediately got defensive. There was only one message from her saying “ok” and the rest was deleted. I don’t understand why he’d delete it. I asked him why and he said “to avoid problems with you” and I told him that his dishonesty is what is giving us these problems. He said she had just messaged him asking about how our baby is doing. I don’t understand why he would delete the messages if that was it. 

He called me crazy and sick, and said he doesn’t want to be with me anymore. I told him he’d hurt me one too many times and if he’s going to lie and cheat, I don’t want to be either. He keeps swearing up and down he doesn’t cheat or lie, but that could also be as big of a lie as god knows what else. I realized I don’t know anything about him and I don’t know who he really is. Now I’m looking st my sweet baby and my heart breaks for him. He will always have a broken family because of his fathers immaturity. There is a lot more than this that the father has done. 

He won’t let me work, because he wants me to stay home with the baby for a year. Understandable, but I had found a job at a daycare that would let me bring and watch my baby while I watch the other baby’s. It’s good pay 10 hour days and 5 days a week. It was the best opportunity of my life for a job. I said no, because he said he didn’t want me to. He won’t let me go for a run or a walk because he’s too jealous and is afraid I’ll go meet up with somebody or someone will follow me or try to talk to me. He’s also afraid that if I lose weight I will leave him. He’s also been out on weekdays drinking until 3 o clock in the morning, coming home drunk, and fighting with me because I told him it’s inappropriate now that he’s a father. I recently found out he’s been selling weed, and who knows what else he’s doing. I’m in a rut. I really loved him with all of my heart, I changed everything, I cook every night a new recipe and clean the entire house even though we only rent a room and other people use the rest of the house. I only care about my baby and my health and my fiancé. I love him, I’ve never denied him access to my phone or knowing what I do, and he accuses me of having people over to have sex with me while he works. Today he shoved money in my bra while we were arguing and said “this is all you want, take it and leave. “


Now I have no money, because I’m not going to take his money. I don’t have the best job I could have possibly gotten, I am all alone with my sweet baby and I am completely heartbroken. I have nothing for myself anymore, and I still manage to be so madly in love with this guy that I just pray he comes back to the house with a good explanation saying we can work things out and promising no more secrets. That’s all I could possibly ask for. I feel pathetic because I keep praying to God and acting like he’ll help me, because I’ve always believed in god, but he never answers me. Praying isn’t helping me. I have the biggest knot in my throat as I’m holding my little son trying not to break down because I know he needs me. I’m broken. I don’t know what to do. ",08Sep2018,0

88,"Hey Reddit, I’m still pretty new to the website, but didn’t know where else to turn for asking advice from strangers.
ANYWAYS...
I’m an amateur artist/illustrator aiming to eventually work professionally. I’m having an internal issue with deciding whether or not I’d prefer my art/art style to be more on the goofy, wacky side, or more serious. The artists/illustrators I follow on social media and whose work I’m inspired by vary from comedic, light hearted, like adventure time (cliche I know, but that show left a huge impression on me), to more serious, and somewhat grim and gritty. Think Mike Mongola (creator of Hellboy)

I really enjoy people laugh. It’s honestly something that brings me true joy, is to be able to make someone giggle or even smile at my silly drawings. But I also have days where my drawings become more gritty and serious. There’s stories I want to tell that are dumb and (hopefully) funny, but also darker, serious-toned stories that people would take more seriously? (I mean no disrespect towards comedic stories or the like, I really don’t) I’m just not sure which path I should follow. Do I draw goofy characters with expressive, funny faces in cute worlds or tone it down to something more serious? It’s hard trying to juggle 2 styles of drawing and I feel it’s holding me back from really progressing as an artist.

I just go straight to defense mode, I think it all roots down to my dad, my dad is bipolar (probably a bunch of other diagnosed problems as well from what I can tell), whenever he gets mad, its like a switch has been flipped, he turns small situations, in to very big ones and starts yelling, and throwing things (hes also punched holes in to walls but never put a finger on me) in some instances, and it has always scared me and made me get super defensive and upset, and now i'm like that with almost every argument, i almost always start crying, and being defensive, it gets in the way of so many things and makes many things very hard that shouldn't be. How do I change this? i dont want to ruin relationships with how defensive and emotional i get when arguing, i would prefer arguments being short and ending with understanding, but somehow i just cant.

94,"I'm in the US, Tennessee namely, and 19. College isn't exactly cheap; however, I don't believe it's necessary to throw money away just because its in your family's best interests or because you can. I try and save my money and be frugal, and everyone tells me that I am getting nowhere by saving all my money, and that I should go buy a new car, go in debt for school, saying things like ""oh anon! you'll make so much money it won't even matter!"" 

My parents are divorced, and since then, the only person really trying to help with my school is my sister, and decisions are usually reinforced by my mother, and I'm like the 3rd wheel in my life and get fussed at if I give my two cents on anything regarding finances. They are always making comments such as, ""he has more money in his account than all of us! he can afford to spend lots of money here,"" I don't make any major purchases or go on expensive trips I'm shopping for a car too, so you can imagine how that's going, but that's a story for another post.

I am going for my bachelor's degree in health science, and last year I went to our state university, did quite well making mostly A's and a B+ in chemistry. This school was paying me around $2000 per semester just to be there, and I pocketed 4k last year from this. If I were to return, I am confident I wouldn't have to pay anything at all. I might even make some more money if I'm lucky. I just looked at last semesters record, and it cost $7285 per semester, and I didn't pay anything and they mailed me a check for the difference.

However, my living arrangement only lasted for 1 year, so now I am back at home, which is an hour long drive away from campus, so that's probably 6 hours of driving a week, but at least the drive is pretty! I will be working as a phlebotomist making probably $14-$15 an hour, so I'm not too worried about gas money. I don't want to live by myself in an apartment or dorm because it's too expensive and I'm just not mentally ready for that.

I would be driving an hour to class and then back home probably 3 days a week, and I really don't mind the drive since it's pretty here. This school has a big, scenic campus, and the instructors are just alright, and some seem to really enjoy their subjects.

So this is option A.

My sister and mom pressured me into skipping this school this year to go to a private **for-profit** college that is even further away, about 1 hour and 20 minutes from my home, and instead of commuting, I would just be staying with my sister and her fiance (kind of awkward?) for however long they decide I am welcome to stay with them, and then I would just drive about 20 minutes to class.

The thing about this school is that it is also an accelerated one, and since it's a smaller, private one, you are going to pay more money. It costs $6900 for any schedule above 9 credit hours, and they have school in quarters, so you can get classes done faster, but you can't do as many at the same time. I've been trying to make a schedule today and argued with an unhelpful adviser all day, and they have awful class hours on crazy days, and I can't take what I want because they only have like 1 or 2 course offerings per class that all overlap with each other. For example, they have biology lab on Friday nights for 4 hours, and class is on Saturday, and the rest of the schedule is on Monday and Wednesday. In comparison to last year at the other school, I went Tues/Thurs, and did 1 lab on Wednesday and I was done!

I think I would like to apply for a physician assistant program, and this school offers a guaranteed interview for their students, but their program is also expensive as hell so I'm not even sure if its even worth it because I might not want to go there or even be accepted anyways. The only two benefits of this school is that I can get my degree probably 6 months faster, but is that really worth it? If i graduated debt free I could just continue to work and apply for programs until I am accepted anyways I think.

I have not talked to their financial aid department yet so I don't even know what they are planning on charging me to go here total, but I just have a really bad feeling about signing up, and I am thinking of telling my sister/mom screw it, I'll take 1 semester here and after that I will continue at the other school, and I will be met with disdain, told I'm being greedy with my money like I'm a leprechaun sitting on a pot of imagined gold. I just want to go to school, learn, have some fun, and not have this contribute any more to my depression and otherwise miserable time that I'm being put through.

This is option B, and I am just feeling unhappy and have an otherwise gut feeling that I am making a mistake if I stay here. Do you guys have any experiences that could give me some perspective, or have any advice on where I should go? Any ideas on how to confront my family and just tell them what I really think. I am not usually one to worry about things, but this is just making me so unhappy and I don't know how to fix it other than my ideas above.",08Sep2018,1
95,"20 M

These days my life is super boring. My life is basically work and home. Work makes me feel like a worthless nobody - most customers I greet don't even acknowledge my existence so basically I spend hours standing in one place trapped inside my own head doing the same repetitive thing, 5 days a week. The upper-middle aged customers are the worst, for some reason they take it upon themselves to talk down to us. That plus social anxiety has me in a mental mess by the end of each shift. I only get the chance to talk to co-workers in my 20 minute breaks, and even then its just polite small talk.

My home life is pretty bad. I live at home, and my siblings hardly notice my presence. If I ask one of my brothers if they want to do anything, they'll say ""maybe later"" and forget. I don't have ANY friends to do anything with. Basically all I do at home is sit on my laptop. Lately I've even been struggling to find motivation to watch a movie or play a video game.

My life isn't going anywhere. Nowhere apart from physical labor is hiring without a university degree. Even then, whats the point of getting some job anyways? I don't want to get sucked into the system of work - buy house - die. I want to do something with my life, like travelling, but everyone tells me not to waste these years and to put my head down and get on with it. When I have a day off I have no idea how to spend it - I just sit around all day watching youtube. Even when I want to do something I can never think of anything to do by myself - I just feel anxious doing things in public by myself. I don't feel anything anymore - I haven't since I was 15 - happiness, sadness, anger - the only thing I feel is apathy - I just feel disconnected from everything - my weeks are just blurring together passing me by.

I feel like while some of my life is my fault, theres some stuff I can't help. I'm high-functioning autistic - I WANT to talk to people, have friends, be happy - but no matter what I do I just can't. I don't have a personality - I'm just that one weird guy no-one likes. Is there anyone on this sub thats experienced something like I have and got over it??

&amp;#x200B;

My SO dropped a bombshell on me this afternoon.  Called me at work crying, blubbering.  Asked me to come home.  I obliged.  She could not vocalize what she needed to tell me so she wrote it down.  My FIL, married to a woman, was caught having an affair with a man.  Unsure if gay, bi, etc.  The FIL has not divulged any information at all with regard to anything.  What is known is that FIL has been in a dead bedroom for years as the step-MIL has gone all-in on MCOG.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many troublesome things about the story.  My SO received a phone call from the step-MIL who informed of the affair.  The step-MIL is vindictive so I question her motives straight away.  She is ultra religious...a member of a religion that does not believe in divorce.  They believe that the sinner/adulterer must face the church.  The story she told was along the lines of ""praying the gay away"" and that they are closer than ever before, etc.  I question why the step-MIL would call my SO to inform of FIL's transgressions...why the step-MIL would not let the FIL break the news.  

&amp;#x200B;

My SO is distraught and feels lied to.  If the FIL is gay, why hide/lie/live in secrecy?  I don't think SO takes issue with the the possibility of new-found orientation but I'm not sure.  If the phone call to my SO would not have been made, my SO would not know any different...and now, with the FIL being silent, was the cheating to be kept a secret?  Was the possibility of a new sexual orientation meant to be kept a secret.  My SO cannot fathom saying nothing because SO feels everything has been a lie.  

&amp;#x200B;

My mind is a flurry of activity as is my SO's.  There are limited reasons for step-MIL's actions.  

1. She is looking to tear down the cheating husband by getting to my SO knowing that the events could tear apart their relationship (my SO is sensitive to cheating as SO's mom cheated on SO's dad which led to divorce)
2. She is looking to have her husband initiate the divorce, clearing her of misdeeds with her church.  FIL has good job, makes 6 figures, and there is a prenup.
3. She has good intentions...thinks my SO should know what is going on

My mind is kind of set on #1 due to her vindictive nature but wouldn't doubt #2 either.  I highly doubt #3 is a factor.  

&amp;#x200B;

My SO has not talked to FIL about any of this and he is in the dark that we know.  Personally, I do not have any gay friends (at least that I know of) and have zero experience in approaching situations where someone is either coming out, in denial, or has been outed in some way.  I don't necessarily take issue with personal choices or if the FIL discovered he is attracted to men but I seriously have no idea how to approach the FIL, nor does my SO.

&amp;#x200B;

There are some questions littered throughout the mess above, but here are a few more:

1. Should my SO confront/approach the FIL on any of the topics? (cheating, orientation, lies, secrecy, etc)
2. How should we or what is the best/preferred way to open a discussion on the topic of cheating?  On orientation?
3. Should the step-MIL's motives be questioned?

105,"Throwaway account because I use my handle for other things

I have a friend who's been with his girlfriend, both of which I've known for a few years now. I never really got too close to his GF because I could tell she was kind of two-faced/snakey, but we're not on bad terms on anything.

When they started dating, my friend would spend less and less time with me and our other friends, which I assume was pretty normal and paid it no mind. But as time went on we rarely even get to talk or hang out, and I noticed that he'd been basically spending his free time with her friends rather than us.

I figured it's up to him to choose who he spends time with, so I kind of paid it no mind until yesterday he asked me if I wanted to hang out with him and some of our other friends, to which I said sure, up until when we were supposed to meet he texted us that he would have to flake, and when I asked why, he simply said ""i have to flake"" ""and you know why"". When I asked him what he did, in half jest, he responded ""literally nothing, every fkn time"" which is the first time I've seen him actually be remotely frustrated about this.

My own bias is that he shouldn't have been in this relationship in the first place, and that I'm kind of worried that he's getting gaslighted, as many of our friends that we used to hang out with, including the girlfriend, were aware of her sort of snakey tendencies, which is why I believe she's doing her best to essentially isolate him from us and to surround him with her friends, who all we interested or engaged in a relationship with her in the past, and are essentially her yes-men, which to me mirrors classic propaganda techniques. 

I don't want to be all like ""you need to break up with her"" or anything as binary that, so I was hoping you all would have advice on how to address him and convince him to rethink his situation and put himself and what's good for him first for once, because for all the years I've known him, I think he's too nice for his own good, confirmed especially when I purposely did things to push his buttons just to see if he had the backbone to tell me off for being a prick. Or I could be reading too much into this and if you could confirm that for me, that would work too. I just need an outside opinion.

I did not feel that was correct since he was in compliance to the court order we made two years ago, but it has since expired last year. He was still making payments and trying his best. I understand sometimes people cant afford to make payments and I am caring. 

I cancelled the Child support last week before it proceeded to court and told my mom just tonight because its been gnawing on my conscious. (I am a very blunt person) and she straight up told me ""Get the hell out of my house. Why did you do that? You are only hurting your daughter. Your only hurting her."" I tried to confide and tell her that they have indeed been making payments and have been current up until now and I don't feel like getting the state involved in something that is already taken care of cordially and civilly. This is MY personal matter, not hers.

Her exact words to me were ""Its not fair - He gets to go out and get drunk, laid, smoke, and do whatever he wants acting like nothing ever happened and your stuck raising her."" (My mom has had a bad past with an abusive and X husband who she stuck it to in court for cheating on her)

&amp;#x200B;

She has since told me I need to move out because I am hurting my daughter by not proceeding with CS. I told her I have been working, I have been putting money away in an account for my daughter, that I do not need her telling me to get on child support, that life is not a game, etc. I feel that I have the choice in life in whether or not it is beneficial for my daughter. I am not OUT for blood like she was for her X husband.

I am going to move out here soon and just be done with the whole ""Living with Parents"" faze.

Edit: More info: Parents have been having trouble with debt and have been blaming it on my daughter and I that they had everything figured out before we moved back in. ---They accrued the debt before I was even living here again. -- Told us to get out and to ""F off"" and I stated what about my brother? They said he could stay. ((I give the hell up))

123,"I'm just wondering how normal is it to feel no emotions? 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't felt any emotion since at least last November. I guess I should also mention that the last time I remember being happy was in 2013, I think. For so long I wished that I could feel nothing but now that I do, I'm stuck. I like how much I can do almost anything because I don't have emotions or feelings that could stop me. But I hate how useless I feel as a person because I don't feel anything. It's been interfering with my life in numerous ways. I don't feel the pressure or motivation to do well in school, let alone show up or even do any work at all. I don't feel anything towards anybody I know, even people that I know I should be feeling a certain way towards but there just isn't any feelings at all. I can't feel emotions at all. The area in my body, in my abdomen and up to my chest where my emotions usually are is just a void. I guess the closest thing I can get to emotion is when the void inside that area echoes in my body, for lack of a better word. I don't know how to describe it besides it being like the void spreads throughout my body and it feels like it's consuming me. It comes at different points. Sometimes it's very short, sometimes it lasts quite a long time. I feel so helpless, impulsive and like life is just collapsing and swallowing me whole. That's a large reason why I'm posting this. I haven't found anything online about the ""void"" or numbness ""echoing""/spreading and I told a friend, who says she doesn't really feel emotions, about this when I was high and she was incredibly concerned. The other thing that's close to emotion is just pure boredom. I feel so bored in life overall, as well as in the tasks that I do. I feel bored all the time, just a whole stale feeling in my body. 

&amp;#x200B;

I self-destruct in order to try to feel emotions. I'll purposely fail a test, or not hand in an assignment just to try to feel something, but it never works. I do drugs, alcohol and smoke and they work, for a while. They make me feel something, but obviously that isn't sensible or sustainable. I constantly think about just leaving my town and my life behind and starting somewhere fresh, in hopes that it would cure my boredom and make me feel alive again. I guess the other odd thing is that I'm so confused. Most of me doesn't want to do anything but continue to self-destruct so I would have to move away and start again. A huge part of me doesn't want to feel emotions again. But, a very small part of me does, although, it isn't very prominent. I think I've just given up at this point.

131,"In a high school setting.

A good friend of mine is a fairly likable person. She's very gregarious and gets well with others. This causes people to like her a lot. Sometimes, it attracts people she does not want. People she doesn't really like or younger students that don't really fit within the friend group or just aren't for her. 

This would be fine, if not for the fact that she doesn't know how to say no.

What I mean by this is that, these people start to like her and want to become friends with her and such, but she does not want the same, but she can't tell them that. She seems to be unable to. 

When they ask if they can sit with us at lunch, it's always a yes. 

If they ask if they can come to an event with us, it's a yes. 

Problem is, the friend group suffers because of this, and overall enjoyment of our down-time declines greatly. So there is a lot of pressure on her to just tell them that she doesn't really see them as a friend. And no, we are not peer pressuring her. She also wants to cut it off, she just doesn't have the heart to. 

Not only this, but she is also a physically attractive person. Which probably contributes some to her likability to those she just met. But this also attracts somewhat creepy guys to her.  

This is where the problem of not being able to say no becomes a tad more important.

Lately, one such sort of creepy guy has seemingly caught an eye for her. He's a senior, and she, a sophomore, so (at least in the societal norms around here) it's seen as a bit odd. Not only this, but he has had a past of being generally unpleasant and very *forward* when he is attracted to somebody.

Multiple times now, he has hugged her unexpectedly, and she has not wanted it either time. She does not want him to invade her personal space. Problem is, she doesn't say anything about it. She just seemingly *can't*. 

She says that it's uncomfortable for her and all, but at least she made them at least enjoy their day a bit more. Yes, that's very kind of her, but at the same time, I feel that she should value her own comfort in certain situations as well. 

I am afraid that because she hasn't said anything, he will take that as a sign that she wants it, and I don't want him trying anything because of it. 

Really the first half is not as important as the second, but it still applies. So what I'm asking is:

Is there any good and kind way to tell someone that you do not really like them that much that I could suggest to her that she could use?

Is there really any way that I can help her realize that, sometimes, it's okay to say no?

132,"Hi Guys,

So I currently live in an apt with 3 other roommates (all friends) and it’s 3:30 am on a Saturday Morning, I went to sleep around 11 pm and was woken up to my drunk roommates coming back from bar and talking and playing video games. 

I asked them to turn it down and they did but not till half an hour later. 

It’s the beginning of the semester and I’m thinking about possibly moving out where we can change room selections. 

I would like to try to hash out with them times maybe we could have quiet hours but am unsure of how to do it being compromising but also fulfilling my needs as I value around 8 hours of sleep a night.

133,"Hey Reddit. Some of the stuff I wrote might be just heated out of emotion but just bear with me  as it is 75% true.

I’ve playing tennis for only about six months now and over those weeks of lessons, whenever a ball doesn’t go over the net or goes too high I start getting frustrated. If this continues,I get to a state where I really just want to destroy my racquet. 
And it isn’t just during lesson I experience this. A few moments ago I was having a rally with someone who looked at least 7 years older than me. I just had  a pretty frustrating lesson before it and my mum was watching which created a lot of pressure. He hits. I miss. He hits. I hit it poorly. And then I miss. My form just started declining in quality the more frustrated I got. 
I know this whole post might sound really childish but it has happened three times now and every time after a rally,I just start crying. 

I am generally below average in sport and have tried to improve so I don’t know why I feel so frustrated with little mistakes. This mainly happens for just sport and tennis. I don’t think I feel defeated like this in anything else. 
With these experiences, it has discouraged me from trying for the tennis team or even playing with other classmates. Just because I feel like I will break down and embarrass myself.
I don’t feel like quitting tennis anytime soon and I need to fix this issue. Any advice would be appreciated.

134,"Background : I work with very few people and the establishment in which I work was recently sold, this guy who was my coworker is now [by seniority] considered my manager. 

He frequently disappears to get high on the job, disappears to get food, basically is never working. Almost every time I am off he spams me begging me to come in because work is slammed and I’m the only one that does anything. 

So here’s the potential opportunity to say something about it to new ownership:

I had scheduled with my previous boss to have a couple days off. When I heard about the change coming in management I told my coworker who I knew would become my Manager. For him this was short notice but still over a week before my scheduled days off. My [then] boss who I was already in the clear with also told him when I would be gone.

So my day off was scheduled because of a class that I had registered for over a month ago. I told the new manager (old co worker) the day before, and the day before that, including a text I sent him a week in advance, and telling him in person a week in advance. 

The day comes, and I am receiving numerous texts and phone calls from my him [manager]. Because I’m in class I’m unable to respond. When I find the time to respond heres what I read.

Him:
“Are you planning on showing up or what?”
“Dude?”
*missed call*
“Perfect thanks”

Me: “Hey sorry I’m still busy with this class I won’t be making it in today.”

Him: “Would have been nice to know.”

Me: “Sorry, I cant respond much, still in class”

Him: “Ok np you can take it up with [the actual boss, (new owner)]

I called the actual boss and without going into the entire conversation he seems fine with it. Here’s the thing, this guy (my now manager) has been there for about 5 years, he was friends with the previous owners and so they let basically everything he did slide. They probably even put in a good word for him to the new owners. 


Tl;dr
So I have only been at this place for a year, how am I supposed to get the new owners to believe a word I say over someone who has been there for much longer and was left with praise from previous owners. The kid is an absolute dirt bag and waste of space. But I’m afraid they won’t believe anything I say. And it might even cost me my job

Hopefully more than 16 gb storage. Idk the material, but maybe something that will last a while? Like if it's made of plastic I'm good.

1)can Google stuff and download other browser apps
2)has YouTube
3) can check your email in the browser 
5) more than 16gb storage (please don't rec to me a 528mb phone that ended up in disaster last time)
6)can connect to internet/wifi 
7)(optional) maybe decent ram if possible but idk any of that stuff I'm bad with tech
8)(optional)like maybe still supported by the current operating system? Or maybe one that is just dropped by the operating system. Idk, but maybe not one that was not supported by like 3 years ago pls
9)if it can go on social media it would be nice, like without lag every time you touch the screen
10) pls be touchscreen phone, like a smart phone ya know
11)if made specificlly for a company/brand, not require activation when using, like it doesn't lock itself when it isn't activated. I'm fine if it comes preinstalled with the company's apps or whatever, but don't lock up 

Idc about brand either btw, also how do you buy a phone??? Like do you just give them the money and pick it out or is there like a special phone store that'll sell it to you without all the service plans or whatever? Like Target or a Street market place idk about the real world

142,"My younger brother by 2 years and I clash regularly. He has a short temper and gets mad over small things, while being very hypocritical. He gives little time to family as for him, it's all about friends, yet wants to get in on my business ventures. He's only really interested in money making, and nothing else, whereas my business ventures are about giving people services they lack. I continually tell him that once your friends settle into their lives, you keeping family second will result in no one wanting to spend time with you from your family. To elaborate, we once went to the gym together by car, and he wanted to hang out with a friend, so he kindly asked me and offered me change to take the bus home. He often says he's too tired to go on family dinners, but will hang out with friends. It really gives the vibe that we are on his time.  

He did poorly in high school, and he asked for my help to get him into a college. I did that, but still help him with other things such as dorm booking. He still gives off vibes like the world revolves around him.

What hurts me/angers me is when he speaks angrily with my mom, despite her not doing anything. But at the same time, he has a soft spot for her, as he frequently calls her when he is away for college. It's weird because I feel he looks up to me, but he still thinks he's superior to me. He does defend me, when others speak back bite me. 

When I visited him in college (same state but hours away), he was really humble, kind and open to advice. At home, he doesn't want to hear it, and does what he wants. He hangs out with conformists.

As a result, I'm confused. Do I help him, or should I kindly let him know that I wish to cut contact with him, so he can realize the type of toxicity/damage he causes?

He can be rude to me, but I can't stand my parents. He's angry one moment, but regretful the next.

Met this guy here online about a bit over a month ago (I’m a guy too, just a friendship, nothing more), we clicked really well, talked about lots of stuff, both serious and random, messed around and helped each other, like friends usually do. That was all really cool.

I’d say, like maybe two weeks ago he told me that he wasn’t feeling well and that he was sort of feeling antisocial. Gave him space and time. Checked up on him once or twice, told me that he was feeling better, but just not that well, so I just ended our last conversation with *take care man* and left it at that, presuming I guess that he would text me when he felt better.

I know he uses Instagram, but he still hasn’t texted me. Now this is where my question lies? Should I just move on from that relationship and don’t text him? I feel like I should move on, since my gut tells me that he’s not into it and doesn’t really want to talk. But there’s still that one percent that tells me I should text him first and see if he just didn’t want to do it first, you know? But then, it’s been two weeks, so I presume the conversation would be really short and awkward and end in the same way, and kind of don’t want to experience that.

He steals money, regularly. We’re by no means well off. A single mother raising twins probably never is. But my twin clearly doesn’t give a fuck. He’s stolen thousands at a time, cash advances on credit cards. Writing bank information down to use online secretly, running two lines of credit into the ground.

Doesn’t stop, keeps stealing. Moms crying herself to sleep as long as I can remember. But she won’t kick him out. And she won’t tell anyone. He steals the money for drugs, cries I’m sorry when caught, back to normal after.

I still have at least two semesters to go before I finish my master's degree, but I feel like everyone in my environment (friends as well as family) is so far ahead of me already and I'm still not done studying and therefore still not working and making money.

I know that comparing myself to others doesn't do any good, but I just can't seem to help it. My brother tells me he has a job interview in his field next week, and all I can think is ""Great, I'll be the only failure in our family because I'll never make as much as he will"". A friend of mine's doing a 6 month traineeship that already pays more than what I can expect to make 5 years into my career and I panic thinking about it. My pregnant cousin and her fiancé are planning on building a house and I go ""I'm never gonna be able to afford building a house or buying a place, I hope we can afford to have a family some day."" I see random people in the university library studying for their law or economics exams and my brain goes ""Oh hey, those people are all gonna earn way more than me"".

I hate that I think like that and I hate that I'm so envious and grudging all the time. When I talk to my boyfriend about my existential crises, he says ""Why are you so obsessed with salaries and money? It's not the most important thing in the world and we'll manage just fine, no matter what job you'll end up getting"" and I know he's probably right, and I never used to think money was so important. But in the past few weeks I just feel like everyone surpasses me and everyone's better than me, even though I know deep down that money doesn't make you more or less valuable as a human being. I feel like everything's a competition nowadays and I can't stop seeing life as exactly that - a competition.

By the way, none of these thoughts are put into my head by other people. My parents have always been supportive and have never pressured me, I know my friends appreciate me and my boyfriend constantly tells me how much he loves me and that he believes in me. All of this is me being hard on myself and I just don't know how not to be hard on myself.

When people tell me good news about their professional lives, I want to be able to genuinely be happy for them and not secretly think ""Damn, why is everyone better than me"" or ""Why can't I be interested in the stuff that makes good money"".

I don't consider myself too vanilla (I've had to work at a hotel while they hosted a furry convention, so I've seen it all), but it's uncomfortable thinking about a sister of mine engaging in activities like this.  It's like if your dad started talking about the porn he watches before he goes to bed - it's not a conversation I enjoy having.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I bear with it until she finds a friend in the community to talk about this with?  Or should I say something?  I don't want to break her confidence, and I want to support her as much as I can, especially in a city where she doesn't know that many people.  But I also don't want to talk about safewords while riding the bus to work.",08Sep2018,1

167,"Backstory: 

My friend and I thought this guy was handsome. My friend has been hung up on her ex and has always told me she can’t imagine getting with anyone else. She’s expressed how she thinks he’s cute, but has always seemed neutral or disinterested in pursuing. I am not interested in dating or messing around with the guy. But at the party we were both drinking and flirting. Nothing else happened. My friend leaves the party pissed off and tells me I can pick up my stuff in the living room. (We had the intention of having me stay over at her place). She’s telling me how it’s girl code if you think a guy is cute you can’t go after him. Which seems a bit irrational. I would understand her being upset if this was a guy she’s actively pursued, dated, messed around with, etc. But they haven’t talked outside of the two parties we have seen him at. So I get my stuff, but since I was intoxicated, I just slept in my car until I sobered up and then went home. Now I’m thinking about how this seems ridiculous. And I just wanted to reach out to reddit and check to see if this situation makes me an asshole or not. 

Tldr: my friend left me at a party because she was mad i was flirting with a guy she thought was cute, but she isn’t actively dating/pursuing. i had to sleep in my car since I was still buzzed because she didn’t want me sleeping at her place. ",08Sep2018,1

So I declined several girls that wanted to meet just she wouldn't think I had moved on to others. Suddenly yesterday after it was almost certain she was into me again she sends med snaps of her with another guy, stroking his hair, watching movies and being in bed with him. 

So I'm looking for advise how I should handle this situation. Should I try to move on for real this time since there was actually no positive things about but the way she made me feel. almost every one in the class dislike her and calls her names behind her back after how she handled the the last breakup or do you guys and girls have any other advice?",08Sep2018,1

But this younger guy that I met at a party recently seems to want me to use them on him. Like he wants me to press my vibrator against his dick to help him cum.

He says that his gay friend bought him a vibrator a few years ago and that he likes using it to get off.

I think this is so effing creepy like why would a guy even need or want this.

Can’t he cum like a normal guy? He seems like a creepy perv but tbh I love the good dick downs that he’s been giving me. And he is pretty hung too so there’s that lol

Can anyone share their experiences with this kind of thing? I have always thought that sex toys are a woman’s thing and that it’s there to help us because we have different sexual needs down there and need some extra stimulation sometimes. Why TF would a guy need or want one though? Cant his dick just work like it’s supposed to? Could he be gay or suffering from a mental illness? Or possibly a pedo?

I'm a 19 year old girl and my life is very chaotic, I have self destructive behaviours and often negative emotions about myself. I hate myself. I have zero friends and keeping up with school is difficult. I also self harm by cutting several times a week. I thought they'd at least take the cutting seriously, but they didn't. They just told me I'm not depressed (hurray?) And that they'd send an application to some therapy place but that it'll take months for them to call me back and they might not. 

It seems the only way to be taken seriously is if you constantly try to kill yourself. I've done pill overdoses before which I told them, but with the intention to feel fuzzy rather than to kill myself.

My parents supposedly fund my social life and pay me to do chores round the house, so that I don't have to work and I can focus on my A levels. Sounds fairly decent doesn't it? Except it doesn't happen. I haven't been paid in about 8 months, and the last time I asked them for money (£25 so I could go to a friend's gig) they didn't share the cash and I had to borrow off another friend to make it.

Irritating, but no real cause for alarm or anger compared to what else I've dealt with. Of course that was until I told them I was going to get a job. Cue the response ""No you aren't, we pay you!""
This gets my hackles up as the gig and £25 loan happened YESTERDAY. 

Long story short, as so often happens, we reach what is usually an impasse. I'm told that I can have the job, but only if I find somewhere else to live. This is a threat that they seem to love to use, and it happens often ( and not with any of my three siblings fyi) and honestly I'm pissed now.
They control, they threaten, and they abuse and I've had enough. I want to move out but I have no money, no idea of what to do or where to go. Help?

Cheers for reading through my wall of text, any advice would be a godsend BUT pls pls don't advise counseling or making up with them. It's all been tried and they just don't care, I want out and I need advice regards this.

I told my insurance what happened and they sent me an email and told me someone was dealing with it, I’ve now got a letter from this guy and it’s him taking me too court for £8000 do I have any ground to stand on or is it my fault automatically cause I’ve gone into the back of him ?? ",08Sep2018,6

Said they took the canoe instead of kayaks, and offhand mentioned something about there being space to lie down in it.

Mentioned at one point her friend noticed they were gone so she took a kayak out on the pond they were on and started calling out to them (said she didnt hear it, but this pond is barely big enough to be called a pond and noise travels over water).

Her friend went back in to get their other classmates and gf said next thing there were a bunch of flashlights coming down the hill looking for them when they decided to head back in.

Normally we sleep naked unless shes on her period (obv reasons), but since she got back shes been very receptive of sex right up until it happens when she says its still her period, although has no problem sleeping naked that same night.

Am i being paranoid?

I am coming through the other side of the tunnel with my cancer. It’s pretty much beaten by this point and I’ve gotten a clean bill of health from the doctors to move on with my life as normal. However, the mental issues my cancer has left me with is the worst part. I’m constantly scared now. I’m always either in a knack or I have a panic attack right under the surface ready to blow. I mean, my hormones are still very out of balance after all this so that has a major part to do with it too. But, I’ve been fighting this thing every day now for so long, fighting for my life. Now it’s so suddenly over. 

There was no cool down phase, nothing slowly regressing. I went from fighting for my life every day to, BOOM it’s all over, you can go home now. It’s hard to change gears that quickly into thinking you’re just fine when last month you were fighting with everything you had. 

“It feels like you are choking above water. Like oxygen isn’t what you need to survive. It feels like you get full breathes of air while at the same time nothing 

It feels like your world is spinning out of control. There is an extreme dizzying nausea. A sinking behind your eyes that puts everything out of focus.

A weakness comes over you that is unimaginable. It makes your face and extremities numb with pins and needles all over. It’s so powerful and wracking it feels like you body, limbs, extremities, etc. are going to fall off of your body.

Overwhelming debilitating dread and sorrow assail you press against you with the weight of the Earth. So much so it feels like a darkness is literally pushing your very spirit and being out of your body causing you to feel a complete lack of control.

You could have the world around you supporting you and leaning on them but nothing helps. You feel completely alone because there is nothing for anyone to do but to watch.

You have to walk alone through hell with nothing but overwhelming dread and sorrow surrounding you until you eventually find a way out.

In your mind you are undoubtedly, unconsolably, convinced that you are about to die.”

I wrote this one night when a fit of insomnia kept me up during my treatments. People always asked me how I felt and I could never put it into words. So one night I spent about 4 hours writing down how these dark feelings feel. How bad my panic attacks really are, and how desperate I am to get better. After feeling this way for months and months straight has got to have it’s mental toll on someone right? I’ve been reading blogs and other websites saying thyroid cancer (along with all other cancers) is extremely taxing on your mind. Since it screws with all your hormones. 

After fighting cancer and those feelings for so long and having finally beaten cancer, I don’t feel like I have the strength left to keep on fighting these emotions. I’m so.... so.... tired. I want to be done fighting so I can finally rest. ",08Sep2018,30
194,"When I was in high school and college, I was on part of our school broadcasting program and ""Kevin"" also participated. We were teammates and friendly, ran around with similar people/went to same parties, but we weren't friends. Anyways, he had serious anger issues, got kicked out of our program in college, shot someone in anger, and was sentenced to serious prison time. 

My mom is an idealistic, wonderful lady who doesn't think things through. Anyways, when he went to prison, she kept in touch and has become his go-to to the point where she and my dad visit him regularly (his family is shitty), and my parents have agreed to allow him to live with them when he gets out on parole later this year. He has done well in prison, getting his associate's degree, and being a peer leader for new inmates. He was mostly nice when I knew him, minus serious anger problems. 

I am glad my mom is super helpful, love her goodwill, but am furious that she did this without consulting anyone else in our family. I have a toddler at this point, and Kevin is now all of the sudden getting ready to be a huge part of my parents' lives, and mine by proxy. We spend a lot of time with my parents, and my mom babysits for us frequently. 

Last year when he knew he was close to getting out, he wrote me a letter basically saying he wants us to feel like family, and for me and my husband to be involved heavily in his life. This letter freaked me out considerably--he is trying to create something that was never there. While I want the best for this person, we were not even friends in college/not someone I would call to hang out with. I wrote him back, told him I wished him the best, but we could not be these people for him. He has not written me since.

I don't want Kevin in my life. He's moving in with my parents--I feel like he's going to be at holidays all of the sudden, and around my young son, with which I'm not comfortable. Reddit, advice? I've talked to my parents once about this, and they seem to not be concerned, act like he will be working all of the time and they're just housing him. I don't think this is true...I think he wants to really get enmeshed in my family, and I do not want it. Don't care if it's selfish, his letter creeped me out, and I'm worried it's going to hurt my relationship with my family.

John is a gay man and for the past year has had his most stable relationship to date. His boyfriend (let's call him Chad) is a musical theatre director and is on the road a lot.

I apologize for the length of this passage, as I really need to vent and get help at the same time, but I don't know what to do.

I am a nineteen-year-old straight male just starting my sophomore year of college. Just to give you an image, I have plain, uninteresting, brown hair and a kind of pale-green eyes. I am slightly overweight, but with better dietary and exercise habits, I have been trending downward for the past five months.
I first acknowledged the concept of having a relationship when I was in fifth grade. I figured that once middle school came around, since that's when it appeared that people started to experiment, I'd be able to grow and experience what I expected I would. Turns out that was a crock of shit, as middle school is middle school. I went in with unrealistic expectations, but the main thing to grab from this is that having a relationship was something I have wanted since I was ten years old.

I've been single the entire time. I had one brief ""fling"" so to speak when I was seventeen, but I don't count it for a variety of reasons. I've had my fair share, maybe even more than my fair share, of social issues and unrealistic/incorrect social expectations. I never realized many of the things it actually takes to find a relationship, and I've been cognizant of my failures. So it is not as if I blame others for my perpetual solitude like an incel. (I bear no ill will towards anyone for my being frustrated and upset, and I strictly blame myself. And frankly, I find it pathetic that I have to explicitly differentiate myself from incels. They make people associate my personal issues with them and it makes me angry.) Another thing precluding a potential relationship was my weight. I am 5'9"", but throughout high school I weighed 258 pounds. At the start of my senior year, I weighed 208 pounds, and that's where I am now after I bounced back up between senior year and freshman year of college and then lost it over this past summer.

I know that this is fairly common, a nineteen year old with no relationship or sexual experience. However, what I don't think is common is being completely obsessed with having a relationship to the point where my satisfaction with my life is completely contingent on it. It's in my thoughts every moment of the day. Every time I do anything, I think about what it would be like to do with somebody. Everything from running errands to studying to just watching TV. It doesn't help that I am surrounded by secure, experienced, and socially competent friends. Granted, they're mostly just college bros looking for their ""fix"", so to speak, so whatever I discuss with them is within the context of just sex, not relationships. My insecurity is consistently fed by casual, friendly slights as to my status, accompanied by condescending remarks such as ""you'll understand someday"". None of them care for commitment so that's one more thing they don't understand. Also, this is definitely a factor, but I have a hard time explaining it: I feel such a strong, unrelenting desire for affection. It actually, physically makes my heart hurt to think of someone telling me they love me, giving me a hug or a kiss, running their hand through my hair... all of that kind of stuff.

I've tried to get deep down into the roots of why I am like this. I believe myself to be quite introspective, especially because I've had issues with therapy before and I have to make up for lost ground. And the only possible explanation from my upbringing that could have led to this issue is that for my whole life my parents have been separated and divorced (I was only fourteen months old when it happened). My dad resented and continues to resent my mother, and has never given up an opportunity to talk about her negatively (she never wronged him officially, it was just a messy divorce precipitated by a decade-long collapse). My mother only occasionally mentions positive life experiences with my father, but to this very day, I don't understand how they could have ever loved each other at all. My father remarried and it has been a very successful and happy marriage for ten years, but there were so many issues between me, my father, and my step-mother that prevented me from learning anything from them. I don't really speak to either of them at this point.

Love is a language I can't understand, even though I know I am very capable of loving (just not being loved). I feel like I am one of those factory defects that fell off the conveyor belt, fine in every way except with one glaring flaw that can never be fixed. My more supportive friends have told me that I would be fine and capable in any relationship/sexual context, but I don't believe them; I can't find anybody I like enough to approach romantically, so I have no way to find out anyway. I'm not attractive or witty enough to take the quicker route and just straight-up approach someone I find attractive. Love is a language I cannot understand.

This issue... it eats away at me every day. I feel ridiculously insecure, I am hopelessly self-deprecating, all accompanied by an unrelenting yearning for affection. I just want it to go away. I am so angry and upset that I'm in this ridiculous situation, and I want to shake my fist at the world and live unhappy and alone for the rest of my life just to spite it. I am consistently feeling alone, upset, and angry. My life that I am supposed to be living for myself feels empty without someone else, and ruled by her absence. There is something wrong with me, and I don't know what.",08Sep2018,1
207,"This girl sits across from me in my AVID and she’s pretty sweet and kind.


She talks to me a lot and makes a lot of jokes , she a lot of times makes jokes like “bro you suck... jk jk I love you as like a friend I’m glad we’re friends”, I can’t tell if it’s teasing or just a general dislike for me.


She does speak to me a lot and even does it in the halls, it’s wierd for me since she’s one of the popular girls and since I’m so outgoing and have a wack taste of humor targeted towards guys not many speak to me. Although I’ve stated to hang out with a lot more of the “popular” guys so I’m not unknown.


Only problem is the girl in my neighborhood, I went on a date with her a month ago and planned on asking her on a second, I even offered to go to a volleyball game for her, I wonder if she finds out she’s gonna be hurt. I don’t wanna hurt her since I still like her well enough.",08Sep2018,1

211,"So I just moved to a new state about 6 hours from where I used to live. Me and my gf decided to try and make long distance work. We can’t see each other a lot, I’ve been here for almost two months and I’m starting to lose feelings for her. We’ve been dating for 2 years. I used to feel so strongly in love with her but now it just feels like our time is up, and it doesn’t help that we’re always arguing. I honestly just want to break up now but I still love her I care about her I just don’t want to be with her, I’m tired of being tied down. But it’s not her fault and even if I tell her that I’m still scared that she’s gonna take it out on herself and become depressed because she doesn’t have many friends to help her through stuff like that. So I know that I want to end it but the catch is before I moved I put all of my family’s stuff in her shed because we had no other place to put it and didn’t have the money for a uHaul or storage. Knowing her if we break up and she takes it badly she’s gonna either destroy all of our stuff or let her dogs piss all over it. So since I want to break up I have to wait until we get our stuff back and pretend like I still love her and it feels so unhealthy I feel like shit. On top of all of that I met someone at my new school. She’s drop dead gorgeous, has a good sense of fashion and humor, we have a lot of the same interests, we’re both new to the school (but I’ve lived here before so I’m dying to show her all of the traditions my family has started here), she’s ethnic and could introduce me to so many new and different things, she’s a clean eater, and she likes to travel. So here’s the deal with this girl. I’m really into her idk if she can tell but I got her number. I texted her and she never replied so that obviously bummed me out and made me feel like she isn’t interested in me. But when we’re together we talk non stop like we just seem so compatible. And I start to think what if she is interested and we hangout and end up taking things to another level. What am I gonna do if I’m still with my gf. That’s like the biggest cock block ever. Even though I don’t love my gf anymore I don’t want to cheat on her I have respect for her. But I also want to be with this girl so bad I’m always thinking about her. And if I explain the situation to her that’s gonna completely turn her off, it’s gonna show her that if me and her end up long distance that I’m might do the same shit to her and she’s not gonna want anything to do with me. Also she would know that I was flirting her up and shit while I already have a gf, which would make her think I would do the same thing as well. So I’m basically fighting a six way internal battle in my head. Sick of my relationship vs my stuff is gonna be destroyed vs I don’t want to send my gf into depression vs I want to be with the girl of my dreams vs this girl doesn’t even want me vs we could be such a good couple. In conclusion I’m completely tore to bits, idk what to do, I need help. Just to clear things up for your answers, neither of them know about each other. Your advice would be kindly appreciated. Thank you.",08Sep2018,2
213,"TL;DR - Should I ask a guy out again who had rejected me, because the circumstances that led to him rejecting me have changed? 

I'm a 24 year old female, and I work for a large company on a contract that is up in about 4 weeks. While working for the company, I met a guy that I really clicked with. He's pretty shy, but he has a sense of humour that's really similar to my own. We started talking to each other completely by chance one day because he overheard me talking about a band that we both like. It turns out that we're both into the same bands and movies, so we started chatting fairly often about pop culture, and a little bit about our personal lives. 

A few months ago, I decided to ask him out (we had been talking for about a month at this point). I was totally thinking that he was going to say yes, because I was picking up interested vibes from him and we seemed to be hitting it off really well. I was really surprised when he said no. He said that he didn't want to mix his personal life and his work life (I totally get that, and that had been my thinking always until I met this guy), and that he wouldn't want either of us to say something to the other outside of work that could get either of us in trouble. 

However, since that rejection, we've gotten much closer. There have been a few times that we've been at the office for about 2 hours at the end of the workday chatting after most people have gone home. Although we still talk about pop culture and tease each other, we've started talking about much deeper topics as well, stuff that I haven't even discussed with guys that I've been on a few dates with. He's shown me video clips and sent me articles that he thinks I would like, and he remembers stuff that we talked about a few months ago. I know that he's not doing this with other girls, so it's not like he's just flirting with everyone in the office.

I think that the other guys in his department have also noticed that there's something going on, because they will bring him up unprovoked a lot to me about how funny and awesome he is. One of his coworkers even called us lovebirds a few weeks ago. 

Recently, I found out that my contract isn't being extended, so I will definitely be leaving next month. I would like to see this guy outside of work, because I feel like there's a real connection. However, I'm not sure if I should ask him out again, or if I should just wait to see what he does? I'm also not sure if he's interested, as I thought I was pretty good at reading him but I had thought he would say yes to hanging out previously.

Thank you in advance for reading!

214,hello Reddit! I(M20) am living with strict parents(M60 and F50) and I have an upcoming camp at an island near the city this October. I really want to it because I am one of the facilitators of the camp and we'll be teaching Photoshop to people. however I have strict parents who do not allow me to go to camps unless it's an official school activity. there was one time where he let me go to a camp that wansnt school related and when he found out we argued till he told me to get out of the car and walk home. I was very angry and I really wanted to get out of the house already. my father's reason for not letting me go is that because he was not raised that way and he thinks that it is not right. my father is 60 and my mother is 50 they're pretty old fashioned when it comes to everything. my father lived with his parents till he was 40. he thinks he's always right and always obeys his parents and my mother till she was 30. they won't let me go home on my own cause they always want to pick me up in case something bad might happen to me like I'd get murdered or kidnapped. they wouldn't even let me ride in my friend's car because apparently we might crash the car because they think my friends are reckless people but they aren't and they are good responsible people who take good care of me. I am turning 20 years old and I have never had a sleep over at a friend's house. i think it is time I go out on my own and see and experience things Ive missed out on before I turn old have no experiences in life like them.,08Sep2018,3
215,"So I struggle with anxiety, I have for a while now. And for the most part I’ve learned to manage it fairly well. But I notice one of the biggest things I get anxiety over is fear of abandonment and other abandonment related issues, to the point where I will feel physically uncomfortable in my chest/stomach, or even have panic attacks where the thoughts in my head on loop are related directly to fear of being abandoned by the people I love. Which causes me to reach out for comfort (“are we ok” etc) which causes me to feel guilty/afraid I’m driving the person further away with my need for comfort. Which continues the cycle. 

I feel like I obsess, often, over things like if my boyfriend is falling out of love with me, if my best friend is drifting apart and our friendship will never be the same, etc. to the point where I fear my anxious thoughts will negatively effect those relationships, if they haven’t already. But I can’t turn it off. No matter how comforting the other party is, I get into this headspace where I can’t be convinced they aren’t gearing up to leave me.

219,"Two days ago I made a post. The post in brief was my girlfriend who I've known for over 10 years and were in a relationship with for 8 years had broken up with me and I was looking for some advice.
I'll try to keep this post as short as possible and address the main issues I would like advice on.

I ranted and got some really good advices, but unfortunately also got some hate. I didn't think much about it initially, but now all I've been doing just that. If I was the shit person in our relationship just deluding myself. 
Some of the mistakes I've made were calling my girlfriend, wife. Whenever I asked her if she would marry me the answer was always yes, We were completely honest in our relationship I'm positive she would not lie about it. She always wanted me to refer to her as wife rather than girlfriend and I've always liked that. I even proposed and gave her a ring, we were set to marry in 2019 Regardless was it wrong of me to do such a thing? 

Secondly, I had sex with my ex's sister a few times. I was never in a relationship with my ex at the time and I really didn't know much about her. I was young and just fooling around.
The sister eventually ended up in a relationship, but not before she introduced me to my ex.
It was awkward at first but we eventually ended up liking each other and in a relationship. Our relationship was built around honesty, so I was honest about everything. The only thing I did not tell her was I had sex with her sister, because I thought it didn't really matter. Fast forward when my girl broke up and I made that post on reddit and people have been calling me pathetic and disgusting for playing the victim. I'm sure my ex does not know.
I'm a loyal man, I could never imagine cheating on my so for any reason. I felt better for a few hours but it dawned upon me after getting so many messages calling me a shit human being that I'm most likely in the wrong. 
Now that we are broken up it doesn't matter, but should I have told her this when we were in a relationship?

One other thing regarding my relationship was I let her go out to the movies with her male friends. I called it giving her freedom I know it's not wise to say I gave freedom to an adult. They already have that, but in the perspective of a relationship I'm sure many can relate to me that we feel jealous that something might happen and they might end up liking each other. Was is right of me to let her go to the movies with her male friends?

The last issue is an expansion of the previous one. I asked her not to work, because some of her friends were clearly taking advantage of her. She still liked helping and doing their work even if that meant staying up late. I was extremely worried that people take advantage of her kindness. I wanted to stop this and said I could provide for her.
I made a reddit post on this as well. I eventually took reddit's advice and let her be, and decided to help if it makes her feel good.
I would like to know if it was wrong of me to do this, that I shouldn't have brought it up?

I ended up giving my ex a call just so I know what went wrong, especially since our relationship was which I thought perfect. The answer was she just wasn't in love with me anymore, she fell out of it. I have no reason to doubt this woman. So if love is something that we can fall out of, what is the point of getting into a relationship and spending so much time and not to mention the effort into it? I would like to know your perspectives.

I'm really sorry for this post and for taking your time. I'm at the worst point of my life and all I can think of is to talk to someone, but I do not want my sadness affect anyone. So I've distanced myself from friends and family until I get better. Reddit is the only place I can think of that could help me.
I'm really sorry and I thank you guys a lot for spending your time reading this and even more for anyone who answers.

227,"Reddit!  


I come seeking advice on how to deal with a toxic and mentally unstable family member?

This woman has recently started claiming that she was interned in a mother and baby home and that she had a child stolen from her. She claims to have been sedated and that the records of her time in hospital and the birth were burned and now she is searching for her ""lost"" son.

Now let me be very very clear on this, this woman was never in such a home and her 1st child was born @5yrs after the time she is claiming. She is however taking parts of my Mother's story and creating a whole new victim narrative to seek attention.

My concern now is twofold, 1st off she has attached herself to a lot of ""Survivor"" groups and is sharing the story and embellishing it.  
Those women are vulnerable and all too ready to support a fellow victim.  
My worry is that she could become the ""face"" of one of those groups and the damage it would do when she is outed would do extreme harm to an already abused cohort of survivors.  


Secondly she is claiming dates that were actually when my mother was in such a home, as my mother has now passed away I'm fairly sure it is part of a long game plan to try and avail of any redress or compensation that may become available.  
I don't want any, nor do I feel I'm entitled to any!  
I came home after all.  
But she appears to be massaging her resemblance to my mother, to convince people that it was her and not my Mother who was there.  


The best description I've ever heard of this woman was given by her Father, shortly after Beverly Allitt was arrested for child murder.  
At the time, her 1st born was constantly in and out of hospital. Being very sick at home, but recovering and fine shortly after admittance to hospital. Only to be released and the cycle start again.  
Anyway her Father had an epiphany when he heard about Munchausen's syndrome and by proxy and said ""if there's ever a name for what (She) has... That's what it is!""

&amp;#x200B;

I cut ties with this woman over 14 years ago but the stories and the fallout still comes back.

Previous efforts at confronting on a group or family basis have resulted in her getting very violent and even going so far as to lodge false and very damaging allegations with the Police.  
Part of me is thinking that public exposure on a large scale will push her towards the help she needs, but she is so wrapped up in her fantasy that I'd worry it could push her to harm.  


If we lived in a non twitter/outrage mob era, I'd totally be talking to a journo mate already but when I look at how quickly that spirals, I wonder if I want to put her through it.

230,"I'm female in my thirties and grew up in this \[small\] city, but I met a guy and lived in his country for five years before our relationship broke down - I found myself back home with nothing, with no job or recent work history to get a job and suffering severe depression, I also found all my friends had moved on. I'm still struggling to get back on my feet.  


I went on Meetup to try to meet new people, I found a great group of people my age and who enjoyed going to all the places I like going, I'm socially awkward and depression is a bitch so I still struggled to make friends but it gave me a social life. Then a new member joined, he became very popular and close with the main members, we ended up dating and at first we were exceptionally happy as it felt like we were made for each other...but he became abusive, we ended.

Now this group is a no-go, even if my ex hasn't told lies about me the members of the group are now more his friends, also as Meetup groups tend to intermingle and he's involved with them all this means Meetup is a write-off all together. Plus places I like to go (including a bar I've been going to since twenty years ago, a place I've always felt comfortable and the core of the local music scene) now feels unsafe as there's now this risk of running into my ex or his friends.

While I'm at home alone my ex is out with this group having the time of his life, it feels deeply unfair.

I've tried to do other things to meet new people but I'm just failing.

I volunteer for three different charities but there's not really much opportunity to make friends as either I'm busy working or I'm dealing with people like sex offenders and homeless youth, I used to go to the gym but it was all muscle-head guys focused on their workouts, I tried climbing but that's more a solo thing, I tried various other free activities too but other people trying these activities were often elderly people not peers. I'm not even sure how people my age make friends, it seems we already have our friend groups or if not I'm assuming many of us are just content binging Netflix.

I'm not sure what else to try to make new friends.

I'd like regular social contact like a club, people I could just ask to hang out for coffee or to play pool, and a social group I can go to clubs with to have fun like I had prior to moving abroad or briefly had via this Meetup group. I just don't know how to achieve this. Not knowing where to meet people or how to find situations with potential to make friends is bad enough, but being socially useless and depressed also makes it so difficult to make connections with people too.

232,"I have a lot of issues, but this one is particularly pervasive right now. 

Last summer I got my first job, as a janitor at a Catholic children’s summer camp. To be honest, I was terrible at this job, and I hated it, too. I tried my best to be efficient *and* get the job done so I could spend as little time doing it as possible, but one day my boss called me after work and he was *pissed*, rightfully so.

I’d skipped cleaning a place because it was in use, and I was told not to go in to this particular place if it was in use... so I didn’t. My boss was upset, and he went to inspect the place. In a panic, because it was my first time being reprimanded for anything in awhile.. I quit that job. 

For the remainder of that summer, I felt like my mom hated me(who’d helped me get the job in the first place), and that I was a failure for having quit after being given a chance to learn and improve. 

When I quit, I told my boss that I knew I would just go back to my old ways, even if I was taught how to clean everything properly(which is probably true, or at least I think so). 


So, ever since then, I’ve been afraid to do just about anything for fear of failing again. 

TL;DR: i had a job, i quit the job, i felt like a failure, now i’m afraid to do anything cause i don’t wanna be any more of a failure ",08Sep2018,1

At first I thought she was shy or uncomfortable around new people. But she only ignore me, my one other roommate, and our friends. I have been here about a month while all the other have lived together for about 2 years.

It did not bother me at first. Made things awkward but I respect if she does not want to be my friend. What has been bothering me is how she will ignore us and then tell our other roommates to tell us or send a group text about issues she wants fixed.

236,"So we've been together for over a year, things are pretty serious but I can't stand his brother.  We used to get along really well but then he (the brother) stole from me and was kicked out of the house (he'd done it to other family members before).

Everyone seemed more concerned that the brother was having 'problems' again than the fact he was a thief.

I made it clear that I want nothing to do with the brother, and that if we do end up married, he won't be welcome in our home and our kids won't have anything to do with him.  His eldest brother has the same view, but my boyfriend has kept in touch with little thieving brother and keeps offering him advice.

Recently, little thieving brother has been allowed back into the house, he hasn't apologised or offered to replace what he stole.  He hasn't even mentioned it.  Neither has anyone else.  My boyfriend thinks I'm being unreasonable.

What do you think reddit?  Should we break up?  The brother thing is a big part of it, but what I worry about most is my boyfriend's attitude.  If we have kids and they're thieves, I want zero tolerance, not 'oh why is little billy stealing' or whatever.  Boyfriend claims that he'll do this but his behaviour towards his brother suggests otherwise.  I don't know what to do, I really do love my bf but I don't want my children growing up in a household where they get away with this sort of stuff.  Any advice is very much welcomed.

N.B. his brother had his own things he could have sold, he actually kept them at the house and then my boyfriend let him in to pick them up.  So no, he didn't need to steal from me.

Edit: so yeah, this is less about me hating his brother and more about me worrying that my bf will excuse any shitty behaviour from our kids like he does with his brother. ",08Sep2018,1

Not that my preference for older guys is necessarily a problem but what I've realised after losing my virginity a month ago is that sex has in a way, lost its meaning for me as I no longer see it to be something special. Recently, I've just been hooking up with countless guys (all of which are significantly older e.g 27, 31) which is something I've never done, even if my asian parents were devastated after finding out I had sex and made me promise that I wouldn't do it again/would cut off all connections with any guy who I could potentially hook up with.  This, to me, isn't really a healthy way to approach guys and relationships in the future. 

After reflecting upon myself and taking advice from my close friends/peers, I think it may have to be a coping mechanism  to deal with the pressures of senior year/college apps and to feel validated and important even just being 'myself' without having to meet the high standards that my parents have set for me for so many years and be the perfect daughter. The thing is, although I enjoy the sex itself, I don't necessarily think that this is who I am on the inside. At the same time, I don't know how to suddenly stop doing something that I, at the moment, correspond with bringing me happiness.

My mom who I had the most contact with always let bad men in her life and did a lot of selfish abusive stuff emotionally. Or my sister and her husband who always used agism to discredit my thoughts or feelings even though they still do it to me in my late 20s. Or my other sister who I get along with and she understands most things but keeps me limited contact. My family gets together without me anyway and then tells me about it. There's mostly bad memories and the only reason I have stayed in contact at this point is because I felt like I really wished I could have a good family and also I been treated like I'm obligated to go. 

I think I'm too hurt by the way I've been treated to keep seeing them. They've just done a lot of fucked up things to me in my life. And I know they will call me the bad person for not coming. A bad uncle and a bad brother.

So as the title says, my mother is a hoarder (in denial). The stuff she buys she never uses, and it keeps on piling up. I'd say that she spends at least 50-150 dollars a month going to those consignment stores. 
The topic of hoarding has been brought up around her before. Whenever she is accused of hoarding, she throws a tantrum (containing mostly guilt tripping and just screaming ""I'm not a hoarder!"" despite the house looking the way it does). When I try suggesting to her to clean up, she says that she will, but when the time comes around, hardly any work is done and there's already 2-3 items taking the previous item's place (kind of like a hydra). My dad and I share the same views on her hoarding, yet he enables her because of the way she acts once she's been accused of something. My mother is also the one who handles the finances, the vehicles, etc.
The way the house looks has had a big impact on my mental health.

Also, not that it really matters, but I want to clarify beforehand that my wife and I arent bad with finances. 8 years of renting different apartments, we've never missed a payment. This is just circumstantial.

So, my wife and I moved into a new place in April. First few months were fine: we sent the rent in the mail a few days before the first, and he would cash it a few days later. The last check he cashed was in June. Here's whats happened since:

Middle of July, we noticed he hadn't cashed it yet, so I texted him asking if he got it, and when he planned on cashing it, and he didn't answer. We called in late July and left a VM, no answer. Sent him August rent. Still didn't cash July. Mid July he stopped by the house to give us the water bill, he didn't say anything (and I forgot to ask). Never cashed August. Sent him September's rent, hadnt cashed it. Today, he called to let us know we over paid him for the rent, so I'm assuming he's planning on cashing 3 months at once (a total of 2800). The problem is, we dont have that much. We had car issues mid August, and we thought we had more money, but after we noticed we were short (withdrawals from our account didn't show up for a long while, so that messed us up). On top of that, there was a banking issue, so we have around 1300 right now. Granted, I know this would've happened eventually, but I thought we had more time to figure money out.

If he tries to cash all 3 checks at once, and 2 bounce, is he fully in the right to get super pissed? Or since he waited 3 months to cash anything, or even touch base, do we have some leeway as to how to handle the situation? Like, I realize that rent was due, but he has continually neglected to acknowledge anything, even when we asked him about It, and even when he stopped at the house.",08Sep2018,1

So knowing this even if I could, I just don't want to get back anymore. but the accusation is still left, it's what these people believe about me.

I seem to be very very sensitive to false accusation, it feels like I lost my autonomy to the perception that is not true instead. It's something I really hate in social relationships. Even now I can't shake of the feeling.

I just thought what if he was right and my memory didn't serve me well? The guy was likely trying to manipulate me due to how he says thing repeatedly and shut down anything that lead me to claim that he wad wrong.... Perhaps I should try to delude myself into it?

How can I deal with this kind of thoughts and has anyone here lost to a false claim that affected you im some way? It really sucks.",08Sep2018,1
264,"I'm a seventeen year old male living in georgia, being treated for depression and anxiety, and being tested for bipolar disorder. They are considering bipolar because of my problems with anger. I'll be okay for a while and then I'll just snap. I'll scream, yell, break things. That sort of thing. I don't hit anybody though. There's not much i can be proud of, but I'm proud of that.

I snapped again last night. There's a lot of shit leading up to the actual outburst, and i'm not the best at explaining or writing, so sorry if i do a bad job.

It had been a while since I had snapped or had any sort of trouble, I had built fairly good relationships with the marching band people i was hanging out with last night. Especially with my girlfriend. We've gotten far in our relationship and it was looking pretty good. I've been under stress lately, with the problems of me being on probation and my issues with school, but the frustration really started building 3 days ago. I was informed of the murder of an old friend and his daughter. I'm not going to go into detail, but that's not the first time one of my friends have died. So i didn't take it too well. now we go to yesterday. It was relatively okay until the actual football game i had to perform at. See, I'm in online public school, and so my marching band is a homeschool one, as well as being a christian band, what with me living in the bible belt. They have a pda rule, which in and of itself is not a problem, the problem is how strict they are concerning it. No physical contact of any kind is allowed, no hugging, no holding hands, nothing like that. Obviously, that's hard for those in relationships, but i'd done ok following the rules up until last night. We got rained out during the football game and so we had to take cover under the bleachers. it was dark, and do to recent events i was feeling depressed and i wanted to hold my girlfriend, kara, and so i did so. it wasn't doing any harm, and nobody really noticed it, short of her friends little sister, who told us to stop, I don't particularly like her and i know she hates me, because she doesn't get as much attention from my girlfriend as she used to. Anyway, after a little while, we stopped and took cover under an awning, since the bleachers weren't exactly helping any more. the child didn't like that and went off to tell one of the band directors. We weren't breaking any rules, but she told the director we were doing more then we actually were. she was furious. she came over and started yelling at us for breaking the rules. I tried to tell her that we weren't doing anything wrong, but she shouted me down. at this point i lost my patience and i started yelling at her, I swore, called her a bitch, that sort of thing. I don't remember what i said, just that i yelled and swore. that's not abnormal for me. My girlfriend started crying and i stormed off. my parents went in to apologize and i waited by the car. they drove me home without speaking to me and i went to bed. that was it for the night.  
This morning i called her over the phone to apologize and i broke down in tears once i heard her voice. the reason why i cried was because the first thing she did was ask if i was okay. I wasn't prepared for that. Anyway, i apologized and informed her of the recent death. She told me her dad had said that she needed to take a week break, no contact whatsoever, which i agree with completely. But she also said that she wanted me to apologize to the director and the kid. And that's where the biggest problem lies.   
How do I make up for this? My section used to look up to me before hand, now they're scared. What do I do about that? What do i say to the directors? How do i apologize to the kid, and what the hell do i apologize for? Why does this happen to me at all? How do I make her dad trust me? (her mother always has and always will despise me, so there's not much i can do about her) Why wasn't she mad? 

Basically i need to know, what the fuck to i do now? How the fuck do i recover from this? And the part that really bugs me is what i do concerning the manipulative little kid?",08Sep2018,1

269,"It's a long post, if anything is confusing please ask! I just really need some help right now.

So some backstory. I met this girl (don't want to mention names) at college orientation about a month ago and I had been talking to her for that duration. I hung out with her friends once at a theme park for a day, which was very fun! She was very eager seemingly to be friends and very kind. Problem with all of this is that I had some strong feelings for her because we got to know each other so well, but she had a boyfriend, so I know nothing would've happened regardless. 

A few weeks ago, someone started to harass her nonstop through Instagram DM's and she started telling me about it and asked for help on what to do. I started to provide some help and then the harasser seemingly went away. A couple days later, the harasser contacted me on Instagram and tried to get me to tell her something that he couldn't because she blocked him. I sent her a screenshot of him attempting to talk to me and responded with whatever she wanted me to say. I continued to send screenshots and eventually she stopped responding, just reading whatever I sent. 

Later that night, after not responding to me, she completely blocked me on all social media I had her on, and blocked my number as well, without ever telling me. I found out because her dad called me later and threatened me that if it was me he will fuck me up, either his way, or at college academically, or with getting the police involved. I did nothing wrong, and I hate that she and her family think it was me that did it, when I didn't do anything at all. I'm very non-confrontational as a person and have been a little scared and really sad from that night, and it's been weighing me down so much. I've told a few people, who all agree that I should move on, and I agree with that too. I know I should move on, and my brain is rationally telling me to, but the emotional part of me doesn't want to. I just don't know what to do with my left over feelings, it's crushing to know I can't be her friend anymore, and that she absolutely hates me now. I figure a large part of it is because there is a serious lack of closure to all of it. 

Now the kicker is that on Thursday, I had my first lecture of Calc, and she was in it. I'm pretty sure she saw me (it's a decently large class at around 100 kids). Now i'm sure this is probably a bad idea, but I really want to try to talk to her and sort things out. See why she thinks it was me and explain how it wasn't. I just don't know of a good way to approach her, especially with everything that happened. I'm not about to just go and sit down next to her, and i'm pretty sure she won't want to talk for long, if at all. But I still want to try and be friends, because we really got along, and she said herself that she hasn't really quite clicked with someone like me in a while as a friend. 

I feel like I might be being a bit delusional trying to go for her still as a friend, but i'm just broken right now. Any advice is appreciated...

273,"I'm 26. My family lives several states away, I see them maybe once every other year. I keep in contact the most with my mom, somewhat with my dad, and *rarely* speak to my brother and his family. Almost any form of contact is initiated by me. With one exception. 

Anytime a birthday or holiday (Mother's day, Father's day, Christmas) comes up. I get a text message, from one of them, asking what I'm getting that person. When I inevitably say ""I don't know"", I get told that they decided to all chip in and buy a gift for that person and tell me that I owe them money for it (usually between $50-$100). Then, when my birthday comes around I will typically get a text from my brother, a text from my dad, and a phone call from my mom (this year she called a couple days after). My dad will always promise a gift, but never sends one. And for Christmas I'll usually just get a package with some candy. Though, last year I asked for a spending limit on Christmas gifts, and they used that exact spending limit to buy a gift card and mail it to me. After I spent a day driving around my entire city, buying pint glasses at local breweries for my brother who just bought his first house and is into craft beer.

Now, I want to stress that this is not about the gifts. I don't care if I get nothing. A phone call and knowing that they thought of me is **plenty**. The issue I'm having is the unequal expectations. If I don't spend a ton of money and buy some ridiculous item, then I feel guilty. But when I spend the money to buy it, then I feel kinda dirty. I live off one income and don't have a ton of excess money to spend on this kind of stuff. And I would rather give no gift, than give something that wasn't thoughtful. I feel like gifts shouldn't be obligations regardless of holidays. They should mean something. But, my family doesn't share that. And it's increasingly hard to buy something meaningful, for someone you rarely ever see.

For example, this year for mother's day, I made my mom a recipe box. She was always asking for recipes from me. So I hand wrote about 60 recipe cards and bought an old recipe box I found online. All together spent about $20, but it was thoughtful and I was super excited to give it to her. She seemed to care less about it, and then told me how my brother bought them a new television. I just felt like the disappointment. My mom's birthday is coming up, and I have no motivation to buy anything. My brother told me she wants a coat and a purse. Both expensive and requiring her input to purchase. 

I'm just tired of feeling like the the son that doesn't care. The one that doesn't call enough. Doesn't fly over to them enough. Is always asking to have spending limits on Christmas gifts. 

Sorry this turned into a bit of a rant. Maybe I'm just being selfish.

For context: I'm 23 years old and have a very well paying job with great benefits. It's great for me financially and for my career, but I'm not very attached to it. On the other hand, my girlfriend absolutely loves her job, and sees herself working there for the foreseeable future.

285,"Sorry for the long read, but I could really use some advice.

First some backstory. I'm twenty. Due to my fathers job, I spent the last five years in a country where I had no real job opportunities. While I was there I took every opportunity to make money and save it. I now have around $30,000 saved and a year of college completed (3.9 GPA). I've been completely unable to get scholarships, although I've applied for many and am rather good at essay writing. I just moved back to the US with my family, got my learners permit and my first real part-time job.

My plan was to take a few months to get mentally prepared, work a job, get my drivers license, then go off to college and never speak to my family again in about half a year. I haven't been getting along with my father as he's taken to being a lazy, anxious alcoholic in his retirement, constantly worrying about money but completely unwilling to look for a job. He's also taken to frequently insulting me, calling me lazy, ungrateful, and self-centred, and then acts surprised when those words of encouragement cause me to refuse to help him with whatever he wants. He hasn't once apologised, instead preferring to say that we ""need to try to get along"", as if I'm somehow culpable.

After working hard all week and on my one day off, my parents insisted I help scrub the siding of our house without so much as a please. This was after multiple insults within the 15 minutes I had been awake that really hurt my feelings. One thing led to another and we had a fight. Now, I think I might get kicked out.

I have no idea what to do or where to go. Hell, I'm not even sure if my parents aren't right about me. Is 20 really too old to be living with my parents? I mean, it's not like I've just been laying around doing nothing. I feel like I've been trying my absolute hardest, but I'm not exactly the most mentally stable person. I can be pretty hard to deal with some times.

A few options I've been considering:

1. Patch things up with my parents, go off to college when the next semester starts. (I'll have a drivers license by then.)
2. Move out. Say in the small town I live in. Keep working my job. Try to get another part-time job or increase my hours. Walk to work and ride the bus home.
3. Go off to college now. Somehow manage without a car. Hope I get a new job before I run out of money.",08Sep2018,1

After a while she insisted to get naked, which I felt was a bit weird but whatever. Anyways we talked for about 2 hours.

292,"Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

Using a throwaway. Very long story somewhat short, I have two life options and everyone in my life is incredibly biased and not helpful at all. Here's the situation: 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 29, single, and have $110,000 in student debt, $10,000 in credit card debt, and almost zero savings. Every time I write those numbers out it feels like a kick in the gut. I've been paying toward these debts for 3 years and barely made a dent. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have an job offer on the table that pays extremely well where I currently live in the Bay Area. It's in tech and it sounds like I'd be putting in at least 50 hours a week, but worth it considering the pay (more than double what I'm making now). I'd be able to pay off all my debt in a couple years and save pretty heavily for the future. Even working 4 years at this potential job would change my situation dramatically and increase my future job offers and career outlook potential exponentially. My current job isn't great but it's completely remote and allows me to travel and visit family pretty freely as long as I have access to internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

My family all lives up in Washington state (parents, younger siblings, grandparents) and my aging grandparents have offered to let me move in with them (also in Washington) rent free until all my debt is paid off. My current not-so-great job would allow me to move up there easily, continue working remotely and spend time with my grandparents whom I love deeply and get along with great. I'd save about $1500 a month on rent ($18,000 a year). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been leaning toward taking the higher paying job and making a point to fly up and visit family every 8-12 weeks because I'd be able to afford it, but this morning my favorite uncle passed away very unexpectedly of a heart attack (he was 65) and in all of my emotion and heartbreak all I can think is that I want to live near my family again and cherish them while I can. My grandparents are in their 80s so there's a good chance they would be gone before I'm able to pay off all of my debt and have more financial freedom. 

&amp;#x200B;

What would you do? I feel so trapped and overwhelmed by my debt and want to get out from under it, but at the same time I know we only live once and the people we love are all that really matters. I'm single but I want a family someday and it's hard to see how I could even consider having kids before getting out of debt. Working my current job it will still take me at least 10 years to get out of debt, and even then I wouldn't be able to save very much. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Should I take a high paying, career boosting job to get out of debt OR move to be closer to family whom I love and trust that I'll figure out another way to pay down the debt? Thanks in advance for any advice &lt;3",08Sep2018,2

We go to leave and she grabs me and starts making out with me. Yes I kissed back. But we were drunk and what's the harm in it. She's extremely self conscious and I don't want her feeling ugly before going downtown. (At least that's my drunk logic, mixed with the fact that a cute girl is trying to make out with me for the first time in forever) 

We are walking downtown when she falls over and that causes me to fall as well. We drank an entire bottle of vodka between the both of us so I decide we are too drunk to walk all the way. So I carry her back to our housing complex. Once we are back she immediately starts back to wanting to fuck. (This whole time she's talking about how done she is with her boyfriend and how long she's been wanting to fuck me) 

I was weak. I did it. And now I'm too ashamed to even talk to my friend. Their relationship has been toxic so I'm not scared of ending that. But telling my friend his girlfriend isn't just sleeping around but she's also slept with me, could destroy two of my friendships. But at the same time my friend doesn't deserve to be treated like this.

299,"I have kind of a weird question regarding pinworms. I'm a 27 year old female who works in an emergency department and I often go into patients' rooms. The only thing I really touch are the curtains in the rooms. I understand that pinworms can be spread from poor hygiene.

I use hand sanitizer on my hands constantly in the ED, however I know that pinworm eggs can also get under fingernails which I don't usually clean. Yesterday when I got home from my shift I opened a bag of protein powder and put my hand in to try to find the scooper, however couldn't find it so dug a little deeper.

I am now petrified of the possibility that I somehow got pinworm eggs under my fingernails in the ED and Im worried my protein powder is now contaminated. I read that the eggs can survive 3 weeks outside the human body.

Should I dump the powder, or keep it and use it in 3 weeks when the eggs supposedly die and are not infective any longer?

300,"I'll try to keep it short. I'm 32. My parents aren't really narcists, i think just confused and misguided. They worked hard raising myself and 3 siblings on OK salaries, switching morning and evening shifts because they couldn't afford daycare. I know having kids myself that raising 4 kids must have been tough, and opposite shifts means they probably never saw each others. So they put in work to raise me. 

That said, their personalities are garbage. My dad is an alcoholic and is so defensive and ego protective. To at least one of my other brothers he said he couldn't wait until we moved out. He wanted to fight me several times growing up. And my older brother cut contact with the entire family a few years ago. My mom was emotionally manipulative. Often using our feelings against us and whining about how the world is against her.

&amp;nbsp;

Needless to say it set me up with some serious personality problems that took years to undo. In the last few, I have extended an olive branch by continuing to go over once a week with my kids (4 and 6) to watch game shows with them like we used to do. It makes me anxious, and a few times I've seen some behavior I dont like come from them toward my kids. 

But recently after they watched my kids for a day, apparently after my 6yo was acting different and some coaxing from my wife, the 6yo said she had a terrible day and couldn't do anything right. She said my dad, after the 4yo asked to go on the swing he *made for them* and was so proud of making it, yelled at my 4yo that ""This is my house and my rules and we are not going on the swing."" Making her cry. Now the 4yo is absolutely relentless about continually asking for things over and over and over...but I've seen my dad go from 0 to yelling like that before and do not approve. 

The 6yo goes on to say my mom at one point said to both of them ""I don't love you guys right now."" And that is just a terrible thing to say to kids. And the 6yo then said she doesn't really want to get babysat by them anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

Ever since then, I've pretty much ghosted my parents. It's been like a month and my mom is starting to text me. Stuff like ""I saw you commented on X on facebook, what's wrong, did you get my text earlier?"" And though I haven't addressed the issue yet...I really don't know how to. 

I honestly feel like if I never saw them in my life again I'd be fine with that. Then I convince myself it's not that bad and maybe the kids were overreacting. Or I could just answer the text but continue to keep my distance, but then think that's kicking the can down the road.

301,"Hi all, first post on this sub. I’m in a really difficult situation because I’m 23 and am still living at my moms house; it is a horrible situation and I’m very self conscious about it. I left home at 18 to go to school, finished a year, and suffered from a stress related psychotic break during the summer. I was not aware that I was predisposed to these kind of issues before this. I then spent a year at home, went back to school the following fall and suffered a psychotic break again. This led me back to the same position, stuck at home again going nowhere. But this time it lasted almost two years before I reenrolled in school a third time this past January, resulting in yet another psychotic break. I realize that I put myself in this position but the insidious thing is that when I’m not psychotic I fully comprehend the shitty situation I put myself in. But when they happen, which are the result of a combination of stress and drugs, I become oblivious to what I’m doing.  These setbacks have led me to where I am now: 23 with hardly any work experience and barely an associates degree. It’s my fault that I’ve ended up living with my mom again but I don’t know what to do about it, I haven’t been able to get a job (she lives in a remote part of SW FL with nearly nothing going on), and I don’t have the kind of money to just up and move somewhere. Now I’m trying to figure out how to get myself out of this situation as soon as possible, but no one will hire me and I only have like 2k in savings. My moms told me I should move into assisted living and get on disability but I would prefer not to do that. So I am in a tough limbo here. 
I don’t really have any marketable skills either, besides maybe music production. I’ve been trying to finish my degree in journalism, which is a hard field to break into, degree or not.

303,"I act to support a Project Manager with their responsibilities. Their function is to ensure at least a dozen workstreams hit their milestones and the overall project meets its objectives. Each workstream has their own formats (though directionally similar) for their project plans as they have separate functional areas.

My current task is to put together an instruction guide for a new Project Manager who is completely unfamiliar with the milestones involved, even if they know what the functional areas do. A how to if you will.

The final plan should, at the very least, include: how long each milestone should take (or a lead time), what the milestone involves, interdependencies, key decisions outlined, pitfalls, and budget considerations. 

It should be high enough level that they know what is going on, without getting into the weeds since the workstreams will handle that. Ideally I can scale the level of detail based on feedback.

I'm kind of limited with tools. The final output files would be either PowerPoint or Excel (not ideal but there isn't widespread adoption of anything else amongst prospective end users).

The ask: I'm struggling to find a way to succinctly represent each of the individual project plans in a summarized way. I'm close to the process and familiar so I can make sense of the mess but that doesn't give me the best perspective.

304,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been volunteering for this teacher for almost over 10 years and I would like to buy something for his classroom students because the school didn’t give the teachers enough money for school supplies.

I’m studying to be a teacher and would like to buy something to help out with the classroom since I have extra money from work.

306,"I am in a college Spanish class. I signed up for this class to polish my skills, rather to to learn new ones since I have been studying Spanish as my second language for several years. This is a night class filled with mainly adults, so the dynamic is much different than your typical degree path college level course.  There are about 10 people in the class along with me. 

On the first day of class, I chose to sit in the front row. (I use this as my motivation not to use my phone or computer too much since I am fully visible and don’t want to appear disrespectful or miss any of the lecture.) The only other person sitting in the front row is a disabled man, we will call him Andy. 

Disclaimer, I do not know much about the proper terminology to use so this is not meant to offend in any way, I just want to lay out the facts. Please educate me if there is a better way to refer to something. 

My school, along with many others, has a disability resource center that helps anyone with a disability to be more successful in their courses. This could range from anything like dyslexia to paraplegia. A service that is offered, among many others, is note taking. This works with the professor, the student in need, and a helpful student volunteer who coordinate privately after class or during office hours to agree upon a method of sharing notes for the student in need. Some students aren’t able to take their own notes, or to take them effectively. This assistance can make a world of difference to someone.

I have been a note taker for several others in other classes before with nothing very interesting to report, until now. I decided to offer to be a note taker for this class when the professor asked if anyone was interested. A note taker’s responsibility is to simply know who your recipient is, exchange phone numbers or email addresses in case of an absence, and provide notes. Notes are provided in an online portal in order to give the recipient privacy in case they do not want their disability on display for the whole class.  

So as I mentioned, Andy is disabled and it seems to be to a pretty serious degree. I don’t know (nor is it any of my business) what his affliction is, but he has some physical challenges which means he is bound to a wheelchair, and has close to no use of his arms and legs. 

The issue: every night in class, he asks me to unpack and repack his backpack for him as he is unable to do this himself. He brings a laptop, a few notebooks, pens/pencils, and a textbook. He has also asked me to take his test to the front to give to the professor, to pour him a glass of water, and to take his trash to the trash can. Now, I am happy to share my notes, as I take pride in my organization of my own notes, and running off a copy of them is nothing to me, I’m happy to share. However, I wonder how it is that he expected to be able to come to this class with no assistance? I know the school is able to accommodate for some kind of companion for situations like these. I’m feeling like now I have extra responsibility upon me that I really didn’t ask for. Frankly, I’m also uncomfortable handling other people’s things, like his computer, which I don’t want to be responsible for mishandling or breaking. I don’t see the professor taking any interest in his situation, or anyone else that is willing to help. It is obvious that some are scared of him since most people have since moved their seats to be far away from him. I am not scared of someone in a wheelchair, and I’m also not scared to help a little. I am scared of him being my responsibility where I now have to worry about my own grade, along with his well being. 

Should I say something to the professor? Is it his responsibility to make sure Andy is taken care of for basics like unpacking his backpack and getting a drink of water? Should I say something to the disability center? I really don’t want to be a problem, and it isn’t much of a big deal right now but I can see this dependency growing into something that I am absolutely not ready to take on. 

Full disclosure: the school pays note takers $100 in exchange for uploading a folder of notes per class for the entire semester. 

TLDR: I help a disabled person in my class by sharing my notes with him. He asks me to handle other random tasks for that shouldn’t be my responsibility and I’m uncomfortable with it. Who do I talk to? What do I do? ",08Sep2018,1

I had some furniture in the spare bathroom we were using for storage. I go in to find my table, lights, and shelf missing.  After asking, Ben says, “I assumed nobody was using them, so I just put them in my room because I needed them.” 

Ben also “hijacks” conversations I’m having with my friends. Will walk into the room in the middle of us talking, buts into the convo, then changes the subject.

309,"For the past 3 years I’ve been living here in America, I’ve been trying to get a driving permit and haven’t been able to for different reasons. 

The first 2 times I took the permit/written road skills test, I was in a time of my life where I was extremely stressed out constantly, so I made stupid mistakes on it. I wasn’t as prepared too so that also affected it. Then, I moved to a new crowded city with good public transit, and told myself I’ll finally put more effort in, study very hard, and take the test again. While I do get around just fine using Uber and public transport, I wanted to learn how to drive finally and become more independent. 

I’ve been studying for the current test now the past few months, reading the manual in chunks and doing practice questions here and there. This material is pretty easy, so it shouldn’t be hard, but I wanted to be extra prepared. This past week I’ve been studying a lot and did many practice test. The first actual time I’ve felt truly ready to take the test. So I went to the DMV at 8 am today and waited in line for 3 hours only for  them to tell me I don’t have the correct documents. I went back home and waited in long again and they told me again they won’t accept my proof of residency (it was a print out photo on my phone and all I had at the time). 

I then decided to give up and leave. I cried on my way home because I’d been at the DMV for 7 hours and nothing came of it.

Her smokey eyes glistened playfully as she took the bar stool and sat between us. Conversation was mostly between her and my flirtatious friend, though there were attempts to include me I had little I wanted to add to the topic. My eyes were fixed on her as they had been for much of the night. Their conversation was coming to a close, my mind could think of no better time. Assertively and confidently I blurted out “May I have your number?”

&amp;#x200B;

One week earlier…

My good friend Aaron and I went to a Mexican bar in Ballard, an old fishing neighborhood in Seattle. The bar tender’s shape was appealing to me. Aaron and I talked with her throughout the evening, and I made googly eyes at her. Though I was inebriated, I’m confident my presence had piqued her interest.

&amp;#x200B;

One week later…

Aaron, Thomas and I return to the Mexican bar, largely due to me wanting to see the bar tender again. YAY! She is working again! The three of us sit down at the bar and begin our usual bullshitting routine. Thomas is a huge flirt and makes delightful conversation with the bartender. Perhaps 20 minutes pass and she approaches our portion of the bar and asks if we have any song recommendations. 

She’s looking for 90s hip hop recommendations, not my strong suite so I lay low during the conversation. No song decision is made and she returns to other duties.

Aaron gets up to go to the bathroom. While he is gone she comes around the bar and sits on Aaron’s stool, right between Thomas and I! Now I’m hella nervous because I know there will be no better opportunity for me to ask for her number, then when she is sitting right next to me.

“May I have your number?” I’m downright shaking at this point.

“I’m unavailable to give out the digits.”

Crap, a vague and un-fulling answer.  Sigh, life goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m still into her, and I’m still seated at her bar. I keep on making eyes at her, trying to make eyes that said “I’m a little sad you turned down my request, especially because it felt like you were also making eyes at me. Was it all a ploy to get me to tip better, because that’s super reasonable.”

Uncertain if she was able to translate all that, hardly matters because moments later disaster struck.

She leaves the bar and puts on a new song. What song did she put on? WHAT SONG DID SHE PUT ON AFTER TURNING ME DOWN?!!!!!!

TLC’s “No Scrubs.” Damn, she is cold. I love it, I’m loving every second as I sit there, ears burning while my friends speculate as to how spectacularly she had outplayed me. It’s not often you meet a girl cool enough to completely lay you out, a customer, while at her work. 

I couldn’t let it go, it’s not possible for me to take a music diss and sit on it.

&amp;#x200B;

One week later:

It’s a Thursday and I’m back in Ballard. I spent 5 hours creating a music mix specifically to prove to her that I’m not a scrub. I’m a badass ganster who doesn’t give a fuck about all the right things and refuses to roll over for some bullshit TLC song.

USB stick in hand I walk up to the bar. She’s not working… I look like a huge creep walking past the windows slowly while peering inside. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day later:

It’s Friday night, she will be working tonight. I’ve got my flashdrive containing the 5 minute mix, featuring 6 hella poignant song edits expressing my feelings. 

It’s creepy, the mix is creepy. I know it’s creepy because I made it, and I showed it to my partner. I’m in an open relationship with the coolest being :)

Hand in hand we marched into the bar. It’s crowded. So fucking crowded, zero space to roll up to the bar. I spot her immediately, I have perhaps 2 seconds to make a plan without looking like I’m standing around like a mook. Taking the only option available, we push through the crowd right to the opening of the bar. 

She turns and I see recognition on her face. Perfect. 

“Last week you turned down my request for your number, then you played No Scrubs. I made you a mixtape with a personal note attached.”

Hand outstretched I hand her the flash drive.

“I’m flattered.” 

Everything comes to a dead halt as her co-workers realize they I’m taking a stand. Taking a stand for all beings who have ever been undeservedly accused of being a scrub. This aggression shall not STAND!

&amp;#x200B;

I panicked. My goal being accomplished I turned away and fled. Well more like Adele, led me out because it was too busy in there to walk side by side and we were still holding hands.

I forgot to say goodbye, I forgot to act “normal” in any way.

At the time of this writing I do not know if she has listened to the mix or has any interest in contacting me.

Reddit, Do I have a chance with this girl?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a link to the mix: [https://audiomack.com/song/severin20/the-scorpio-s-mix](https://audiomack.com/song/severin20/the-scorpio-s-mix)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the contents of “The Note” included on the flash drive:

Hi,

In these moments, I've been thinking about you. You seem cool.

When you played ""No Scrubs"" after turning down my number request... Damn, that was well played.

I made this mix as a result of my feelings from those moments. 

You helped inspire this answer to ""no scrubs.""

I recently changed high schools, and i know virtually fucking nobody. I’m completely separated from all my friends, all the relationships i’ve worked so hard to build, gone. My worst fear of abandonment is coming true. It’s hard for me to occupy myself with a hobby, my electric guitar just broke, I’ve lost all my motivation to draw lately, school sports would be too stressful on me (emotionally, not physically), and it’s not like I can just waltz up to some girl in a school i know no one at, and expect to have a girlfriend. I know it’s gonna be hard to keep my friendships with my old friends when I can barely see them anymore, so I can kiss that goodbye. I spent my nights either cutting, crying, playing video games while feeling empty, or trying to make conversation with the friends i’m on the verge of losing.

324,"My parents passed away when I was 6. I’m 23 now. I have very little memory of my mom and dad, but my grandmother on my mom’s side took me in, so I know a lot more about her. My mom and dad never married, and I was an only child and an accident, so my grandmother on my moms side of the family knows very little about my dad and very rarely talk about him. 
When I was little, I spent much more of my time staying with my dad, because my mom had issues with drugs (which led to her death).

 I have very few memories of him, I don’t even remember what his voice sounded like. But I do remember that he loved me more than anything. I remember one time I got stung by a wasp when I was very little and he took an aerosol can and a lighter and torched the entire wasps nest. I thought it was the coolest thing I’d ever seen. 

Besides the few memories I have of my dad and two pictures of him, I have nothing else of him. I think about him every single day, and I wish that I could talk to someone who knew him, so I could learn more about him and what he was like. Sadly, the majority of my dad’s family has passed away, many within a couple years of his passing. The only remaining family member that I know of is my dad’s sister, my aunt. I have asked her about my dad in the past, but she didn’t have much to say, as she sort of disowned herself from the family a long time before everyone passed away. Also, I feel weird talking to her because she made it clear she did not like my dad or my uncle (dad’s brother). She was in charge of his funeral when he passed, and she didn’t even put a headstone on his grave. When I visit my dad at the cemetery, it’s just a little rock on a patch of grass, that I put there. I’m not entirely sure it’s him, but it’s next to my grandparents graves so I’m assuming it’s him.

I could ask her again for photos or anything else she might have or know if my dad, but I’m more interested in finding people he was friends with. I know he had a lot of friends. I have one memory where I was sitting on my dad’s lap with a bunch of his friends on a back porch somewhere, listening to bluegrass and jamming out. I feel like if I talk to these friends who knew my dad, I could learn more about him. I could talk to someone about my grief who would understand because they knew him. 

I have no idea how to find these people. I feel like Facebook might be a good way to start, but I don’t even know what I would look up. I know my dad lived in one city at one point, but I also know he moved around a lot. The only things I know about him are his name, and that he lived in one particular city at one point. Besides that, I really have no idea. 

I’m hoping someone here can give me some tips about how to track down these people. I don’t know where to begin. Any and all advice is welcome. Thank you in advance.",08Sep2018,1

The rock scene has been the only scene I've been connected with and it's part of my identity so it's normally rockers I look to for friends or partners, I look for events at that venue, etc.   


The problem is my abusive ex now goes here often, as a result of joining a social group I was a part of - due to what happened with us I can no longer be part of that group, as he's become a very popular member, and I have had to cut contact with everyone for the sake of my own sanity. There's also a monthly rock club locally which I now have no one to go with, seeing updates from their Facebook page or the risk of seeing photos of my ex or my old social group has meant now unliking their page.

334,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here because I need financial help and what I can do to save for long-term and looking to move out to an apartment with my SO. I went to r/personalfinance but did not help me. I know they have sidebars there and some links, in which I've tried, but I prefer to have direct answers to specifically my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm turning 26 and I live with my parents in Miami. He lives with his uncle in Chicago. I plan to move up there because I want to experience a different city and I love Chicago point blank. We have been together 3 years, 1 1/2 LDR and are planning to move in together real soon. Since I am cannot be physically there, he's viewing the apartments himself and sending me videos of the places. I'm very excited and I hope we can make this a reality someday.

&amp;#x200B;

I make $37k-40k a year, and he makes $57k/year. He has a potential to make more! I am a recruitment coordinator and the job is alright and the pay is decent, I make 18/hr. His credit score is a 670 and mine a 764. So we're good on that aspect. I am still diligently looking for another job up there but it's quite hard having to miss interviews because of work, and the flights can get a bit expensive at times. I've only missed one interview so far, but basically I'm looking for jobs that will pay me the very least 15/hr, but it has to be more.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a breakdown of my bills I pay monthly:

* **Car = $650.70 (new and paying it off in 3 years)**
* **Car insurance = $1,546.36 per 6 months**
* **Health insurance = $175.36**
* **Dentist (had to do 2 fillings) = $76.50 for 6 months (end payment on Feb 2019)**

**Car/Health/Dentist** **= $902.56**

**Car/Health/Dentist/Car Insurance (I pay during December and June) = $2,448.92**

**Car/Health = $826.06**

**Car/Health/Car Insurance (during December and June) = $2,372.42**

&amp;#x200B;

My mind is really frazzled right now and I just really need guidance. 

**Bi-weekly: $1,200.59.** **Monthly: $2,401.18**

&amp;#x200B;

According to my boyfriend, he pays probably about $500-$600 for his bills. Which I wish those were my bills. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's a way to still move in together and make a living. How much can I save based on what I have above? We were looking more into apartments with the $1000-$1700 range, but I believe it leaves me short of $400-$600 after bills/rent are paid.

335,"Backstory: I’m 18 and I have had a group of friends from school for about 3 ish years now but the last two years I have been feeling pushed out of this friend group, especially since we all started college and most of them ended up going to the same college. (They are all also going off to uni and I won’t be) 
These past two years on and off I have been left out of group things and parties etc and to begin with I didn’t really care and didn’t say anything because I thought it would be a college thing or whatever but now I’ve realised that I really don’t think they want me around them anymore and I don’t know why. I am kind of fed up of them continuously hurting and pushing me away. My two closest friends in that group also have left me out and I am the last to know everything or I sometimes don’t get told at all and end up finding out some other way (eg one of them breaking up with their boyfriend). 
The last straw today was when, earlier in the week, I made a plan for all of us to go out together before they leave for uni. I work early mornings from Thursday to Sunday so the only times I can go out int the evenings is if it’s on a Sunday, Monday or Tuesday. So I asked them if any of those days would be good and Monday ended up being agreed on. Today I get a message on this group chat asking if we can all do Thursday instead when they know full well that I can’t do it. So I let them know again that’s I work then and pretty much all of them made excuses not to go out on Monday night and go Thursday instead (“clubs will be dead Monday” “I don’t feel like doing Monday- I’d rather do Thursday”).  So turns out they’ve made my plan their own and kicked me out completely. 
At this point it’s happened too many times to know when I’m not wanted and clearly they don’t want me around anymore. 
I have no other friends so I will end up being very lonely now and I’m not sure what to do to get over it. I don’t really know what I’ve done to deserve being pushed away apart from the fact I am a bit different from them and I do believe I have some form of autism. I guess I need to know if anyone has been through the same thing and how to handle it? ",08Sep2018,1

Anyway, i borrowed his car today to run some errands since my brakelight is out and I found a hollowed out pen sitting in his car. For those who dont know, hollowed out pens can be used to smoke drugs or sometimes snort them. Anyway, im lowkey freaking out right now because this isnt the first time I suspected he might have relapsed.

 About two months ago he was getting nauseous alot, he was constipated, his pupils were tiny, he just wasnt acting like himself. The list goes on but after a week or two he went back to his usual self so I kind of just figured maybe he was just sick or having a bad week and decided not to worry about it but now I found what could possibly be drug paraphernalia in his car. Im worried about him but I also think I might be overreacting. I just cant think of a reason he might have a hollowed out pen in his car other then he might be using again. On the otherhand I do trust him and hes been clean for 26 months as far as I know. I have no reason to believe that hes using again other then the hollowed out pen I found that is likely nothing other than something he accidently broke.

340,"Hey reddit, I live in an apartment in Montreal and my landlady had arranged to have new patio doors installed in every suite with a terrace, which is great since the old ones were quite shit. Anyway, the workers did my apartment yesterday and I returned home to find that they had moved a little table inside and when I went to move it back outside I discovered a leg had been broken off. On closer inspection I saw that the workers had left a thin layer of dirt and fibre glass dust on essentially everything in the room: bed, blanket, pillows, floor, nightstand, books, fucking everything. I had just returned from a short holiday and instead of coming home to nice new patio doors and the clean apartment I had left behind I spent the next hour or so vacuuming and mopping and changing the bed clothes. I don't have a washer/dryer so I had to take a shitload of laundry out to the laundromat and spent 8 bucks to have everything cleaned not to mention the time suck that always is. I mentioned it all to my landlady and she was sort of dismissive but apologetic. I spoke with another tenant in the building and apparently they left a mess in her apartment as well. I am right pissed that people could be so disrespectful of someone else's home and stuff and I feel like it is unfair that I had to put in so much effort and time to right their wrong. I feel like I should be compensated for my labour and for the money I spent on laundering my bed clothes as well as the broken table but I'm a bit afraid of appearing like a spaz or making a mountain out of a mole hill and spoiling my good relationship with my landlady.

I have a disorder that’s related to the OCPD family. Its called excoriation disorder and It’s a combination of hair pulling and scar picking and while I’ve been working through it with therapy and self care I have been left with a series of small scars across both of my breasts that are very dark and visible.

I have been single for a number of years, but in my last relationship I mentioned it once in the beginning of our relationship, he said he didn’t care and it was never brought up again. 

Now that I’ve been single for a long time I am very worried that the next person I date may not be as kind or understanding. I’ve developed a fear of intimacy and my self esteem has took a huge hit. Casual dating just doesn’t seem like an option and getting close enough with someone to reveal this personal issue before intimacy feels equally daunting. 

Practically speaking I’ve tried numerous creams and none have been successful. I would love to get laser treatment but it is far too expensive. Often I do really well only to relapse and disfigure myself further. I’m at a loss. It feels easier to just stay single and not even think about dating. It would be hard enough to find someone I am compatible with but this just adds another level of complexity that I’m not sure will be accepted by a partner.

347,"Lemme give you a rundown of what happened -

I live with my mom and my sister in the Vancouver, WA area with 4 dogs.

Earlier this morning, sometime after I had woken up (~12PM), My neighbor had rung my doorbell and let me know that our puppy, Rover, had escaped the house and made it's way into their house. I took the dog, of course, and he was in there for a while.

My mom calls me about what happened 5-10 min later, and I explain everything. She suggests I check out in the backyard to see where he could've gone. Of course, I do so, and I find a few spots that he might've escaped.

That was it for me. I go back inside and call for Rebel. I couldn't find him (but I didn't look that hard), so I assumed he was somewhere upstairs hiding in a closet.

Fast forward a couple hours (more like 20 minutes ago), my mom arrives home for lunch and calls for the dog. Initially, nothing. 

I'll spare you the details because nothing super important happened, but what I can tell you is she's furious and looks like she's ready to stab or taze me or whatever (I was the only one responsible - and I 100% put all blame on me, I should've been paying more attention).

Now, the kicker is- I have zero clue how he got out again. My only 2 explainations are this- either he somehow got out again while I was checking the backyard for escape routes (I didn't shut the door, so it's entirely possible he ran out while I wasn't looking), or the most unlikely- he ran out the front door immediately after the neighbor brought him in (there was a small gap of time where the door was open after he came in when I was talking to the neighbor.

That's all I know. This is really the first time it's happened. I'm probably dead for good, my mom is not clinging to any positivity and probably doesn't want to listen to me (of course, I wouldn't either if I was her). She's not home at the moment, probably checking the neighborhood or talking to cops, animal shelters, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

I met a cute guy on Grindr (gay ""hook-up"" app) and saw that he put his Pokemon Go friend code in his bio and said he was new to my city (he moved from across the world). I invite him to play PoGo with me while also showing him the city, he says he'd like that but needs to get a plan first. We add each other on PoGo and after he tells me his IRL name, I for some reason decide to google his PoGo username + IRL name. The first result gives me him promoting his snapchat (same username as PoGo) on his semi-personal tumblr. I kinda snoop through it, and find out we have the exact same interests; we like the same movies, bands and even some obscure things. He seems perfect to me. While this was happening we didn't really talk a lot, and I had to do all the question asking because he wouldn't. Then after the conversation died off, he randomly asked me a question, which made me think he wanted to meet up some time. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was 4 days ago, and he hasn't been online on Grindr since he asked me that question. It probably sounds quite weird, but I feel like I've already started to get feelings for him. Whenever I think about him it, my heart starts to pound like crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

In the next couple of days I kinda looked at his tumblr from time to time, when he suddenly posts a thing among the lines of ""Welcome to my new stalker from \[our city\]! Please hit me up, don't be shy!!"". I freak out because I didn't know people could see who viewed their tumblr, and I'm 99% sure it's about me because apparently the ""stalker"" is new and we live in quite a small city. Since he hasn't been online on Grindr in a few days at that point, I was really tempted to hit him up, because he seemed sincere. Though my friend said it'd be really dumb because she thinks he's being sarcastic. I didn't end up sending him a message telling it's me, since it'll most likely really freak him out and don't want anything to do with me. Or if he still wants to meet up, it'd just be really awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I quite like him and would just want to talk to him, it really frustrates me that he hasn't been online and I'm not sure what to do. As hot as I find him, I'd love to just be friends with him and nothing more per se, because I don't have any irl gay friends (that I know of) and especially not people who like the same obscure things as me. Seeing that he posted his Snapchat online and asked people to follow him, I am really tempted to just add him. It would be kinda weird, but since it's the same as his PoGo username, I think I might be able to justify it. Or I could just hit him up on tumblr and come clean and hope he doesn't find it extremely weird. But I'd rather not risk it. So what would be smart? Just hit him up and hope he doesn't care I ""stalked"" him, wait until he comes online again or just cut my losses.",08Sep2018,1
354,"Hi reddit. For context I'm 16(m) and my best friend that we shall call Sandy is 15(m). Sandy and I are both sophomores and have been friends for around 4 years. She's a sweet girl that is innocent, but also naive and sheltered. Around the end of freshmen year (the last 4 months of school) she got a boyfriend that we shall call Richard. 

At first, Richard seemed like a cool chill dude who likes to play volleyball. It seemed a little weird to me that they got together even though they barely knew each other for a week, but isn't that how most highschool relationships are? 

2 weeks into their relationship, she stopped texting me, blocked me, and stopped hanging out with me. We had this little ""secret"" spot that we hung out at during lunch and it seemed very off to me that she wasn't there one day. Weird, I thought, she must've had a club meeting or whatever. 

But she didn't come the next day. Then the next day, the next day, etc. I then realized that she was hanging out with Richard. The weird thing was that even though we had history together, she didn't say hi to me or even look at me. She also started to dress more differently (more 'showy' and flashy) and changed her appearance. It seemed like she was a different person. 

She started avoiding me the last 3 months we had freshmen year and I was devastated. She didn't acknowledge my existence and only hung out with Richard. 

However when summer came, she unblocked me and texted me. Apparently a few days into their relationship, he was already being more sexual to her. He was trying to sext her and dirty talk, even though she openly stated to him that he was her first boyfriend and she didn't want to do anything sexual. She was uncomfortable and he didn't seem to care. He then started to manipulate her and started saying ""If you really liked me then ..."" etc. and ultimately guilt tripped her. Like I said, she was naive and thought it was the truth. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks, he asked for nudes and she hesitantly sent him some pictures. He then proceeded to immediately threaten to leak them if she ever talked to me or any other guys at school. If he saw that she talked to *any* guy, he would leak them.  She was absolutely terrified and explained to me that's why she avoided me. 

4 weeks into their relationship he openly complained how embarrassed he was being out in public with her because she was ugly. She got really insecure about this and decided to change her looks to satisfy him and please him. 

A month in, he guilt tripped her into having sex with him. He took her virginity and they started having sex on a regular basis. She said to me how sometimes she didn't want to have sex, but he didn't care and forced himself on her. 

The reason why she unblocked me and texted me was because he broke up with her due to the fact that she was a ""too easy cheap slut"". He isolated her from our other friends and she had no one else to go to but me. 

I was absolutely shocked hearing this. I comforted her and tried to help her out. I visited her during the summer to see if she was okay. I was extremely worried about her. 

But it seemed like she still had feelings for him. She expressed how she couldn't move on and even went as far to say that she loved him. I think she thinks she loves him because they had sex, but I could be wrong (she believes that you only have sex with the person you love). The breakup was devastating for her. I made sure to check up on her regularly and try to talk to her about things she liked and be ""ourselves"" again. I could tell she was different.

The first few weeks of school she's been harming herself (cutting and bruising herself) and doing reckless things to get his attention. She desperately wants to get back with him and I'm not sure why. I've tried telling her she doesn't need his attention and should focus on herself, but she isn't listening to me or even showing that she cares the slightest. 

Please help me. I have no clue what I should do at this point and I'll do anything to help her.

355,"So my friend posted a image of some text that said that it isn't Ariana Grandes fault for leaving Mac Miller and it wasn't her job to stay with him. And it then went on to making it a woman's rights issue by saying ""This is just an attempt to guilt trip women into staying in toxic relationships""

I replied with ""First off, who said he's toxic? Secondly, why should men stick to toxic relationships but not women. Women's motto is ""if you can't handle me at my worst you don't deserve me at my best."" Double standards are funny.""

She then called me an idiot and I just replied with "" Makes sense. I mean I am not really a big follower of celebrity gossip anyways. But I do think she had every right to leave him. But... I just don't think it's right that only women are encouraged to leave toxic relationships. If the genders were flipped people would be outraged.""

359,"I recently made [this post with a lot more context](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9e6g2h/i_think_im_getting_kicked_out_what_do_i_do/), but since then the situation has become a bit more severe, so i decided to make this condensed version to hopefully get more responses.

I've got to move out today. I don't have a car or a drivers license. I don't have a cell phone. I have $0 in my wallet. (Spent my last $5 on a bus ride home.) I've got an account with $30,000 in it under my parents name for college, but I'm not sure I'll be able to get access to it given our rather rocky relationship. It's also pretty difficult to start a bank account without a phone number and I really don't want to use my parents number.

I live in a town of 60 people. I've got a part-time job in a nearby town of 2000 people. The nearby town has a bus service that's pretty cheap, but it doesn't run soon enough to get me to work and doesn't run on weekends, so it can't get me anywhere today. I guess I could ask my grandparents for a ride into town, but I've got no clue where to go after that. (My grandfather hates me, so I couldn't ask to stay with them.) I don't even know where to begin to look for places to stay. Online, there are next-to-no options I could find for small, cheap rentals. I'm new to the area and have no-one to turn to for help.

362,My husband has been working with a start up since May and was laid off yesterday. We’ve wanted to begin working Real Estate together and I received my license last week. I started a very intense training that teaches you all aspects of the business and the only payment the company requests is a 60/40 commission split on the first 5 transactions. The only downside of this program is it is only during typical office hours so my husband couldn’t join me. All my husband has to do is submit his license paperwork to have his license. Should he pause applying for jobs to join the training with me? Right now it would be about $400 each in start up costs for real estate because we would be joining mandatory associations. We have around $6000 and our rent is $1000 and soon have a 6 month car insurance payment of $1300 coming out..... any advice? My other idea was that he looks for jobs and tells them he can’t start for a month which is when the training would be done or at least more flexible. I also thought of signing up to deliver pizzas or work Ubereats together while beginning Real Estate. Open to all advice and ideas. Thank you! ,08Sep2018,1
364,"So like in 8th grade this guy came to our school and he was new, I was like wow he’s kind of cute. Then 8th grade ended and we went to high school. I was hoping that he’d go to my school and sure enough he does. 

Now I’m a junior and I see him around halls every year and he’s always on my mind. If he does something as little as look at me I get instant butterflies. Like I wish I had a class with him.I’ve literally never had a boyfriend and I’m way too shy to say something to him.  When I was feeling brave I followed him on Instagram and added him on Snapchat, but that took a lot of courage. He added me back on both too. (Idk if that means something??) 

But now I see there’s a girl in his Instagram profile pic. Idk if I’m being paranoid but it could be his girlfriend or maybe it’s just a friend/cousin. And I really want to say something to him like “hey I’ve thought you were cute since 8th grade and would like to get to know you” but I really don’t know because I’m terrified that he’s not going to reply and then it’s going to be just like an awkward encounter in the halls. I was thinking maybe just wait until I’m a senior and see if we have a class? I don’t think I LIKE him, because I’ve never gotten to know him, but I also feel like I do... but that sounds stupid because it would be based off solely of looks and I don’t want to be that type of person.

365,"I’ve saved up 370 dollars and I want to know what I should invest it in. I’ve accumulated this money by reselling cloths and saving up my lunch money I get for food everyday. I get around $12 every school day to buy lunch ending up to be 60 a week. My plan is to leave 20 left over at the end of every week so I can top up my investment my $10 and save $10 dollars. The 10 I save is for back up money for if I ever really need it, but the long term goal is to keep it for when I’m adult. And the same goes for the money I want to invest. Make in initial vestment of $370 and top it up $10 every week till I’m 18. This is just a plan I’ve made for myself so I can have money when I get older for family and just to live a happy and not have to stress about my next pay check when I become an adult. The money I save and invest will probably go to student loans because I head those are very expensive. I’m inspired by Warren Buffet and I think it’s very interesting how you can turn your money into much more buy putting it into a company. I find school interesting (when we are actually learning) but there are some things that I’m dying to know but school does not have all the answers! I’ve been thinking about buying a B share in Berkshire Hathaway as of writing this it’s $214. I think this is a good safe long term investment that I can hold onto for a while. This is what I think is a good investment for the research I’ve done online so far. I put 5 dollars a month out of my allowance to a super ( I know it’s very early to be thinking about retirement but I call it a head start).  I’m reading an Australian book called the Barefoot Investor and it’s giving me good tips on how I should spend my money and save it. What I want to know is some advice on what to spend my money on in the stock market. I’m also just looking for new ways I can invest that $10 a week on things other then stocks. Any books you would recommend to a young investor. Anything will help!
  


Note: I posted this on the investing sub reddit but I think it got taken down. A lot of the comments were addressing how I should keep my money and save it. I have $400 in a saving account that is separate from the 370 I want to invest. And a lot of the comments were talking about how I should put the 370 into a lawn mower or some thing that that will help me make money, well I do have something. I have $230 that I buy cloths and sneakers with and sell them for more money so I do have another source of income besides my lunch money. I also live in NYC so I don’t think buying a lawn mower would be so effective. Also people were saying enjoy being a kid and I do I hang out with my friends a lot and we do not constantly talk about money and stocks. This investment is a trail run, I just want to get into the habit of investing my money and saving it. I’m going to try and get as much knowledge as possible by reading books and asking people around me who I think could help. This means when I get more money from reselling or when I turn 14 and get a job I will be able to invest a larger sum of money knowing what I’m doing. Any advice on investment strategies, books, crypto would be much appreciated. Well thank you and have a nice day!",08Sep2018,0

370,"\*Omitting and changing some details just in case my friend finds this, so it might sound weird in some places.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend, who I'll call Joe, is graduating high school this year. I've known him my entire life and I'm a little older than him so we've always joked that I'm a bit of a father figure to him, always giving him advice and such. This time, however, he seems relentless in not listening to me. He's usually a really rational guy, but recently he's been blowing my mind with how unreasonable he's being.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the problem: So far, he's decided to pursue a university degree in a field that's very competitive yet not very rewarding. That's fine; if he's truly so passionate about that field then I'll support him no matter what. The thing is, he does absolutely nothing to meet the requirements of admission. I'd told him 2 years ago when he was choosing his senior subjects that he needed to make sure that the ones he choose met the requirements. He simply decided not to take one major one, claiming that ""that's only relevant to the universities here in our country, the university I'm going to only cares about your marks, not your subjects,"". Now, the university that he's referring to is on an entire other fucking continent. He has this weird superiority complex that he's too good for the universities in our country, so therefore he must go somewhere with lower ranking ones but more exotic locations. Okay, fine, whatever. BUT, this university has a whole other set of requirements, including different language fluency requirements, identification documents, and scores of other things that he doesn't know or doesn't have (and won't be able to get by the time he applies, but claims that he can). Also, they don't even list the subject requirements on their website, so you can see the both the quality of the university and the risk that Joe is taking in applying there.

&amp;#x200B;

He plans on applying to the university mentioned and about 2 other rinky dinky universities 5000 miles away. He essentially has no safety schools, and the tuition at the unis is about 3 times as much as you can get in our country, not including boarding. He'll be considered as an international student, meaning that there are very few spaces available for him, lowering his chances of getting in even more.

&amp;#x200B;

His life isn't over if he doesn't get into a university, but I just want to knock some sense into his head. If he simply applies to some more local universities (or at least some on the same continent) and actually applies to a program for which he meets the requirements for, he would be in a much more comfortable place.

&amp;#x200B;

He gets extremely angry every time I bring it up so I have no idea how to get this across to him. How can I possibly tell him that his putting himself in a place of a lot of stress and uncertainty? Or am I being the irrational one here?

377,"So let me start by giving some background, I’m a 19yr old enfp (male) After years of doubts and self reflection I’ve finally realized that I might be bisexual. Looking back I’ve always been different-even since early on. I was just made to fall in line a certain way bc of my upbringing/culture. 

Anyways, I understand life’s a rollercoaster but I don’t think I’ve ever been this down before. Here’s some of the reasons why... 

I fell in love w/ my (straight) best friend for two years, and it nearly killed me. I finally decided to tell him and long story short he’s no longer in my life. (This was probably the hardest for me, nobody know’s I’m bi. So I went thru all of this alone for two whole years. Only for my worst fear of losing him to come true.)

I go through relationships w/ girls like crazy. They never last more than a few weeks bc I’m never satisfied. I’ve rarely ever felt a connection. 

I started developing feelings for this guy who was ultra flirty w/ me. Until he finally admitted he was engaged. Should’ve dropped him then, but he was the first person I came out to and helped me accept who I am, so we remained close friends until his fiancé made him cut ties w/ me. 

I developed super strong feelings towards another best friend who was sending super crazy mixed signals (again, very hard for me) that is until he started dating someone.

I pursued this local dude I thought was gay but was very surprisingly straight. I had to do damage control so he wouldn’t know I’m into dudes (it’s my area and location. Also my family doesn’t know and would never think of me the same) Still, we hit it off very well and started to become close friends until he randomly stopped replying to my messages.

I actually started to develop feelings for the last girl I was in a relationship w/ but had to cut ties bc of way too many red flags. She hasn’t stopped trying to get my attention ever since and it’s driving me crazy. 

All of my close guy friends who I hang out w/ all the time are seeing someone so they’re constantly on their phones every time we hang out, so I’m basically sitting there alone. 

On top of this, the only ppl who know I’m bi are the two ex bff’s that dropped me. 

This is the most alone I’ve ever been, yet at the same time I’m so numb bc of everything that’s happened it’s like nothing bothers me anymore. 

Any advice about what to do or where to go from here would be very much appreciated. ",08Sep2018,2
378,"Sorry in advance for the long post but i want to give y’all the entire backstory so y’all can give me the best advice...

So I’ve been close friends with this girl since my sophomore year of high school. We’ve tried a couple times to be serious but with where we were at that time, we decided that it was best to stay friends. Throughout these 6 years, we have always been each others person to turn to when needing advice, having a bad day, or just needed someone to vent too. After we graduated high school she went off to college and i enlisted into the military. During this time, we have remained extremely close. Every time i would go home we would make sure to hangout and see each other. There have been times during our friendship one of us would start dating someone but we always remained close. I ended one of my relationships because i realized i had more feelings for my friend than i had feelings for my ex. With her past two relationships, she would come to me and tell me that she misses me and wishes we could see each other more often. Just over a year ago, i told her that i have feelings for her and she told me that she also has feelings for me but with the distance and us being in different phases of our life, she didn’t want to risk our friendship so she just wanted to stay friends. Now we are currently trying to plan a weekend that i can come and visit with her since her university and my base are only about 4 hours from each other. I want to tell her how i really feel and that i am tired of acting that there is nothing here. But the thing is if she doesn’t feel the same way and she wants to stay friends, i cannot do that. Us staying close has only given me hope that the possibility of us being together is still there and i cannot do that to myself anymore.

381,"The mods on r/relationships deleted this and said that it was a troll post. I really resent that because nothing about any of this is funny, and I would really appreciate some advice.

Long story short, my university funded me to work for an NGO that provides services to unaccompanied refugee boys coming into Greece. I was there for 8 months total, and I worked at this NGO for 7.

I'm very grateful for the experience and the skills I've gained, and I genuinely have never felt so confident and secure in myself after this experience. But since I returned to the US about 3 and a half weeks ago, I've been feeling very disconnected in a very specific way. Every time I read the news about what's happening politically in Greece or with the migrant crisis, I start to absolutely sob. The hardship these kids face, alone in a new city where they're not welcome and have no support network, is truly beyond my capacity for understanding. I'm actually struggling to even type this right now through the tears.

Most days I'm pretty neutral if not happy, and I feel more confident than I have in probably my life. While I was there I established two volunteer programs on behalf of the NGO and even wrote a beginners' English curriculum because there wasn't a full time curriculum developer and English is so important, and I think that seeing that level of suffering prompted me to do whatever I could which helped me gain some perspective and appreciation for myself and what I'm capable of.

The school I go to is also incredibly elite and wealthy, and the social difference is incredibly stark and honestly just makes me angry. Everyone is so petty and career-focused (not a bad thing), but it's gotten to the point where I can barely tolerate being here without being very triggered. Like I don't really care if Emma didn't get hired by Deutsche Bank. Shahab lives in a squat and can't afford an eye surgery that would save his sight, and he's only 14.

Growing up, I was also homeless and am very grateful for the opportunity to have attended this school. This place has given me every single professional and academic opportunity that I've ever had, and I absolutely don't take it for granted. But it is very jarring for me to be here, especially after working with homeless youth in a very precarious and unstable situation. Working with these kids has helped me come to terms with being homeless (at around their age too), but it's made me even more aware of class differences and general inequality.

Like why does Amir deserve to live in an actual park where people are sold into sex work and junkies shoot up instead of following his dream of becoming an engineer, while at the same time these very privileged and wealthy students lurch from milestone to milestone (that they don't even want sometimes) just because they were born into a better situation?

I don't know how to make sense of it, and I feel so lost and sad when I start to think about it. I don't feel like this all the time though. Yesterday I genuinely felt happy, but by last night I was feeling miserable. I'm also writing my honor's thesis on the role of NGOs in lawsuits (I don't want to get into specifics because it's low key boring), and every time I sit down to do research or write I burst into tears. Why am I here while they're not? Why am I here while my mom (who singlehandedly got us off the streets) is slaving away at a job she hates?

What can I do about this? Who can I talk to? Would a therapist even understand? I'm very lucky to have had this experience, but it's a very specific set of circumstances from my childhood and my work that have made it so salient for me.

TLDR: I worked at an NGO for unaccompanied refugee boys for a while. I used to be homeless as well, and while I'm generally happy and feel more self confident, I'll burst into tears at random moments from thinking about their situation juxtaposed with the school I'm lucky enough to attend. What can I do?",08Sep2018,0

He asked me out over text the other day (I don’t think I’ve been giving him the wrong idea, this was the first time he messaged me) and I don’t know how to say no and to continue with the training program.

384,"I want to preface this by saying: I am depressed. I’m on medication for it, so no need to say I need to seek help.

The reason why I ask this is because, yes I feel my life is pure drudgery, I’m working towards a “dream” career in an academic clinical discipline but even the thought of attaining that is meh. 

I rarely feel joy or have any “zest” for anything. No hobbies. I occasionally get flashes of inspiration towards my work/job that allows me to come up with projects. 

I’m also reasonable successful to an outsider, however as I haven’t attained the position I want yet, I still feel inferior. Yet, this dream position is essentially one I feel no excitement to getting, it’s purely one which will satisfy my huge ego and get me a lot of money. I also don’t believe that the “follow your passion” thing is relevant as to most, this career would fall into that category lol. 

It seems that by your 30’s you have already experienced all the major sensory stimuli that comprise the human existence and everything just becomes routine. 

So, yes, though to some it may feel that what I’m describing is depression, but what I want to know is if what I’m feeling is pretty much normal and I just can’t accept the fact that life is drudgery and grayness. 

So what do you think? ",08Sep2018,4
385,"Hey everyone, so I recently I've been chatting quite a lot with my crush (even personal stuff), even though she doesn't know that I'm in love with her. Usually when Im asked to tell her about my crush I just straight up tell the truth (Like when it comes to questions like ""Which haircolor does she have"" etc) and I use a certain code name (Which she picked and that name is her favourite name too) when I talk about my crush. So she asked me to tell her something about my crush (I forgot the exact question) and I told a lie because the truth would've probably given me away. Immediately afterwards she suggested using another codename because my crush ""was probably ugly and (old name I used) is too much of a beautiful name to fit her"". Now don't get me wrong, that usually doesn't give anything away but the thing is she told me she normally doesn't like to dislike people or call them ugly or something, even if she doesn't know them, to a point where she said she's simply unable to really dislike people. 
So I thought: Could that be a sign that she may be in love with me and maybe was angered because the descriptions I gave don't really fit her  and she's jealous? She often called me a great person and such and gave me compliments too.
Thanks in advance, guys!",08Sep2018,1
386,"I have been dating a guy for the past 8 months. He is wonderful, generous, and kind, and we love each other. He also struggles with depression which makes things difficult sometimes, but I have in the past as well so I understand when he's having a rough time. The only thing is, he feels he can't commit to me. Neither of us are seeing anyone else, he has told me he doesn't want to, but there is just something holding him back from committing. I think he's afraid. But the lack of commitment has made me paranoid that he would sleep with someone else if the opportunity arose (he said he wouldn't but still), and it just all together messed with my head and made me feel insecure. I just kept wondering why I wasn't good enough to be his girlfriend. We got into a fight this morning about him hanging out with a girl he used to see who's just his friend now. I told him it made me paranoid because of the lack of commitment, that I would absolutely trust him if we were boyfriend and girlfriend but we're not. Basically it ended with both of us being very sad and saying we weren't gonna see each other anymore. But i""m beside myself. We both still love each other, he told me he did. But I just can't get past the no commitment after 8 months! I don't know what to do. Should I be firmer and give him a stronger ultimatum and tell him I really do want to be with him but only in a committed way? That's what I was trying to say to him and I'm sure he understands that...but he didn't say he would commit. It just sucks because we both still love each other. Any advice is helpful.

387,"So i finished sixth form in july and since then ive been thinking alot about what i want to do with my life as i find it quite intimidating looking for an apprenticeship. I dont want to end up hating what i do so ive tried taking my time and making the right decision. 

The issue comes from the fact my dad is slowly removing things he gives me as i dont pay for them; for example my internet connection has been removed completely so im relying on data for emails banking etc which makes searching for jobs so much harder. 

Ive been looking for a few months now and ive managed to narrow it down to a few apprenticeships one main one being an apprenticeship with the RAF.
The reason this one appeals to me so much is that im away from home so i dont need to put up with the shit i get from my dad. I realise this is terrible motivation hence the reason its taking me so long to decide whether to go for it or not.

Honestly id appreciate anyone's two cents on the matter because i feel a bit stuck as to what to do. 

Also AMA if you need more info to help me out 

This is my first post here so please say if i need to change something.

The thing is that I haven't told her about my love for her and I don't know if she has feelings for me. So my question is: How should treat her/talk to her? In 2 days, my six week vacation is over. We haven't really talked to each other in person the whole 6 weeks because we weren't able to and before the vacation we didn't really chat/do much besides sport together. So how do I treat her when school starts again? Like a normal person, a friend?

## 

My ex was emotionally abusive - we weren't together long, this abuse only showed-up during arguments and I think it was his own emotionally issues that saw him deflecting rather than him making some sort of conscious effort to hurt me - he ended things when I tried to talk to him about it. This was a bullet dodged, I know, plus many people have pointed out I could do much better (even without knowing about the abuse people think he was batting out of his league).

Consciously I know I'm better than him, better off without him, and deserve better.

I'm still hurting, we weren't together long but I'm still grieving. I can't seem to wrap my head around it: he said he loved me and was happy with me, he was happy with our ex life and we shared the same kinks, he had someone who was not only 'out of his league' but who loved him, valued him, was patient with him, etc. but he didn't want me. He couldn't find it in himself to deal with his issues to make the relationship work. He's just moved onto the next person like what we had was nothing and like I was worthless...I wasn't worthless, why can't he see that?

Why do I need him to see my worth? 

I don't mean to sound arrogant but I am worth better than him and how he treat me, I want to be the sort of woman who can just say 'Whatever, he didn't deserve me' and strut on to better things...I don't understand why I can't, why I'm stuck giving a damn about him. ",08Sep2018,2
