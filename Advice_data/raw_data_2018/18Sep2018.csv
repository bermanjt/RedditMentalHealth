0,"So I have this online friend who is in depression. Sometimes everything is fine, but at other times he feels EXTREMELY depressed. 

I am actually worried about him. When he gets really depressed, he sometimes talks about how death is better than loneliness. I do the best I can to comfort him, but I have no experience with depression, so I don't really know what to do.

Can someone give me some advice on how to handle this situation? That would be nice, thank you.",18Sep2018,1
1,"I recently started joining ultimate frisbee Mondays when my friend invited me over with our group of friends (usually we consist of 3-4 group of friends going there). Its a good opportunity to have fun and meet new people. After coming 6 times, my friend that invited me told me he felt like something is off when we went home having a conversation in the car.

Usually, the group of frisbee friends hangout in a restaurant after the ultimate frisbee game. They invited us over when I first came there. We went to the hangout and enjoyed the night. Last 2 weeks ago, only one of their group of friends hangout with our friends. So we are 4 in total last 2 weeks ago. The other group of friends went home that day.

Yesterday, nobody wants to hangout on their usual restaurant place. So we went on our separate ways. My friend that invited me over told me he felt that the frisbee group of friends does not want to do anything with us atm. They are testing the waters to see whether they really like us or not. He even told me that do not say hi to girls for a while in the frisbee.

He added that just talk to guys more than girls and let the girls come to you. In other words, he wants it to be organic.

Is my friend right? Or am I overthinking this also? Any advice?",18Sep2018,2

7,"Hi Reddit! 

I was born into a very basic but VERY committed Christian household. I played drums in the worship band since I was 12 and had been active in the church body basically since I could walk.  It was established from a young age that faith is the most important part of existence. 

Long story short I was on a long term missions trip to Europe when I was offered my dream job. I was going to be playing in a band I really enjoyed, and would get to live and travel in Europe for as long as I wanted. It was everything I ever could've wanted.

And for some reason I couldn't say yes to the job.

After lots of thought I realized this was because I couldn't go around doing missions work if I didn't really believe what I was preaching. 

After a tear-filled coming out to my parents about leaving the faith, they finally accepted me and I felt the weight of having my life written out before me taken off my shoulders for the first time. IT WAS AMAZING! The world was my oyster! 

But here's the problem. It has been 6 months since I left and I don't know what I want. 

I don't know who I want to be, I don't what I want to do with my life.

But biggest of all I don't know how to find out who I am and what I want in life. 

Can anyone give me any advice on how to discover myself outside of religion? Thanks in advance!

8,"I recently moved across the country to rent an apartment together with a friend. We had both been living with our respective families prior to this and needed a change. I was able to transfer my retail position to a store in his state, so I am employed. He is currently not working and living off his considerable savings from a previous job.

My financial status is not good, and my friend was aware of this from the beginning. He is better off than I am and said he was willing to support me financially for the time being. So far he has been paying the rent, and I chip in for utilities, groceries, furniture, cleaning supplies, etc while trying to build up some savings. I feel guilty for being financially dependent on him, so I try to do my part by keeping the apartment clean, taking out the trash, making sure the bills get paid, etc.

Because I don't make much money and he is unemployed it was very difficult to find an apartment to begin with, and our current apartment is VERY small. It is basically two rooms (one of which contains the kitchen) and a tiny bathroom. At the beginning I did not think this would be an issue because at home with my family, I spent pretty much all of my time in my bedroom. However, sharing such a small space with someone has proven to be more difficult than I expected. 

My roommate is not as clean and tidy as I am, so I have to either pick up after him or feel stressed out from all of the clothes and trash lying all over the place. I get up early in the morning to go to work and go to bed early, but he stays up all night playing video games, and the walls are so thin that I'm having trouble sleeping. He has almost started a fire on the stove twice now (neither of us are very experienced at cooking) but doesn't seem concerned about the danger at all. Overall I am starting to see that he is an irresponsible and immature person and not someone I can comfortably share a living space with.

My dilemma: we are locked into a one-year lease, and even if I talked to the landlord and asked them if I could break the lease, I blew through all my savings paying for the security deposit, furniture, my car, etc. I don't have enough money for a security deposit elsewhere, and it was so difficult to find this apartment that even thinking about starting the search all over again makes me feel sick.

If anyone has any advice for what I can do to get myself out of this mess, I'd really appreciate it!",18Sep2018,1
10,"I've only had a few relationships in my life, all long term, all ending in bad ways, including my now ex husband who was an abusive alcoholic sociopath almost killing me before I took Off for good. After him, I tried to put myself out there but only met men wanting to sleep with me, lie to me, use me or worse. 
I've realized after deep self reflection that I truly change for the worse when I'm with a man, and I'm finally at peace and happy being single. I do get lonely but do not want to let another man in my life. I want to focus on family friends and myself. 
My loved ones all support that I'm taking care of me, but When I discuss that I won't be with someone again, they shut me down (politely).  They say things like ""you never know what will Happen,""  ""you will meet the best guy and he will change your mind""  and so on. 
But, I've decided this. I want to be single, it's frustrating that they don't listen.... And I feel like I'm doing something wrong by never allowing another man in my life after everything I've been through. 
I think I'm doing what's best for me, but my loved ones think a partner would make life better if I let them in

So I’m [24F] and black and also a TINY BIT socially awkward (for context). 


My friend invited me to go to a sand volleyball match to watch her current fling [30M] play, I’ll call him Jay. After the game we all went for drinks and that’s when things took a turn for the worst. We were at a long table with Jay, his 3 friends, my friend, and me. There was an empty seat beside me because I had absentmindedly put my purse there. Jay noticed that no one was sitting next to me and he jokingly told his friend to sit next to me and his friend shook his head and said he was fine where he was. A few minutes later Jay jokingly says to me,  “ you’ve got to step your game up. I don’t know if it’s because you’re black or what but none of my friends want to sit next you”. I immediately shut down, I kind of did a fake chuckle but he could definitely tell that I didn’t find his joke funny. It just was not a good situation because I was at a table full of people I didn’t know and was made to feel even more out of place because of the fact that I was black, which was something that didn’t even cross my mind until he said something. I didn’t stay much longer after that, I closed my tab and told everyone it was nice to meet them and then I left. The whole thing has me feeling really emotional and I’m honestly on the verge of tears. But part of me wonders if I’m overreacting, I don’t want my friend to be mad at Jay because of me. I mean he said he was joking??  Am I overreacting?

17,"I had my heart broken 3-1/2 months ago.

Since then, I've been on this mad mission to be the best version of myself possible. The way I saw it, and still see it, is that I have two choices - Sit around and cry, or get the fuck up and turn this pain into something better. The problem is, I think it's making me miserable. I have this idea that if I push myself every day to get better, smarter, stronger - that this will make me feel better about myself and everything that happened. There's two sides to this strategy. 1. I'm desperately trying to improve on the things that I believe caused our relationship to crumble, because I don't want to make those same mistakes in the next relationship. 2. I'm pushing myself to exercise and chase my dreams/hobbies in the hopes that I'll gain some more self esteem and fulfilment out of it.

So far, the results have been good and bad. The good being that I am seeing improvements in some areas, which feels great, in some ways I've progressed further in the last 3 months than I have in the last 4 years. The bad is that I feel overwhelmed, constantly. My mind is never present, it is always somewhere else. I'm in a constant state of ""You should be doing this"" or ""You should have done that."" I never feel content. Ironically, this has led to more procrastination. The more overwhelmed I feel, the less productive I become. These tasks I've set have slowly become dreaded chores, which take every ounce of my will power just to start upon. It's almost as if by pursuing the wonderful idea of self improvement and fulfilment, I'm only finding disappointment and stress, so my subconscious want to avoid it all together, hence the procrastination.

My typical day goes like this - work, gym, home, walk the dog, cook dinner, eat, shower, frantically try to get my 'life improving tasks' done and then, *only* then will I start to feel some sort of calm. Then of course, the days where I slack off and don't feel that I've accomplished enough, I feel like I've let myself down. The problem with this is, even when I do manage to get everything done, I'm spending 14 hours of my day in stress mode, frantically trying to get everything done, as if that's the only way I'll ever find happiness without her.

I [27F] lived in the US my entire life before moving to Manitoba to be with my wife [31F] during peak election madness in 2016. At the time the first thing I would ALWAYS get asked upon revealing my citizenship was “what do you think of Trump?” This annoyed me, but it was election season and pretty much the only thing anyone was talking about at all, so I just kind of let it go. 

Except that was two years ago and nothing has changed. Without fail as soon as someone finds out I’m American they ask about Trump before literally anything else.

25,"Hi, teenaged F here.  I've just started highschool and am really stressed and want some more external opinions on my situation (my parents aren't really giving me advice so much as what they want/think I should do).

&amp;#x200B;

So.  I'm the oldest of six children (3 sistes \[aged 10, 7, and 3\] and 2 brother \[aged 9 and 5\]).  As the oldest, I take care of my siblings because I am expected to.  Don't get me wrong, I love them, but I've noticed some things lately that have seriously, for lack of a better word, have started to really piss me off.

&amp;#x200B;

Like for example... they're all in elementary school except for my 3 y/o sister, so they're supposed to get to bed at a certain time (8 PM).  Whenever they try to get out of it, I get upset not because I'm annoyed that they're making noise, but because I know that it's just not good for them to stay awake messing around.  So, being the oldest, I'll tell them to go to sleep.  Of course they don't appreciate that and get angry at me.  Fast forward about 30 minutes later, they'll still be messing around and I am then forced to scream at them to get to bed.  They'll finally go, but then they'll start muttering about how much they hate me and how horrible of a sister I am.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example: my brother, 9 y/o, is really rude and disrespectful and, honestly, hurtful.  Whenever I tell him to do something (like if I tell him to stop being rude/mean to everyone) or tell him not to do something (like not to freaking PROVOKE a dog, which he was doing at the park yesterday), he gets so angry.  He will storm off and start muttering about how much he hates my guts, how I'm not his sister (we're half-siblings, as is the case with all of my other siblings and me, long story, I know), and etc.  It hurts so bad but since I'm older than him, I'm always told to deal with him, put him in his place, etc.  How the heck am I expected to do that?  I'm a teenager, it's NOT MY PLACE to discipline my siblings!

&amp;#x200B;

Final example: my sister, 7 y/o, is just so manipulative.  Here's an example that's been going on for years: she snores.  Intentionally.  I share a room with all of my sisters (I have no other choice, my mom has been promising me my own room for years now but has never gotten around to implementing it, but I've learned to not push things because my parents are under a lot of stress and I don't want to add to it), and my sister snores.  Now, you're probably thinking, ""how the heck can a young child like that snore intentionally??""  That's perfectly reasonable, but I've grown up with my siblings and know them.  What she'll do is randomly start snoring full force, and then stop if A) my mom/dad enters the room, B) I threaten to drag her out of bed/tell on her, or C) if I start to get out of my bed and she knows I'm really pissed.  My parents have tried many times to convince me that she just can't help it, but I know that it's bullcrap.  She stops snoring so quickly in such specific situations, and it keeps me up late at night and forces me to wake up frequently during the night.

&amp;#x200B;

My 10 y/o sister also does crap but I'm not even going to get into it here, because it would triple the size of this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, right now, I'm debating whether or not I should just start going about my business in my house (i.e. not giving a care if they aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing, getting into trouble, doing dangerous stuff).  I'm conflicted because on one hand, I know that it'll be better for me and my stress levels in the long run, but on the other hand I know that it will disappoint my parents and piss THEM off (""oh, so you don't care about this family, huh?  You're throwing everyone away, huh?"" and etc.).

27,"Hello, I am a father of two and currently sole bread winner for my family. I'd like to start by informing you of my situation.

My wife was working earlier this year, but her health has been declining and has lost her job, she cannot work for more than 10-15 minutes at a time, that was roughly 1.4-1.5k monthly income. She also has been receiving social security up until this year, survivors benefits ( roughly 800 monthly) from her late husband committing suicide, which has now ended due to our oldest turning 18 and not being in school full time, yet. I personally have about 1600 take home from a full time job that has been developing into a career.

So to sum it up a bit we've lost around 2-2.5k monthly income in the last couple months. I've asked my boss if there is anything they , as a company, could do to help an employee in distress. He offered my another 1hr daily to help.. Grateful, but that obviously isn't going to solve anything.
Quick layout of current bills:
Rent 800
Car 380
Electricity 100ish
Cable( yes i know it is cuttable) 100ish
3 credit cards of my own 200ish ( currently maxed for obvious reasons)
3 credit cards of the wife's 150ish unknown current balances in hers.
Food is mostly paid for with food stamps.

Little bit about why I haven't simply left my job to make more money..
I've been there for just over 3 years and have already been promoted to warehouse coordinator, had that position for around a year. Currently we are 2 people down (quit) out of 9. I manage one employee, should be 3, and 10000+ square feet of space incoming and outgoing. I make &lt;12 dollars an hour.... 
I have a couple options I can see. Being an unskilled worker I can look for other work in a similar field or ask my older son to wait for school and get a job. The latter, I honestly don't think I could do. I feel like I'm just floating, no family I can ask for help. Most of them aren't doing really well either. I know my best bet is going to get into some kind of trade. Being only 33 I have time, and long run that will help, if not solve, my problem. 
I don't really have that kind of time.

We both hit it off and are good friends, however, she had just gotten out of a relationship when I met her. For a little bit, we were physically involved with one another, but over time I decided it was probably best and less confusing for the both of us if we weren't. She's beginning to display very self-destructive tendencies and I'm very concerned. She doesn't have a great history with her parents, and they don't treat her as well as parents should. A few weeks back, she got really drunk with a friend of her older sister's (who just got out of rehab for serious issues concerning substance use) and made out with him, and engaged in some acts of foreplay. She thought it was funny at first and felt kind of bad about it, but within the next week, she felt even worse, and decided that this was in fact, sexual assault. She told me that for the next while, she doesn't want to engage in any sexual or romantic acts with other people because she feels really confused and bent out of shape by what happened, but other night, she went bar-hopping with her sister, and used her sister's ID card to get into the bars even though she is underage. She got extremely drunk, used cocaine, and wound up nearly having a threesome with a woman who is in her late twenties and a man who she thinks is most likely in his upper thirties. I've become extremely concerned since then, and I'm starting to really worry about her. I haven't eaten today and have felt miserable because I feel like she's going t get sucked into the party/drug scene that's rampant in this town. Many of my friends have fallen victim to this cycle, and it scares the hell out of me that she might too. What do you recommend I do about this? I'm tempted to distance myself from her because it really hurts me a lot to see her act like this.

37,"About a year ago, our team got a guy fresh out of college.  About 6 months later our lead architect left our team.  Since then, the new guy has dominated team meetings and discussions and my boss just allows it.  It's gotten to the point where everyone else's ideas and projects have literally been overrun by this new guy.  One miserable example is when someone comes into our shared office to ask me specifically a question, and the new guy immediately starts to respond.

To be honest, I'm beginning to consider looking for a new job.  I'm a hard worker and love the work I do, but having to compete to express my thoughts is miserable.

38,"I need some advice (and some venting) regarding my work situation, any reply will be appreciated.

This is the case,
Since quite a while I've come in conflict several times with one of my supervisors, and I'm not alone in this, I'm just the one who can't hold back and doesn't give in.

Here a summary of the conflicts:

- she is extremely rude and authoritarian at times, I once caught her making a private phone call at work which is clearly against work policies, I said something about it behind her back and she got to know about it. It came to a confrontation after which she claimed to distrust me (I'm not sure how this works).

- I was ill-informed about changes at work and got the blame for it (instructions should be handled and confirmed to be understood during working hours while at work, but apparently it was explained in a private email message which I overlooked) once I mentioned this, I got blamed for not knowing it anyway and pressured to file a complaint about the scheduling which hadn't been done appropriately (the person we are talking about was responsible for this) since a long while because it was similar to my complaint about instructions (if you can't follow, don't worry, I can't either). 

So I filed a complaint and two days later I got about 25 weeks worth of passed schedules (which doesn't make any sense either) and she suddenly changed my schedule and put me on morning shifts (which I hadn't and still haven't worked on since years because of health issues (I need a regular sleeping pattern). 
I didn't manage to get any form of communication with her so I had to push it through several layers of management and had to call in a company trustee to fix this.

- about a month ago she came by on her day off and wanted a product free of charge (also known as stealing) and expected me to not ring it on the till but instead book it off as loss (also known as fraud). 
When I made clear, calm as can be, that I wasn't going to do this since I prefer taking my responsibilities rather serious at work, she replied that I shouldn't worry about it and that she would book it off as a loss (fraud) the day after. 
I repeated that I wasn't going to comply and she had a little go at me saying that what I was doing was rather peculiar, apparently she was used to getting stuff for free, just not from me. 

This was about a month ago, she has been on a vacation for a few weeks and on her return, she is still sulking and not at all communicating with me. Even though this is rather laughable and ridiculous, it bothers me because I prefer having a pleasant atmosphere at work.

Also  a few days after the free product incident, we all received a mail from the floor manager that all employees were to receive a free product every week, on first sight this may come across as a good thing. But if you look closely you'll find that this makes me look rather foolish after denying free stuff to coworkers.
I confronted the floor manager with this fact and also with the fact that he hasn't the authority to legislate his own rules, he is not very experienced as a floor manager so I can't really blame him for it, so I explained to him that what he was doing, was giving unauthorized permission for giving away company property and even wrote the whole thing down and put his name under it. 
This may have led to his discharge instantly would he have not retracted this and make a note that only company rules apply to this issue. He sincerely thanked me for making the issue clear to him, which I really appreciated.

To avoid some sort of gossip girls scenario I transparently told other coworkers that it was of my doing that the floor manager retracted his email on free products. To my astonishment, quite a few people were upset with me for doing so, even after me explaining them very clearly that taking company property without authorization is actual theft and that a floor manager does not have the authority to decide on this matter.

I can see how this all doesn't make me very popular at work but the situation asked for it. I told my floor manager that it wasn't the first time that I got in trouble for obeying the company rules and that this shouldn't be the case in a healthy working environment. He absolutely agreed with me and it feels good to have his support in this.

What I do have a hard time with is dealing with this supervisor who sort of decided to excommunicate me, I understand that it is in a way humorous and I find that to be so myself, but spending up to eight hours per day with such a person is a lot less fun. I also have great distrust of her and have the feeling that she will grab whatever she can to harm my reputation.

Any advice will be appreciated, thanks in advance!

41,"Hi guys,  I'm seeking advice with regards to my situation. Any advice or help would be very much appreciated !

**Backstory**

We exchanged instagram and two days later our numbers. We have been talking non-stop since the instagram exchange. I get to know her a little about her but something is kinda off. Back then when we talked in person, she's said that she's a cafe person and don't club. Three days after after talking to her, she said that her friends ""forced"" her to club. To cut the story short, they partied and one of her friends got really drunk. So, I did the ""extra mile"" and  offered my assistance to help her drunk friends and sent them back home (I paid for uber to the club and back). 

&amp;#x200B;

During the same night, we sat down and talked. We became very ""opened"" asking questions like ""what's our ideal type of partner"", ""Our habits"" and all that but she was very secretive. Also, while in conversation she changed her story and said that she casually go to parties. Following that, we went to a convenient shop to buy some snack (It has been a long day) and I offered to pay for it but usually, girls tend to shy away when guys offered to pay of such (from my experience) and she doesn't seem to be bothered by it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two days, after the event, I saw a slight change in her tone of texting. I feel that it's not the usual ""her"" that I'm talking to. Until recently, my closest friend screenshot her insta story talking to other guy, video call (I don't really care) but what surprised me was that she blocked me from seeing it. Note that we are still talking to one another.

&amp;#x200B;

**Red flag from my point of view ?**

1) Wasn't being straightforward and honest

2) Wasn't being very appreciative (Texted to say thanks for the help instead of in person)   

3) Very secretive 

4) Her tone suddenly change and usually our conversation is like a ping pong now it is 40/60 my favour

&amp;#x200B;

**But...**

1) She's showing her affection towards me (All the hints are obvious on our first meetup)

2) She shared almost everything but also very secretive (The insta story incident)

3) She's always eager to set up a meetup... or a ""date"" 

4) She responded very fast to my text (max 1hr unless sleeping) to a point where I struggled to keep the conversation going

&amp;#x200B;

**After all that, what should I do now ?**  

1) Continue to know her better, more dates and such (I'm still talking to her though)

2) Ghost her... not worth my time

3) Other advice ?

42,"I'm a junior in college and found a room all to myself in a house (as opposed to sharing a small room with another person). These girls needed a sixth roommate, I kinda knew them and they asked if I wanted the room. It was late in the summer and I still hadn't found a place so I agreed. 

This isn't some romantic help question—I have a girl friend and she is friends with them, that's how I found this living situation. Besides my mom, never lived with women. Friends have said it's going to be tough. What are some things I can do to be a good male roommate? Besides toilet seat down, of course.

It seriously feels like a mental sickness that is on my mind every minute of every day for weeks, sometimes months, on end. It seeps into my daily life, makes me very depressed, and i can hardly focus on other things because of how much it bothers me. I’ll constantly replay things in my mind about what i did that caused the person to be driven away.

52,"A little about me: I'm 2mo fresh out of an amicable divorce that had been a long time coming. I also tend to surround myself with people who are SUPER touchy (cheek kisses, booty touches, and all that) and whose main methods of communication are sarcasm, puns, and innuendo. So... Pretty much high school drama club all over again. That said, the thought of ACTUAL intimacy of any kind (even a kiss on the lips) is TERRIFYING to me atm. 

Ok, so without revealing too much else, a bunch of friends and I have a yearly camping trip we do. I'm talking like 50+ friends of friends, doing nerdy shit, getting drunk off our asses and generally having a blast in the woods. 

So, obviously, given my recent life event, I decide the best course of action is to spend the second night in a drunken stupor.

Thankfully, I had my friend/confidante and his best friend to keep Drunk Me company/entertained/in line/clothed as we wandered (read: stumbled) from campfire to campfire.

At some point in the night, Drunk Me decided that since I liked these two so much, I was going to adopt them as my parents. Many jokes ensued, and once we got back to my home campfire, ""Daddy"" jokes started flying like crazy, much to our disgust, and everyone dissolved into hysteric giggles.

Toward the end of the night, I had downed too much booze to walk, so he half-carried me to my tent. As he gave me a hug goodnight, Drunk Me got the stupid idea to continue the ""daddy"" bit, and said in my/her best sex voice ""uhn squeeze me harder, daddy!""

In response, he grabbed my ass (common in our friend group) and gave me a split-second peck on the lips (DECIDEDLY NOT COMMON IN OUR FRIEND GROUP) .

I threw myself back and tripped over my sleeping bag like a three-legged deer in headlights, and after assuring me that this changes nothing between us, that I didn't do anything wrong, and that it was just a joke, he went back to the party.

My thing is, it took me 2 days to even REMEMBER THIS, so I don't know whether to bring it up or just pretend I forgot???

Also to preemptively answer any questions: he was the one who broke the kiss; yes, I know it was done for shock value; no, nothing seemed off the next day; and yes, Drunk Me is grounded for the foreseeable future. ",18Sep2018,1
54,"First off, apologies for any spelling mistakes or formatting as I am on mobile right now. I’m sorry if I ramble a bit, I just need to type some things out I’m having trouble with.

*TLDR at bottom*

Some background info: Shortly after I was born, my parents went through a divorce. It never really affected me, though it did affect my older sister who was about 8 when they separated. My mom told me that my father became a completely different person once the divorce came, and turned against my mom almost immediately (didn’t hear this until recently). Fast forward to high school, they have both remarried and I am currently switching between houses on a weekly, sometimes daily basis.

My dad re-married before my mom, pretty shortly after the initial divorce. I barely remember anything from the wedding, as i kinda just did what I was told to do. I had no concept of what was going on, or why I suddenly had two houses. It’s grown on me, and I often find myself forgetting that a centralized house is normal.

My dads house is not the ideal place to stay. He barely ever has any food, as he and my stepmom are on a strict weight loss diet. They never keep up or clean any tables or rooms, and are rarely home. They come home for lunch but mostly bring breakfast/dinner with them when they go out to work. I have started buying school lunches and other fast food just for me to eat, but I don’t really have a stable income of money to keep buying myself food. I’ve always felt weird around my stepmom, and when my mom brought to light some new information about the initial divorce, seeing my dad with my stepmom fills me with feelings of anger/sadness. 

When my sister was still living with me, we often talked about staying with one parent full time, but we never really committed to the idea. Every time we brought it up to our parents they kind of just brushed it aside. Now that I’m older and have a better grasp of what’s going on, I feel like I need to bring this issue up to my parents, and ask them to keep me at one house. I’m constantly forgetting things, as its spread out over the two houses. I always forget homework, clothes, papers, etc at the different houses, which just piles onto the already existing stress of high school. Im failing classes and I feel as if I’ll do so much better if I just have one place to stay at. I know that custody has to do with this somehow, but I don’t really have any knowledge as to how it works. I’ve seen my dad slip my mom checks of 1000$ plus which I can only assume has to do with custody, but I could be mistaken.

TLDR: I don’t know whether I can ask my divorced parents to keep me at one house, or if legal issues get in the way. And if I can, how do I go about asking them. If anyone has a good idea as to how this kind of custody works, please let me know.

72,"Im currently in high school and I had a massive crush on this girl. It was the first day of second semester freshman year. I walk into class with  my friend (for the sake of privacy, we’ll call him James) and we all just stood around while the teacher introduce himself to us. He told us to all find our own seats by last name. If your last name started with an A for example, you will sit next to someone with a B. While we where all walking around asking everyone for their last names, SHE approached me. I felt a tap on my shoulder and when I turned around I saw the most beautiful girl. She asked me what my last named started with. Me being the introvert who doesn’t do well with human interaction, I naturally stumbled up my words. In my head I was thinking that she probably thinks that I’m an idiot, but she laughed. At that moment I had a voice in my head say “roll with it”. So, I did and said that I hadn’t slept the night before and probably threw in one of my terrible jokes and then I said that that my last name started with a M. She said hers started with a N and that we might be sitting next to each other. Then, She walked away to go ask the teacher a question. I turned around and saw James looking at me with a cheesy smile on his face. I gave him a light punch on the chest and told him to go find his seat or something. Eventually, the teacher decided that this was taking way too long and just showed everyone the seating plan on the overhead projector. I was wasn’t sitting with her and I was kinda bummed out, but the guy who did sit next to me was pretty cool and is still my friend to this day. Fast forward to last period and I walked in late. I just grabbed a seat next to a group of friends and didn’t have time to see who was in the class. The teacher had us do this activity where we had to choose a topic from a hat and discuss it for a minute. Kids went up one by one and said there speech. When I was sitting and listening to some kids speech about birds, I noticed that the girl from first period was in this class. She was sitting with a couple of other girls. At that moment, the teacher called my name. I got up and chose my topic from the hat. I went up to the front of the class and talked about how a t-rex would win in a fight against a lion and I actually got people to laugh. When I was done, I started to walk back to my desk, but  I notice that she was taking to one of her friends about me. All that semester I tried to impress her. I learned that we had similar interests, for example that we both like the Marvel Netflix shows. I also love professional wrestling and one of my friends told me that she liked it as well. I never actually asked her if she did because I’m a major pussy. But when I did have those small conversations with her, I felt like a was in heaven. She even laughed at all my jokes. I told one of my friends that she did that and he said that she likes me as-well if she doing that. I was skeptical because she was wayyy to pretty to have a crush on me, but a week or so later we where watching Romeo and Juliet in class and in the middle of the movie she got up and sat next to me(We had a supply teacher so he didn’t care). You can only imagine what my teenage brain was thinking at this moment. I’ve never felt this way before, this feeling of happiness. I wish I was confident enough to talk to her more. When I look back, she probably didn’t have a crush on me, but I had a huge one on her. To the point where I actually wanted to go to school just to see her. Fast forward again to the last day of school when we got our exam marks. I was getting my marks and I actually made small talk with her and made her laugh. We didn’t talk much over the summer because I chose to focus on my personal fitness over the summer and I’m not really into the whole social media thing (coming from the guy who is posting this thing on reddit). During the summer I went to the gym every day except Tuesday and Thursday. I couldn’t stop think about her though. “This year you are going to talk to her more, no more small talk” these thoughts ran through my head almost everyday. Even when I hung out with friends, I couldn’t stop talking about her. Her laugh, her smile, she was so kind. Fast Forward to the first day of school. I walked into class and took a seat next to James. I sat there thinking about Overwatch or something and then, she walked in. She took a seat next to one of her friends across the room. The teacher has us do ice-breakers were we had to talk about three things we did over the summer. The thing is that we had to talk to the opposite sex. I told myself to go over there and talk to her, but I didn’t go. I just stood there and some other guy approached her and started to talk to her. This guy(we’ll call him Drew) has had a-lot of girlfriends in the past and he was know to be a f*ckboy that all the girls loved. Sounds real cliche. Soon after that, the teacher made a seating plan with you and the person you chose to talk to. I just had to sit there for a month just listening to him trying to flirt, but it was useless because over the summer...... she got a boyfriend. Over the summer, some guy had impressed her so much that they became boyfriend and girlfriend(her first boyfriend may I add). I didn’t know this until James texted me. I just felt a wave of defeat/sadness. The day I found this out, was my birthday. I had to see her everyday in the morning and could not do anything. I wanted to, but I had to respect the relationship. I was moping around for awhile. On Halloween, I just climbed a school and just sat on the roof thinking about life. I became angry at myself and wanted to know why I was too afraid to approach her when I could. My friends where concerned and told me that “ there are other girls” and to “move on”. I unfollowed her on all my social media to send a “statement” to them, probably a stupid thing on my part. I went down a dark path, I started skipping a-lot of classes and getting in trouble with the law. I’ve done that stuff before, but way more now. I was angry and filled with rage. I broke friendships because I was angry and then, she moved away....New school and everything, I didn’t even say goodbye or how I really feel. Some people might blame this on teen angst, but It’s not. She goes to a school that is like an hour away from my area, but I miss her and wish I told her how I feel. I am starting to treat people with more kindness now and attending class. I heard that she broke up with her boyfriend two months ago. I still have these feelings, but I don’t know what to do...",18Sep2018,0
73,"Hi everybody. I'm currently a sophomore in college in the US. I came into college with almost a semester's worth of credits from AP classes I took in high school, and am trying to decide what to do with what is essentially an extra semester to play with.

STUDYING ABROAD
There's a program London where I can get an internship and fulfill some gen-ed requirements throughout a whole semester (which means easier schedules the rest of my semesters).
PROS: I get a lot of support finding a long-term internship, with the bonus of it being in a foreign country! This is probably the best choice for me, professionally. The program is affiliated with my college, so all my aid will carry over and it will cost roughly the same amount as a regular semester.  
CONS: I'm already spending a semester abroad soon (also the same cost as my regular semester), so this will be my second term abroad. This isn't exactly a negative, but it means I'm not completely missing out on the abroad experience. (This is also listed as a pro, but) It'll also cost the same amount as a regular semester of college, which, obviously, isn't great. 

HIKING TRAIL
In this plan, I'll take a leave of absence for a fall semester and flip-flop the trail from May to November. (If I can fully manage a thru and not wimp out, of which there is a chance!)
PROS: I've been itching to get on the trail for years. I think a gap semester may be a good step back from academics and worrying about my career and future. It could be a major transformative/bucket list experience. And even with the start-up gear costs and cost on the trail, it'll be way below what I'm paying for a semester of school! (Taking some financial burden off my parents for a semester is a big deal with this one.)
CONS: Not sure how my family would feel about it. Not the best choice professionally, since I'm giving up a semester of work experience. I wonder how coming back to school and work will feel after being on the trail for so long (and of course there's always the chance I won't finish). Also, it's a bit of a silly reason, but I'll miss my summer job with a boss/coworkers that I essentially grew up with and which means a lot to me. And the trail will always be there, while the other opportunities will not!

GRADUATE EARLY
This is another option, and it makes financial sense since I'll have time to live with my parents and save up money while applying for jobs. But frankly, graduating with my friends means a lot to me, and I'm lucky enough that financially it's not an absolute necessity to graduate and work asap. 

So none of this is really set in stone, but I just needed to get it all out there. Sorry if it's really list-y, that's just how I think. Feel free to tell me I'm an idiot and should do neither and just spend the semester working, lol, because that's what I think half the time",18Sep2018,1

I've seen them around my school and on the subway from time to time, and am debating on whether or not I should say something the next time it happens. Yet the thing is, I am aware of how creepy and weird it can be to approach someone out of the blue as a stranger.

They're very active and popular on social media with thousands of followers, so it's kind of an an excuse to say that's how I recognize them.

I already requested a change of availability thing so I could get the other job but didn't explain why. It got declined.

85,"Hello All,

So I started a new *unpaid* internship yesterday. I am a graduate student who currently teaches one class and coordinates for a tutoring studio on campus (both jobs I’m paid for), but I decided to pursue this internship because it would look good on my resume.

The role online said the position would require 15-20 hours of work per week, done remotely. I have two days off on top of my weekend, so this seemed highly doable, and so I applied and was given the position.

Well. My boss is a lunatic. The position is for he chief of staff for a start up magazine, but the boss thinks I need to be available 24/7. I worked 8 hours today on tasks for her after working 7 hours on campus. She seems to have the same expectation for tomorrow and it would only be Tuesday. I have no problem giving her the 20 hours a week I agreed to, but I simply cannot see myself working until 10 pm every night. I will  undoubtedly burn out and it also doesn’t allow me to do the work I’m going to grad school for. For instance, I told her tonight that I had a group project meeting at 8pm, and she started sending me ASAP requests at 8:40. I had to go back and forth with her for over an hour about silly formatting on an email she wanted me to send.

So, my question is, how do I professionally let her know that I need to set boundaries? Is it unreasonable to say I will only do work between 8am and 6pm daily unless scheduled in advance? How do I tell her I am willing to do the job, and do it well, but that I cannot do what I did today again?

Please help me be an adult. ",18Sep2018,1

87,"In a Sociology of Sex and Gender class the professor should be open minded and sensitive to people of all backgrounds.  The professor of my class seems to be misinformed and under-educated on certain aspects of the LGBTQ culture.  I have compiled a list of incidents specific to the class. Please advise me on the best course of action to take. 

Last week, the Class Instructor uses the term hermaphrodite alternatively to intersex. Hermaphrodite is widely considered extremely derogatory. Additionally, the teacher includes beastiality as a sexual orientation included with other non heteronormative orientations.  Further stigmatizing these sexualities as mental and sexual disorders 

The Professor tells a story of a man going home with a woman only to find out he is with a man, a transvestite! A student informs The professor this is an inappropriate and outdated term along with hermaphrodite. Professor apologizes citing he did not know and asked for the proper terms to use instead. 

The next week, The professor discusses hetero-sexism ideology and explains he had a conversation with an unnamed person about being told hermaphrodite and transvestite are inappropriate terms. Professor explains to the class that the unnamed person said not to pay attention to those people because they have multiple personality disorders. Professor then asked a transgender student in the class if this is true. ""Do you have a multiple personality disorder?"" The student responded no they don't. 

It is inappropriate to ask about a student's personal mental health in front of the class, especially on a very sensitive topic. Furthermore, by referencing a conversation that transgender people have multiple personality disorders, Professor is insinuating that they could have something psychologically wrong with them.

90,"My parents got divorced when I was just 2yo. I moved out with my mom and two older brothers. My mom worked all day and night to support us and get promotions. So she hired a babysitter to take care of us.

My brothers and I didn't like the babysitter at all. She was an old cranky stern bitch. She was often mean to us, especially me. She punished me for almost anything I did. If my posture was bad I got punished. If I said something without being asked I got punished. She also sent me to bed without having had dinner for no reason. She made me take cold showers. She sent me to bed for no reason a lot actually. This one time she told me and one of my brothers to remember a random sentence. My brother could, but I couldn't because I was only 4 and didn't understand. Then she belittled me, laughed at me and punished me. She would always allow my brothers to do fun things, but not me.

Now the worst thing is. Since my parents were divorced they fought over custody. I wasn't allowed to see my dad for 4 years while my brothers were allowed to. After the death of my mother (she died of cancer when I was 6) I discovered that I wasn't allowed to see my dad because my mom accused him of sexually abusing me. I was shocked to hear it. I remembered my mom as this very sweet and loving woman and could not imagine using me to get revenge. The whole thing damaged my dad, my brothers and it also damaged me. I could not understand why my mom did that and I hated her for it. It bothered me for the rest of my life. So much to the point that it contributed to me attempting suicide. My childhood was pretty miserable from the start because of all that. I never got to have a real bond with my dad. I see him as a friend, but not my dad. 

My traumatic childhood damaged me so much that I'm still suffering the consequences to this day and probably always will. I have been suffering from depression, anxiety and also likely a personality disorder since my childhood. It affects me in all aspects of life, especially relationships. I recently got broken up with by my GF, who I consider to be the love of my life. My issues and mental illnesses contributed a lot to the break up probably, because it affects my behaviour. My life has been pretty awful because of it all.

Now recently I visted my grandma (om my mom's side). She told me that the idea of accussing my dad of sexually abusing me never came from my mom, but instead came from the babysitter. And I specifically remember how the babysitter made me undress completely and asked me where my dad touched me. She suggestively pointed towards my genitals and asked me: ""He touched you there right?"". She continued until I ""confessed"". She made me, a toddler, say it. I guess she told my mom then and that is when the whole shitshow started. I don't know if my mom was in on it or that it was just the babysitters idea. I do know that my mom deliberately tried to keep my brothers and me away from my dad with excuses like that we were sick. So she could've been in on it. Though I know for sure the babysitter was.

Now I can't get answers from my mom since she's gone which always frustrated me. I never had closure because of it. Though the babysitter is still alive and I know where she lives. I want to visit her and just tell her what a despicable and horrible person she is. How she caused so much damage. I could actually murder her for it, but I won't. I luckily have enough self-control to not do that. I can't go to the police though. Even if it can be considered child abuse it is too long ago and it would just be her word versus mine, maybe my grandma and brothers could be considered witnesses, but it's no real evidence.

I do a double take, if not a triple take and then a good stare whenever I see attractive women and it makes me feel pretty creepy. I don't have very many friends that are girls anymore (not for any related reasons) and so maybe girls have become some sort of taboo concept. It's basically to the point where I don't even know how to just regularly talk to other women without having that twinkle in my eye that indicates ""I'm not trying to flirt with you but it's happening involuntarily"" and it really bothers me because I just want to make friends but this weird tension won't dissipate. And it isn't even strictly sexual, I want to have genuine tender moments with girls. Like holding their hand and just treating them how girlfriends deserve to be treated


I've had plenty of gay experiences when I was in junior high and high school but none that were emotionally satisfying and I don't feel like I've been able to have the chance to fully honor the other side of my sexuality. I'm dating someone currently whom is an opulent individual (a man my age) and we have every intention to remain together until life or death suggests otherwise. So maybe one day I'll feel comfortable asking him for a threesome, but I feel selfish in the way where I just want to have an individual experience with another kind girl.

93,"So I'm 22, and my girlfriend is 19. Still live with my family, but I work full time. I've known my girlfriend and have been friends with her for around 3 years now, but we've been dating for around five months now. Started with casual dating, but we've grown much closer through our time together. However, her own home situation as I learn about it is increasingly hostile. Her father is explicitly racist (she's half Asian, yet he's white. He insists that she's full white, and I've actively heard him degrade her Asian family) and her mother actively controls and puts her down, and she's expressed that CPS was called on their family multiple times when she was younger.

She's been expressing to me that she wanted to see a therapist; her mother won't take her to see one because she said the therapist will only lie to her for money. I decided to take her to see my own therapist. My insurance covers it, which I am exceedingly thankful for, so we set this up a couple weeks in advance. Time comes today, I come to pick her up, and she won't answer her phone. I learn that her mother woke her up around 3 or 4 in the morning and started yelling at her, because she wanted help with filling out job forms earlier that day and she oversleeps. She's exceedingly upset about this, because she was genuinely anticipating seeing my doc, and she has an anxiety attack and deletes her social media. I pick her up and take her back to my house, my family is understanding and she spends the rest of the day with me.

I think the best thing for her to do is chiefly, get the hell out of her parents' house.

95,"Hello Everybody, I am needing some advice for the current situation at my job. I'll lay out the scenario for you:

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremost, I love what I do. I enjoy the work I do and the clients I work with. I enjoy some of the people I work with (I'll get into that), my day flies by, and I truly learn something new almost every day. I work for a Wealth Management company, in Account Services. I do a lot of application preparation, in-service account maintenance, account review preparation, and a lot more. 

&amp;#x200B;

My background: 7 years of banking and been in my current position for 1.5 years. Graduated College in 2011 with a Business Management degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Team: I work for a small company. We have one location and there are 8 people who work in our office, including me. 3 advisors, 1 Practice Manager, 1 Account Service Coordinator (me), 1 Data Analyst, 1 Marketing/Events Coordinator &amp; 1 Administrative Assistant. The practice manager, and 2 of the advisors (one is her husband - yes I work with a husband and wife as my superiors) started the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

Workplace Relationships: I get along with the support staff. I don't have much in common with the Marketing/Events Coordinator, and our jobs don't interact a lot, so we don't have too many non-work type conversations throughout the day. I get along really well with the admin assistant and data analyst (she is a friend of mine, and the one that got me the job). The three of us are close, and regularly talk outside of work, and hangout occasionally. One of the advisors is new, but we get along well. The other (one of the owners) is a people person, has a great personality and is very easy to talk to. There is a large age gap, but I feel comfortable going to him with any questions or concerns I might have. My problem lies with the married couple (the Third advisor and the Practice Manager - the other 2 owners). One of my issues is they don't always leave their marriage at home. They frequently call each other honey, babe, etc. They also bicker (not like workplace arguing, but marriage bickering/arguing). They also talk down to each other and overall can be pretty disrespectful to each other at times, and overall their interactions can get really awkward within the workplace. 

&amp;#x200B;

1 Specific Instance Regarding The Married Couple: A couple weeks ago, I had left early. 15 minutes early, max. Well this had maybe happened twice or three times over the course of the 1.5 years I've been employed there (other times I have given her a heads up, these situations I was done with my work for the day, or needed to be somewhere so I left a couple minutes early). Well she called me out on the situation and said it was not good workplace practice, and we work until 5 every day (we are salary employees, not hourly). I was floored by this, not expecting it. I just took it all in, and held my thoughts. The next day, I decided to say something to her, in an respectful manner. I told her I work my butt off day in and day out, and I don't abuse the whole leaving early situation. I told her I thought it was unfair, and I spoke my mind. We quickly moved on to a different work topic. I thought it was done. Well later that week, my advisor called me in his office (he is married to the Practice Manager) and brought up the same situation. Again, didn't expect it because I thought this was over, and should have never been an issue in the first place. However, his take was on me bringing it back up to her. He told me I need to respect her (i did, I made sure to hold my thoughts for a day to not act irrationally). He told me I can't bring those types of disagreements/conversations to her because she is a feeler (they're BIG into Myers-Briggs). I was also floored by this, not expecting this at all. Was confused on this because as Practice Manager, it's her job to manage all the associates. He's basically telling me she can't handle this situation because she's too emotional. He essentially picked her over the business, and that DID NOT sit well with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Situation: We are a franchise, hence the one location with 8 associates. However we are under the umbrella of a parent company. We adhere to their guidelines. Our office has been in business for 3 years. Late spring, our owners made the decision that we will be switching to a new company. We will still be owned by the same people, however our parent company will be a different company now. We will have to adhere to their guidelines, and offer the products they provide. My overall assessment of moving to the new company: Excitement!! The products they offer will be better for our clients, the processes I will have to adhere to are less constricting, and much easier on my job, and will end up saving me time throughout the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Transition Date(s): The biggest problem is we have had 2 projected transition dates, and have not hit either one of them. The owners tell us bits and pieces of information, but overall it's a legal battle to complete the transition (which is not uncommon). We have a projected third date coming up in a couple weeks, but to me the situation is becoming more like The Boy Who Cried Wolf.

&amp;#x200B;

Transition = Stress: With transitioning to a new company comes added responsibilities. I am essentially working 2 full time jobs, while being paid (salary) for one, and being implored (not required) to work extra hours. I am still responsible for servicing current clients. I am still responsible for preparing applications and paperwork for new clients. However, I now have to prepare paperwork (repaper) to move ALL of our current clients to a new custodian. It's a lot of work. I am stressed, every single day, because I have so much to do, all of the time. If I spend a day without doing any of the repapering, I get stressed because I'm falling behind. If I spend a day repapering, but not servicing current clients, I get stressed that I'm not providing the best customer service to our current clients. As a result, things are falling through the cracks, mistakes/errors are being made and it has lead to some issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Mistakes/Errors: More mistakes/errors have been popping up (some due to lack of communication between us and our current parent company, some due to issues mentioned above regarding workload, some due to stress, and some just general mistakes). I am not making excuses for my errors, I own them. They SHOULD NOT HAVE been committed, but they were, and here I am. As a result of the errors, the Practice Manager has placed me on a 90 day probation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Probation: During this timeframe, if I am to make any errors, they have threatened me by saying they will take away 10% of my salary, immediately. I am a salary employee, and never signed any type of contract with them. There is nothing in the policy manual regarding pay being taken away for disciplinary actions. This punishment came out of nowhere.

Overall Feelings on the Practice Manager: Up to this point, she has never bothered me, however she has caused many other associates to leave the business because of her. She is the type of person that is tougher on the females in the office than on me (I'm the only male support staff outside of the advisors). She has never been a problem, until these recent issues have popped up. She has never micromanaged me, but will now because of this probation (side note: I don't do well being micromanaged, and I have told her this before.) My feelings have clearly changed on her, and because of her (along with the stress, and some other issues at work - but alot has to do with her), I am no longer excited to come to work. I used to love coming in to work (as I stated I do love what I do). However, I no longer feel that happiness, and I feel she has taken that away from me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I need some advice:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What do I do about the reduction in Salary? Is that legal? I don't plan on making any mistakes, but obviously nobody plans on making mistakes. 10% is a huge chunk to lose.
2. Do I find a new job? It's really tough to put on a happy face, but is it due to heightened stress from not hitting our transition goals, and currently having to prepare paperwork for 2 different companies, with heightened workloads? Should I try to ride it out and hope the grass is greener on the other side?
3. Do I continue to speak my mind regarding situations at work? I find it very tough to do that when her husband calls me out on it. 
4. Am I overreacting to this situation? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts you can provide would be amazing. Thank you so much for taking the time to ready my long story. It is much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I work for a small company, including working for a married couple. We are transitioning from one company to another. My workload has doubled (salary stayed the same). My number of errors/mistakes have increased. I have been placed on a 90 day probation with the threat of losing 10% of my salary if I commit any additional errors. I have had my run-ins with the manager and advisor (married couple) and am no longer happy at work. I used to love coming in to work, but that is no longer the case (I do still love what I do). Wanting advice on the situation, and if I should leave, or try to ride it out, hoping this is just a blip instead of an overall ever-present issue.

97,"Whatsup reddit,

I'm 22 and there's just something that's been lingering for a while. For anybody that's put their all into sports (or any dream) and didn't get as far as expected, you can probably relate.

I started football in the 8th grade, and I fell in love. I ended up running track and football, and aiming to get into college for one. I was pretty good, but fucked up my training, burned out, got bipolar disorder from steroids, and things got mixed up. I ended dropping all of my sports. I was a division 1 hurdling recruit, one of the best in the state. My head was always in football, though. 

Even to this day, I cringe at the fact that I could have gone ions farther if I knew what i know now. I was always a genetically gifted athlete, even at young ages, and I have a nice frame and height (6'0) was fast (clocked at 4.51 as a junior, but on the track) but was just too immature to focus on one sport (i really wanted to focus on football) and believe in myself. 

Now, my dream of going far in football is essentially over, but even after 4 years, it still always seems to hurt a bit. How do I move past this crap, and move on with my life?",18Sep2018,1

100,"First off, I acknowledge that as a mere sophomore, I barely know anything about love. That being said, I very recently began to change from typical high school boy behaviour to a more ""romantic"" approach to things; the catalyst to this event was me meeting a senior girl at my school. She loves hockey as much as I do, is very smart, and is truly one of the most beautiful people I have known. If it sounds like I am infatuated, it is because I am.  She and I talk every now and then, but it is only ever over social media. I want to at the very least expand our relationship, but when I see her irl she feels ""untouchable"" and distant. I have been losing a lot of sleep thinking about these things, and wanted to hear advice from some anonymous veterans of high school romance.

102,"All names are fake of course.

Every year on our hiring anniversary several coworkers are tasked with giving anonymous positive and negative feedback. I wrote a specific scenario on my coworker ""Sarah""s review about how she overbooks herself and it causes her massive amounts of stress. If she allowed others to take control she could save herself some stress. That is all I wrote officially.

Inside I believe her attitude is difficult to work with because she couples it with demeaning phrases about how she's the only one getting anything done. When in reality, she is just running around like a chicken without a head.

This weekend she asked me out for lunch and immediately told me she knew I wrote the comment about her and she is very upset. She said it was unfair that I wrote the comment because she doesn't like writing bad comments since it stays on your record. I don't agree with that logic at all.

To put the cherry on top, Sarah let me know she isn't mad at me anymore because she talked to Tim, John, Megan, Adam, and Laura who all told her she's amazing and what I said was wrong. 

Is this retaliation and what should I do? She is actively discussing confidential details about me to our coworkers and slandering me. I realize she is looking for validation that she can't seem to give herself. What can I do to communicate how damaging this is without ruining our work relationship?

103,"I live in a hotter climate in California, so I’ve been familiar with mosquito bites for my entire life. Until recently, the only symptoms I would get from a bite were a pea-sized raised area and some itching that went away in a day or so.

In the last two years, the itching from said bites has become maddening. In the past 10 months or so, those little raised areas have become painful, quarter-sized welts that can leave nasty scars if I give in to the unbearable urge to scratch.

Is this progression (of what I assume is a newly-formed allergy) something I should be worried about? I looked it up, but most resources about mosquito allergy don’t seem to touch on such a violent progression.

Basically, should I be concerned or am I just overreacting to a typical allergy reaction? I’ve never really had allergies aside from hay fever, so this is new territory to me.",18Sep2018,2
106,"So I’ve had this weird thing ever since I was a kid. It is REALLY hard to explain. And it might sound rediculous when I try to put it into words. But I’m really curious as to what it is. 

Anyways ever since I was a kid, whenever i lay down at night with the lights off, in my head I will like imagine something being really small and it being compared to something way bigger. And for whatever reason it makes me feel like uneasy, or Disturbed. For example, I'll picture like literally a crumb, next to like something normal sized. And I will just feel weird. Or I will picture something normal but microscopic sized. I specifically Remember when I was little. I pictured a gun that was microscopic sized, and it made me feel so uneasy that I started crying. Sounds so weird but to this day I still occasionally do it when I'm laying down. I'm 16 now. It's not anything worrysome, it's just so damn weird. Like I don't think anyone will know what the fuck I'm talking about unless they've had the same issue or something, I don't know.

Basically I've known this person for about 3 years now and we've always got along and been good friends, we play Xbox together for hours on the weekends and I really look up to him. It seems to me that I probably should have realized this before, since it \*has\* been going on for about a year now, but I guess I've been giving him the benefit of the doubt. It's the usual starting signs of what you would consider abusive: Constantly breaking out in arguments where i'm belittled for having an opinion, constantly having one sided conversations, respect is only really given from me to him and not mutual. The thing that bothers me the most is that if i'm offended by him, maybe something that was said unintentionally,  then I need to grow up and stop being sensitive. On the other hand if \*he\* is offended by something, like a misunderstanding of something I said, then i'm insensitive and need to learn common decency. I get into arguments with him that, most of the time, just end up with him yelling at me for something he was clearly in the wrong on. Once one of these arguments start, I can say \*nothing\* that won't make him mad at me even more. If I try and end the argument by saying something like ""Okay, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I think we should stop fighting now,"" then he tells me that i'm somehow trying to act more mature than him and that I need to deflate my ego.

114,"Some background info: I met this dude (let's call him G) at some visual arts program a while back, and we later found out we were going to the same school in the fall. We also had a group chat with everyone in the program, but since I have an Android, I was never able to get any messages. At the end of the program, since I didn't talk very much to G who was probably going to be in a lot of my classes this year, I asked a friend for his phone number, considering we were all on the group chat. I got it, and we made light conversation for about a day or two before we stopped talking altogether (until we went back to school).

My friend (let's call her A) has been trying to set me up with G since day one. It wasn't until a few weeks, maybe a month ago, until I started developing feelings for G. A makes little jabs at me to get moving and hang out with G, but I've not been able to because of various AP classes and general anxiety about being around someone really attractive. I'd really like to catch up with G, maybe get some coffee or something, but that's another story.

Fast forward to Saturday, and I'm sitting on the couch with A, watching a movie. She gets on the topic of G yet again, asking me when I'm gonna try talking to him without stuttering. A suddenly perks up and begins texting her friend, who has G's number. She already knows I have his number and a small conversation buried somewhere in my phone from about two to three months ago. A then proceeds to get G's number from her friend, and texts it to me despite me making it clear that I don't want it. I'd personally find it really weird if some chick I worked on an art project three months ago with texted me out of the blue. I don't like being weird and creepy, especially not to cute guys.

I still have G's number from the visual artist group chat, and am at a loss of what to do. I doubt he'll remember a conversation we had two months ago. And if his friend says he gave it to A, who ""gave"" it to me, he'll just assume I asked A to ask him for G's phone number, which I think anyone would find weird. I don't want to make things weird between me and G, and in all honesty, I'd really like to catch up with him. He seems really nice, but I just don't know how to approach him. Any advice?",18Sep2018,1
115,"This happened 6 days ago. I need advice and some words of encouragement. I know there is a long road ahead for him and his mother in healing from this trauma and loss, and I will be there by his side through every step of the way. He has already made/been to doctors appointments for medication and therapy, but I’m worried because before the incident he already suffered from PTSD and panic attacks. 

His PTSD has taken over on a whole new level where he relives the experience on a daily basis and the image of what he saw replays in his mind over and over again. I feel helpless when he goes through this and it breaks my heart to see and not be able to help him. I wish I could take all this away from him. 

I haven’t left his side since the incident, and tomorrow is my first day back at work. His mom has been staying with us due to the incident happening at his parents house, so she will be here with him.  I’m just worried leaving him. He’s always been very attached to me, and since this happened he hasn’t been able to leave my side and gets scared/worried if I’m not around. I get scared and worried about him if I’m not with him. 


I think I’ve shut myself off emotionally so I can stay strong for him and his mom, and me saying I feel pain from loosing his Dad and seeing them go through this is nothing compared to what they are going through, even more so since they witnessed it. I feel selfish for being sad and wanting to express to my boyfriend everything I am feeling that I’ve been trying to fight off.  No way can he handle me being upset, and he has made it very clear he doesn’t want to talk about what happened. I know I should open up to someone for support, but I just haven’t felt comfortable leaving his side yet. 

I’m worried I won’t be able to be there for him like he needs me to. He is definitely very co-dependent on me, and sometimes I find myself exhausted, not being able to give anymore, and I feel absolutely terrible about it. (I have depression which I am on medication for, and endometriosis where pain and fatigue are a daily battle)

How can I help him through this? How can I balance being there for him, while also taking the time I need to take care of myself and my health and not feel guilty about it?

118,"Hi Reddit, not really hoping for much but maybe it will help to at least get this off of my chest. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend who I dated on and off for about 5 years. We broke up last January and decided to just be friends, which we have always done very easily. This went fine for a while, until she started dating this new guy. At first nothing was different as far as our friendship went, but as they got more and more serious, he wanted more and more of her time, which makes sense. Before long, I found myself never hanging out with her. We would only really talk in passing or through texting. Some more time went on, and she started to text less and less, until finally I asked her about it. She mentioned that he didn't like to be on the phone when spending time with her, so she decided to reciprocate that and put her phone down too. Well as you can imagine, if they were together all the time, this meant no more texting for us either. One day, I finally said that this bothered me to her. We never spent any time together, even in public (since I can understand her boyfriend being uncomfortable with us being in private together). Long story short, this turned into a fight in which she essentially told me I was expecting too many things to stay the same. At the time I just accepted that and said id try to let it go.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to them breaking up a few months ago. Now she is trying to stay friends with him as well. I thought that we would at least hang out a little more now though and maybe talk more. But nothing changed. In fact, we started talking even less. From my point of view, she is still in love with him and spends every waking moment with him (probably hoping to win him back or something, idk), and because of that, yet again, we speak even less. At this point, she doesn't respond to most of my texts. Yet, she still comes to me for advice about this guy all the time. I finally let it build up too far and I lashed out and told her I felt used and that it hurt that she always expected my friendship but offered none in return. That conversation ended in her asking for some space while we try to fix our friendship. It has been about a month since that happened, and we still are not talking hardly at all, and when we do its the same as it was before I lashed out. It's like nothing got through to her at all or she thinks that I'm just totally in the wrong about everything. In any other scenario i'd say she was trying to ghost me, so I just stopped texting her, but then she asks me whats wrong or why I am being moody. So again, tonight, we had another fight where I explained all of this once again from my point of view. Trust me when I tell you I know that we both want this to get resolved, but I don't think either of us have a clue where to go from here, so we just keep fighting.

Also, I know she browses reddit constantly so if you see this, you are welcome to share your point of view. I think it would help me a lot to hear your side anyways.

I guess i'm just hoping someone here can tell me what I should do next. I can't decide and sometimes hearing a strangers opinion is better than a friends. If you think i'm in the wrong, please don't hesitate to tell me so.

124," 

***Sorry for the really long story!!*** \[I want to mention, by school, I mean *elementary* thru *high school*. **Not** college\]In my Philosophy class, we were told to get a piece of paper and write down any question. My teacher had us write them anonymously and then he read them aloud for discussion. He said to put one question down, but I was stuck between two, so I put both. My first one was ""Why do we go to school?"" which seems like a really dumb question, *obviously* we go to learn and get an education, but since when did an education have to be stressful and difficult? Why are we, quite literally, *'forced'* to go to school? It's straight up against the law not to. I've also heard that there are really smart people in the world who never went to school, they developed their minds by living life and having hands-on experiences. So, this got me thinking *sure school is good for basics, but how much does it actually help, then?* I hear adults say all the time that they never use their educations at all in 'the real world', so the idea of school almost seems useless (I haven't read any studies, I've simply made my own biased observations based on what I've heard)(also, other than literacy, school is kind of useless. Literature &amp; the basics should be mandatory, but specific subjects like Chemistry, French/Spanish, Physics, etc., should all be optional. Either that, or more subjects should be artistic instead of practical. One of my teachers told me how Europe is embracing the arts more and more, and students are actually becoming more intelligent than those who have no impact of arts whatsoever). So that was my first question and I thought that we were going to discuss it like that, but we didn't and everyone got really awkward about it. Maybe it's more 'political' than philosophical, but I still didn't think it was ***that*** *bad*.

My second question was something like ""Why does God use hell against us? If he really trusted us, shouldn't faith alone be enough for him to not need to practically force us into believing in Him?"" (Btw, I wasn't trying to hate on God, I was and still am *genuinely confused* on the concept of hell and why he would send people down there for doing nothing. This is also based on the Catholic religion, so idk about other religions, but this is how it is in this one.)(I also did call God a child in the question, which I'm regretting, and I didn't mean to offend anyone in the class or the Catholic religion, it's just my view on God, you know? I also don't think I should have done that cause the Philosophy teacher is also the **Theology teacher** so.. yeah.....). I know the question is weirdly worded, so let me explain it like this. A kid's parents obviously made him, and when he goes out into the world, they need to keep the trust with him (understandable). To keep their trust with him, they set up an extremely intense punishment(literally hell) if he doesn't stay faithful to whatever trust plan they have (eg: texting, calling, etc.). The thing is, though, their kid is completely innocent; he never goes out and does anything bad, he's always been a good kid, and they have a good relationship with him. This is where freedom comes into play, and free will or whatever. This question obviously was supposed to be more theoretical and philosophical, but like I said, the teach is also the Theology teacher. And obviously, he is a Catholic (technically I am too, I've been confirmed, but I'm more agnostic now. Also, I do go to a Catholic school.) so his conclusion and discussion were a lot more biased than they probably should have been, and as you can imagine, this question was even *more* awkward than the last one. No one spoke at all, which was surprising because usually everyone in this class (I'm not including myself in this, because I'm really quiet. I only know two other people in there). He kept repeating himself, and saying stuff that honestly did not answer my question at all, so idk. Anyways, because of this extreme silence, I feel like I asked bad questions? Or I'm a bad person? Like I said, this class is super talkative, so I don't get why they were so quiet today. It was awful. What would you do in my situation? I think I may have social anxiety or smth, because I worry about crap like this all the time, and the stress never goes away. I felt so nervous in this class, because I felt kind of scared? Like almost as if I were to try to clear up one of my questions, I would be 'persecuted' or smth. I was kinda shaking. What do you guys think? ://",18Sep2018,0

I'm a full time student (mostly online) but grades are suffering due to illnesses, I'm doing my best but I'm so depressed I'm losing interest in my studies which I actually love normally. 

My friends don't visit, and I don't even want them to. I'm in pain and sick and really just want to be left alone, but I want attention and looking after at the same time? If that makes sense. 

My partner is too busy for me and rarely has time for me, plus I don't want to burden him anyway. I feel like there's no point even being with him anymore because I just hold him back. 

My family are loving but they can't help me get better (health wise) and I'm just getting more and more depressed. 
I can barely get out of bed or shower or do anything. I just want to have a drink but I rarely can because of illness. 

I'm just bloody lost. I'm not suicidal, today was the first time I thought it would be easy to sleep and never wake up. 

I'm just depressed, not chemical depression, depressed from being ill and never being able to leave the house and starting to fail uni and my relationship is dull and I feel like a burden. 

I don't know what to do with my life anymore. It really would be easier to sleep forever and not wake up. 

Idk I don't know if anyone can help me but it would be nice if other people could tell me they've had these times in their life and got over them. 

I have my cat, but if I didn't wake up someone else could look after him. I'm just not needed anymore, if I wasn't here everyone's lives would go on and nothing would be different.

TLDR sleeping forever would be great rn.",18Sep2018,1
126,"Whenever things go to crap I tend to get very self destructive. I stop exercising or binge eat or stay up watching tv just to avoid having to re-engage in the morning in on weekdays.

A few years ago I undid 40lbs of weoghtloss after a neck injury., having my identity stolen (and credit scores dropped from 750 to 550 before I could repair the damage), buying a house,  a broken foot (same day I got the keys, go figure), and my dad committed suicide in a 13 month span that also included my wedding. Let's just say I was useless as hell as a husband during the fabled honeymoon stage.  Honestly that year left me so.... dead that I went ahead an put my career in a nosedive. I spent two years dealing with the fallout of all that. And only this spring have i started to go back to being myself. I signed up for a triathalon and joined crossfit in addition to my regular raquetball. I started making gains towards weight loss and fixing my career trajectory. 

All it took was injuring a ligament in my wrist. I cant play raquetball. I cant do crossfit. I cant participate in my hobby. I cant lift my daughter.  I'm about to schedule a recheck, I'm betting on surgery. And all my self destructive behaviors of stress eating, procrastinating bedtime, disinterest In my work are back with a vengeance.

How can I stop piling on to myself? It's like I think to myself ""oh buddy... you think it's bad now... give me 72 hours"" . 

I had we noticed that it is stress related more than depression related. As if I get an extended weekend, no matter how bad things are.... I really start to rally until work starts back up.   And work.. I dont jave a problem with it when the house is in order, and I'm exercising and feeling good. 

This damn wrist just took the wind out of my sails becuase I was fixing it all. I've lost every tool I was using to get right with myself.

130,"I don’t have friends. I don’t speak with my family more than a few times a year. I’m 22F. Let me explain to the best of my abilities. 
I grew up being gaslighted. I learned that much of my childhood trauma was comprised of events manufactured by my father. Even after the divorce, his grasp on my family was much more secure than I thought possible. He’s a master manipulator, or at least was until old age tired him out. I have been confined to a psych ward, homeless, beaten, as a minor all at his hand (or the nearly untraceable trail of it). He physically and mentally abused me, it was much more apparent from the time I was 14-18 and he and I really started losing a grip on reality. I left his home when I was 17, moved across the country and erased myself when I was 20.  At 22, he will occasionally visit as we enjoy each other’s company despite our rough history. 
I have worked very hard to support myself and create a life and some sense of purpose. I don’t have friends and I don’t necessarily want them. It’s been this way for years. I have a boyfriend who loves me very much, I love him too. We live together and have a nice life, we both live with “our life” in mind. I can’t help but feel like there’s something fundamentally wrong with me though. This isn’t a constant feeling, but it happens often enough to be considered a higher nuisance in my life. I haven’t shared this with anyone.
My father moved me around very often.  I went to 14 different schools before I graduated high school so one would find out about the abuse. He was constantly changing nannies. Girlfriends. Towns. Looking back, as soon as someone who wanted to help would catch on, they would disappear one way or another.
 Now that I’m creating something truly stable for myself, I can’t help but feel that I have to face these demons to get past them. 
I’m not comfortable in therapy.
I don’t have friends to confide in. 
I don’t have family to confide in. 
I love my boyfriend very much, but I face a significant amount of fear in telling him what happened to me. I wouldn’t know where to start and I don’t want him to view me any differently. 
I suppose my real question is this; not having anyone close to me, does that mean that there’s something truly wrong with me? Is this a normal part of the recovery process from a severely mentally abusive and physically abusive upbringing?
Any feedback or advice is appreciated. I would very much like to figure this out so I can feel close to people again.

135,"**Background**

My friend group consists of ~15 people, ages 19-24. The majority of us met in high school and still reside in our hometown, either in school or working.

There is an acquaintance, William, who has never directly been in any group messages, but is a friend of several members. I also used to associate with him (6 years ago) but cut him off over general manipulative behavior, stealing from friends, treating girls like trash, etc. Since then our mutual friends have confirmed an incident where he *killed his girlfriend's cat with his bare hands*, with additional rumors about much worse things.

**Tonight**

I walked into our weekly trivia joint, when two of my friends informed me that they thought I wasn't coming and had invited William. This happens every few months, in varying settings. I never escalate the situation, I just leave.

I'm feeling especially furious because I introduced trivia to this group, and it is one of the only social events where I don't worry about running into any small town drama. And my own friends ruined it for me. They are decent people, really, I would not hang out with them if they weren't. But I don't understand how they tolerate this guy just because ""he's never done anything to them personally.""

**Questions**

Is this worth ending friendships over, even when it only happens several times per year? What can I do?",18Sep2018,1
136,"Now, this situation doesn't involve me personally, but this holds a certain importance, since I've seen what this kind of situation leads to as they age.

Now this girl already gets a lot of attention because, in short, she doesn't look like a 15 year old. She looks fully grown and more vuluptuos then the average adult woman. This already gets her a lot of attention and she always posts NSFW pics. Recently, I found her account again and saw shes now selling nudes, selling videos of her twerking, posting her PayPal, and offering ""alternative services,"" which I wont try to assume what that means now.

This presents some issues. If she really is 15, this means that shes supplying child pornography when she sells her nudes. Already a very big issue. If shes not, shes at least masquerading as a 15 year old girl as what essentially would be a marketing tactic (if that sounds blunt or callous, I apologize, I have an issue with that) which means shes pretending to sell child porn which is still bad. Instagram has deleted her accounts already, citing the ""no child porn"" rule that pretty much every website has, but Twitter hasn't done anything. Theres no way to report the sale of child pornography on her account, and it really just rubs me the wrong way. Twitter shouldnt allow the sale of child porn on their website, even if it isnt reat child porn. What do i do here? In some deleted tweets shes even offered sexual acts for a ""sugar daddy."" Again, *15 years old* (supposedly, but still). 

Do I bring this to the attention of the police or other organizations that deal with child porn and/or exploitation? I know what is happening with the account must be very illegal, and personally, I dont want to see a child go down the path of selling her body for money at such an age.

141,"Hi, so first off i'm 18 and have been going to college since my senior year of high school. I have a full year done and I am on track towards transfer to a university as a junior by fall 2019. I am going to school for biology because I want to be a field research biologist.

 I really have enjoyed all of my science classes and look forward to going to them and their respected labs each day. But I have always struggled in math throughout school. I barely passed my pre cal class and am currently in calculus. I am struggling to get by in that class already. Going to that class makes me feel down honestly and it is really starting to impact me on my want to go to college. I HAVE to go through some extra math classes because i'm going to school for a science though.

I have always told myself that I didn't want to have a traditional job. I wanted a job where I move constantly and work in remote locations and environments. Field research biology was the answer to this, I'm able to work with the environment whether that be animals or other aspects of the biosphere, and I'm able to be traveling to more remote locations in order to do my work. 

I'm not one to harp on the need for money or anything, just enough to be able to live comfortably. I just want a career that allows me to do the things described above.

I'm asking for advice on what to do here. Whether I stay in college and finish all 4 years of school to get my biology degree or drop out and find a job similar that doesn't require traditional school, maybe one that requires a trade school or just no school.",18Sep2018,2

Here is the situation. 

(1) Non-profit is well known and sweet. But it is Monday-Friday 2pm-10pm. So I would have 3 sleepless days (working hotel and non profit), and would have to sleep on a table for couple hours on Thursday and Friday in between shifts (7am-2pm), because I need time to get home, and I don't trust myself enough to go to bed and wake up to alarm. But I'd be making good money at a reputable organization i(f I can handle the schedule).

(2) Dollar store is decent (merchandising all day long, and it doesn't further my knowledge in any way). It is Sunday-Thursday 10am-4pm. So, I would have only Thursday to worry about in terms of sleeping. But it would make me less money.

Which one shall I pick?

163,"To start off I am a 15 year old male, and I think I might be depressed. (long story btw) 
It all started when I was younger (around 5) I remember one of my three older brothers had started doing drugs, (I didn't really know what it was or how it affected people when I was that young) when he started he soon became very aggressive towards my parents and everyone else in the family. He was kicked out multiple times and we went through around a year of hard times after being kicked out for a while he came back clean and was super nice. He introduced me to gaming with his pc and I soon thought he was my favorite brother. A couple years later another one of my brothers fell victim to drugs, but this time it was worse. The brother that became addicted had anger issues and if you couldn't tell, it got worse. Not only that but unfortunately I was the only one who knew about this, I decided to come out and tell my parents after finding multiple bongs and such in hidden places. When my parents confronted him about he only got more upset and continued his addiction. During the worst three years of my life full of anxiety and fear that my brother could get mad and snap at anyone at any moment, my parents ended up finding multiple bottles of stolen alcohol in his room (he was 17) they ended up kicking him out for several days. Once my parents allowed him back into the house he brought a gf. We later find out she was 17 (he was then 18) and she was a foster run-away. We've had multiple 51-50s since then and he has even threaten to destroy property. All the while this is happening, I turned 14 and started attending High School. During my first year of High School almost all of my childhood friends changed from being friendly and kind gamers to Drug-using Alcohol-drinking dicks that made fun of everyone that wasn't in our group. After what was going on with my brother I believe that's when I truly fell into depression, I was silent everyday at school while my 'friends' used slang words for drugs thinking I had no idea what it was, I like to think I have strong will and thankfully they were never able to pressure me into trying anything. I ended up convincing my parents that I was ""Too smart for my school"" and now I go to an online school. Now that brother that is addicted to drugs has recently been kicked out for good, however my parents still can't shake him off and he blames us for everything, we also found out that he had taken many things from us, such as my nintendo switch that I got for my birthday. All I do now is sit a my pc and do just about nothing but think.

All this has led up to the present day. I am 15, and can't seem to do anything, I used to be funny, I used to do all my work at school, I used to talk a lot. Now?

166,"I am gonna make this as simple and short as possible: I have no career paths in mind. The first is to follow in my aunt's footsteps and become a respiratory therapist and obtain multiple certifications in the hospital (CNA, Phlebotomy, etc) to gain as much experience as possible in the hospital. My other path involves majoring in becoming a Fitness Specialist, getting a personal training license and make my living that way. On paper, the Respiratory Care path seems like the most ideal because I would make the most money and I am interested in the medical field, but I am unsure if I want to make that my career. For the other path, fitness has always been a huge passion of mine. I plan on starting a fitness page on instagram and I would love nothing more than to help people reach their fitness goals as it has changed my life. The only thing stopping me from doing that is the fact that it does not make as much money, and I have goals of owning properties in the future and I do not want to go into too much debt and not be able to pay for it.

When she was 18 she got drunk at prom and cheated on her date and that summer she got on a sugar daddy website. She went on dates to pay for college and she swears nothing happened. All of her long term boyfriends were abusive and cheated. For some reason she kept in contact with them and only stopped when we started dating. She also had a boyfriend for a semester and cant remember his name. She would date multiple people at once because she said that that was what was the norm there. She was extremely depressed and anxious in college and cut back afterwards but up until 2 weeks before we met she was doing the same things but on a smaller scale.

169,"(This post is a bit work, a bit personal)

I typed up a super long thing when I realized I could say it in much fewer characters. Here’s a summary. :)

Basically, my boyfriend and I have conflicting work schedules, have for a while, and it’s consistently leaving me running on ~4 hours of sleep. We’re looking into getting me another/a different job as this one is super part-time and requires I absolutely work mornings (and my boyfriend’s schedule is laaaate), but it’s a process.

I’ve been napping a lot to compensate and I think that’s effecting my health a bit. We were involved in a car accident recently and lost our vehicle, and I don’t mind being without it for a while because I know it’s temporary (I miss the freedom/convenience of course), we can walk places (our apartment is right next to a plaza and two major grocery stores, a pet store), and the city bus system isn’t too bad. Buuuut the bus runs on a schedule, of course, and with me working so early, I have to get up as much as an hour earlier to work with the bus schedule. This means less sleep for me, which I’m already kinda suffering from to begin with.

When I took this job, it was made clear to me that I would primarily be working mornings, and I’m okay with that! (Especially since my boyfriend’s schedule was different/not as late at the time.) But the schedule I have right now isn’t very compatible with the bus schedule (no busses run that early), and I would in general love to not be a tired zombie in the morning/depression sleeping all the time now.

I know I’ll need to talk to my boss (and I’m in tomorrow so I’ll do that then), but I don’t know what all to go about asking. I’ll obviously tell him I’ll be in as early as possible within my limitations, offer to stay late if I’m in late, etc., but I don’t know if I should also maybe bring up working slightly later shifts so I can get more sleep? I have a host of mental issues on top of it all and the lack of sleep is really catching up to me.

Should I propose a different set of hours, or should I sorta accomadate it to the best of my ability (on normal 7am days I’m fine, bus runs then) and suffer through it until I find a different job (which would be, ideally, by November—boyfriend and I are going on a trip in the first week of October)?

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend and I have super conflicting work schedules, constantly running off of ~4 hours of sleep (and depression sleeping/overnapping to compensate; mental health is effected), temporarily without a vehicle due to car accident and bus schedule isn’t running by the time I start some shifts, when it’s running I sacrifice more sleep by waking earlier to work with it. Dunno if I should propose different hours to my boss or suffer through it until I get a different job, hopefully by November.",18Sep2018,0
170,"Well I suppose the heart of the problem is my anxiety and it’s definitely my fault. 

Coming out of an emotional abusive relationship in a new city and making large strides. I have a lot of shame I’m peeling away.

My insurance changed and everything in my life has been hanging on by such a string, I never sought help with a preferred provider...and fell off my medicine (duloxetine).

It’s been about 1 1/2 weeks, and I know the withdrawal is scary. I have found myself in this position before, and I have get super resourceful when my head clouds to find a way to claw back to a steady place.

I had a wake up call when I slowed on a highway from a car that cut off the person in front of me. A work van hit me from behind. 

I had my seatbelt on, I was jostled a bit, but not hit that hard I think.  It took me awhile to find a place to pull over. I disappointed myself by handling exactly as you’re told not to do; I panicked. I was overcome with guilt. I did not end up exchanging info. I know.

It’s been 10 hours. Over course now I am just scared and googling whiplash. I do have a slight headache now. Tired of looking at articles about it.

Worried about not being able to make a war plan, like my mind won’t wrap around how to get a new doctor, like I’m frozen.

Today we texted how our day was and stuff about the hurricane since we both live in NC and I asked her what place in the world she’ll always wanted to visit but she didn’t answer.

173,"Reading the title, I'm sure you're thinking, *well obviously you need to see a doctor or psychiatrist.* The problem is, I already have a psych and a therapist, am heavily medicated, and am overall in good hands.

 For further context, I have bipolar type 2 which just means the cycles are shorter and I have more prominent depression than mania. 

What I need help with is deciding if this problem warrants asking my psychiatrist for a medication change, or if there's a different way I can get some help. I know that not every mental health issue can be helped with pills, I get that. But I'm also desperate.

The problem is that, for the past 6 months or so, I've been having extreme mood drops (not ""swings"" because it never comes back up). We're talking mood drops so severe that it feels scary. I immediately have suicidal thoughts because the emotional pain is excruciating. It's hard to describe other than, a dip that goes so deep it's debilitating. Absolutely nothing helps bring me out of it. It's pure hell. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for over 10 years now, and I've never experienced this level of sudden depression ""attacks"" like this.

I don't knew what to do. I change medications very often because my psych is trying to find a combo that keeps my mood stable and my anxiety in check.

175,"So a little bit of context. I'm a Computer Engineer who graduated college a year ago, and live and work in Mexico's border.

Currently im working as a Front-end Web developer in a startup (which has been a startup for about 7 years and havent grown any bigger) and supposedly my work hours are from 9:30 to 6pm Mon-Sat but constantly my boss is asking me and my coworkers to stay late (like reeeeaaallyyy late) working 12-16 hour shifts at least twice a week, and in top of this he doesn't pay this extra hours. 

Today he asked me to fix a new bug on a software we are developing at 5pm and expected to have it fully fixed by 6, this plus i had a meeting with a customer on this hours, and finished two other projects i had on my back (due to poor scheduling by my boss) on that time... Obviously i didn't had time to fix said bug and wasn't in the mood to stay late. Instead of saying thank you for finishing 3 projects in less than two weeks he told me we needed to deliver this project because the customer hasn't paid and he is struggling with the payments, so i tell him i will work on them tomorrow despite the fact tomorrow and the day after we are having an event which will last all day and he expect me and my coworkers to work and be on the staff team of this event all day long without any extra compensation. I receive a text message from him at 10pm asking if the bug was fixed and i told him i worked on it at my place but we needed to change the backend (which is done by another co-worker) so i had to wait till tomorrow to talk to him about this changes and my boss asked to start a video conference with the backend developer to which i said no and he then sent a message in a threat tone basically saying he will downgrade my payment (which is bad enough already) because i had been doing a terrible job (allegedly, because in the last three weeks i finished 3 projects and two of them from scratch to fully completed)

This sounds so bad nobody would like to work here, right? Thing is, this is of the best places to be if i want to become a programmer / developer because my city is full of ""Maquiladoras"" which despite the fact of getting a good payment i would end up fixing computer parts or working on Excel sheets, and currently I'm making mobile apps, web apps, and videogames. So a very fun job with petty payment or a bored to death job with a good payment?

Since I'm Mexican i also need a VISA to visit the states and mine is about to expire and i need a one year job to ask for a new one, so if i quit it means byebye visiting the states and if i stay i still have a chance I don't get since my boss pay us in cash and not by the whole legal way (this is to avoid taxes) and government fees and stuff. 

Also since i have already a year in here i finally get my vacations which i already for in October, so if i get a new job before this it means i would need to cancel my vacations.

Tldr: my boss asks for 12-16 shifts constantly without any extra payment, asks for impossible delivery dates, and threatens that if said delivery dates aren't complied he will not be able to pay us. Despite all this i love my job, and what i do, and if i quit im risking my visa papers and will not be able to visit the states any more.",18Sep2018,1

Today I received a parcel in the post. I was a bit confused to see the courier at my door because I haven’t ordered anything online recently. He asked for my ID and confirmed it was addressed to my name and address, so I signed it and thought it could have been concert tickets or something that I ordered a while back. Anyway, I opened the box and a find a brand new phone valued at almost $2000, and a sim card from a phone company I’ve never had any association with (I have no idea how my details would ever be in their system)

I double checked the parcel, it was addressed to me, under my name, address and it had all of my contact details on the receipt. I checked my bank account thinking someone has committed fraud against me and I found I was never charged for the items. 

So I went on to the company’s website and started a live chat with a rep. I explained my situation and they looked into it for me. They then said that someone placed the order under my name, and then later tried to cancel the order because of address issues. They then said they could retake the phone and everything would be sorted.

And then I thought for a minute. If this package is placed under my name and contact details, how could it be proven that I didn’t purchase it?

I have no idea how my details were used on this purchase. I’ve never had any association with this phone company. My wallet was stolen a month ago, but all of my cards have since been cancelled and replaced

183,"For my entire life, I've been mentally ill. Until I moved out got college, I was very volatile. My life skills are still below average, but being forced to improve them while living with roommates helped. Things got a little better. A year and a half ago I graduated, and spent most of that time working in an office. As of a month ago, I'm on a freelance project.

Although I'm blessed to have a job in my chosen field right out of school, I feel like I'm not cut out for it. My anxiety is severe enough to make work feel impossible. I've wasted so much time since starting freelancing from home, staring at the ceiling, too anxious to eat or function. Before this, etiquette/tardiness was a big issue. And, since finding out my dad- my only positive relationship growing up- may be dying, my career motivation has plummeted, since it involves moving across the country. I feel lost.

While I'm not the stagnant, painfully awkward person I was as a teen, I'm still really tired of getting by on the skin of my teeth, and seeing others pass me by- I have the technical skills, just not the life skills. I was hoping that if I took up a barista job for six months or so, I could get a better work/life balance- not be staring at a screen all day, every day, nervously comparing my work to everyone else. Right now my job has direct impact on my self worth. It's everything. I want to check in and check out. I want the creative energy to work on side projects. I'm in my mid-20's, so I have a little time to fuck up-- I've also never been in a relationship, or involved in a community. I wouldn't have been able to do that before, but I could now. I want to have the milestone experiences I was supposed to have already, but was crippled from doing, focus on developing healthier coping mechanisms so I stop laying around, frozen for days. I want to self-actualize a little more, because if I'm how I am now when my dad passes away, I may not recover. 

Or maybe I don't need those things? Maybe I'm squandering the opportunities I have, when I should be focusing on my career, saving money, building my life? Am I making excuses? Could I do these things anyway?

187,"To those who don't know, Yom Kippur is Judaism's holiest day of the year. It's a 25 hour fast where Jews pray and beg God for forgiveness for the past year and for a beneficial judgment for the coming year. Even most secular Jews will fast on Yom Kippur, even if they do it while watching TV and playing Xbox. 

About myself, I came from a religious family, but left it nearly 15 years ago when I realized that I had too many questions and not enough answers. Since then I went to one extreme of eating a cheeseburger on Yom Kippur (eating on YK, cheeseburger isn't kosher, etc.) to mellowing out and slowly getting back in touch with Judaism, not as a religion, but more as a system of morals and a common tradition I and my wife and kids can share with the rest of my family, all who are still religious. My wife is Jewish (not religious) and mainly puts up with the things I do, but even she said that she doesn't think she wants to fast anymore.

if you have seen this posted with another account else-where, that's why.


I have an episodic disorder, that I tried to get diagnosed when I was 14. They (multiple specialists) said that it was some form of autoimmune disorder but couldn't figure out which one. Doctors over the years, tended to just shrug their shoulders, or worse, told me it was solely BC of my weight.

It came and went over the years, getting worse each time. Generally comes every 2-3 years.

unrelated, I got ptsd, which meant as a teen, I was unable to work. I finally fixed my head, and part of that was moving away from my home city. I can not move back home, for my mental health.

Before I moved.away I wasn't able to work mentally, so I had very little money, so no savings. I was overdue an episode.

I got a job... And an episode came. I have never had one this badly. I got so tired I couldn't eat after work. (Even with my partner cooking dinner) I would be crying in pain. I had recently lost about 30 kilos, which meant my cardio had been improving.. for the first time ever I enjoyed running... And overnight I struggled to just walk to the bus stop 300m away, when previously I had been walking 1.5 km and feeling good.

I sucked it up, and started to see a new gp, and I have some referrals to specialists.

At the moment, I can hardly see out of my left eye. I'm laying in bed typing this because I'm so worn out, and in so much pain.

The issue: I live in Australia.

Disability here requires you be 'diagnosed, fully treated and stabilized'. So if I am unable to get a proper diagnosis, I can't get it. If I can't afford treatment, I can't get it. If the outlook isn't stabilized, I can't get it. If I don't meet the requirements for the table, I can't get it.

If I can't get it, it means I will have to live on unemployment, which is 490 dollars a fortnight.

Rent is 240 a fortnight, and there is no where cheaper, except share houses, but with my disability, that's not really an option. (I am unable to keep on top of chores, for one.)

Internet is 30 a fortnight phone is 7.50, I put 40 dollars on my transport card,

195,"I went out drinking for the first time, and took way more shots than I could handle. The next day I threw up around five times. My mouth became pretty sore after that, and I did some research and it was a result of the stomach acid that made contact with my mouth. Two days have passed and the pain is only getting worse though. I have gotten no sleep as my mouth is literally throbbing with pain. I’m typing this 4am after having dreams about how I dealt with my mouth pain only to be sadly awoken. I’m curious as to whether this is more of a dental issue now, or if it will go away on its own.

206,"Right now I work at a Target trying to make some money for myself and also going to college. I would say that I am still pretty new at the job considering I only worked there for 7 weeks and everything is going great. On the 5th week of working there I happen to see a friend from high school. He was dressed up in formal attire like in tuxedos or like coming back from a wedding party. I walk up to him and gave him my informal greetings like how we used to do it in high school ""yo wassup dude!"" and usually he would respond back in the same informal and jokingly way but this time it was very formal ""Oh! Hello Flenzzz didn't see you there.""  I got creeped out for a second because it felt like he got a huge personality change or something. Back in high school, he used to be very funny, popular, and a class clown type of person. After the greetings, we went talking about how's life going after graduating High school and how College is going for us but after I mention about needing a little more money for my textbooks for College, he asked if I want to work a little more for extra money on my day offs. It got my interest and so I proceeded to ask what is the work like and what will I be doing. He responded with very vague answers like ""Oh don't worry you will like it."" and ""doing some technical and computer things."". Even with such vague answers I accepted his offer to work a little more. We both exchanged our numbers to each other and he left the store. While I was working, I started to have thoughts on why did I accept a suspicious offer and regretting it a lot. On my day off, he called and asked if I am available to come in. I wasn't really doing anything important on that day but still having some thoughts about the offer I made up an excuse to having to go mall shopping with parents. Luckily, he understood and said his goodbyes then hung up. Ever since then he never called back. But today during my lunch break at Target, he called back and asked if I want to make some extra money tomorrow. This time I really want the full info on the whole offer but again he has been giving me the same vague answers. I got very suspicious and so he responded with ""Trust me you are going to like it. Come in tomorrow and see for yourself."" I told him ""I will think about it but at least give me the location"" then he said that he will give me the address and the time of the meetup after the call then told me that many of his friends from his elementary school and his cousin that also graduated High school with me will be there then hung up. I got the address and I looked it up, It was his house. I have added him through facebook before and seen him do things with charity or non-profit organizations so I could be drawn to doing the same things with him.         

I heard something like if there was an opportunity to go big, take  it but this opportunity is making me very anxious because a friend from High school is not giving me the full details. 

Should I go take the offer? 

TL:DR 
Met friend from High school. Gives me an offer to work but doesn't give full detail. Accepted the offer but made excuses and didn't go because too afraid. Called back today and got another chance. ",18Sep2018,1
207,"Thanks for reading this in advance.

I am a 30 Y/O Male, I’ve had a group of school friends now since I was 13/14. We’ve grown up together and have always been great friends.

I just want to add before I continue that I have friends I’ve known since birth and who I really see a lot outside of this friendship group who I see separately from many different walks of life.

Back to my friendship group, we are all guys who now all of us (apart from 2) have girlfriends or wives. There are a couple of people in the group who don’t offer much positivity and are selfish, annoying and always think about themselves which I speak to as little as I can, and most of the others who I really get on and have a good laugh with.

We all have this WhatsApp group which I rarely reply to anymore as I get ignored most of the time when I say something and a few of the people always seem to kiss the asses of the guys who act like dickheads.

I have done so many favours for most of my friends and I always will (never expecting anything in return) yet these guys never have but every still seems to kiss their ass. I suppose because I don’t go out as much as the others that’s why they don’t talk to me as much. 

Lately me and my best mate (not in this friendship group) have formed another group with some of my wives friends blokes and we are getting on so well that it makes me want to see this new group more than my old friends.

I’m not sure what I’m asking or trying to say but I guess I’m venting.

I am currently trying to lose weight and get fit whereas almost all my friends in my original group are slim and just love to get pissed all the time. 

I do feel as though if I were slim fit and in good shape I would want to go out more with them because I can have a few drinks and not worry about putting on weight but there is another part of me that thinks am I drifting away from them? It’s impossible to separate myself from the annoying people in the group because the guys I get on with are friends with them.

Sorry for the rambling and changing topic here and there but if anyone has any advice or guidance in how to deal with this I’d greatly appreciate it. ",18Sep2018,1

211,"Ten years ago, I was assaulted by my college professor. He’d done the same to another young woman. It was on more than one occasion, a systematic abuse. At the time, I sought counseling, but never reported it. I don’t know why. Part of me felt responsible—I did have a crush on him—and my suffering didn’t seem important enough to ruin his career. I idolized him. My psyche seems to be permanently damaged. I still dwell on what happened and in some ways it impacts how I’ve functioned with men since. With the #metoo movement, I’ve felt renewed interest in telling people of my assault. But it’s been 10 years and I feel embarrassed to drag him through the mud now. I feel complicit. He was 37/38 and I was 20/21. He likely still preys on young woman, I recognize this. He took my virginity.

Should I come out with my story? Part of me feels that the professors I keep in touch with would think of my differently. I was an adult.

213,"I recently went back to work after nearly four years of being unemployed by choice. I’m a nurse so being out of the field for that long is a big deal. I’m working part time, and overall I’m really happy working there. 

The reason I took off for 4 years was to go through infertility treatment. My husband and I had decided that we were out of options (and adoption was not something we are considering) so I decided to return to work. During my interview I was honest about my reason for being out of work and said that we were finished trying fertility treatments. However, we recently found a new doctor and have a new set of options. The problem is my insurance. 

My new job offers awesome insurance. The only problem is that it only covers doctors in the same hospital system. The new doctor is in at a different hospital system. 

As it stands I see 4 options...
1. Quit my job, go back on my husband’s insurance, likely not be able to go back to work if this fails
2. Pay for everything out of pocket, keep my job, use paychecks plus some to pay for treatment
3. Switch to the non hospital based insurance, pay $1500 a month in premiums, leaving me about $100-$200 a month after taxes and insurance
4. Ask my boss to drop my employee status below 40 hours per pay period to 32 hours, become ineligible for insurance through work, go on my husband’s insurance

Option 4 seems like the best but I feel really bad for asking my boss to do that after I said that we were done with treatment. Am I just overly concerned or is my worry justified. What would you do?",18Sep2018,1

Some backstory real fast, I was in a relationship with my ex for a year and a half and it ended for several reasons which I don't want to get into. I decided we shouldn't talk afterwards because it was too much for me to handle at that time. Fast forward 6 months (3-4 weeks ago) and it's her birthday, I texted her to wish her a happy birthday and we began chatting and agreed to meet up again. We're seeing each other regularly now and it's been really nice for the most part. Hanging out with her and seeing her has been great and I'm super happy that we're reconnecting. She was my first real love and I haven't completely gotten over her so I do have some feels, meanwhile she's moved on completely. It hurts but it's whatever, I'm dealing with it and am content with just a friendship. That said, anytime she mentions another guy I feel myself shut down and get very sensitive very fast. Even if it's just one she's friends with. No matter how much I tell myself how irrational these thoughts are, they don't seem controllable at all. I already knew I had a problem with jealousy during our relationship but nothing like this. I was never controlling about it when I dated her, but sometimes I'd be bothered by her hanging out with or talking to some guys. I know there's no commitment between us, I know she's single and wants to experience life and other people, I know it's okay for her and myself to see other people, but these thoughts just eat me up and I have no idea how to deal with them and would love some advice if any of you have some.

Its been about 2 years since my thought about living abroad is bugging me. The problem is that my university is causing a huge hindrance in pursuing my passion/career as an Android developer. The way the situation has become, I can either be an Android developer or just be a normal student only having enough time to focus on university-related studies and at the time of graduation, I come out as an unskilled person. I am stuck in this dilemma! I have to say that I have many different goals like setting up my business and etc. But I am horribly confused on what to focus.

He brags and expects me and whoever else we might be with to praise him, but has proven to never do the same for others. For a general example, the main game we play is a competitive one and we make a good team. We win most of our games, but the problem is that he really only cares about how he does. He talks himself up and makes cocky remarks and does that whole song and dance routine and all the while he fails to acknowledge my contributions to the victory which, I promise this isn’t said with any cocky or malicious intent, are 9 out of 10 times bigger than his by a considerable margin. But I never say anything about it. In fact, I usually choose to forgo mentioning my own performance altogether and instead give him his praise just simply so he doesn’t loose confidence, which I realize probably only further perpetuates the issue but that’s just what I do in the moment. The one-sidedness branches out into other aspects of the friendship as well and the most recent example came just yesterday. We were supposed to play and he told me he would switch from another game he was playing within a few minutes, but that never happened. I ended up waiting almost two hours without so much as a message from him and on top of that he even ignored me when I hit him up asking him where he was. The whole thing was pretty blatant. I’m just sick and tired of his selfish attitude where it’s “I have to feel like the king” and I don’t know what to do. I will say that the one redeeming quality he has is that he has always stuck up for me when I wasn’t there to stick up for myself. He’s always had my back against people that talk behind my back and I have greatly appreciated that for the 8 years I’ve known him. I’m really conflicted on it because I just don’t feel that there’s mutual respect when we’re actually hanging out. It feels really one-sided.

I didn't linger at their booths or anything either, just met them, told them how I felt and moved on. I know some other fans stick around and chat when the booth lines aren't long, I'm wondering if I should have done that to try build more of a friendship with them. 

I just want to leave a positive lasting impression. Does anyone with more con experience with celebrities have any feedback or thoughts on the matter? I think I'm just looking too far into it because these are my idols and it's important that I came across in a respectable way. Any advice is appreciated, thanks :)",18Sep2018,2

241,"Hey guys,

I’m working at a school overseas and have been teaching there for the past 3 weeks. I didn’t realize it when I started, but I’ve been teaching an extra 1.5 hours each day. That means I teach 6 hours each day and have no time to grade or plan at school while other teachers do 4.5 hours and have time to plan or grade. I’ve also been doing all the subjects for my classes whereas most other teachers focus mostly on only English or some do a couple of the smaller subjects (math, history, health, etc.)

I realized shortly into my first week that this was the case and immediately alerted the head teacher. She said she’d figure it out. I’ve been trying to reach out to this teacher once a week or so now to make sure she gets this figured out, but I’m starting to lose patience. I’m getting paid the same as every other teacher for doing an extra 7.5 hours of work each week.

Supposedly this situation is getting figured out soon, but I really can’t keep going at this pace. I’m very scattered right now trying to keep all of the subjects straight and keep my classes on schedule, and I am exhausted and worn out every night when I get home. I feel like I’m getting burnt out and I’m feeling a bit taken advantage of with my schedule.

I want to email the head teacher on Friday of this week if I haven’t heard back from her about a new schedule, but I’m wondering how I could word all of this in the most polite way. I’m really fed up with how lackadaisical the school has been in handling this, and I’m planning on going to a different school if it’s not worked out soon, but I don’t want to make it sound like I’m necessarily giving an ultimatum.

And after 2 year in the university, everything goes quite well actually, i love my major, university, friend, and my score is quite good (ofcourse it's not the best-by asian standard if you know what i mean LOL). But once in a while, i still feeling stressed out and then the depression and guilt about dropping out of the previous university catch me again.

We are all some form of gay (sexuality is complicated dont worry about it for this, its not an important factor.) but last conversation about romance we had was we were all not interested in dating atm.

 I was so happy to be moving in with people who I trust and feel comfortable around. Im a very anxious person and get social anxiety very badly. These two I just click with and was unworried about living with thm. We are super open and try to be communicative. We are all also very affectionate, cuddly, and like to fake flirt. We had a great dynamic. We were all excited for a friend house. But the night before i moved in they decided to become involved romantically. They didnt tell me for ""my own sake"" because i was stressed rearranging my whole life. I found out almost two weeks later because i saw them making out in the car. They had been cuddling with me and acting normal, but sneaking off to smooch.

Its just not what i signed up for or was prepared to deal with. 

It leaves me the third wheel while trying to adjust to an entirely new living situation. Changes the dynamic and makes me feel left out and insecure. They are trying their best to avoid that but im still noticing the little things they do to treat me different. Them having settled into a routine before i moved in also makes things worse.

I just wasnt aware i was agreeing to move in with a new couple and not two friends. We seemed even before but not now. My best friend is definitely biased towards spending time with our roomie. Makes sense but hes being extreme about it and i just got here so its hard. He just locks himself away when they arnt around. Even roomie noticed and agreed when i asked them if i was just crazy. We all hangout sometimes and thats fun but they sometimes act like we are all parting ways and then when i go... they continue. It makes me feel like i was in the way or unwanted the whole time before. They could just tell me when they want time. Even if i might feel a bit sad id never hold that against them. Just the way they go about it gets to me.

I am happy most of the time but when it gets to me i cry and at night i feel like i wanna just go back home where i know im not in the way. Am i justified a little in feeling this way? Any advice on how to deal with the new dynamic?

I’ve had a really difficcult childhood. The relation with my parents has been more than toxic and I am feeling that it’s taking over my life more and more. My mother was really abusive and manipulativ, and my father was never there to take care. And lot of other bad things happened..

I am 24 (girl) now, and I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about three or four years.

I started this relationship with him because I wanted to convince myself that I am capable of loving a man (since I only had really close and intense friendships with girl). I’ve never felt a strong bond with him like I have with woman, but i wanted us both to work out to badly. I want to be with him, to be happy with him and get my life together. But I am obsessivly gravitating torwards woman (mostly my best friend): I want to kiss her, be with her, touch her. I am quite sure that she hasn't any intentions being with me, which is fine for me.

But I don’t want my messed up childhood determine how I live my life now.

I often feel like I need to breakup with my boyfriend. But i just can’t. He is my little light in life. He is just so wonderful, loving, sweet… but I almost broke up with him three times because there is an emptiness inside of me that he cannot fill. Because i get often desperate and feel like I need to leave everything and everyone. Because sometimes I have the feeling that I can only be purely happy with a woman. But i don't want to accept this solution.

I considered that I might be gay. And i also told my boyfriend and my bestfriend. Both of them said that it might be possible but that it’s also possible that I am misinterpreting this thought/feeling.

261,"TLDR: I work for a social landlord and love providing homes for the vulnerable. The place is underfunded and disorganised to the point where I feel clueless, stressed and depressed. Should I leave?



I've been working for a social landlord for the last 6 months and have, mostly, loved my time here. The people are so welcoming and friendly and tje pay is really good.

There is one fundamental flaw to the organisation though; because it's a non for profit, budgets are tight and all of our resources are stretched as fuuuckkk. We're constantly understaffed and behind on targets, which is stressing me out beyond belief.

During the last two months, the pressure of having so much work to do and not enough people to do it started getting to me. I was having panic attacks and spent most of my time outside of work cripplingly depressed. 

My manager was very supportive and allowed me to change my day to day role from my main job of answering the phones (where 22 people would share answering 200+ calls a day- woo!) And instead crack on with the admin we were four months behind on. In 6 weeks, I managed to bring us to just two weeks behind our target for admin. This really helped to reduce my anxiety and my co-workers commended me on my work.

However, because the admin work I was completing doesn't have any KPIs attached to it, my managers decided that I couldn't continue this admin work, despite there being a lot left to do and more paperwork coming through daily. 

Jnstead, they moved me to another department where I have no fucking clue what I'm doing. I've been sent to a new manager who had no idea I was joining his team and who has no time to train me because we're so understaffed he's in six places at once.

I feel kind of sad and pissed off - I was working my ass off to clear the admin work and I was getting good at it, but because that didn't suit management, I've been thrown aside to another department. I have no idea what I'm doing and am once again stressed beyond belief. I'm 22 and I feel like I've aged a decade since starting here six months ago. I care about social housing and helping the vulnerable to live independently, but I can't cope with how disorganised this place is.

We have a phone plan together, and a dog together. The reason she wanted space was so she could figure out how to make herself happy/how to be independent. A lot of the reason it happened was because of stress form her family. But it’s also my fault. She felt like she was 100% committed 24/7. She felt like I wasn’t. I’ve always been a little scared of commitment, but I am and always have been 100%. It just didn’t show. Anyways, neither of us are in a point where we can get apartments on our own (at least, not in a good part of town) so she’s got a friend in our apartment now (it’s two bedroom). She asked me to stay with her so I wouldn’t have to live in a bad part of town or on a friends couch, but I’m not sure what to do. I’m worried that staying with her will hurt my chances with her. I know for a fact that she loves me, but I’m not sure if she’s willing to try again. She means the world to me, and I would do absolutely anything to get her back.

266,"So I recently had to do a group assignment for a university course - of my group of 4, 2 were completely useless and put barely any effort in. However, the 3rd person turned out to be way better than I could have imagined. We met up multiple times from 8am, five days straight to basically do the assignment for the other 2 members. But I ended up having an amazing time, because our conversations about the assignment were so stimulating. Something about him made me feel confident about wanted to say, and (for once) feel comfortable to say my opinion. 

We even texted a lot in anticipation for the group presentation, and I had a blast messaging back and forth about how hilariously horrible the rest of our group was. I remember feeling so thrilled and wanted when we messaged me the day we handed in the presentation to say that he ‘backed me up’ in peer assessment (since I’d previously mentioned to him that I would give him really good peer marks because he’s put in a lot of effort).

Anyway, long story short, the next week leading up to a class tutorial, I was getting kind of excited about seeing him again. It’s something I’ve never really felt before, so I kept rationalising it by telling myself that I barely know him, and that I don’t even have time for a relationship (especially because I doubt he would even like me in that way).

So we get into the tutorial room, and we smile at each other, and as I go to sit down at the back of the room, I notice him smiling to himself. Maybe I’m reading into things, but something about the way he smiled to himself as he sat down made me feel really weird (in a good way lol). 

Here’s the part I need advice on: now that the assignment’s over, how can I keep him as an acquaintance and slowly become friends with him (and maybe something more)? I’m not too good (pretty bad actually) at putting myself out there, and I need a strategy so that I can approach him, maybe sit next him in class, strike up a conversation, etc. so keep this thing going. Basically I’m sick of wondering about things that could’ve happened in my life, and I want to start making them happen. So if anyone has any ideas, I’m all ears!!

She's 26, fresh out of school, no bills to pay, no responsibilities, has probably been spoiled rotten by her parents all her life ( still lives with them ), and acts like a 12 yo. She requires and immense amount of attention from everybody and talks about her issues out loud all the time. And it seems that my entire team is willing to give her the attention she wants, and it's pretty much killing me. 

Last week, we all went - our entire team - to the restaurant with some suppliers, and she forgot her super expensive umbrella at the location. Next morning, she calls the restaurant and is told that they can't find it. She then starts crying and sobbing. At first, no one notices, so she starts sobbing louder until everybody in the department surrounds her and tells her how awful it is that she lost her expensive umbrella. I pretty much had to leave my desk and go take a walk to calm down, as I was about to burst in flames. This kind of thing happens a lot - health issue ( she's talking about a throat ache since last monday ), travel issue, etc. It's never anything important but she just makes a big deal out of nothing. 

I told my boss a couple times, but he still gives her all the attention she needs, while i barely get a '' Good Morning ''. I don't have any issues with her work, so it's all purely personal. I don't know what to do anymore, because I get irritated just by looking at her and it's driving me insane.

Should I :

1. Tell her that she needs to stop being an attention-seeking brat.

276,"Obligatory writing this on mobile, sorry for formatting.

One of my previous best friends throughout life had ended up in jail a few years back. When he was arrested he attempted suicide, and ended up having open heart surgery and he lived through it.

He didn't want to talk about what happened leading to his arrest much, but basically blamed it on him being 18 and he had sex with a girl a few days short of 18 (in a state where legal age is 18, we lived in a state where it is 16), and her parents were pressing charges.

Our friend group forgave him and welcomed him home, after he took a plea deal. Fast forward to a few months back and his sexual Predator status was released to the public with his crime, which was very different from what he told us.

It was rape of a 14 year old. Which, unsurprisingly after that came out all of his friends/family/job all abandoned him. 

Now I don't condone what he has done in anyway. It is absolutely horrid for that girl, and I in no way forgive him for what he did. 

I care immensely for people, and always try to see the good in someone. And while his action is unforgivable, he was never a terrible person in general, and made a horrible decision.

I remained someone he could talk to if he needed, never seeing him since and hardly ever messaging, but I wanted to be there just for someone to cry to even if I don't want to be directly prevalent in his life in any way. 

Hes come to me a few times feeling extremely suicidal, and I've talked him through stuff and he was able to pick himself back up a few times and keep trying to live in the mess he created.

He has told me that he has reached his expiration. And he is in a place that I don't doubt it. He has given himself until his birthday, a week from now. 


This is where I'm looking for advice:

He asked if we could meet up one more time, which I  have too many feelings about. I honestly don't feel scared in anyway of him, but I am cautious. I don't think safety is a concern, but it is a thought. 

I'm left in an emotional conflict, if I see him just a few days before he goes that might make it hurt even more if I see him and he is still the kind person I remember after not seeing him for so long.

Or if I don't meet up with him will it hurt more knowing I wasn't there to say any goodbye, and I abandoned him as well in the end.

Then there is also the option of, do I just let him go through with it? Do I not? Do I try to talk him out of the whole thing again, or do I let him have his peace. Should I call 911? I don't think he will ever be able to be helped because as long as he is a marled as a sexual predator, people will never forgive him.

Or is there anything else I can do?

I'm sorry if this is a mess, lots of emotion coming out.

Thanks for any advice",18Sep2018,4

# small backstory

We've been friends since I basically started College and she's slightly older by one year, it has been two years now. Since we've been friends, I always kept my *little crush* on her ever since then, its just been some light joking around and meme'ing with the two of us. It wasn't until Summer, I asked her out on Deadpool 2, and she said accepted straight away. I enjoyed it, but it got kind of awkward when we got to my house, I kept trying to keep conversation and finding stuff to do so I became increasingly nervous until she went home. After the ""date"", or at least I think it was a date. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started to think, ""shit, what if she just saw this as a friendly hang out"" I started going through loads of ideas in my head over a message, ""she just called it Movie Night"" And that got me thinking all kinds of shit.... 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway it has been one month since this semester started, now it is September, and she and I haven't been really hanging out that much, not even making much contact during College.... Only through snapchat and other social medias. Just today and yesterday, we actually made small talk on the Bus and on the way to College, but that is all. And a few days ago, I just started thinking, maybe I should just confess and say I like her straightforward on Snapchat or just face-to-face when I have the chance or just ask her to meet at a certain area and tell her that way. 

But like I mentioned earlier, there is this part of me that is afraid. Afraid of ruining or end up other negative possibilities. I'm know that, if she says no, nothing bad will happen. But. There is just that one certain part that stops me from asking.

282,"So I know this is extremely personal opinion but I was just looking for some outside view points and maybe some things I had thought of. 

   Currently I am 25 and working as an hvac apprentice. 
      The work is eh I find almost no joy in it. They pay as an apprentice sucks it is Barley above minimum wage and the work is way too hard for that pay. Everyone says Don’t worry Once you get you’re license you’ll be making good money. Problem is even at 30-40 An hour this work DOES NOT seem worth it to me. Just the whole trade persona really rubs me the wrong way. 

    So recently I started learning programming and eventually want to make a career change even though I know that is some time away in the near future however. I begin taking classes (online) towards a degree very soon and will be self learning as well. 

   During this period I am unsure of if I should
Stay in the trade making barley above minimum. Let’s say it did take me until I finished school to completely switch careers that would be 4 years down the road and I would be licensed. (Which wouldn’t make me want to stay) 
 
  Or if during this period I went back to my old
Career of bartending where the money was fucking great for the work being done typically 30+ per hour as high as mid 40s. As well as  working as a bartender would allow me tons of time to study for school and programming in general. (And in my opinion raise my Quality of life)

    Any insight it appreciated and will be (probably) used to help me mull over my decision. 
 
  Just so any one that cares has an idea right now my plan is to do one semester sticking in hvac to see how it goes and then rethink it over with my new found data. ",18Sep2018,1

Well about two weeks ago we broke up.  We broke up because she told me she needed time to heal after  a recent suicide attempt I made about 2 months ago.  Well, we still talked every day and saw each other basically every day, she came over last Friday and we had sex like 3 times, and then she left for West Virginia that weekend and came back Sunday (not this most recent Sunday but the Sunday before that).  I was watching a football game with my cousins and she wanted to hangout as soon as she got back so I left my cousins house and went to hangout with her for the whole day.  That Monday we hung out during the day then at 4 A.M.  she called me and asked me to bring her medicine because she was sick.  Which I did and I didnt leave until like 5:30 and I had class at 8:45.  Then Tuesday we hangout again and I'm thinking things are going pretty well.  But my cousin advised me not to get back together with her and gave me a list of valid reasons, all things that should be addressed if we were to get back together.  I bring it up to her on Tuesday and tell her that things are going great but I need these things to change from you if we're going to get back together.  She started crying and was like everything you said is right and I know I need to change that stuff.  So I'm like okay cool.  Wednesday comes it's a whole different story.  She totally flips everything on me, insults me, blows up my phone, and says that this isn't worth all of my friends and family hating her.  I told her the only impression they have of you is the one you've given them and that if you're not going to change then you should leave.  She didn't respond and the whole next day I didn't hear from her until I text her at night and we ended up getting in a huge fight.  This was the first time I ever tried to say anything mean that would hurt her feelings but she's way better at it than me and brought up something that I've literally only ever told her and she used it to hurt me.  It really messed with me and I told her I wanted to die because of it but  I repeatedly told her I wasn't suicidal and I just wanted to go to sleep.  She called the cops on me twice and the second time they came the cop was like dude this is the second time we're here tonight just come to the hospital with us it will be like two hours if you come willingly or I can pink slip you.  Having been pink slipped before I was like okay I'll go.  So I stay there for like 14 hours.  My ex comes to visit me and cries and tells me how much she loves me and how sorry she is and that I mean the most to her in the world this and that.  Then she leaves a case worker comes in and says to me that my ex made it ""abundantly clear"" that we broke up weeks ago and that she ""wasn't sure why I was texting her in the first place"" and that she thinks that I think we're still dating and the case worker literally was talking to me like I was obsessed with her.  Then I get out of the hospital to find out that she did the same thing to all of my friends and family, basically making it seem like she had no idea why I was contacting her and we haven't spoke in a long time.

Hello I am a 34 F. My partner (27m) has a younger brother (24) who split up with his girlfriend around 12 weeks ago. Since the breakup he has tried to kill himself once (apparently. There are no marks no hospital trip. He told us he tried to hang himself but there is not enough space in the area he said he tried). He has repeatedly tried to get his ex girlfriend back and at times we have messaged his ex to make sure it is really over (we are still on friendly terms with her) He came home a week ago and told his parents (my partners Mum and Dad) that he was going to kill himself in a months time. As you can imagine they have been extremely upset. Tried to get help for him. However. We have since learnt that the reason for the breakup was in fact abuse. He was abusing his girlfriend by making her do things sexually and mentally abusing her. She had to go to victims of domestic violence counselling to get out of the relationship. We now have found out that before telling his family that he wants to try to kill himself again he’s told friends.... but only the friends who all have connections to his ex and we now believe that he may have done this because he thought one of us may tell her and she would come back to him. It has backfired on him with her telling him she wants him to keep away. He is still hanging onto her. At first he would say he wanted to kill himself because he couldn’t be without her. He didn’t want her as a friend it had to be a full on relationship . He learnt she didn’t want a relationship so now it has turned into if she’s my friend I won’t kill myself. Basically putting all the pressure on this girl who clearly doesn’t want him in her life. She’s even went secretly to his parents to tell them why they broke up and they have brushed off the fact he was abusing her! What should we do? I have previously been in a relationship with domestic violence and I now feel like a hypocrite helping him. He has serious problems but where do we even start? ",18Sep2018,4
298,"The current job is to keep tabs on another PI that my client has hired (max paranoia, or so I thought) with particular interest in whether the investigator makes direct contact with the people he's investigating. I know of the people he's investigating, a well known pair of twins. Conmen, non violent, I'll call them the twins for the sake of simplicity.

Long story short: For the life of me I couldn't find this PI I need to keep tabs on. After a few days I was assured by my client that the PI was consistently on location because he's been sending photos of the twins on a regular basis. *In hindsight that's pretty odd as the twins have done nothing worth noting or capturing since I arrived, so to keep sending pictures would be a pointless waste of everyone's time.*

Also, it's worth noting that my client never wanted to meet in person.

After a week and a half, I asked my client to send me some photos the PI had sent him so that I could get to grips with his location, it was a bit embarrassing and a blow to the ego but my only option left to find this PI.

**Where was his location?**

**My car**

**The PI had taken photos of the twins from inside my car, sitting in the drivers seat.** This guy's f\*\*\*ing with me, He knew I was there the first day I arrived, I know that because the progress of the building work in the background matches my first day there. I always leave my car for a portion of the day in this type of work (food, coffee, shit etc) not to mention the police tend to get called about “a suspicious man in a car” and blow things out the water, so to speak. He must have entered at those times, but this isn't even the worst part.

Roll back two days before hand: One night, sick of sleeping in a car seat after realising I was getting nowhere, I stayed in a grotty old dump of a hotel that had reasonable view of the twins so I could safely presume the PI would be close by and I wouldn't miss anything. I only stayed one night, it was worse than sleeping in my car.

All the photos my client sent me were taken from my car. All except **the one from the window of my hotel room... With me in shot... While I'm shutting the door leaving. Meaning he would have been in the room with me, and must have entered while I was asleep.** It gets worse.

Last night I found a note in my pocket:

&gt;*“He clocked you the moment you arrived*  
&gt;  
&gt;*under no circumstances should you open the boot of your car*  
&gt;  
&gt;*You've entered a game you know nothing about*  
&gt;  
&gt;*you cannot simply leave, you'll need to speak with us*  
&gt;  
&gt;*T.H.B”*

T.H.B are the initials of the twins which I haven't actually seen since I slept in that grot hole of a hotel. Their caravan hasn't moved.

Normally, I wouldn't worry myself in this type of situation but the pictures, along with the boot comment, have me in a panic and I make it a point not to make decisions based on panic. I haven't slept all night so my judgement is even more clouded right now, either this is genuinely from the twins, or I'm being played further.

Either way I'm cornered and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to continue as if nothing happened except I can't bring myself to leave the car. I need to make a decision soon. I have my suspicions about what's going on, but I want to know how others perceive this as clear headed outsiders of the situation before I taint it with my own logic.

305,"i feel so empty all the time. im not bored. im just numb. i waste my days away by lying on my bed and staring at my ceiling. i have a ton of schoolwork i do last minute or not at all just lying around my room. my grades are dropping and im just losing my focus. i experience absolutely no joy or sadness, or anything at all. just nothing. a whole lot of nothingness. i used to be very creative, but it seems as if all the creative energy i had just disappeared. i used to believe in my abilities and have ambitions, but now im just kind of counting days until i get old and die from some illness or something.
if someone asks me how im feeling, i just don't know what to respond with. i usually just fake a smile and tell them that i'm having the time of my life. i used to get bullied in my previous school for getting good grades. since that i changed school and no i no longer get bullied. my family also moved to a much prettier and better place. so if anything my living conditions improved. 

i just want to know why i'm feeling this way and how can i fix it? is it normal? i don't want to bother my already hardworking mom with this and i just feel like my dad will only give me some random ""it's only in your head"" bs. did anyone deal with similar issues as me, and if so, what helped? 
thank you for any kind of response, i appreciate it a whole lot!",18Sep2018,6
306,"I live in a small country, and im also a famous entertainer in this country. Many people recognize me, and want to be my friend. 

Before I became famous (at age of 16), I had no friends (well maybe one and he wasnt that close to me). I had social anxiety and was very quiet. After I became famous, my social anxiety cured, but I still stayed quiet. I had no problem talking to people or having conversations, but I still was rather stay quiet near other people. 

Being famous however brought another element that makes it even harder for me to make friends: People want to be my friend just to brag about it, or because they are fans of mine. Every person who gets close to me and talks to me start talking about money or about what I do and asks for advices and doesnt show that he really cares about me at all. This really makes it hard for me to trust people who recognize me.

Im 21 now and I have one friend who I dont talk that often, I also have a gf, who tells me to go find friends because im too clingy. (I am).

**TL;DR: cant find friends because 1. Famous and its hard trusting people as they often come close to me to use me.
2. Cant start conversations with people",18Sep2018,2

309,"I'm wondering what the best protocol is for this situation. I really want to stop hanging out with this person Rick because of his treatment of my best friend, but I can't tell him why because my best friend Mary doesn't want me to mention that she has confided in me about her troubling situations with Rick, and she would prefer to deal with the situation on her own.

Mary lived with Rick for a few years. During that time they had a short-lived pretty quiet sexual relationship (maybe a few months long, but Rick didn't want to make anything public and Mary broke it off with him because he had some anger and control problems, coupled with depression, work instability, and some debt). She eventually moved out of the apartment mostly because he tried to make her guilty for having her current boyfriend to their apartment, even though he had a girl stay over multiple times. Mary has told me and our close friends about her difficulties with Rick and his anger and guilt-tripping, which was tough for her to deal with because she considered him a friend and was hurt by his treatment of their friendship. Also relevant: Rick took in a cat but didn't have the money to pay for anything vet related. Mary, who loves animals and is a good friend, agreed to split vet bills with Rick. She ended up paying for everything over the short life of the cat because Rick doesn't have a steady job, so even split, he owes her $1100 and hasn't tried to pay anything back over a year and a half.

Our social circle is pretty big and Rick is part of it. For example, my boyfriend Dan is Rick's best friend. I see Rick every so often when they hang out. Recently at a party, Rick asked me if I wanted to work on his music with him (he does local shows). This was before I knew the extent of Rick's mean/selfish behavior towards my friend, and I said that sounded great and he should send me anything he wanted me to work on.

Since the party, Mary showed me texts that made her really upset, all about Rick guilting her and getting angry and insulting her for not writing him a recommendation letter to adopt another cat. She also told me that she has brought up multiple times that they can work out a payment plan, anything, $20 a month, just something to start working towards Mary getting back her own money, and he has just ignored it every time. She has pretty much broken contact with Rick, and she messaged my boyfriend Dan because she felt Rick was trying to indicate he was feeling suicidal because of this, so she wanted Rick's friends to know about it.

I'm so pissed that he has made her feel this way, so I am ready to break off contact with Rick. But he is messaging me about doing music together, and I can't tell him the real reason I don't want to work with him (since Mary told me she doesn't want him to know she has been confiding in me and Dan about the situation). I don't want to make things worse for Mary by telling off Rick for this behavior that she told me about, and I also don't want to get into an argument with him because he seems to be super manipulative, even over text, and I don't want to get sucked into a debate or nasty conversation with him.

Am I stuck trying to ghost him? I feel like I can't avoid him forever, since he's friends with Dan and he's in our social circle.",18Sep2018,1

319,"For the purpose of wanting this to be as private as possible (i.e. nobody I know finding out about this), I may have to keep some things vague, but if you’ve any questions, ask and i’ll answer them. 

I’m almost sixteen, and I’ve recently moved to a foreign country to live with a friend until December (3 months away roughly). I knew this friend beforehand, they were my best friend and of course I still trust them. 
I’m in a new class and I’m semi-familiar with a few of her friends, I’ve mainly gotten my own group though. 

Her joint birthday party with another friend is coming up in the next week or two and she’s told me there will be drinking, probably in the city. This is a city that’s unfamiliar to me, by the way. I haven’t drank anything more than a glass of wine or a single shot before, I don’t know how comfortable I am getting drunk in front of basically complete strangers. 

I was talking to one of her friends outside of class for a while today and he was saying how much she’s changed, and naturally as teens do we were talking about weed. I said I’m familiar to it but haven’t done it myself and he pretty much said that if my friend can change, anything can happen. 

Back home, people are already changing a lot too. I’ve been gone less than a month but there’s drama about a few of my friends hooking up with people. 

I guess were at that age where people are trying new things, but I have a hard time trusting anybody outside of my extremely close friends back home. I want to make more friends, but I don’t want to get drunk and make a fool of myself. And if I were to smoke for the first time, I’d rather not do it with some guy I’ve known for a month or two. 

How do I either a) stop freaking out on the lowkey and just trust that these people wouldn’t abandon me on some city street to get raped or something, or b) explain to them that I’m not comfortable with being out of my control in front of them. 

I know these people go to parties and drink a lot, god knows how many people there will be there, it seems a little inescapable.

The firm is currently pretty much set on auto-pilot; the other attorneys pretty much run the show and my boss is there to sign checks and give general advice. This was always his vision and now wants to use the firm, essentially, as passive income while he does what he really loves: teaching.

My boss is very smart and has been in the game long enough to really know his stuff. He's charismatic, well-liked and respected in the community, and really does have a knack for this stuff. His idea is to do online teaching and coaching through Webinars on financial planning, estate matters/insurance, and general life coaching.

My idea was to use a Webinar service such as Livestorm to offer short, free ""teaser"" webinars; basically, a Webinar long enough to give a decent amount of info on a given topic, but then pitch a paid service at the end. So you'd get some free info and then be given the opportunity to pay for more information. I've also thought about subscriptions services; paying monthly to get access to certain amount of content.

326,"I became a TA for my department this semester. Last week I was helping out one of the students with a problem and I was just sort of fixated on her. I thought she was really pretty and she legitimately makes me laugh. I felt the kind of draw to a person that you don't encounter very often but you instantly recognize (if that makes any sense). 

I tried to shake it off over the weekend but the next time I saw her we got to talking and found out we have some similar interests. Just yesterday she caught me looking at her while I was working on something and she somethnig to the effect of  ""I get it, I'm cute but don't lose focus"". I can only identify this as flirting but it was almost like my ears didn't want to believe what i just heard.

I have no intention of breaking the barrier of professionalism. And if it means anything, I have no direct influence over the grades of the students. In theory, I'd be okay with just waiting until after the semseter to ask her out. But lord knows that 3 months is more than enough time to get put in the friendzone.

328,"Okay, so my friend and I go to a trade school and live in off campus apartments. We both drive together and take turns driving to school each day. There’s also another person in my class as well who lives in the same apartment complex, I’ll refer to him as S for the story’s sake. Now, the way our school works is there’s a shuttle that takes students from housing to the school and back, but it usually arrives pretty early because different programs start at different times.

One day after class S asked me if I l also lived in the same apartments as he did, and I said yeah, and he asked if I could drive home. Of course I said sure, because I was also going to the same place so it wasn’t an inconvenience. I found out that he would take the shuttle to and back from school because he doesn’t have a car, so I offered to drive him since we both live in the same apartment complex.

Now the first day driving him things were okay. The only thing that kind of threw me off was once we got to the school, my friend and I were getting our tools and equipment from the car, but S just kind of walked along and didn’t really wait for us. I didn’t view that as a big deal and tried not to think too much into it. 

Now today as my friend and I were ready to leave, S wasn’t there. We called him, and texted him, but no answer so we just left because we didn’t want to be late for class. But once we got to school and settled in, I noticed that S finally called me back. I felt bad, so I talked to my instructor and he gave me permission to go back and get him. S did say he appreciated it and said that his excuse was he overslept.

We only have 30 minutes for lunch. Now that same day, on our lunch break, my friend and I like to drive back to the apartment to eat (it’s only 10 minutes away) because we don’t have much money to spend at fast food places. S asked us if we were going to get food, and we said “nah we’re just gonna go back to the apartment because we’re kind of broke” and he said “oh cool do you mind if I come with you, I’ll go back and eat at my room” and we said sure. But as we’re driving back, he goes “can you guys just drop me off at McDonald’s” (McDonald’s is like a 5 minute drive from our apartment.) I said sure, because truthfully I have a hard time saying no.

As we’re driving now to McDonald’s, he asks me and my friend if we’re rich. Kind of thrown off, I replied “no, I had to work for most of the things that I have.” He then asks if we ever let people borrow our cars. That kind of threw me off, I’ve only known S for like 3 days and he’s asking if I let people borrow my car. I don’t know if it’s just me overthinking, but those questions kind of raised some red flags in my head. We then dropped him off at McDonald’s, and as my friend and I got back to the apartment, we only had 2 minutes left until we had to start heading back, so we didn’t even get a chance to eat lunch. 

I then texted S saying that we’re on our way back to get him, but again he didn’t answer his phone and now we were running late, so we just left, and once we got back to class we saw S sitting there and he said he got a ride from someone else, without even notifying the person who drove him there.

Am I being taken advantage of? If so, how do I go about this? I’m not really used to sticking up for myself and I’d really like that to change.

332,"I'm finding myself at a loss. I have been pretty much unhappy for roughly the last six years. However, I feel like it has been getting worse. This year I have lost a good friend to complications with diabetes and a sibling due to health complications related to long term drug abuse. My sibling who just recently died was removed from the home as a pre-teen by child services as it was wanted by all parties (sibling, parent, and state). This parent, has serious mental issue which have been diagnosed and generally is a difficult person to associate with due to their manipulative and vindictive behavior. I consider this parent dead to me, and the feelings from what I have been told by them are mutual. My relationship with my other parent is good however, I don't feel like we are able to have meaningful conversations, I typically don't feel heard as there are typically distractions (tech, tv, etc) occupying this parents’ attention. Generally, speaking my childhood was rough, broken home, lots of weed, lots of alcohol. Abusive in all of its forms, and to be honest, a lot of my childhood is a blur. 

My relationship with my spouse is not very positive either. We typically feel more like roommates than a loving couple. I desperately want this to change. However, I have difficulty completely trusting my spouse. I want us to share intimate details, stories, thoughts, and feelings. However, I feel like there is too much judgement and criticism between us. I also, feel like I can’t share things with my spouse without them getting shared with friends and family or brought up indiscreetly as a conversation starter in a crowded place. We also find ourselves struggling with distractions (tech, tv, etc). We are aware of this issue and try to prevent it, however we haven't been good at this lately. We come up with good ideas how we will fix things, for instance sit down at the table for dinner instead of in-front of the tv, however we often fail to commit to this good idea.

I'm currently going back to school and up to this point have a decent GPA, however, this semester I am terrified I am going to fail. We are in big-big debt, we struggle to get anything adult done. For example, we haven’t done our 2017 taxes yet, as I am waiting on my spouse to provide me with documentation from a MLM business the spouse was sometimes doing. I was once supportive of this business, but anymore I find it draining. We don't have health insurance for another few weeks due to job changes. I can't focus on shit, I'm unhappy, I have zero motivation and little belief things will get better. I really want to go on a mushroom trip to work through these decades of trauma but realize 1) I shouldn't do it in this headspace, and 2) don’t want to do it without a guide.

I feel like I used to be good at self control, instead of binging on candy, I just didn't buy it. I can’t binge on it if it isn't in the house. Didn't hardly ever play any video games or watch tv, despite enjoying them. I gave up at some point. I almost feel like at some point I said ""fuck it, if you can't beat-em join-em"". Now I feel like all we do as a couple is eat like shit, watch tv, and bicker. I want to be happy, I want US to be happy. I want to be motivated. I want us to motivate each-other. I want to go on regular walks, runs, bike rides. I want to sweat it out together. I want to trust and to be trusted. I want to share my feelings without needing to defend them. I want to share how something makes me feel without feeling like I'm viewed as the bad-person for feeling hurt or mad. I want to cry, laugh, and enjoy life. I want to get out of this fucking rut.

I’m close friend is named Zach he’s 23 and the ex is one of my close friends as well also 23


he is having problems with his ex girlfriend or fiancé however you want to put it, they been together for 4 years, Zach went to her graduation, got engaged....and.... they broke up in April 2018  and his ex decided to go on a relationship with someone on March 2018 which is a kid who she met on PlayStation(the kid is 18 years old and she’s 23), I don’t know if this is considering her to be a cheater or she had this planned out or she had a backup plan....idk, she told Zach the worst words to say to him or any other man which is “I don’t love you anymore more”, but when they broke up Zach changed to be a better person, he’s been going to church, doing CrossFit, focusing on college, been going to therapy for what his ex did to him, and trying to catch up with old friends, and the person he was when he was with his ex is not the same, when he was with his ex he was a Destiny addict, guy stuck in a cave not going out at all and was immature, I want to say he’s doing the right thing not being the same and moving on, but while his ex is still the same, still has photos of him and her up on her Facebook and I don’t know if she’s trying to get Zach’s attention or trying to get us (my friends) to be part of this problem or getting her kiddy boyfriend to threaten us, but she was trying to get my attention by contacting me and telling me I’m important her her life including her best friend, which to be honest I really didn’t want to talk with her for what she did but still want to be friends with her and I’m trying to be a better man and grow up. 

but she did something stupid which is sending one of her phones to this kid who lives in Louisiana without clearing out her contacts (which I’ll get to that soon of how I know this), so this kid has my number and all my other friends numbers including Zach’s and the ex’s parents numbers, so one day I got a message from this kid saying “question why are you ignoring her?!!” And other messages the other days that are coming down from Louisiana (337 area code) that we’re racist jokes to me and I’m not the only one getting these messages my friends are too and including her family, I’ve messaged her telling to keep her boyfriend in check, she tells me she sent one of her phones down to him and forgot to clear out the contacts and tells me she made a mistake, so she messaged him...... and tells me it’s not him but the kid messaged me on Facebook messenger and tells me it’s Zach( I blocked the kid immediately).....I tell her why you would think it’s Zach because I want to hear it from her not this kid, she tells me it has to be Zach he’s doing this.....so no reason 😐......and the worst she told me is she fully trusts this kid with her life..... Zach told me not to trust her and tells me don’t fall into darkness and we got your back and quotes a verse in the Bible. 

So being mature and looking at Zach and he’s changed and his ex I looked at her and she hasn’t changed I told her “well someone is lying and I can tell you this it’s not Zach and I’ve seen enough” 

So the kid had the balls and messaged Zach telling him “if your doing this you better fucking stop this, and if my girlfriend is pissed off so am i”, Zach sent us that message to me and my other friend, we told Zach just to move on and don’t feed the beast he’s just trying to push your buttons or he ran out of ideas and is trying to blame it on him, so I messaged a another close friend of my that is best friends to the ex, I told her what was going on and she tells me she has to be with the ex because even though she made a bad mistakes I have to be there for her... 

Zach been telling everyone who’s been getting the random messages down at Louisiana to keep them as evidence, take a photo, block the numbers  and get rid of his ex out of our lives, a couple of my friends did.....but I don’t want to 😞 because I know what the kid is doing keeping her Isolated to where she’s only going to have him to go to. 

So my problem is we been all close friends since elementary through high school, been doing a lot of get togethers and have a lot of memories. 

But this has to happen at a bad time of the year. 

So I need some advice, what should I do make the ex feel who she is losing or trust the ex???

335,"There’s this singer whose music I really like (already dead) and he made lyrics that criticized the then-communist government. But he was also in the secret police, because 1) for his band to be allowed to give concerts in a non-communist foreign country he had to help them and 2) he wasn’t against the government itself, just some of the things they did. So I suggested one of his songs to play during my guitar class today because it’s a very nice songs with totally interesting and amazing lyrics. My guitar teacher was VERY offended because of the singer’s secret police past, since he himself had huge problems with the police prior to ‘89. I should’ve known better; I knew about the singer’s past and as well my teacher’s, but it just wasn’t as present to me, especially since his lyrics aren’t exactly pro-commie government. Maybe I can’t fully understand why it was so hurtful for my teacher; I was born years after the end of communist Europe. But how sorry do I need to feel? I accept how my teacher feels, but does that really mean I have to refrain from singing the singer’s music? Do I need to be more careful? Am I allowed to continue playing the song in class? It’s not my duty to take care of everyone’s feelings, or is it?",18Sep2018,2
336,"I have had a (good?) Friend for around 9 years now, we've had quite a few fights and periods of not talking but always make up. The last few cycles of fight don't talk then really again, his presence has just made me extremely uncomfortable. There have been times when we're around other people when he just brings up things from my past that I've told him time and time again that I just want to stay in the past but he keeps bringing these things up.

338,"Forgive my terrible writing I’m more a programmer than a writer. 

So a few years ago I met this girl through an ex in college I’ll call her Jane. Well fast forward a year or two and me and Jane both split up with our respective partners over summer break and being best friends we decided to move in together. 

We get into the apartment and everything’s fine expect our third roommate is just a grouch and he brings the mood down. Long story short it drives me and her together I start to sneak into her room at. Night to hangout with her and she starts to develop feelings. It’s not long before we are both tipsy in her bed one things leads to another and we are making out. At this point I realize that hey I have feelings for her too and have never noticed that she’s actually really attractive and we get along amazingly. The relationship from then on consists of us sneaking around out third roommate because he actually had a thing for her and we just didn’t wanna hurt his feelings. I know in retrospect we should have told him. 

Anyways everything is perfect in the relationship there’s not fighting, arguing, or anything negative. It’s not even forced it just works that way. After two weeks she told me she loved me and after a month she said she would marry me in the future. Eventually I realize I’m madly in love with this girl and that she’s everything I could want and ask for. For a year was fine until one day we are cuddling on the couch and she tells me that she’s sorry but she is going to break my heart and then breaks up with me out of the blue. She said it was because she was changing schools at the end of the year (it was February) and she was moving to another state. We talked it over a few days later and decided maybe a break would be best rather than a complete split and that it shouldn’t be any longer than three months which is when she found out if she was accepted or not. 

I found out later a week after we split she tried to hook up with a friend of hers from class but nothing ever happened. I seen her on bumble and on her a few times because I still lived with her after the break up. Which kind perplexed me but I assumed she was trying to do the whole college hookup thing.

Anyways the break ended up lasting a whole damn year which by that point I had decided screw this and started putting myself out there again. She found out and came to me one night to tell me she still had feelings and was considering getting back together with me. I told her not to rush but that she didn’t have a lot of time because I was sick of waiting. Like the big gullible idiot I am we got back together. 

In six months there was no kissing, barely any hugging, no cuddling and she claims she was trying as hard as she could. We also never slept together but there was some minimal intimacy. She blamed her grandmas death a year prior to her being unable to love. Im not sure why I stayed with her and at this point I’m still not sure why I still love her. Well at the end of summer I went on vacation for a week and a half and two days after returning she texts me “we need to talk” and I just told her I know what you’re gonna say. She told me she realized when I was gone that she doesn’t love me anymore like that. She said hat she did love me up until that time I was gone. That same day she left out apartment and drove to spend the night at another guys place. 

She’s been screwing they guy since that night and maybe before. She’s even brought him over when I was home. I can’t get the image of him and her out of mind and it makes my stomach flip when I think about it. I already told her how I felt about the break how I was mad that she wasted my time for 6 months and that she was kind of a shitty person. 

I wrote a letter to her yesterday and I basically just said that we can’t be friends. She wants to be best friends still but I can’t even look at her. She broke my heart twice and thinks I can just be okay with it. The depressions been pretty bad but I think it’s just living with her. After she read the letter she hugged me and said “thank you for everything and being my best friend” and then walked away. 

I don’t know if I did what was right. I don’t know if what I feel is justified. I just know it’s painful and that I did everything for this girl. I taught her how to drive, made her countless dinner, sat with her for hours when her depression kicked in, and just did everything I could to keep a smile on her face. I loved her with everything I had. I guess I need some feedback if I did or am doing the right thing.

TLDR; Started dating my best friend and fell in love with her. Things got ugly and we broke up she had a new man the same day.

339,"So I recently moved to the country side and my friend/ex music teacher who’s about 60 and who’s so kind and such a great teacher, puts on concerts out of his own money so young musicians can play live music, just a really great man. Anyway he gets work at a uni near where I now live so he comes down to stay in the bnb in my little village. When he comes down, any days I don’t have plans is just a day where he sort of expects me to meet with him for the day, so I’m meeting with him like 5 days in a row every 2-3 weeks.

He’s such a lovely man but he has a big personality, he’s not opinionated he just talks over people so much like it’s ridiculous how much he does it, and he must not realise that he does. But my mum tries to avoid him whenever he visits cause she just can’t stand how much he interrupts. Since he’s started coming down our conversations have just been more like him talking at for about 20 minutes with me barely saying anything. It’s got to the point now where I just feel like I need to say something, by the end of his visits I feel like I’m going snap and say something I’ll regret.

341,"Ok, this might be tough for me to describe, but bare with me. Also don't know if this is the proper place to post this, but eh, oh well.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here first instead of a doctor because I rarely think of it, unless it's happening. Like right now. But on very rare occasions I get this really odd feeling, and then, almost suddenly, everything just seems different. Like my body and all of my surroundings are simultaneously incredibly tall and yet super small at the same time. Like my center of perception is no longer in the middle of my head, or where my eyes are. It's very hard to describe, and the closest thing I have found online is called Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Though it doesn't match perfectly. It's actually very weird, and makes me wonder if it's a type of epileptic episode or something. Also my vision seems to want to un-focus, or go blurry but if I concentrate I can keep it clear. It's super odd, and I remember this happening as far back as my young childhood. But only every couple of months or so. Just curious if anyone else has experienced this or knows what it is, since I can't articulate it enough in google to get any solid answers other than brain cancer or epileptic seizures lol",18Sep2018,0
342,"Quick note before I start. I'm not trying to be pretentious. I'm just quite annoyed at a situation that has been going on for almost a decade now.

So I came home today, I had just visited my grandparents, who live \~20 km away. I usually cycle there, to get some exercise. I'm an okay cyclist, and my bike is set up for speed. It's not a racing bike, just a lightweight citybike that I did some work on the cut out excess weight and to make it more resistant to high forces. So today, on the way back, I crashed pretty badly, on a busy crossroad. I was just pulling up, so I was probably not going very fast, but I was going fast enough for it to send my flying. I used to do track cycling, so I know how to fall, and I only grazed some skin. 

Quick history of my crashes: I haven't had a crash in 8 years. The last time I crashed on the road, I was 12, and someone literally drove into me. I normally NEVER crash, but I just woke up, and I'm having a bad couple of days, so my attention was wavering.

So, me coming home, I tell my mom I crashed, because communication is very important to me. Without a single heartbeat of worry or asking if I'm okay (which never actually came). she starts going of about how I cycle too fast and how I need to be more careful and how Everything is my fault. So, I explain with objective arguments that I wasn't going ""fast"" (about 25 km/hr at that point), and that If I go faster, on straight roads, it's because that's the most efficient cadens for my muscles, so I can go longer distances. She then fires back with more incoherent subjective bambling, proven by absolutely nothing but her perception. At that point, I start losing my cool, and I raise my voice, restating the things I literally said three seconds ago. Same reaction. And I literally walk her through the exact science of why I cycle at that speed (I have a strong scientific background). And then she fires back with what she always uses. 

Her **experience**. She has never crashed before. Okay. Fair point, I guess. Until you realise she can't actually cycle that well. I can run faster than the fastest I've ever seen her cycle, and I have really bad ankles. So of course, if she feels herself falling, she has the time to carefully brake, and put her foot on the ground, and have nothing happen. Which I've seen her do countless times.

Okay, I realise I shouldn't have gotten annoyed, that's the reason I'm writing this post. But like I already said, stuff like this has happened for years, on a weekly basis. I tell her something, she flips out without using a single drop of reason, I try to use objective arguments, and she gets me mad. 

I read a lot of scientific studies. multiple a day. I read books. Lots of them. Science books, psychology books, History books. There's two things that are important to me. Knowledge, and communication. Because of that, I'm vastly more well spoken than her (English is not my native tongue, forgive me), and I have a much broader understanding of science than her. The last time she read a study, was probably never. 

Every single time I bring up something that I read (nutrition, psychology, physics), that shows that there's better ways to do something than or that proves her wrong, she flips out. I then refer to the exact studies I read. And she does something that's probably on the same level as showing me her 50 year old elementary school math book. She can't accept that science has progressed beyond what she learned in school, and that She's wrong all the goddamn time. 

So then I try to avoid her, so I don't lose my temper, and she starts yelling that she never sees me and that I'm a horrible son. I also can't just let her be wrong and stupid all the time, because I care about her enough that I want to help her. Moving to my dad is also impossible, he's very old, needs to get surgery often, and is financially incapable of taking care of both me and my sister (who strongly agrees with me).

Before anyone says ""we found the teenager"" or something similar: I have friends three times my age (anyone doing the math knows I'm 20), and everyone I talk to that knows her too agrees with me. They even bring it up themselves. I went camping with my mom and some friends (age 14-54), they said, and I quote ""I thought you were agressive in your speech, but I now understand exactly why, and I would probably be worse.""

I'm flirting with her on tinder hard and we eventually more over to Snapchat, we're we trade some pics. (clean no nudity). And we eventually decide that we should meet up at my place and watch a movie etc.  Night keeps going on and on, and we end up making out on basically what is a giant bean bag essentially.  Things get a bit more intense and I start to finger her (she's never been fingered, given a blowjob, or had sex, and for the matter never been in a relationship) and in return she gives me her first blowjob.  Thinks heat up, and we get in the shower naked together.  After we are out of the shower I eat her out, a first for both of us.  It's about 1 am now, and it's storming pretty badly out and we both agree its not safe for her to be driving in this weather. So I sarcastically offer we should sleep in my bed together.  She out of the blue agrees.  Night goes on we don't really sleep that much just kiss, finger and blowjobs.

348,"Last week, I received 9 voicemail messages, within the space of an hour, from my ex-roommate. I gave him my number, but he never gave me his, so for the first couple of messages, before I texted him to confirm his identity, I didn't know who it was who was calling. I didn't pick up the phone, but listened to the voicemails as they came in.

&amp;#x200B;

The messages were abusive and irate. He told me that, because of complaints I had made to the landlord, two of my housemates (from the house I left a few weeks ago) were being evicted. I was confused.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that I had maybe said something to the landlord and that I had forgotten that I had done so. I rang the landlord. She said that I hadn't made any complaints, and that no one was being evicted. All she said was that I briefly mentioned that I had done more than my fair share of housework.

&amp;#x200B;

The messages were absolutely terrifying. He was clearly very unhinged. He called me ""evil"" and a ""worthless piece of shit"". He said he wants all of the housemates to ""know"" and ""remember"" ""what kind of person I \[me, not him\] really am"", and that I was a ""coward for not picking up the phone"". He said that I said that I had ""been forced out, bullied out of the house"". This is not true.

&amp;#x200B;

I have blocked his number.

&amp;#x200B;

I am definitely afraid of him. Just before I left, he apologised profusely for how little housework he had done. He was obsessively singing my praises, saying how the house would be awful without me there. He went on and on about how sad he was that I was leaving, and I asked if there was anything he could do to make me stay. These abusive voicemails are the first contact we've had since I left.

&amp;#x200B;

The landlord talked to the housemates to clear up any confusion, but she told me she has no idea why he believed people were being evicted.

&amp;#x200B;

I took my phone to the police station and played half the messages. They didn't seem to want to bother listening to all of them - they said ""are most of them like this?"". I didn't know precisely what they meant by that, but I said yes. Voicemail playback is in reverse chronological order, and the later messages were slightly more mild, but still pretty bad. The police said that he was ""actually quite civil"" and that they couldn't do anything about it because he hasn't threatened me. Were they right?",18Sep2018,1

He then pulled down my yoga pants halfway and started fingering me. I gave him a handjob and then he went down on me. Everything was perfectly lining up and he asked to have sex. I asked him to put on a condom but he didn’t have one, so I told him that I didn’t want to get pregnant.
He went back to just doing other things. Things kept building up and getting hot and heavy. I grinded on top of him and then he flipped me onto my back. He pulled down my pants halfway again and started fingering me again. He asked/went to try and start having sex and I told him no again and that I wasn’t on birth control. He tried to tell me that he’d pull out but I told him I didn’t want to risk it.
Now we went to spooning and making out. He pulled my pants back down halfway again and started grinding his dick up against my ass. I leaned back and kissed him, but then he angled his dick into me and thrusted a little bit. I immediately moved my body away from him and yelled at him saying no. I asked him what he thought made me change my mind from the other two times.
He rolled over and finished himself off, and then we went back to making out. Eventually we both fell asleep until he woke me up at 4:30 am and drove me home because he didn’t want his roommates to see me there.

Like, i've had a point where my mother was put under induced coma and intubation for few weeks, and I just stopped doing school all together, I failed my classes but didn't tell anyone, as it was a finals period, I just turned 21 at the time..

My parents have a terrible relationship, and I am the most reliable person there is, I also have some background in medicine as I changed majors, I stayed in that hospital almost everyday with minimum sleep, standing behind the glass keeping an eye on her vitals, 95% of the time alone.. I was the only person there for long hours aside from the nurses, because there were no chairs, as visitors are expected to leave....And I missed my finals.. I regarded them as unimportant at that point, because I know how drs/nurses can be incompetent, I mean like the Dr said she has ""Diabetes"" and she didn't, a mistake I know they'd fall for along others, and I know her history/allergies and everything..so to prevent that, I was a sophomore

On the other hand last semester a classmate had her mother in a terrible car crash, she had multiple broken ribs and others, yet, she still attended every class.. and finished the semester.. she was a junior 

At the back of my mind I know, that she must've had family members to rely on, her father or siblings, but I can't help but think i'm weak and fell behind.. in comparison, I just dropped everything.. my mother got better and left the hospital

By senior year I feel my peers who are younger and been in school for shorter time, are growing faster all around, my class is like a big bubble of friendly students who know each other, they know me and are very friendly, but I try to keep it formal and distance myself always, as it is less of a weight.. and more freedom.

I on the other hand, have gone stall, cognitively I feel I just gained examination skills, that's all... and I'm taking longer to complete simple tasks, my ability to understand got slower.. it's like my brain has gone on autopilot sometimes... and has so much bugs/errors that need to be sorted lol...

like writing this took me two hours right now, to be able to deliver what I want to say, in a short manner that you can tolerate reading..

I tried be friending multiple ppl online, and tried going through a studying/self growing kinda thing with them, because I felt I may need a shoulder, but it didn't work... instead I wasted a lot of my time tending to their needs.. and I still didn't open up, I was the one helping and being depended on in all relationships, I went through shyt and I never told them.. because I genuinely know they can't help nor have the exp... the majority started getting interested romantically even, which i never expected.. and dodged..

I think I may be tired of just being that role, the giver... I can trust others, but only if they prove reliable otherwise it's a waste of time.. Man, I feel like I'm wasting my youth with my attitude, but I don't know what to do with myself..

I'm aware i'm just being too negative, or too self critical, which is sth else that grew for some reason, although no one told me i'm shyt, i still see my faults... Feels like a waste of oxygen sometimes lol

The obvious answer is, the choices i'm making are causing me to be behind, and I should look at the things i'm behind on and work on them..but yea, i don't know...

We ended things earlier in February, but the breakup was awful, not because I was losing him but because I had to move back to my parents and I was so accustomed to being with him for so long, even though we were not good for each other. So throughout Feb and March I went through a deep depression. I hit up old friends I haven’t hung out with in years (who still lived in my hometown) and one of them was my current boyfriend. Mind you, he literally broke my heart 3 years ago it was also awful. So I didn’t see a future when we started hanging out. During the time, my ex and I hooked up (worst mistake of my life after the way he treated me idk what I was thinking). I have not hooked up with my now boyfriend during. Anyway, i dropped my ex and blocked him from everything bc by then I was out of love (I never really loved him anyway) and fell for my boyfriend. My current bf and I made it official in April and have been together since. Just last week I told him about my ex because it was eating me alive for months but he took bad. I gave him the option to break up or stay. Of course he stayed but now I’m scared that a year from now he’s going to regret accepting my apology or worse cheat. I never cheated on him but i did fuck up. Idk what to tell him or what to do?",18Sep2018,2
367,"**Tl;dr at bottom**

Using a throwaway just to keep anonymity more. But the main root of this comes from having to live on my own. The situation is sort of odd but here it is, my step dad and mom moved to virginia due to what I assume is it being cheaper down there. My step dad comes back to the house (bottom floor apartment) we lived in before they left to work every other week and pays a third of the rent. Me and my friend live there full time and pay for the bills and everything. Here is where the issues start. I've had huge issues with getting up in the morning for work often leading me to be incredibly late (current job doesn't care when I show up) so I make little to no money every week. I've been job hunting and looking for second shift jobs to no avail and my only real options are working days. I am not really sure what to do to help ghe situation as I've tried every sleep aid there is, trying a bunch of things suggested on this sub to sleep and nothing works.

Heres the kicker, on weekends, I wake up no problem or if I want to go somewhere earlier in the day. Every time I know I have work the next day I just can't physically wake up. I've been at my job for about 5 years now and despise every second of it and even when I showed up on time every day and almost never missed a day of work I still have not received a raise so I'm stuck at $10 an hour. I have an interview wednesday for a job with hopefully higher pay to help me.

The major problem is that last month I needed $150 from my mom/step dad to pay my part of the rent but this month I'm not sure if I can even get part of it as I am already waiting an extra week to pay my phone bill when I get paid. Nothing has improved and I don't know what else to do. I'm lost and just need something.

Tl;dr: Can't wake up ever unless I don't have work, have no money to pay for anything, parents might have to help pay for my side of the rent this month and I just don't know what else to do. I just want some sort of normality in my life and stability. Anything will help...I feel like I'm just consistently a liability to my mom and step dad and it kills me. ",18Sep2018,2

The halt in communication could be a few things:

 the tumor is back, and this time fatal, so she stopped teaching and went out to live her life

she was fired (very unlikely, she was one of the most prominent teachers in the district)

nothing is wrong, she just switched schools and didnt tell me about the email change

 For further context, I have bipolar type 2 which just means the cycles are shorter and I have more prominent depression than mania. 

What I need help with is deciding if this problem warrants asking my psychiatrist for a medication change, or if there's a different way I can get some help. I know that not every mental health issue can be helped with pills, I get that. But I'm also desperate.

377,"Hello everyone,

Background: I'm a University student based in Texas majoring in nursing but planning to go to flight school afterwards.

So here is my issue, I have been considering moving to Canada for school and to immigrate afterwards to basically start my life there. However, my parents own a business here in Texas that they were considering to sell, which is one of the reasons I was wanting to move, since i'd have nothing holding me back. But, they recently offered me an option to ""help"" with the business while I go to school here, then possibly run it afterwards. Financially, this is the better option, however I truly despise Texas and the atmosphere here. I just don't enjoy life here. 

Something else I should mention, my father is planning to move back to Asia while my mother and I stick together. So it'd just be my mother and I staying here.

If my parents were to sell the business, this would mean my father would still move, but my mother ""may"" come with me with Canada if she's eligible for immigration, which would be tough. They are also considering opening a business there, this would make immigration for my mom easier too.

I'm very weary about moving since i'll basically be financially independent since my parents don't ""help"". School costs would range from 15-20k a year, not including cost of living, car/rent, etc. Of course i'll be taking out loans, but i worry i might make the wrong choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this is confusing or whatever, i'm just really lost and stressed as to what I want to do. Parent's aren't much help and our family life isn't great.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

Basically, my options are to stay here where i'm not happy and make more money &amp; finish school, or move with/without family and finish school there and eventually immigrate.

380,"Hello all, looking for a bit of advice because after thinking about this for a week I still don't know what to do.

I've been dating my current boyfriend for the past year and a half. He is amazing, such a kind and loving person and never did a thing to upset or hurt me.

Since I've been with him he's lost a lot of weight and really shaped up and has started getting a bit of female attention which he hasn't had previously. He also started a new job.

He does get anxious and doesn't handle change well so I don't know if that plays into everything that's gone on...

Basically two months ago after too much to drink out of nowhere he said he'd been rethinking the relationship and didn't know if he wanted to be together. We had a very long and very tearful discussion and he said he didn't mean it and was really sorry and would work to get my trust back.

Since then he was perfect again. We were looking at potentially getting a place together next year and everything was fine.

Then last week I noticed he was messaging a lot on his phone and being very shifty which he never is. So I asked who he was messaging and he said his friend. But he continued to be very shifty so after a while longer I asked again and said don't lie. He then admitted it was a girl from work and lied because he worries I'd think something was going on and it isn't. I said don't ever lie again and he apologised and things were fine. Then the next day he turned up and said the girl had said she has feelings for him, he messaged her while I was there saying these weren't mutual and he wouldn't be hanging round with her again. Then deleted her. 

Again everything was fine until a few days later when he suddenly said again that he wanted to break up. He saw no future in us. Seconds, and I mean seconds later he started hysterically crying and shaking and saying he didn't mean it. And please take him back. I said I want you to tell me everything I need to know then I'll make a decision. So he admitted he kind of liked the girl at work too, and had been feeling very guilty about it. Because it was just a crush and nothing in comparison to his feelings to me. But he was worried if I found out I would leave him. He said nothing has happened physically and even the messages sent were platonic and not flirty or anything.

I said we'd work on it. But the more I think on it the more hurt I feel. It's just so out of character for him. I feel like I don't know him anymore.

My question is this, do I trust him based on the past year and a half of how he has been. And accept that maybe a bit of attention has had him carried away but he is dedicated to us, as shown by him immediately rejecting the girl. Or do I move on, as he's said twice now about doubts. Even though he immediately took it back.

It's probably worth nothing I am his longest relationship and the only one he had prior ended by him being cheated on.

Please advise! I'm so confused.

384,"I recently applied for (and accepted!) a job that I'm very excited about. However, I started applying to jobs with \~6 months (or at least, less than a year) left to go on my PhD, and it was a huge surprise to get an offer as quickly as I did. (Literally the least worst problem anyone has ever had, I know.) So in submitting my background check, it asked for my education, and I filled in the degrees I've gotten (including bachelors and masters), and when I put in PhD, I intended to put that I will receive the degree in the spring of next year. However, I instead put down Spring 2018, rather than Spring 2019.    

In the interview process, I had explained the whole situation to the hiring manager, and that I would write in the evenings and on weekends, and defend my dissertation in the spring. He was completely fine and comfortable with that. The job also doesn't even require a PhD - most people in this position at the company have a master's, but not a PhD.    

Because writing the wrong year on my degree completion date changes the situation from a degree that I will receive to a degree that I claim to have already received, the background check came back claiming that was a lie/misrepresentation. I got into contact with the recruiter in the HR department I had worked with during the interview process to explain my situation, and he pulled up my resume from my application and noted that I list the PhD as ""In Progress"" there (not completed in Spring 2018). He has additionally spoken with the hiring manager and also the hiring manager's boss, and they understand the situation and are fine with it. However, it does apparently need to get escalated through some HR process that may take up to a couple of weeks to resolve.    

I am unsure what to do here, and whether there is anything that I even can or should do here. I am mostly focusing on trying to not be a worrier, since that's not helpful. I've contacted the HR guy a couple of times, but I don't want to harass him. He added me on LinkedIn yesterday, which also reflects that the PhD is an in-progress situation.

So I \[17M\] started university about 2 weeks ago , it's a bit far from where i live about 20min drive so i can't afford going home and back on my lunch break , decided i'd spend that time at my aunt's \[31F\] house since it's very close to campus . 1st week was all good i'd just come in have lunch spend what time i have left browsing the internet or having a chat with her since i consider her a rather closer family member and i'm comfortable talking to her about things i can't say to my parents . also worth mentioning she lost her husband a couple of years ago and her son is about my age and he's not at home most of the day . so 2 days ago we're just talking about university life and she brings the subject of having a girlfriend as we're talking i'm having this weird eye contact with her i'd usualy just stare away but i kept looking her in the eye , and since i'm trying to keep this as least NSFW as possible it just developed into having oral sex . soon after finishing i realize what i have done and after washing up i went straight to uni still shocked . i didn't have classes today but i do tomorrow . what i would mention i that it was fully with my consent i never showed signs of rejecting or anything so how should i deal with this ? i have no idea whether i should confront her or just act like nothing happened . sorry for the  wall of text but i'd love to get some advice on this

398,"I'm a highschool teacher, kind of. Today I broke up a fight between this frequent bully and his most recent victim. He had his arm around the boy's neck and was punching him. After I pulled them apart, the bully claims his $145 Hugo Boss sweater was damaged because I tugged at it, and wants me to pay. There's no apparent damage done whatsoever.

How do I handle this person? I'm sure he's plotting to break something of mine as soon as he gets an opportunity.

He's two grades above the boy he attacked, and a constant problem for both teachers and other students. He's got absolutely no redeeming qualities at all, except for the fact that he obviously has a lot of issues in life that makes him act this way, but he's about as unreachable as someone can get. Reason does not mean anything to him. Words just doesn't get through. It's like talking to a severely autistic person, except he's just ignorant and full of threatening ""gangstah"" attitude.

I'm sure he values his sweater very much, because expensive clothing is a status symbol for him and it's probably one of the most expensive things he owns. I mean, he's obviously got little else to be proud of. I understand why it matters to him, but at the same time, he's got only himself to blame and the only reason why this is even an issue is because he's an unreasonable and offensive idiot. I don't owe him anything. Not even respect. But I still need to be an adult and keep this from escalating.

I really don't know what to do except to just try and ignore him, and hope he just forgets about the whole thing.

Though the devil on my shoulder is curious about what would happen if I showed up one day wearing an exact copy of his sweater, and later took it off and just cut it to pieces with a pair of scissors right in front of him, just as a display of power. I usually dress rather simple, so he think's I'm a poor loser who can't afford nice clothes. It's probably one of the reasons he doesn't show me any respect. I'm not sure what it would accomplish, but I'd love to see his reaction!",18Sep2018,8

No one in the room said anything to her, including myself.

But is it even worth it? It’s kinda like jacking off. What’s the difference between jacking off and hooking up when there’s no emotion involved.

415,"Hello!

So this may come across a bit silly, I apologise if so. It's my first car and it's an odd situation to be in. I expect I know what the advice will be, but I welcome all input. First off, some backstory.

I bought my first car last october. It's a little red Hyundai i10 1.2. About 5 months in I was told by a mechanic that the car should never have been sold as it has a serious issue with its engine. A repair by the dealership was attempted, but it only made the issue worse and since June the car has had a permanent engine warning light on the dash.

I have plenty of evidence that the car was faulty when it was bought, along with the testimony of two mechanics and the AA who did a check when it was put up for sale.

I'm now waiting for a court date, which could be over three months away. The dealership originally agreed to mediation on August 29th, but on the day they didn't show up. As my MOT was a few days ago, I suspect they were stalling for time.

The car as expected failed its MOT, and I don't know what to do. I've spoken to two garages about fixing the issue as I need a car for work and other mundane reasons, and both have said that considering the cost and time it would take to fix it, they wouldn't touch it.

Do I wait for the court date and keep the large paperweight on my drive for the next few months, or is there an alternative? I have toyed with buying another car, but museum assistants get paid peanuts and I'm still paying for this one.

Thoughts welcome!

My boss keeps blowing me off. I use facts, statistics and methods that are well recognised within my field, and she flat out ignores my suggestions and recommendations, even though I can guarantee fast results. 

She never lets me do anything even remotely close to multimedia design, and only has me posting (photos of her choice) on Instagram and making price lists. She tampers with the work I do, and often lowers the content quality in doing so. If she dislikes even the smallest details, she deletes the work I’ve done. 

I have asked her multiple times to get on projects and to complete tasks that actually suits the skills I have worked hard to improve during my education. She denies me any chance of showing her that I am perfectly capable of delivering great solutions and content.

428,"
For about three years, I lived in San Francisco. During that time, I was living with my partner and working as a software engineer.

My entire family lives in the greater New York City area. From the start, I felt very homesick for the east coast while I was in SF. It was my first full-time job and the tedium of development work started to get to me. We didn’t have a car, so I would often go months without ever leaving the city at all. Over time, I grew tired and resentful of every part of SF life.

Because I had never looked at it as a long-term location (mostly due to housing costs), I was impatient to move on to the next phase of my life. My partner, on the other hand, did not want to talk about our future at all.

A little over a year ago, I ripped the band aid and got a new job in NYC. Frustrated by their indecision, I hoped that my partner would either agree to make a compromise with me to stay (ex. give it another year and we’ll make a plan to leave SF together) or find a job on the east coast to join me. 

As you might guess, that never happened. Our breakup dragged out for months, but it’s clear now that they’re never coming out here to join me. We do still talk a few times a week.

To make a long story short, my new job in NYC was nothing like I expected. Struggling to readjust to the east coast and suddenly living without my partner, I made the decision to go back to my old job, working remotely from home.

Now that I am coming up on a year in the remote position, I am considering looking for a new job again. Although it has a lot of advantages, being isolated at home every day has been hard on me, and my advancement opportunities feel really limited.

At the same time, my lease is coming up on my apartment. Being able to have access to a car again was very important to me when I returned to the east coast. As a result, I chose to live right outside of NYC where it’s possible to have a car.

I am not a huge fan of city life, but I also thought I should be in a place where lots of younger people live so I would have a better shot at dating and making friends.

Even though it is my home, the NYC area has not felt like the right place for me since I came back. There was a huge culture shock coming back from working on the west coast. My apartment is absurdly expensive for what I am getting, and I can’t save much by relocating unless I give up the social opportunities I had been hoping for.

Because I work in tech, my next job out here would have to be based in NYC. If I decided to move out into the suburbs, my commute would be murder. The dating pool right outside of NYC is also not really my type: fratty finance guys.

Lately, I have put serious consideration into going back to SF. I have been back a handful of times since I moved, and it always feels like some kind of home for me. I still don’t feel like it’s a definite long-term solution, but I could give it a few more years. Dating again is still very scary, but I suspect that my prospects would be a little better for me out there than they currently are.

From a career perspective, moving back to SF would be much better for me. At least for a short time, I could most likely stay in my current job by going un-remote and working in the office again. Longer term, there are countless opportunities that would pay me more generously than those on the east coast.

Getting an apartment with a parking spot would be a must so that I could do SF “better” this time. I’ve done the financials, and I would be paying just about the same as I am right now if I went back to SF.

The caveat is that I would be without my family again. I feel like I am choosing to either be close to them in a place where I am really struggling to build a life for myself, or leaving them again (maybe just for a few years) to go back to a place where I have a better shot of establishing myself.

437,"Hi,

I might sound like a weirdo but I need to stop being an introvert. I want to be finally honest open and overcome my fear. For over 9 years I've been developing anxiety and low self-esteem. When my sister ( 5 years older than me ) was 13 she was very rebellious. Due to her age and character, she was arguing with our parents each day. Each afternoon I've heard them yelling at each other. I was sitting alone closed in my room to avoid their anger. It continued until she left to study. I never tried to talk with them about this cos I don't want to offend anyone even if it means that I have to suffer. Cos of it they think they are good parents and think everything is ok. Then my father left us due to his lover. Again I never complained about this. Since he has a high income and my mother doesn't she is still dependant on him cos they never divorced. She is always saying that I should keep good relations with him but I hate them both. Another thing is when I was in kindergarten I invited a girl to my bday. She was the only girl and felt alone surrounded by boys, started crying I left back home. Since then I never tried to make the first step in any kind of relationship/friendship. I always liked to be in the school theatre and play some roles, there was a cute girl and once I tried to talk to her but when I reached her I just stopped in front of her staring at her and couldn't say a word. I run away embarrassed and never came to any rehearsal again. Now I'm in the 3rd year of technical college my parents choose and I'm not doing very well. I won't pass this year and want to change the school. I don't feel secure of myself and I'm not sure if I have any self-esteem left. What should I do? Will I make it in a new environment with ppl 2 years younger than me? Should I get a psychotherapy appointment? Don't know completely what should I do.

First of all im not a native english speaker so there might be a lot of mistakes.You can correct me if you want to otherwise ignore 

To get to my story first i need to tell you about my country.I am from a poor devoloping 3rd world country in Asia. A lot of things you (people in first world country) joke about things like misogny,child labor,child marriage,rape, child abuse,religious extremism are still happening at large in my country not in an alarming way though. And the politics here gets as dirty as it can be. Corruption is in the root of every working system we have. Dont get me wrong I love my country, its a very good Place  to live in but I just cant stand people around me suffering like that and the sad part is that there is nothing i can do other than hoping that someday things will change 

Okay back to my story 
My mom and dad were struggling with money when they had me, so they had to do full time jobs and couldnt take proper care of me.Often times they would leave me to the neighbours and work hard at their jobs.My dad had a problem with temper and he used beat my mom a lot when i was a child and she would take it out on me. I wasnt even allowed to cry after beatings if I did she would hit me more. Also my parents were very controlling back then.I wasnt allowed to say anything stupid otherwise they would mock me. So natually I grew up as shy introverted person. Things started improve from there, my father started a profitable bussiness and anger of my father was less frequent and then i had a sister. I was sent to an all boys school where I had few friends. But when i was in grade 4 my bestfriend died suddenly of a disease. 
I became very lonely after that. After a year of that incident I moved to another school where i was still the lonely nerdy kid who would sit in the last bench watching other kids having fun. But somehow after a year or so i managed to make some friends and they are still my bestfriends till this day.
Then I went to High school where the class sessions were divided by genders. I made some cool male friends there. We used to hang out daily and play football. 

All good upto this point except for one major problem i never had any interection with any feamle other than my mom and sister.I would observe girls of different session from a distant.
By this time internet and facebook became hugely populer so i opened ",18Sep2018,1

I know about the whole teen puberty feelings and all that but I'm fairly certain my situation goes past what's normal. It's not just the awkwardness that most people describe, I get genuinely depressed sometimes because of it. I don't talk to girls in ""that"" manner and I am surprisingly not very confident or happy with myself. It's worse when I see couples too. It's an urge to get a girlfriend even though I am well aware that it's not the best idea, and my therapist agrees. I have talked to other people about this (including my therapist) and there doesn't seem to be too much I can do. I feel like I'm working through it so far since I'm forced to confront it daily but I thought I'd check out what others have to say since that seems to help.

My 40, nearing 50 year old uncle live with my family which consist of me, my 2 sisters, my brother, and grandfather. He stays here for free, pays no rent, and is always fighting with my 12 year old sister. While most of the time, it's my bratty sister who starts it, but he takes it higher, and has gotten physical with her every now and then, but has never gone farther than pushing her. But my breaking point was when he took some can of random shit and sprayed it in her eyes. I was gonna beat the shit out of him but talked my self out of it and let my grandpa handle, since he knows better than me. After that I no longer talked to him. But about 10 minutes ago, my sister broke into my grandpa's out side fridge (She somehow broke the lock my uncle had on it since he stores his stuff in it), and he went fucking nuts and started screaming and yelling at her. That, I can understand, as I'd do the same if she broke into my stuff and took my food. But when she went to open it again, he practically hit her in the face. At the point, I really was gonna beat his ass, but my sister grabbed a fucking shovel and tried hitting him with it, so I had to grab her. He picked up this oil spray and was gonna spray it at her, but I pulled her back. I would have gotten him, but if I let go she would have went nuts.

&amp;#x200B;

After this my uncle called the cops. I talked to them with a minute and described what went down, and they took his fucking side. Since there were no marks on her, and he didn't use an open fist (It was as if he went to shove her with one of his hands, but did it to her face. But I know he did it to hurt her). I didn't get the chance to tell them of previous shit because the cops wouldn't give me the chance and my uncle would speak up when he noticed I tried talking.

I was starting to write the previous paragraph when the cops were and only got the first sentence out before they arrived. At first my plan was to tell them what happened and get him arrested, but they're gone now and I didn't get the chance to tell them anything.

I am a virgin by choice. If anyone is wondering, this is a throwaway so it shouldn’t be an issue, but I’m into feederism/weight gain in men. I have a fat fetish, basically. I’ve had this fetish since I was very small. I don’t exactly know the origin of it. 

I feel like getting into a relationship could turn toxic due to my fetish. I’m not attracted to healthy, normal men even slightly, yet I don’t want to encourage someone’s unhealthy and harmful state. Which means a relationship would be inherently dysfunctional unless it was purely platonic. I know platonic relationships exist but I think my partner would be bummed. 

I don’t look at any porn if any kind, avoid speaking to men or interacting them in any way, and specifically men i’d be attracted to (fat guys my age). 

I used to dress in Lolita clothing to appear as non womanly and cute (asexual) as possible. I usually tell people I have a boyfriend and dress in practical clothing now, however. 

I was curious if anyone has successfully gotten rid of a sexual fetish, and if anyone here has experience with libido suppressing drugs. 

I feel like if my libido increases as I get older, I might wish to take libido suppressing drugs. To me, asexuality is better than having disordered attraction.

457,"So I’m on the autistic spectrum, and as such, qualified for academic accommodations freshman year. After that year, my accommodations expired due to out-of-date documentation , and I didn’t get a renewal. Sometimes, I’d get an email from the office with information about events related to accessibility or reminders to update my documentation, which was fine.

However, today I got an email from a professor asking if I wanted extra time on a test. I was confused and said no, and asked why he asked. Apparently, the disability services office told him I had a disability and needed extra time. Additionally, someone scheduled me to take an accommodated test without telling me or the professor involved. Normally, all of these processes would require me to fill out a form and e-sign it. That didn’t happen.

I’m really confused as to how this happened, as 1) I’m ineligible for accommodations anyway, and 2) according to school policy, he’s not supposed to know unless I give consent (which is through a form). I’ve emailed the office and the professor and everyone is pointing fingers at each other. I just want this to not happen again.

458,"Hi all. On mobile. 


I (23f) have been seeing this guy (31m) for about a month. He is wonderful and I am so smitten! I have never felt this way about anyone before, and I am so excited! The feelings I have for him so soon are so intense, that I am almost nervous about it. 

However, I cannot tell if he is being genuine, and my mind is playing tricks on me, or if there are some red flags. Here are some of the things to note:

He has a job which requires focus. He has me text solely his work phone. (I have his personal as well.) he said so he could “smile throughout the day when he hears from me.”

He does not have any social media aside from an instagram he hasnt posted on in a year, but ive seen him online. 

I see him about once a week. We have asked eachother to see one another more, but it doesnt happen. 

When we go out he pays, and the places he picks are expensive. I always offer and he declines. 

Things got physical pretty fast, and he says he really enjoys our emotional connection we have, because it makes it that much more special to him.

We don’t have a title, but agreed over this past weekend that we should see one another exclusively. 

He is a different ethnicity and claims that he does not have much luck with dating because no one finds him attractive (which i don’t understand why, because i find him attractive?) 

We barely talk at all during the week. Im lucky if i hear from him once a day, usually at night, but is affectionate and kind when spending time together.

This whole thing is recent for us, and i am not trying to expect much, but some things he has said makes it seem like he wants something serious with me, and sooner rather than later.

He makes me feel so beautiful, special, and cared for  (when together) and i really am hoping this all works out., i also hope that he just doesnt have time to respond to texts or say goodmorning, or that he is just nervous because he has said he is so into me, that maybe he is trying to play it cool. 

The lack of communication is bothering me for some reason. Id feel better about it if i saw him more often, but i can’t help but have this weird gut feeling that there is something im missing here. 

Is the lack of communication during the week a normal thing? Or is he not as into me as he says?

465,"Hello guys,

So I recently moved internationally to study at a new college, and coincidentally I found out that one of my friend from school is here with me studying the exact same course, same classes everything. And guess what, she stays right in front of me, has been living here for a while. So I was naturally very happy that I have someone from my own hometown, neighbour and a schoolmate in a new country!

So now a bit of a backstory which might give you the context of the problem I am here to ask advice for.
 
2 years back we talked for the first time after our school, we did talk a little over the phone, and we use Whatsapp to chat, one thing about WhatsApp is that you will not see any info about the person you're talking to unless they save your contact number. And she had not, which was peculiar as we were relatively good friends in school. So I just asked her why she had not saved my number, she replied that it wasted her phone's valuable memory. That right there was a clear indication that she is not someone to talk with as this was extremely rude. 

Flash forward to 2 months back when we knew we will be going to this university. So we talk after that encounter directly now, we talk a little and she still has not saved my number obviously, and we discuss all the formalities, procedures etc. Then I just ask her, what she has been doing after school, and what made her choose this university etc. To which she replies ""You have a lot of questions"", again I'd like to stress that I did not spam her or ask her 100 questions, I literally just asked her what she had been doing post-school. And I just tell her that this was not a lot if questions nor it was a personal question either, its just a formal question which anyone can ask you. To which she never responded. I did address the 2 year old question and asked her why did she behave so rudely with me, she said that she just forgot to save my number and then she was just being 'funny', later on saying that some guys do that so that they can see our photos and everything. I just told her out of amusement, that ""We live next to each other and I've already 'seen' you in person, I do not need you to save my number so that I can see your photos. Besides if that were my agenda, I could have just looked you up on social media"", she again ignored me.

Jumping to present, its been sometime since We talk a little and now she finally saved my number, she is a little less cold towards me as compared to before but still, I see similar things. For instance, she won't reply to my messages, whenever we meet in person, she will make one sarcastic comment on my action or my post or anything for that matter of fact. Even in person she will not talk to me or respond barely, I just assumed that is her behavior, but when she meets new people or people around me, she is all good, no sarcasm, she replies and talks promptly with them. I never see that kind of reaction towards me. Moreover, she tells everyone that we are neighbours, in fact once she told someone in front of me that we are neighbors and then she tells me ""I am sure we have 1:7 ratio, and you've already told 7 people about us"", I said ""I barely tell people we are neighbors, and if I do it's only if there is an ongoing topic where it might matter"". 

Overall, she does see all of my posts and stories promptly, within minutes when I post them, but takes forever to reply if at all she does that is. She remembers some random post, comment that I might have randomly made weeks back and will rub it in how sarcastically out of nowhere. And that's how it's been going on so far.
She also told me she does not understand how to talk to me, she says ""If I text you it's a problem and if I do not still it's a problem"". I told her that let's meet and talk it out once, maybe that might help us both able to solve it. To which she assumed  that I am talking about the 2 years ago encounter, whereas I meant in general what she's been doing but she brushes off the 2 year old thing saying, 'SHE LET IT GO A LONG TIME AGO', and says what's the issue. 

I really do not understand why does she behave this way, again I'd like to say that we've never had any fights, misunderstandings, arguments at all. Nor do I spam her, or text her constantly, I've done that only when it's required or if she is involved in that particular conversation.

466,"Since the recent controversy about Nintendo's Online service being a travesty, especially the detail about cloud save data being deleted IMMEDIATELY after you cancel your subscription, this makes me realize how much of an asshole I was for knowing of and LOVING Nintendo in the first place. I currently have a Wii U, a 3DS, and a Switch, but I am now going to sell ALL of them, as well as their games and then NEVER play ANY of their games even ILLEGALLY EVER AGAIN because I hate them THAT MUCH NOW!

But I don't want to do that for a few reasons. First, since my sister got a Wii for her Birthday in January 2008, I have been sucked into parts of the Nintendo ecosystem and even supported a few of their pro-consumer decisions. Second, all my life, I have been a diehard fan of Super Smash Bros, and was VERY looking forward to Super Smash Bros Ultimate.

But thanks to Nintendo being the WORST offender in the ""Paid Online"" debacle, I think they pretty much crossed the line at this point. If my view isn't changed, I am going to make an eBay account, and put up listings for my Nintendo consoles and games to sell because I just don't want them anymore, all because I would feel uncomfortable to use it if it's made by an EVIL CORPORATION.

Please change my view, but I don't wanna fucking hear ""You'd be missing out on exclusives!"" Exclusivity doesn't make sense, and it never made sense to begin with. And it doesn't matter how good a game is. If it's from an evil corporation that I should hate with a passion, I don't want to use it even ILLEGALLY.

Can someone please help me here? Can someone please give me as many reasons as possible to LOVE EVIL CORPORATIONS???",18Sep2018,1

469,"tl:dr Friend just got a boyfriend, who's exposing her to occult practices, family doesn't like it, she's planning on leaving when she hits her 18th birthday. I'm worried that she's gonna mess up her life.

&amp;#x200B;

Friend's Situation: 

My friend is hitting that rebellious stage right before turning 18, and is planning on leaving when she does. (She's baptized) She has a ""boyfriend"" at the moment who is introducing her to Occult stuff like lucid dreaming, astral projection, seeing angels, invoking beings, and becoming a vampire or werewolf and whatnot. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't care what you believe, but I feel shes substituting the place where the witnesses were in with something that isn't going to help and potentially leave her vulnerable to manipulation. She has also mentioned to me about wanting to try vaping (at least it's not meth i guess.) She's currently working and saving up money to buy an apartment, and most likely is going to move in with him. Idk what her plans are on education, but she is not going for her honors diploma when she could just study for her SATs and get a good score. She's bright, but I just don't know what will happen to her if she goes too far and might become wild.

&amp;#x200B;

Her Family: 

A mess, mom and dad divorced recently. Currently living with her mother's grandparents, siblings are still very JW. Mom works at a chain supermarket, which is where my friend met her boyfriend while waiting for her mom to get off work. Mom really doesn't like him because of the aforementioned Occult, but she ""really"" likes his older brother.  Friend says older brother is a dick, but her boyfriend isn't anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Who I am: 

I'm a friend who has known her for almost 8 years now, and all I feel like I can do is tell her what she should do but not be able to do anything to help her.  I'm so glad she is finally getting out that cult, and I can finally speak my mind about the JWs to her. I feel like she's going down a path that is going to hurt her in the long run and I want to make sure she doesn't do any dumb shit because she is my friend.

471,"My good friend (A) is so bad at picking crazy girls to date. For 15 years I've hated every girl of his I've met, and for 15 years I've kept my mouth shut. If he asks, I'm honest, but it's a known fact he's going to do what he's going to do. Speaking of...

A's in jail. Yeah, we saw it coming. We all tried to stop it but you can't help someone who doesn't want help. So we're left picking up the pieces. Whatever, I'm just hoping this time he gets at least some of his shit together. 

So before he went, I found out he's talking to (B1). B1 is horrible. B1 is well known to be every type of crazy A should avoid. I warned him, but of course when I see the list of people he wants to be kept updated guess who's there? Yup, B1. Well our mutal friend (F) is in charge of updating, doesn't know B1, and now I see why F is in charge of updating people. 

So, that pisses me off, but not my business. 

Enter B2. Yup, 2 girls on the update list. B2 is the one A has introduced to me, and I'm starting to think is a distraction from B1. She seems ok, still crazy but not as bad as others. She sent me messages from a past ex talking about a possible B3? So there's all this too. On fb, he is with B2, if that means anything. 

So now I feel bad for B2. I'm not sure about 3, because she isn't on the update list, but I know he's involved with B1. Honestly I want to tell 1-3 maybe dating a guy in jail is a dumb idea but...hey...not my business. 

Anyway, should I just stay out of it? I'm asking because I'd want to know if I was B2. I don't want to be a giant cockblock to my buddy but, he's in jail so he's cockblocked by the state. Plus I'm worried it makes me the dick if I don't say anything. ",18Sep2018,1
472,"20 years old. I started working for a tech startup about 2 years ago as a marketing person. No experience, but had the passion to learn and improve and I've driven some results for the company. We were recently accepted into an accelerator program with some investments, and things are looking up for the company IMO. I took a semester off college to attend the program for a few months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past few months, however, I feel as though I've lost my passion for marketing. I'm basically a one-man marketing team, which can be pulled off; however, it requires extreme drive from the person running marketing activities (constantly learning, making things work despite failure, etc.). I used to have that. But now I find myself coming to work with no excitement, no passion. I just jump on Reddit or YouTube when I have the chance to avoid doing work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started diving into After Effects and Motion Graphics, and I really enjoy it. But I know myself to be a person to jump from interest to interest often, which is honestly why I've tried to stick with marketing this long. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a good position with this company. I know I'm extremely lucky to be a part of something with potential to make it ""big."" But I can't help but think they'd be better off firing me and hiring someone with more experience/drive than me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel trapped. My options are two fold: 

1. Stick with the company and hope it succeeds (we've seen some success, but it's a low chance), but not enjoy what I do.  
2. Quit and move back to my hometown (which I don't like the sound of), go back to college, and try to figure myself out more. 

I don't know what I'd do for a job back in my home town. My mom still lives with her parents, and my dad lives in another state -- and to be honest, I don't trust him enough to live with him. No scholarship money for college. I was in a position like this before, and I worked my ass off to get where I am now -- I just don't know that I have the strength to do it over again. Don't want to get sentimental here, but this situation has driven me to thoughts of suicide because it seems like the easiest way out.

There's so much I could cover here, but I don't want to leave a wall of text. 

Any help is very much appreciated. ",18Sep2018,2
473," 

I believe someone has lied to me about a CO test, on my boiler, possibly to cover up incompetence, he is using a suction gas analyser, he was called out because a black mark was noticed above the boiler, I wasnt in when he came out, and he told the person who was home that it was caused by the old boiler, which is not true as I repainted the kitchen after the boiler was installed, so he was called out again. the second time he was here I noticed that It didn't look right what he was doing, there is a two pronged green plug that wasn't plugged into the analyser, I think its to do temp sensing I'm not 100% sure (I have messed about with gas analysers, not to do with boilers, briefly at work so I roughly know what I'm looking at) most of the values of the screen he showed me were at -- and it wasn't making a noise, from what I understand, gas analysers make a humming sound when the run because they have a small suction pump inside of them, it was completely silent.

Not convinced by his ability to do his job, I ask for a different engineer to come out, but he turned up again, this time tested the boiler in front of me, however the boiler wasn't even running and then to prove 'something' to me, he turned on the cooker and then started waving the probe around about 3 feet in the air above it, like some kind of gas wizard' not amused by this I was going to call a private company (its a rented property the gas engineer is who the landlord uses) however before I do so the boiler stops working completely Friday night and an emergency engineer comes out assess that the gas valve needs replacing and tells me someone will come out on Monday , they cancel Monday and turn up today, its him, he has no idea what work needs to be done, makes a few phone calls, goes to get a gas valve, comes back puts it in, tells me its not working that he needs another part and he will order it then leaves.

I look inside the boiler and see that 4 wires in the wiring harness look like they have been pinched 2 are cut in half and 2 look like they are almost split, It looks like he has put the new gas valve in but fucked the wire harness while he was at it closed it up and left, I called the company and I have made it clear I don't want him back in this flat again as he is cant do his job, so apparently they are sending someone else out tomorrow to fix it, this is beginning to waste my time.

Does this person sound incompetent to you?

Would that kind of gas analyser make a sound while testing for CO looks like this one, I was watching a video of someone using this one and its humming audibly when its testing [https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTOoA-oIILvQ3vmTQSSf5AJ8I6CIqCRahs9-hbuO78k75XOsVDvU2tuI7gpuQIqtYsICQZ2qTgTFi1Pw7BDna5NlObHln0OMyDt4hlOYZ27DvBFSqHbIqrZDA&amp;usqp=CAE](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTOoA-oIILvQ3vmTQSSf5AJ8I6CIqCRahs9-hbuO78k75XOsVDvU2tuI7gpuQIqtYsICQZ2qTgTFi1Pw7BDna5NlObHln0OMyDt4hlOYZ27DvBFSqHbIqrZDA&amp;usqp=CAE)

But the question I need advice on is whether to ask for the ring back. She proposed and ended up asking for (and receiving) a much more expensive ring than I would have expected. I was inclined to not ask for it back, but she’s been terrible about this. She left me in a terrible position, physically injured, and doesn’t (or can’t) care. If resold, this ring would pay off some things, like medical bills, or some trip I could take to get over this. 

I don’t want to hurt her if this whole thing has been a terrible byproduct of a mental illness she can’t control, but I suspect at this point it’s just shittiness. I’ve been on the fence about asking for it back.

Reasons to withdraw:

- I have an autoimmune disease that I haven’t been taking good care of. I’m back on the right combination of meds but it could be 3-6 months before I notice anything. Worst symptom is just constant tiredness.

- My mother is going through chemotherapy (if I withdrew, I’d likely go home for the remainder of the year).

- I want to kill myself (I won’t) 



Reasons not to:

-I don’t want people to start speculating about my absence. Law school is a community of overachievers and I don’t want people to see me struggling.

- Very few people like me and I’m afraid that will dwindle to zero once I’m gone for a semester.
- I would be a semester behind all my peers and would have to graduate in the winter rather than the spring 

- “Home” is 2500 miles away. Im afraid while I’m there, taking care of mom, I’ll be just as depressed because I’m not at my house or around people i know and like (I don’t have anybody but family back there). Might even be more depressed.

So i’ve known this one girl for a very long time, we met in Year 8 (sorry for anyone from the US i don’t know how your high school year system works, but in year 8 i was 13, if that helps) and from the second i met her i’ve always loved her, we started dating in Year 8 December all the way to Year 10 December when we broke up and we went our own ways but on good terms. Now that i think about it we broke up because we were both...boring eachother i guess? but this wasn’t the state of our relationship the entire way, we truly loved eachother and cared for eachother, i’m willing to bet my life that i was the only boyfriend who didn’t treat her like shit. Anyway, after Year 10 we go to Year 11, but Year 11 isn’t secondary school like years 7 through 10, it’s college for us, and we had no contact in the transition of everyone moving into college from secondary until we met eachother in class, both of us being surprised, since we didn’t know which colleges we were enrolling to. We exchanged MULTIPLE awkward glances in our very first class together, until one day she dms me on Instagram saying hello, i reply, we start talking as if we never broke up and went our separate ways, it was completely surreal, within a matter of weeks we were friends again, not as close as we were when we first met, but friends. A year has passed since we started talking again and we’re basically friends again, and she brings up my 18th birthday, which is on the 1st of October this year and i jokingly ask her what’s she’s going to get me for my birthday, she tells me that i can have “whatever you want baby” that she’s going to have a free house soon and she’d love to have a sleepover with me and her present is going to a “surprise”.

483,"Throwaway for obvious reasons....

&amp;#x200B;

Warning: If you can not handle embarrassing health issues that I will go into detail, then you should click out of this now. I need legit advice on how to proceed.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I work in an office with quite a few middle age people. I worked in a office with another employee however he was never there due to travel so it was practically my office which was great. Earlier in the year I started having issues when I go to the bathroom so I went and got it checked out by the doctor. Turns out I have hemorrhoids and anal fissures which has been a big issue even to this day whenever I go to the bathroom. In the beginning my doctor prescribed me medication that was a cream and some suppositories....Yes this is going to get nasty, last warning.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the first days I tried the suppository I did it in the morning along with the medication before work. I went to work and sat down at my chair. Later on I noticed a pretty bad smell and looked at the chair and noticed there was a mark due to the medication. Obviously embarrassed about this I tried several methods to get rid of the odor. None of them worked. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I came to the conclusion that I must get rid of the chair. We have a old supply closet with some old chairs, so I did just that and swapped it out with an older/worse chair with no odor. About a week or two later all of the chairs in the supply closet were gone. So I felt that this would not be an issue and moved on with no issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this brings us to this month, my boss walks in and tells me that I will be reassigned to a new cubicle in another room with other folks. This is due to the company hiring a new person who needs my desk. I say ok no problem and eventually moved my things when it was time to do so. My new desk had a better chair so I felt that the new person should have the better chair rather than my not so great chair. So I put the better one at her desk and I took my chair with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well this week one of my coworkers who I now share an office with is showing the new person around. For whatever reason my coworker comes up to me and asks if I had seen this certain chair? Do you know where this chair is and starts to describe the chair that I destroyed many months before. Everyone in the office I'm in can hear. In a state of shocked and embarrassment if they find out, I lied and said nope I have not seen that chair. The chair I'm in is the one I used in my old office. She accepts that answer and leaves. Later on I believe I overheard her at her desk say that the office manager doesn't know what happen to the original chair and that the manager didn't swap them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now in that moment I was worried! My mind was going crazy. Whats next are they going to check the camera footage or do some DNA sampling? Why do they need the original chair? I gave the new person just as good of a chair? 

&amp;#x200B;

In seriousness I may be in some deep shit if they find out that I swapped them and idk what to do. I believed I may have fucked up by not telling the coworker the truth but I couldn't do it. I would be terribly embarrassed if the whole office found out which is why I lied.  

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? I see only a few options but need your input if you have the best idea. I may be over thinking this but if it comes up again I need to be prepared and ready to deal with it.

1. Say nothing and hope for the best
2. Nip this in the bud and speak with the office manager in private to explain my situation and offer to pay for a new chair.

Any help would be phenomenal as I do not want to lose my job over this stupid and embarrassing health situation. I thought it wasn't an issue....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Health problem ruined original chair so I replaced it with a different chair that no one was using. I placed the original chair in the storage room only to find it gone a few weeks later. Didn't think this was an issue. New employee takes my office and now the office manager is apparently looking for the original chair. I lied and said I haven't seen it.... What do I do to fix this without them finding out about my embarrassing health problem.

487,"Long read, but I'd really appreciate if you'd read this and let me know what you think.

I'm 17, HS senior. 6'2 165 pound guard. I first picked up a basketball around grade 9 and loved it (or so I thought...) I was garbage when I started, and I put in a few thousand hours or work on my own from mid grade 9 to mid grade 11. I lived and breathed basketball. It was all anyone knew me for. But, I denied myself a social life. I didn't go out, barely talked to any girls, and was miserable and stressed whenever things didn't go well.

First year I sucked, had 0 confidence in my game. I played on a team that went like 0-20, so that didn't help. But I worked hard all summer, and felt I could move to a better team. I moved to a better program, but got stuck on a new squad (there were 2 squads for my age group) with a shitty coach who gradually sucked away the confidence I'd built up. Still, I kept going, kept waking up early to go to the gym, went after school, watched hours on hours of YouTube videos, I was all in. 

Then I went to another team for my grade 11 year. Went to my first AAU tournament and it was alright. I played fairly well even though we went 1-4. Stayed with that team, and in came coach Lloyd. This guy, on the surface, seemed like he was all in on helping us achieve our goals. He'd hype us up, seemed to know his shit, and just generally had our backs. I played well, I was looked at as one of the organization's best players, until one tournament I froze up and relapsed into my old ways. Played like garbage, let people down. But Lloyd was there by my side telling me and my mom how I had tons of potential and he would help me realize it. About a month after that, Lloyd and the head of this organization, guy called Omar, beefed over something, pretty sure it was money. Lloyd spun it to make himself look good, and I along with a lot of others bought it. Looking back, I'm positive it didn't go down how he said it did.

So he forms his own team, promises no fees, talks to my mom and she and I fell for his act hook line and sinker. He seemed like a great guy who was in it for the right reasons. But gradually, as I and others continued to struggle, he showed his true character. I'd have a good game, but 2-3 bad ones after I'd stress over a mistake, and he'd rarely give me credit for what I did right. He also started to use some bullshit psychological tactics like calling me soft over and over like that was gonna help me develop.

Here's when things really got fucked up though. One game, me and like 4 other guys that would normally play 15-20 minutes just got benched. No reason. We lost by like 30. He puts me in with 30 seconds to go, the guy I checked recognized me, and asked me where we knew each other from. I give him a 4 word reply, and I get yanked and Lloyd starts yelling at me about how you can't talk to the other team. After the game, he goes around telling people what they need to improve on and goes in on me and Amani, another guy on the team. He tells Amani that he's a bitch with no heart, something along those lines, and he comes to me and says that basketball's not meant for me, I have no heart, I'm too soft/emotional, then tells me I'm welcome to stay on as a waterboy. So I told him to stop disrespecting me and he keeps talking shit while I just try to stay cool. 

Even after that, I still went to practice, worked my ass off, was in the best shape, but he was convinced that my struggles were because I'm soft and because my dad isn't around much. Yeah, I trusted him enough that he knew that. 

Anyway, one game I got scored on and he starts picking on me, so I tell him to shut the fuck up, he benches me, whatever. At this point I hated the guy and just wanted to keep playing ball so I could get better. He then messages me some supposed motivational bullshit the next day, and tells me to trust him cause he's ""never done anything messed up"". I said that's not true, and it becomes an argument where he just keeps shitting on me calling me soft, saying I should have punched him when he was calling me soft, I'm not a real man because I didn't do so, etc. So that was it for me and that team. He also had a really creepy conversation with my mom when she asked for her money back, he was just so manipulative and weird, it was fucked.


This was around World Cup time. Soccer was my first love, but I hadn't played in 4-5 years. Forgot how much I loved it, and I picked it up fast, I'm better than a lot of guys my age that have been playing for the whole time I was gone. I'm legitimately good at it with little actual training, just messing around. Teammate of mine who used to play semi pro thinks I can make it. But not just that, I just love playing the sport. It's fun, I play on instinct and don't stress.

I've barely played basketball since I left the team. I don't miss it. I don't plan on watching or even really following the NBA. But people that I know have told me that I can't let my hard work go to waste, and that I'll regret quitting in a couple years. I'm a pretty good player when I'm not stressing about it, but it's not fun. The other day I played pickup, was killing and didn't even crack a smile. 

I'm very very conflicted. I don't want anything to do with basketball. It sapped my confidence, which I'm just now getting back, killed my social life (well that was me being fanatical), and just made me feel like shit. I wake up happy these days and smile at myself in the mirror and say I'm the best and life is great. 

Do I have to go back, or should I just close the book on basketball? If you read this whole thing and have some advice, thank you. There's a basketball tryout Saturday and I don't know if I should go.",18Sep2018,1
488,"Okay, so before I can start to explain my exact problem I have to give you some ""background information"" to understand my problem.

I am 19 years old and from Germany. I learned English since second grade, so I learned it for roughly ten years now. 

Since I was always more of a ""linguistic person"", learning languages was easier for me than for some other people in my class. For example, I didn´t really studied the grammar part of the English language, because at some point I just discovered that I had this ""gut feeling"" - most of the time, the sentences that sounded right to me also were grammatically right.

(Of course, I have also subjects that are hard for me- stuff like maths and physics often seem cryptic to me, whereas people who are more of a ""logical/science person"" only have to glance at an equation for a few seconds and already solve them in their head after a few seconds).

&amp;#x200B;

Because I liked the English language a lot and I enjoyed using it I watched a lot of English Youtube videos and write in international forums for a few years now which naturally improved my English even more and now I also started to read books in English.

At work, I had the chance to get my English-level tested in a certified test and reached C1.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to my problem:

&amp;#x200B;

I started an apprenticeship 2 years ago and as my third and last year of training started I was really happy to see that we had English 2 times a week in school!

But after a few lessons, I discovered that most of the other students in my class as far as I am and struggle with things that are easy for me. 

I don´t really know what to do really: Should I just stay quiet and not show my abilities to avoid demotivate the other students and not come off as if I´m trying to show off?

But whenever I do that I also feel like we could progress and achieve faster if I just said the right answer when I know it instead of keeping quiet for sometimes ten minutes or more before some other students answer the question right.

Do you guys have any advice?",18Sep2018,1
489,There is this chick that I want to ask out for Homecoming and I was wondering what I say. One thing kind of bothering is that someone that I have known for 5 years has asked her out but said no. I'm afraid he might not even talk to me anymore because he started crying in football practice for her saying no. what do I do????,18Sep2018,1
490," 

So I’ve been seeing this guy (let’s call him Adam) since January. Initially when we started dating Adam seemed really interested in me and always talked about wanting to be in a relationship. He asked me many times but I always said no because although I really liked him I felt like I wasn’t ready yet. The fourth time he asked I said yes but mostly because I was afraid he would lose interest if I kept saying no, because I DID like him, I just wanted to wait a little longer. We were together for a couple of months but I started panicking because I still felt like it was too soon, so I broke up with him with a phone call and without giving him a proper explanation. I know what I did was wrong but at the moment I felt like I had to do it in order to ""protect"" myself. My last relationship before this was an abusive one, my ex cheated on me many times and humiliated me in many ways for almost 3 years and after that I didn’t want to date anyone until I met this guy. Being with Adam I felt the pressure of wanting this relationship to go right. I fell for him and I was so afraid of having my heart broken again that I broke things off first. I know how dumb it sounds but that was truly how I was thinking at the moment.

After the breakup, I started missing Adam but I didn’t want him to think that I was playing with him so I decided not to contact him if I wasn’t 100% sure that I wanted to be with him. In that time alone I had time to order my thoughts. It was stupid to break things off because of something that had not happened yet, and Adam hadn’t given me any reasons to think he was not being serious about the relationship, and I realized I had fallen in love with him. So after a month thinking non-stop about him, I contacted Adam. We talked and I told him what had happened, apologized and asked if maybe he still wanted to take me back. We talked for a long time and he told me he wasn’t ready to be in a relationship yet because I really hurt him but he was willing to date and see were things go. So that’s what we’ve been doing, dating (exclusively), getting to know each other and meeting each other friends and families. Great, right?

The thing is, I do want something more serious with him and I don’t know if he still wants that. Before anyone asks, yes, I have told him twice, both times within the first month of this situation and both times he told me he wasn’t ready yet but that he is in love with me and would like to commit in the future. I haven’t touched the subject again because I don’t want to be seen as insistent o desperate, but how long should I wait? Is he playing with me? A male friend told me he might find dating comfortable and probably doesn’t want anything else with me, just someone to kiss and spend time with. I’m scared of getting my hopes up just to have my heart broken. I don’t know if I can take being fooled again (also a reason not to tell anyone), it took me a long time just to start dating after my ex. Should I insist? Should I leave? Btw we’ve been like this for 2 months. Thank you in advance and sorry for the long post.

TLDR: I broke up with my bf then started dating again but now he doesn’t want a relationship?",18Sep2018,1
491,"Is there an app (free one) that will allow me to play some relaxing music/sound for maximum of 10/15 minutes?

Like a rain, thunder, whatever sound.

The problem is I can ofcourse go to youtube and do it that way but it wouldn't close in (even if i'd change the lock screen to 5 minutes, if a video plays it won't recognize the phone as not used) so what can I do??

I need my alarms too so I can just get my
Phone to 5% battery so it eventually shuts down, but I can't keep it on throughout the whole night aswell,  anyone that can help me on this?

I'm on an iphone btw.",18Sep2018,1
492,"So I live in an upper lower type of apartment and I have the 2nd floor. Within 3 weeks I've gotten 3 noise complaints from the people downstairs saying they can hear every word I say when I play xbox in my room which due to the layout happens to be right above their bedroom. I know it's not how loud I'm talking becasue my roomate said he couldn't even hear me from the next room over. My suspicion is the 2 vents in my room that are supposed to be for heating are allowing sound to travel down them and into their bedroom. Which is my guess becasue when I run the dryer in the basement I can faintly hear it from the vents. Do you guys have any suggestions on what I can do to prevent this issue?

493,"Reposting here since I posted in r/socialskills twice but to no avail.


Alright....so there is this girl in my math class. 
New student to the school. I had a crush on her since day 1 and really want to befriend her. However, many contingencies lay ahead.

First, she sits away from me in class. Secondly, at lunch, she seems to already have an established friend group. This all seems veru discouraging. 

How do I approach her naturally without coming off as a creep? Thanks!

494,"There is an extremely low chance that this girl likes me romantically, but since she hasn’t given any signals that she doesn’t, I am in denial. I keep thinking she is waiting for me to make a move at the right time, and if only I did the right thing she would make it known she likes me back. I don’t know if she knows how I feel, I feel like I’ve been sort of unclear with her about it so maybe she’s nervous to make a move. I really feel like she isn’t interested and I don’t think I can tell her how I feel because I’m not sure if she has a boyfriend or not. What should I do?",18Sep2018,2
495,"My husband works as a paralegal while he’s working on his Bachelors and making his way to law school. I’ve never known any lawyers on a personal level and I’m fairly unfamiliar with what exactly he does at work and studies at school because he never has taken any work or school related issues home. We’re nearing our first anniversary and this is the first time he has come up against an issue at work that has bothered him so much. I’ve also never been in a situation similar to this. It involves his pay. 
I just want to be able to properly support him even though I’m unfamiliar with his field and his situation. Is there anything your husband or wife does that helps you feel better in stressful situations?",18Sep2018,1
496,"Okay, so I started talking to a girl through a mutual friend a while ago. Just a regular friendship, we talk to each other, we help each other, shit like that. 

About a month ago, she met some of my friends and we hung out for a bit. Afterwards, I’m being told “dude, there’s no way in hell she doesn’t like you”. Apparently she did something to make my friends guess that was the case. I didn’t think anything of it, since I like her only as a friend.

I did, however decide to focus more on her behavior around me and sure enough, she acts pretty fucking weird now that I think about it. Fast forward to today when, just as we’re in the middle of a normal conversation she just casually drops the information she has a boyfriend she hates and wants me to comfort her. She also let me know it’s very likely they’re going to break up.

Now, we have never been close enough for her to tell me this sort of information and it took me by surprise. We’re pretty much the same person, which makes me wonder if a relationship could work out. I like her, just as a friend but at the same time, I feel like we can be something more. I probably sound really dumb, but all my life I’ve been hurt in every single relationship I’ve been in so I’m kind of lost on the topic of relationships as a whole.

**TL;DR:** A few friends saw a girl friend’s behavior around me and it led them to believe she likes me. After paying more attention I thought it looked like that as well. Today, she just casually tells me she has a boyfriend she’s going to break up with. She’s tells me this even though, we’re not that close for her to tell me this kind of information. I like her as a friend because we’re practically the same person, but because of that same reason I think a relationship could work out. Should I try my luck with her?",18Sep2018,1
