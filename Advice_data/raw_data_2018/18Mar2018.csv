0,"My roommate is always trying to be the first out of the house and tries to be the last home. It feels like he is trying to compete over it, but I don't care. He wants to act like he is doing something. 

Today, I was about to go out fishing. He was trying to get all the details of what I was doing and who I was going with. He was asking why I was up so early. I ended up  heading out before him. I'm sure he did not like it. 

I just don't understand what is going through his head?",18Mar2018,5
1,Hi everyone I let my bf cum inside of me tonight it kinda was heat of the moment thing. So I am on the end of the second week of the pill so I have one more week until I should get my period. I have been on bc for about 3-4 months now. Need your thoughts please!! ,18Mar2018,3
2,"Soooooo I recently found out I have a serious grinding problem, so bad that I cracked one of my molars and now have to get a crown. Next step is a custom night guard that comes with a pretty hefty price tag, which brings me to my question...

Does anyone have experience with the boil/diy night guards that you can buy online? If so would you recommend? I’m considering forking over the dough for the dentist night guard but honestly would rather spend that money on a plane ticket.

Thanks!",18Mar2018,5
3,"First of all the reason I say I'm hesitant to use the terms ""bully,"" ""bullying,"" etc. is he isn't explicit in the way he treats me. It's a lot of ignoring me and refuting things I say even if they're true. Frankly it's mostly passive aggressive BS, but there have been a few incidents where I would consider what he's done to me and my friends as genuine bullying. To make things worse he acts gentlemanly to teachers, adults, and basically people who aren't me and my friends. 

The problem I need advice with is that I'm 90% sure one of my friends has a crush on him. She moved to the town I live in about 7 months ago, so we're pretty good friends but it's not like I've known her my whole life. I don't know what to do because I'm conflicted and worried about losing a friend. In my eyes, my options are to tell her how he treats me and my friends at the risk of her thinking I'm jealous of him and that I'm in to her, or let it happen and hope he treats her well. I'm also worried that he's either leading her on because he acts flirtatiously to pretty much all the girls, or that if he does have feelings for her and they get together he'll hurt her. I don't want to lose one of my friends, but I also don't want her to get hurt by this guy.

What should I do? Should I stay out of their platonic or romantic or whatever relationship at the risk of her getting hurt, or should I risk telling her and losing a friend?

They started going out with other girls from our class and they don't invite me.. I think they have a group on whatsapp which I'm not a part of obviously... I was a very social person before high school and had a ton of friends but they all started going in different schools or we just lost contact... I started playing guitar, reading books and working out since i have nobody to really hang out with... I often talk with my mother but i don't want to stress her out with my problems so I don't really talk about it that much with her. I just want a few, if not, at least one friend who i can really trust and hang out with whenever i feel like it. I feel so down whenever I see them hanging out  without me even though it seems like we are great friends. I think I'm pretty intelligent for my age and I can't stop thinking about things in life which make me very depressed. I hope someone here can give me some advice because I feel like total garbage right now...If you have any questions feel free to ask me, I'm ready to answer anything for some help........",18Mar2018,2
5,"I apologize for my long story..

I don't understand my parents. When me and my siblings where young my parents put us through various activities to keep us active. However, as the siblings moved out, and I was left (I'm the youngest) the activity and their motivation grew less. I moved out, infact, all of us moved out of town, and when I came back to visit after 6 years away, our beloved house was in shambles, storage boxes in rooms, dog poop stuck on the carpet, our patio roof is about to collapse, our once pristine pool which was the envy of the neighborhood had turned black.

about my parents- My dad was a Vietnam vet, a prostate cancer survivor, did EVERYTHING for his family, did yardwork etc. he has not smoked for 31 years, has not even had a drink for 15 years.

my mother on the other hand- was emotionally abusive, a bully, constantly argued with my father. Her childhood as she claimed was dark, later I convinced her (after constant struggle) for her to take anger management.

In a sudden twist of things, my sister gets divorced, has full custody of her children and one child decides to live with my parents (thats another subreddit story to tell). Now things are worse as there are old things my parents are hoarding, now theres 18 year old teenage girl things everywhere.

My father is retired, and has the same routine....

-gets up
-goes to breakfast for an hour
-watches tv and naps
-gets dinner
-watches tv and goes to bed
*all throughout the day hes on facebook, he's even added some of my friends whom hes never met

and repeat

my mom, has progressed attitude wise however her routine

-get up
-goes to work
-grabs dinner
-watches tv til she falls asleep

and repeat

My parents, hate each other, they see their marriage as a business for the children and they sleep in different rooms. I feel ive watched the worst of it all and I've grown a strong discipline to be good and active and not be the worst of my parents

I don't want to go further as I could write a book on this. But I know depression plays a factor in this.

HOW CAN I GET MY PARENTS TO GET UP AND DO THINGS WITH THEIR LIVES, CLEAN THE HOUSE, AND NOT MAKE THE REMAINDER OF THEIR YEARS ROUTINE?

10,"I qualify for $44,000 in scholarships from the state alone. My university is offering me $27,500 (from the state). I was depending on this money. The criteria for the scholarship was to have a 4.0 GPA on a 5 point scale and a 1400 on the SAT. I have a 4.71 GPA and a 1470 on the SAT. Since the money is from the state, I assumed I was pretty much guaranteed this money.

14,"Hi ya'll.

I  am an instructor for an organization with multiple performing groups. 
The most advanced group is split 50/50 with kids who are highly motivated, there for the right reasons, and love the activity and then kids who think they can show up and do whatever they want. 
The kids who don't seem to care go home and complain to their parents if something happens they don't like. This could be that they had to do push ups or run laps, that they were not put into a part they want to be in, whatever. Now these parents will send nasty emails to the coach and behave ridiculously (Attempting to yell at coaches in public, phone calls at 10pm, threatening legal action when their kid is the one in the wrong, trying to dictate how practices should be run, ect).

I teach the youngest group and this isn't a problem for me, it only seems to be this older group with the issues. I am worried about the coach of this group, who is also the director of the organization and my boss/friend, because he is always putting in literally 10000% effort for these kids who just don't seem to give an actual shit,. It is burning him out.

23,"So as said in the title I think my friend is depressed. We are both 16 year old guys in secondary school and we're pretty good friends. I recently found out that he thinks he was depressed.

One night we were at a mutual friend's party and he got really drunk. I looked after him for the night, which I was fine with because we're good friends. He was really sad and apologetic about me ""being stuck"" looking after him, I kept telling him that it was fine and I wanted to be there with him but he felt really guilty.
 
Later on in the night he drunkenly told me that he thought that he was depressed for the past few months and that he regretted coming out(he is bi-sexual) because he thought people labeled him. He was really sad for the rest of the night but seemed to cheer up when he told the host that he was sorry for ruining the party(which he didn't) by being so drunk, she told him that she loved having him there, he didn't ruin the party and that other people were way worse then him. I texted him afterwards and he said he would be fine. I feel terrible that I didn't even try to do more.

On Saint Paddy's day which was tonight we went out with a bunch of people (around 10). We were watching a rugby match at his house at about 4 o'clock. He seemed fine at the time and our team also won the match so everyone was pretty happy. After the match we started walking to another friends house but on the way there he got a text saying he had to go home.

After a while at the other friends house he came back. We all said hi and he sat down. We were there for another couple of hours and he hardly said anything unless he was addresses directly and even if he was he would normally only respond with a few words, while everyone else was talking a lot. After we left the house we were walking around for almost two hours and I kept trying to get him to talk but he was still acting the same.

After we arrived in another friends house(some people went home while on the way) he was still really quiet and spent lots of time in the bathroom. After another hour or so we all decided that we would go home but before we left he and another one of our friends were talking privately(I don't know what it was about it could have been nothing).

Just a little bit ago I was texting him asking if he was okay and if I could help. He said that he tried to hide his feelings and that he was feeling really bad today. He also said that just talking to him was helping him. He also invited me to do go for food on Monday which I said yes to and I hope is a good sign.

So basically I want to know how to help him, if I should tell any of our friends that are better at this stuff (but that could breach his privacy and make things worse) or his parents (who I don't really know) or do something else. I have watched some videos on how to help people with depression and I am trying to let him know that I am there for him and I'm trying to spent more time with him. Any advice would be really appreciated.

This was really hard for me to write so thank you to anyone who read this whole thing, I know it's long. Please try to remember that we are 16 so we are really young and inexperienced when it comes to feelings and pretty much just being humans in general.

*So to sum things up, what I'm basically asking advice for is...*

- How do I establish the habit(?) of rationalizing before I do anything
- How to focus on actually putting the effort into understanding and remembering information

*There are probably other issues in the story I didn't cover well, so there may be other obvoius issues i'd need help in*
________________________________________

Story: I've always been like this, but it has gotten way more serious. Whenever I'd say anything, it's become a tendency to not even realize if it fits the situation/occasion, which leads me to seem like an idiot and an odd person. But, more than just talking, this has become a mind concept for everything I do. Whenever I'd read something, I can never actually pick up what I'm saying unless I read multiple times and force myself to understand. I lost my ability to collect info and compute it into data. If someone were to tell me a story about something, after just telling me a sentence, and then another one, I would have already forgotten what the initial story was and what was said in the sentences before.

*Edit 1: Btw my reading issue is only caused when my mind doesn't actually focus on what is being said, rather than being incapable of reading it*

*Edit 2: An easier way of summarizing this is that I basically lost my conscious ability to think before I do something, any advice?*

After a long awkward silence, he tried to take it back and say it was just a joke. I poked and prodded him a little bit with the conversation to see what else he'd say. That night he just said a few questionable things while we were gaming online that just seemed really immature (something I might've done at 13 or 14, not 18) or outright racist / strongly implying that he holds racist beliefs.

I am an alcoholic and they have a pretty serious drug problem. We enable each other, but it always seems to work out in the end. We've gone to rehab at the same time, etc. 

I'm sorry if I'm rambling. I'm on mobile, detoxing, and I'm very upset. 

My friend checked herself into a behavioral health unit at the hospital around a week and a half ago. I guess her family was done with her, so nobody else would pick her up. I went and got her, and since at the time I didn't have anywhere to stay, we stayed at hotels and things like that. I ended up having to sell a lot of the already small amount of property that I had to be able to afford this. Three days ago I brought her to work with me because I was out of money and we didn't have anywhere else to go. I work in a store. She started trying to steal so I grabbed the product and threw her out. I probably overreacted. I drove her to a family members house and left her there. I felt bad like 15 minutes later and drove back over there. I saw her leaving with her family member in a vehicle. Now I can't find any way to contact her. 

I've spent the past couple days worrying that she's dead or dying somewhere while hoping she's in the hospital again. 

Basically I just need advice on how I just let this go. I'm starting to realize that this is really toxic for the both of us and if she wants to talk to me, she will.

45,"Just warning you guys, this is going to be a long post.

Back when I was a kid i was extremely optimistic: I thought I'd develop video games and be insanely rich. Life seemed okay back then, and I was hopeful for everything.

Fast forward to 15 year old me, and everything has been flipped upside down and life just seems like it's going in the wrong direction.

My grades aren't good, and some of the stuff I try to learn is like trying to understand hieroglyphics; it just makes no sense to me. I don't even see the point in school and think college is a scam and that it isn't helpful.

My life is boring. I'm probably in the middle of the high school popularity pyramid, but I honestly think I'm at the bottom. I feel like half the people who are friends with me are just friends with me out of pity, and i feel like i'm a loser. I hate my school and everything about it. I feel like the staff are incompetent, power hungry, and just stupid. I hate most of the kids because they're all upper middle class while I'm more or less lower middle class. They're always showing up with Yeezys, Supreme, Louis Vuitton bags, any dumb ""designer"" brand they can get their hands on they will wear it to school. Because of this I just dread going to school and I've been out around 25 days, either because of general sickness, anxiety attacks, or just not wanting to go to school. When I get home I basically just listen to music or chat with my friends on Xbox. That's it. I do hang out with people but that's honestly pretty rare. No one really invites me over for anything. After being led on twice and almost dating some crazy, obsessive chick, I've given up on dating in this school. Everyone's either taken or just not my type. I've never been in a relationship and it sucks, because I feel like I'm missing out on something. I've also begun to become insanely bitter, and 75% of the things I say are just reasons why I hate this school, people, or just life in general.

My relationship with my parents is slowly dwindling. It honestly feels like I'm becoming my mom's nurse instead of her son. It's always ""Help me with the computer"" or ""get me a bottle of water"". And whenever i show the slightest sign of aggrivation she gets mad at me. She also wants to move in with me when I get a house, which I really don't want to partake in. I'm grateful for everything she gets me, to be completely honest I'm spoiled, but she's giving me a lot of stress with her negativity and her constant need for me to help her with something. I honestly just want to leave my parents because even though I love them, they're holding me back.

A couple years back I was diagnosed with high functioning autism, anxiety, OCD, and depression. I constantly deny my autism, because I am nothing like most autistic kids. I honestly think I have tourettes and anger issues. When it comes to my anxiety and depression, I'm getting help, but it just feels useless. For example, I'm having troubles talking to girls that I like, and when I told my therapist, she basically just gave me advice and left it at that. I know what the damn problem is, and she barely even gave a thought about it. Just general advice I could've found on the internet. My psychiatrist basically is just ""how are you feeling?"" ""good/worse."" ""ok lets up/lower your medicine"". The meds have helped me a lot, but I still feel like I need help, and I'm not getting it.

My hopes for the future vary. Some days I think I'm going to have a good future, and some days I feel like I'm going to end up amounting to nothing, with no friends, girlfriend/wife, and working a dead end job for 10$ an hour. I'm currently pursuing a career in automechanics, since I loved cars as a kid and I want to own my own auto shop. I also have dreams of becoming a rapper, I mean most of today's rappers are inspirations. If they can come up from nothing to being rich beyond their wildest dreams, then I could. I've liked rap for a year now, and this isn't a dream that I had for a few days then moved on. I've had this for almost a year now. I told my mom about this dream, and she jokingly said, ""but you're not black"". Well you don't have to be black to rap. I've wanted to pursue rapping, but I don't know where to start. I have no creative talent, and I have no one to help me.

Overall, If I could be someone else, I would. But I can't, and I want to make this life the best. But I don't know where to start. I'm going to the gym to help fix my scrawny physique and look more attractive, but besides that I have no idea what to do or how to actually fix my life. I need advice on every aspect; How could I better myself? What could I do better? Because the people I go to to get help just don't really care, which is why I'm posting this to the internet.

TL;DR I've become bitter, hopeless, and my quality of life just feels like it's going downhill. I need advice on fixing my life.",18Mar2018,1
46,"She got pregnant about 4 or 5 months ago and we agreed an abortion was the best option. Because of how far along she was when we realized she was pregnant, we were forced to go with the surgical option as opposed to the pill. It has been a hard process for both of us, but it goes without saying that it has been much, much harder on her than it has on me. The typical post-abortion emotional pains have hit her hard, and it seemed like she was getting better for a while but she's been acting weird these last few days. 

Today she forgot her phone when she went to work and, after seeing how depressed and weird she was acting, I went through it. I know I shouldn't have, I know it isn't right, but I did it and that's the simple truth of the matter. Can't take it back now. I found Google searches in the last few days about how to hide a pregnancy, how to fake a pregnancy test, etc. I am shocked.

I don't know what to do. I have *no idea* what my next step should be. It's not as if I can just say ""hey, I know you're pregnant again"" or something. Please, somebody just give me some guidance. I'm at a complete loss here.",18Mar2018,153
48,"Break-ups happen, I know they do, but this caught me so off guard. I was friends with the guy first, but over time I became really close friends with both of them to the point where I could hang out with the girl alone and it wasn't weird or anything for the boyfriend. Hell, they're two of the three people I've told about my depression, so we were pretty close.

Today, he texted me telling me they broke up after a year and a half, and, I don't know if it's weird, but it really hurt me. I cared about their relationship and, from the outside at least, they seemed really happy. 

I just don't know how to go on. I wanna keep being friends with both of them (hell, i'm rooming with the guy next year) but I don't want to hurt either of them.

First of all, I need to know how to care for them, like making sure they're doing okay and stuff.

And second of all, how do I not hurt any of them in the future by hanging out with the other one?

49,"I’ve had KP all my life. It’s something my mom told me would go away, but here I am at 25 and my skin looks horrible. I eat a plant based diet and work out, but nothing helps. I heard skin products are just scams, but I always moisturize with lotion or Vaseline. I’m embarrassed to wear shorts, skirts, dresses, bikinis in the summer. People always question why I never did in school. It’s impacted my dating life as well. I’m so afraid to be intimate with a guy because I’m always afraid he would look at my skin or feel the bumps on my skin. I’m always so jealous of women with smooth skin. So do guys care about a woman having KP? Also, people say I’m really pretty and I always get asked out on dates, but the only thing stopping me is my KP :(",18Mar2018,2

Her parents always work late and since she’s mostly home alone(when I’m not over keeping her company). Since she’s home alone so much her cousin always goes over and brings his friends with him. The issue is that these friends harass her sexually and verbally. Every chance they get they go after her. It’s so bad that whenever they come over and she’s alone she locks herself up in her room for hours on end. It’s not just at home either. If she’s out and they’re nearby or at the same place as her it’s right back to harassment. She and I are afraid to fight back in any sense because they’re all at least 4 years older than both of us and much larger than either of us.

56,"About a year ago, my Dad met a woman and got married to her. I was not phased at all. He has been in over 20 relationships in my entire lifetime and they all failed, so every time I hear about him meeting another woman, I think, ""Here we fucking go again.""

My brother killed himself 2 years ago and it made my Dad even more depressed than he already is. Me? I'm okay and I'm ready to move on with my life, but my Dad is in his 40s and he is still miserable as hell. Every failed relationship that has happened to him reaffirmed that he has still not changed at all. I'm living with him and I want to leave. I am coming to believe that I can't help him with his depression and he takes out his anger on us a lot. There is no physical violence or extreme yelling (aside from a lot of arguing), but he is always on me about stupid shit and trying to control me. He **loves** to argue and wants to try anything he can to do it.

I want to go to the Navy, but I used to be on anti-depressants so I have been 4 months off of it strong and I'm doing well at my new job. I will have to wait a year in order to have a good amount of feedback from a professional counselor in order to be cleared. So that's on hold for now. My Mom lives a few towns away and I've been wanting to move back there for a while. My Dad's wife is a nice lady and she moved down from up north, got a job, and she's been paying all the bills since she moved in.

So they just got into a huge argument and I've never been in a relationship, but I know for sure that even bringing up the word divorce is a big time no-no. It gets worse by the day and I hope that this doesn't end with physical violence. I'm 19 and my Dad and I have anger issues. We've never fought and I don't usually get angry anymore. My Dad hasn't hurt anyone either, but he has horrible moods that I can only respond positively without it spiraling downhill.",18Mar2018,1

It's not that she's mean, she's actually a genuinely loving person to literally everyone, it's just with me she's different, distant.

61,"Bottom line is, I haven’t seen my father since my since senior graduation about 4-5 years ago. Before then, I didn’t see him since my eighth grade graduation. Regardless, he has been pretty absent in my life since he was kicked out of the house when I was in elementary school for being so abusive and being addicted to alcohol. He calls on occasion, but you can always hear how drunk he is in his slurred words.

I cannot stand to be around him for how he’s treated my mother and just the family in general. He is going to come though and when he does, I will be upset. I likely won’t see him until I graduate from  a 4 yr university next—if the alcohol and (possibly) drugs haven’t caught up to him. 

He has not provided a penny for my sister and I, he has also found out he has another daughter a few years ago. He makes promises to come visit, but never follows trough. He had a DUI when I was in elementary and his license were of course, suspended. I believe he’s eligible now to apply for a new license. 

He’s a womanizer, an abuser, and an alcoholic. I get uncomfortable being around him. He use to steal from my mother to get his drinks, and he even use to call her in the middle of the night cursing her out when my sisters and I didn’t pick up the phone. 

How do I deal with the inevitable? He will be there and I don’t want it to ruin my day, but he’s obviously going to try to talk to me. It will make things extremely awkward. I am also very sensitive, so I’m bound to cry not only because it is a special day (I’m getting my AA and my high school diploma at the same fine!), but because he is there and hasn’t done a damn thing for me in my life. Nothing on my birthdays, nothing on the holidays. He has a new job and makes legitimate money, but never gave me a single penny in my life. All he does is hang out with his new girlfriend and gets drunk. Over November he talked about how he cooked for her family and I just felt enraged. What do I do? ",18Mar2018,1

Over the past month, stuff has been rough and she says she’s always to busy to hangout, I’ve seen her once a week the past month, and she usually rejects my invites to hang out but still says everything is fine.

Paying for his college, buying him a vehicle, and really doing nothing to curb this horrible behaviour. I'm sure she was a little bit scared of him.

Anywho, I've heard some empty apologies, but the animosity and resentment, still overflows. They have shown no remorse for their behaviour, and think just saying sorry should be enough. I know a genuine apology comes with remorse, and a change in behaviour. 

I've asked my both my mother and brother to attend counseling with me, I truly believe we need a 3rd party perspective to explain to the them why I am so hurt. As of this past Christmas holiday, I asked them for the fifth time, and they both refuse to go. They just keep telling me to get over it, to move on, to let all my pain go with no actual healing.

I was a freshman and he was a junior. Nothing seemed strange about him at first, but over our   1.5 year relationship things got bad. I dealt with weekly mental breakdowns,  verbal and physical abuse , and cheating.  He decided to leave me for his drug dealer during his senior year,  and when I told him I didn't want him back my friends caught him waiting for hours in front of my house and at my job.  

I never reported it because I didn't want to admit I was a victim of something I thought could never happen to me. I was much younger and much more naive than him as well. I eventually told my parents and they weren't surprised. 

He was kicked out of his home and was not accepted into any of the colleges he applied for.  He moved to another city to do community college .

It's been a year since the relationship ended. The woman he left me for recently tried to follow me on social media. Meme accounts similar to his (he deleted them) have tried to follow me as well. The model of his car is very,  very popular and I keep seeing similar cars to his in my neighborhood. He was disowned by his family and it's been a popular topic at our school , since his siblings are still there.

83,"TL;DR  (This was really hard summarizing the post and still making sense, I would recommend reading it)   

My relationship with my Dad has slowly deteriorated as I have grown into more of an adult. We don’t fight at all, and it’s more of me having problems with how he operates. We are very capable of talking and very rarely have conflicts any with each other. I feel as though our personalities don’t mix and we have very little in common. I don’t know if I’m just being nitpicky and ungraceful or if there is any merit behind my thoughts. I’m stuck because I understand there are natural frictions that happen when children grow up and still remain in close proximity to their parents. Especially with men. But I don’t want to be unfair because of my biases, even though I try to overlook them and understand both sides the best I can. 

Jokes about literally everything. Making it really hard to just have a casual conversation without an eye rolling “ha ha” joke just inserted in randomly. 

Has a lot of self destructive behaviors that can be helped but chooses to ignore 

Is very irrelevant to new things going on in the world, making the topic of conversations static and repetitive

Seems to not try to learn new things or hobbies so he just works and watches tv

Always talks about the past and how things were so good back then.

Let me preface this post by saying both of my parents are wonderful people and have provided me with nothing but a stable home life and I am forever grateful to them for that. I also believe that most of this post is a spawn from me still living at home with them during college, so I am still working out as to why I am writing this other than to just rant.

1.

That being said as I have grown older (21) and much more independent I find that my tolerance for them has plummeted, specifically my Dad. When you’re a kid you don’t really question your parents way of doing things or life choices, but my Dad drives me crazy. When my siblings and I were all very young we all were very happy and would joke around a lot, my dad would mainly joke with Jim Carrey esq type humor (loud and obnoxious). As we all got older this humor became less of humor and more just obnoxious. And he tries to make a joke about every single thing anyone talks to him about. To the point where I don’t want to show him anything that I do because he will try to say something stupid and make it funny. I love to draw and I’ll show him something I’m working on and he’ll say “you should give them a tattoo of a butt on their forehead” which usually ends with me saying something along the lines of “yea totally” with underlying regret of even showing him laced in. This kind of “humor” is pretty much his entire existence and now that all the kids are in their 20s it’s super old and doesn’t result in laughter much anymore. I just want to be able to have a normal conversation that doesn’t involve some sort of lame “joke” to make something funny that isn’t funny. It’s almost like he feels as though if there is no humor in a conversation then it must be serious and not a good conversation. 

(What I understand)

I understand that as us kids get older and leave the house, as my older brother already has, that both parents will start to realize things are changing and that may induce maximum overdrive on the good old days memories. And I get that having kids is a very special thing in life and it's hard to see your kids change while you the parent have already been an adult and have been pretty much the same person for most of your life. But no matter what your age, everyone must keep adapting to some degree to better themselves or you will be left behind and be irrelevant to those around you in my opinion.

When it comes to talking about opinions with him on anything there is almost no consideration for the opposite side of said opinion. I try very hard and would like to think I can see where my biases lay and always try to find the most rational answer to everything without excluding ideas that aren’t in my schema of thoughts already. This often leads to me questioning my Dad’s train of thought on many topics because he is very opinionated and doesn’t like to budge from his stances on things. Not a bad trait to have at all, but things can get quite irrational sometimes and his opinions can baffle me because they make no sense outside of his train of thought and I can’t understand how he can not take into consideration that he might not be 100% right. I do not get into or talk about anything controversial with him because it is pointless and arguments themselves are useless anyways to me. 

(What I understand)

Obviously he has lived longer than me and by nature has strong opinions. I don’t expect him to change his mind for anything just because I think it’s wrong, that’s the essence of an opinion. I tend to be very neutral on most subjects so I can never fully agree with anyone and this can also be problematic.

My Dad has been clinically depressed for quite a few years. Now he is not crippled by this and bed ridden, he exercises daily and can be very social when he is at family gatherings and likes being around others. So there is motivation behind him and he is capable of functioning very normally. (I have never experienced actual depression and I pray I never have to so my confusion and thoughts in this subject are probably not that accurate.)  While this has NEVER impacted my childhood and I will always be impressed and respect his ability to work as hard as he does for the family, he makes life decisions that I will never understand. He is not a dumb person and had a good group of friends that he maintained throughout his life. He had a support network but he always seemed to find something wrong with someone or just a reason to stop talking to them and would keep further isolating himself. This would of course make you less and less happy and everyone knows isolation is the last thing someone who is depressed needs. He deleted his facebook because “he was tired of seeing political posts” and has been changing jobs every couple months now for a year. Each new job he gets he makes it sound like this one is going to be so much better than the last one, only for him to quit it in a few months talking about how they run it horribly and this and that is wrong with it. He tried starting his own business a few years ago and it ultimately failed because 1. He isolated himself from his friends 2. Turned down investors that were giving him very real opportunities and 3. I believe he is too prideful to ask for help when he clearly needed it. And ever since then he has blamed government regulations, taxes, and what not for his failure. Not business model or his decisions.

(What I understand)

Again I am mildly ignorant when it comes to the inner workings of someone who is depressed so this paragraph is mostly voicing my frustration from a point of view of someone is looking in from the outside. But is there not a common sense factor you can apply to start helping yourself or asking others for help? Like I said before he is not crippled by this, he can be very sociable and passionate about certain topics and he exercises almost daily so there is motivation there to do things.

My Dad and all of us kids would always joke around about how his parents (our grandparents) are super old school and are like time capsules from the 50’s. They don’t know much about the current day and as a result are really hard to hang around with because it’s the same dang conversations every time. My Dad always laughs about that but I can already see that starting in him almost. It sounds so petty to me typing this out but am I wrong for thinking if someone chooses to become socially irrelevant that it becomes increasingly hard to talk to them about things? Neither of my parents have any hobbies, but my mother is pretty up to date with many topics as I introduced her to reddit and she loves it. My dad really doesn’t really try to learn anything new or pick up any hobbies so his talking pieces are relatively static and that being the case doesn’t promote many conversations (because I pretty much know the answers or topics already). And he always talks about how the past was so cool or how the internet has ruined things or how new technologies have taken away more than it has given. Generally just a negative attitude to change in general. ( I am well aware that this is a very typical thing for people in older generations to do but he is young enough to traverse the internet and research things without jumping to conclusions that just because people don’t sit on assembly lines anymore doesn’t mean that technology only robs people of things).

(What I understand)

Not everyone wants or needs a hobby I can fully agree to that. But having one surely helps create conversation with others. Or helps keep your mind active and learning rather than just working and watching tv. Depression is a horrible mental illness and I can only imagine what that must do to your motivation but why not give yourself reason to get out and combat that?  It just seems self destructive to work and watch tv over and over again.

Summary sort of

The past 5ish years has slowly devolved into this relationship where I just tolerate my Dad’s presence. I do believe that most of this is coming from me becoming more of an adult and how I have my own lifestyle that differs them my parents and that spending a lot of time in close proximity creates friction. I am still very young and have a lot of life experience left so this might just be the inner child in my still wanting to rebel against my parents, I would like to think this is issue has a bit more fuel than that but you never know I guess. I am very calloused towards my Dad and I am actively trying to remind myself of what he has done for me and the family. I don’t know what the point of this post is. I just felt extremely compelled to write this and share with others because I need feedback or help or something. I think I just need to move out.

84,"What I am going to say may sound stupid/irrational for some of you so please keep in mind:
*I live with my brother
*He's the most disgusting human being on the earth. Doesn't shower daily, doesn't wash his hands after going to the bathroom, doesn't brush his teeth, doesn't clean his room.
*I suffer from OCD. 
I was in the desk finishing my work with my cousin. He was doing his things I was doing mine. All of the sudden my brother appeared on the room and began to mess with him, they usually annoy each other, fight in a playful way, you know, boys stuff. When he was done he put his hands into his underwear and started to scratch his genitals, it's embarrassing to tell you that but when I said he was a mess I really meant he was, the problem is that he did it very freaking near me, almost touching me and when it all happened I, due to the anxiety, turned my face to another direction and couldn't see all his movements, which means I do not know if after putting his hands out he touched the books on the table, my pens, my computer, my elbow or my hair. I didn't see that, in my mind I just have the image of his hands down there. I leaved the place and went to my room, picked up my soap bar and proceed to wash my hands, just for making myself 'safe', but I have not been able to finish my work yet, haven't gone to bathroom neither (fear of getting infected) 
That's the situation and I want to know what random people would have done, this is my options list, feel free to add more/change items:
1. ""Hey, that's gross"" - Back to your work.
2. ""Hey that's gross""  - Leave the room, finish your work in other place without cleaning your objects. 
3. Don't say anything.
4. Same as I did.

85,"I'm not sure why this is happening. I'm slipping a bit, which is natural for any person who recognizes the negative aspects of their life, the world, other people; but I am really angry. I made it out of a major depression episode, around a month and a half ago. I started lifting weights and improving my diet, I had something that gave me purpose, it gave me -gives me really- a reason to continue, doing. It was astounding to me that I could go from a regressive catatonic state, to one of a motivated meathead. It's been wonderful. But a week ago I started having insomnia, followed by anxiety attacks. Intense, long anxiety attacks. They last anywhere from 1-5 hours. The anxiety aggravates the insomnia, and the insomnia aggravates the anxiety. I'm not sure what the problem is. I'm not drinking caffeine after 12 (I only really have it in the morning), I get off my phone at 9 specifically. I've tried valerian root, chamomile, milk and carbs. Don't get me wrong, it worked to relax me, but I can't fall asleep. And that's manifesting into a whole cluster of other problems. Today I had my first pseudoseizure since December, I've had multiple actually. I think about how much I want a relationship, I imagine myself crying, pushing up against a man or a women and passionately kiss them, to wash away stresses and stabilize, simultaneously I think about how my generation is doomed. The happiness, the need for exploration, the amazement with the development illustrated in the 80s and 90s is absolutely gone for us, as a fourteen year old, I observe throughout my age group almost nothing but talk of their substance use, and their failing relationships; their ""affairs"" and their partying. I know that's how it's always been, teens are party freaks. But when I think about it, the purpose of this drug use, it is an existential nightmare. In this first world society I live in, everything's set in stone. You go to school to learn about the past, about skills necessary to succeed in life as someone who learns and uses those skills to help others to learn. But all of this is only to get us on the same fucking page. I feel isolated from every person. Like I am a different organism, like I think and process reality in a completely seperate way, but that's most likely not the case, that's not the case at all. And that idea, the prospect of a complete lack of individuality in the way that we think, how we interact with others, that's terrifying. The way all of this fits to together into one mega cell and we are the workers, how are we supposed to live and function as beings totally aware that everything we know is on the internet, every hobby we enjoy is enjoyed by tens of thousands of other people. So we cope, we find activities, drugs, moral principals that are allow us to forget and just enjoy being human, enjoy being alive. That's beautiful, but it's not enough. That limitation, that understanding and harnessing of beauty makes it tainted. Tainted by corporate desire, we are statistics, we are the numbers on the computers of the people who create every aspect of the comfort we strive to feel. That's hard to accept, and it makes me angry.",18Mar2018,1
86,"Hello Reddit.
I will preface this by saying I've been diagnosed with Anxiety, ADHD, &amp; Insomnia. I'm not sure if that's relevant. 

Both my parents were heavy drug addicts (they still are), and on both of their families alcoholism has been a problem.

I am not addicted to substances (save for Klonopin, but I'm working on that), but I do easily get addicted to random things, often detrimentally. I can pour hundreds of dollars in videogames (even if it means skipping meals), or I can spend weeks obsessing over a certain events or subjects (to the point I wake up in the middle of the night.)

I am not satisfied listneing to songs unless I do it like 30 times in a loop, and I have poured THOUSANDS of hours into videogames and hobbies I could0ve replaced for doing more productive things.

So I'm a college student, and I used to be friends with this guy in my first year. We were only friends, but there were a little bit of feelings on both sides (they were little for me, not sure about him).

Anyways, he turned out to be an asshole, would make racist jokes about me (I'm of asian heritage) and would call strangers names and make fun of them for no reason. I stopped talking to him, but then he started following me around and showing up to my classes saying he wasn't an asshole anymore (lmao kay).

Long story short, he followed me and shit for about a year, stopped for one year because we hardly saw each other around, but not we're in the same class and he's starting again. I sit on different sides of the room every class and each time he follows me, stares at me, and loiters after class so he can try and walk near me.

99,"This is a long standing embarrassing issue I've been having for the last couple years or so. I am 20, and attracted to girls around the ages of 12-16, usually around the ages of 14-15 is what I seem to be the most attracted to. Whenever I see a girl I am interested in, I know she is without a doubt underaged, I am right 100% of the time on it. The closest I came to really acting on it was a month or two ago when I was at a friends house and his sister brought one of her friends over, who is 15. I hit on her, ignoring the fact that the fact I find her attractive is a red flag, and ended up cuddling with her on the couch and having her fall asleep on my chest while we watched a movie. I felt really peaceful, really relaxed to be honest. But, I got ripped apart by basically everyone there for being creepy, they used the word child for her, ""why are you interested in a child?"", over all it was embarrassing and made me feel like shit for weeks. 

I've tried going after girls my own age, but I legit don't find them attractive, I have no sexual attraction or physical attraction to them. I really don't want to put any effort into doing anything for them, I don't know if its because porn has warped my brain to make me think that any girl over 18 is a whore fucking seventy dudes a year and thus, the younger girls haven't reached that stage yet? Speaking of porn. I haven't been able to get off to legal women in like a year if not more. I'm not looking at illegal stuff but theres enough content on social media accounts and other stuff that it actually allows me to have an orgasm, rather than cum and have it feel more like a sneeze than anything else. I wouldn't think this is a huge issue if it wasn't for the fact I cant get off to normal women and that I am naturally attracted to girls who I socially and legally can't date dooming me to loneliness and embarrassment, forever. I'm sure theres some psychological reason behind it, but I wouldn't really know, maybe its an attraction to innocence?  Its not a power thing, I'm not interesting in over powering some young girl because of her age, its what I would expect most straight dudes to feel about 18+ women. 

Does anyone have a solution for this? My dad noticed this once and told me that my mom and him are six years apart and I usually just say it was a different time and thats it. Most people though treat you like a subhuman, and I think that's a dignified response. ",18Mar2018,2
100,"I've come to university, and whilst I thought I was going to have an amazing time in a new city and explore new horizons - I have instead spiraled into quite a sticky drug problem. I didn't realise it was happening at the time but over the course of 6 months I have managed to sell my car (which I wasn't using, because I failed my driving test twice). Max out two £1000 student overdrafts, with £1000 left outstanding as well as around £700 on a credit card, with £500 outstanding and also all of my student maintenance loan (plus money from family) which has been around so far, £3000. 

I have managed to work out my finances so that I can pay off all of my (immediate) debt in three weeks when my next student loan comes in, and I am now actively working towards stopping all drugs except for the occasional joint. 

However, every night I cannot sleep because I have such an incredible amount of guilt, stress, anxiety and regret over my foolish, idiotic, selfish decisions that have lead to me now pretty much failing this year - which my family have sunk a lot of money in to. I have taken their generosity for granted, and in turn I feel like I have spat in their faces.

How do I go about getting over regret, or at least coping with it.
How do I explain the situation to my family? I am not from a rich family, I am the first one to go to university and I come from a very volatile council estate, so I feel like the blow is going to be much harder due to the loss of finances that my family felt like were an investment to kick start me into benefiting my future.

My dilemma is the fact that this is the first girl I’ve ever been in a relationship with, and I simply don’t know what to say or do around her.

Since we’re in different grades, we only see each other at lunch and in the hallways, and sometimes in athletics.

During those times it’s unbearably awkward because I haven’t been going to this school very long, and don’t really know a lot about her friends.

I want this relationship to be more than a school thing, and she seems to really be into it.

107,"I [24F] just went on a date with a guy [29M] that I met through OkCupid. I was really excited about meeting him because we've been talking every day for a week and even spoke on the phone for HOURS. I knew it wouldn't be a long-term thing because he hit some of my major dealbreakers (drug addict and dealer), but was still pretty interested in meeting him because he seemed really nice and chill and I wanted to just give it a shot.

Then comes the day of the date. We decided to go to a bar near his house to play games and just hang out. Within five minutes, his friend calls and he picks it up. I jokingly commented about how that was rude and he just admitted he *was* being an asshole. Then, he tells me we have to meet his friend (and some girl his friend is with) at his apartment to let them in. I said I didn't feel that comfortable about going there yet, but he said it'll be really quick. 

We end up in his apartment  with no sign we're going back to the bar any time soon. End up being there for close to 30 minutes and most of that time, he's doing drugs (not the light shit) in his room with the girl who was with his friend (and she was also being really flirty with him) and left me out in his living room all alone because I didn't even want to be in his house in the first place, and legit didn't think we were going to be in there for more than 5 minutes. As soon as he comes out of his room, I tell him I'm leaving.

I was SO mad at how much time I wasted on this guy who had to even convince me to go out with him (I didn't know if I was into it at first because of said deal breakers) to only be ignored for 45 minutes. It was the worst, most uncomfortable situation I've ever been in. After I left, I ended up meeting with friends who were already out, got really drunk and ended up texting him how I felt. I pretty much tore him a new asshole for treating me like shit on our date. I normally would just dead the situation, but that ""date"" just made me so upset I couldn't even believe it was happening.

The next day, he texted me saying I was a catfish and to update my profile because it was false advertising so he wasn't into me anyway. He's seen all of my social media too. I'm very self conscious about my appearance and him saying that really made me feel like shit. Nobody from an online dating app has ever said that about me before (I've probably been on close to like 100?) and in fact usually say I'm really pretty in person. 

I know none of you know what I look like in photos or in real life to be able to compare, but.... do you think this guy was just being a fucking dick? Or is it possible that I really don't look like my photos and people are just being nice to me because they want to get in my pants. I've been on apps for a long time and this is the first time I feel like I should delete them because I'm too ugly to be on them...

**TLDR** A guy I went on a horrible date with said I was a catfish and this hasn't happened to me before. Is he being a dick or is there really a chance that he was upset that I don't look like my photos?

108,"Thank you for your time. I could really use some advice. I trimmed this down a good bit. We have 2 dogs that used to bark a lot. After we got a warning from the city we took them to training, bought bark collars and left our dogs out less often. We started out with small shock collars that didn’t work. We went to large shock collars that caused the dogs to yelp and then the shocks escalated causing the dogs to convulse. Luckily we figured that one out real quickly. So we found these collars that don’t escalate the strength of the shock and give warning beeps. The dogs bark 2 or 3 times before they’re shocked. These collars are gold. The dogs get even better when we see them bark at a squirrels or rabbits in our yard. So our neighbor reports the “dogs are still barking all day.” We’re mortified. Go back to training and change routines. The complaints continue. So finally we get cameras. We catch her in a series of lies when looking at the footage. The most problematic dog barks a total of 10 times for a 9 hour span of the day while we’re gone at work. 5 to 6 days of the week they don’t bark at all. Zero barks. They never bark at all during noise ordinance enforced times. I want to strive to always be a better neighbor and want this lady to enjoy some peace and her property. Our dogs barking is well below the city ordinance for pets and noise. This is important because this week she filed an official complaint and lies about how much they barked. If she lies enough we could pay a $500 fine. She older and alone. She’s not a nice lady. I don’t feel she’s reasonable but I understand we all have a story. I’m working real hard to be understanding and open minded. The dogs only bark at her. None of the wild and loud children banging on the fence or the dog(our other neighbor) next door that barks at all hours of the night. We think we have footage of her provoking the dogs but it’s debatable. I asked permission to enter her back yard while holding a remote to shock the dogs. I wouldn’t let them know it was me and could train them to not bark. She didn’t like that idea. It’s ok. I understand it was a big ask. She’s started a paper trail against us and a dishonest one at that. The animal organization here doesn’t care about the details, the truth or what’s happening. Their job is to warn people and write tickets. I even offered to provide footage. I understand but it makes it hard to contest the warning. She emails me a lot. A coworker suggested I file a harassment claim with the police to document the dishonesty and email volume. That would escalate it a lot though. She’s become much more aggressive as time has gone on and I don’t see how I’ll avoid a ticket despite the fact that she now knows we have caught her in 10ish lies. Another coworker said that I should not sign the ticket, go to court and provide the footage. I will if I have to but this is a ton of drama that I would like to have settled. What should I do?

But to be honest, as much as I do not want to communicate to her for now, and maybe ever again, because she hurts me with the things she say incessantly (like every. single. time. she opens her mouth when we're alone, like you know shopping or walking around without my dad, such that I feel afraid of being alone with her because I don't know what she's going to say next that will break me inside) like putting me down about my aspirations for my start-up business [funded with my own money]  and how I should help her out with household chores and not just sit around (which I don't get what she's trying to say because I do my part by cleaning and tidying the home, washing the laundry and cooking and most of the time, I'm busy adding items to my business, marketing it and thinking of ways to promote it), and it's gotten worse ever since my sis married and moved out of our home. No one to coax her down and my dad is of the opinion that I should be more tolerant and suck it up. 

The reason I can't move out and leave her alone is because she has suicidal tendencies and I would be very selfish since it will drain my dad out and in Asian's context, it's very unfillal to do so, they see it as like dumping them. 

My mom also refuses to get any psychiatric help because she believes it's just her high blood pressure and menopause. However, I feel like if this goes on, I might just lose my sanity, feel like it's hanging by a thread, you get what I mean? ",18Mar2018,3
110,"An error happened when writing this couple minutes ago so I'll just start out with my friends. I feel like they dislike me and feel like I'm not funny and just a burden and it causes this really uncomfortable feeling for me. Also kinda like they're all alphas and I'm a beta. I haven't been able to tell them this because I'm afraid they'll just laugh at me for it. 

So I also do have social anxiety which feels fucking horrible which causes going to events and dances feel like hell. I am told I never like to have fun. I want to but I can't control it at all. 

So onto my family. I have 2 sisters, one younger and one older, who hate me. The younger not that much. But my older sister... Fucking hates me. I have no idea what I did to her for her to act this way. She puts me down about everything. Like my dislike for sports (which both younger and older play) for example. She does it with my grades as well which are not too shabby at all. The worst part is that I'm actually afraid to pass her or be near her. Every time she's walking down the hallway and I am too, I retreat to the bathroom or I try to think that nothing will happen and try to walk past but she pushes me to the wall. 

 Now with them as a whole. They have to yell at me at least once a day. I've just gotten used to it by now. I fuck up a little and they yell. Don't mind it anymore. The uncomfortable part is how different I am from them. I don't like sports, hate politics, hate school, like video games, complete night owl, love Green Day (live in a catholic family), and hate/dislike almost everything they like. I sit near them and they don't talk to me at all but they will talk to my sisters. My sisters are the stars in my family. They are so praised for everything and I just sit there like, “wut 'bout me?” I know they know I'm the least favorite which causes the most uncomfort for me. Knowing that my family loves me the least kinda scars me. 

Anyways, Sorry if this was a shitfest. Not good at typing/writing. But how can I overcome all of this and accept it. I want all of this to just woosh past me and just live a happy normal life without any of this effecting me. Any other tips are very much appreciated as well.

116,"Hihi, I’m new to posting so I hope this is in the right category. It’s late here so apologies if this post is hard to follow.
I’m currently 17 and living in Connecticut. The past few years I’ve moved around a ton, was essentially homeless and stuck in a lot of unconventional living situations, etc,. Things are okay now, though, which I’m really thankful for. That being said I don’t have any real attachment to being here. I just switched schools, I’ve moved towns too many times to know the neighbors, my friends are impossible to keep up with and my family itself is pretty disconnected. This whole place makes me sad. When I think about being here, I feel like I’ll never get out.
My current goal right now is to get out of high school and move to Chicago (was thinking of Bridgeport), but I have no idea how to go about it. I don’t have any plans for college. I’ll probably be stuck in school an extra year in order to graduate so I’d be going to community college if anything, but I don’t see a point in going just to go, y’know? I was considering trade school or becoming an EMT instead (pay is awful but I can see it being something I’d have a real passion for). I also considered becoming a bartender. I just have no idea how to work enough to afford rent while also becoming an EMT or attending trade school, or if any of this is even achievable to begin with.
I don’t really care about doing things conventionally and I’m A-OK w/ living cheap and frugal if it means newfound independence in a different state. I envy people who just get up and go and are successful in doing so with barely any money in their pocket. But I’m a clueless teenager with no idea on how to go about doing that.",18Mar2018,3
117,"Earlier today my girlfriend of 3 months asked to come over to talk. I had been anticipating this for a little while. We've gone an entire month without seeing each other, mostly communicating through text, because she has been under so much pressure and stress lately - a combination of (mostly) schoolwork, family issues, and other things.

I pretty much knew what was coming and of course when she arrived we went for a walk and she said she thought we should break up. She said she doesn't think she can put in the effort for a relationship right now with everything else on her plate, and frankly, I believe her. She also complimented me repeatedly and told me that it wasn't that I was adding to her anxiety or anything, but that she simply didn't think she could give anything in a relationship right now. She even said I was her rock when she was down.

Like I said, I've been expecting this. I had all these ideas of what I would say when this talk came up, but in the moment I really didn't know what to say. I told her I didn't want to break up, that I was willing to put up with the space, but that if she thought this was the best option, I wouldn't try to say no. She said she thought it was.

She wanted to still be friends. I do too. She's been one of my best friends since long before we started dating. So that's the plan right now. Since we've been so distant for so long I don't really anticipate us hanging out too soon with her busy schedule, but I can't help but feel like as much as I love her friendship, its going to be really weird going back to the way things were before we were dating. I liked ""us"". I don't know... I just feel like everything is going to be different, and not in a good way.

It sucks so bad. One minute I'll feel fine and the next I feel horrible again. I keep thinking about her. I was hoping we could push through the semester with her heavy workload and start to see each other more when summer came, but now? It would be stupid to hold out hope that she'll want to get back together when school is over. Spending time with her this summer was something I was really looking forward too.... but now I'll just be alone.

The worst part is just how great she was. I've had plenty of female friends and plenty of crushes, but I've never met a girl who I just _clicked_ with like I do with her. So I'm glad we're going to stay friends, but god damn it if I don't think she's pretty much perfect. I know it would be stupid to hold out for her, I _know_ that, but I can't help but want to just coast along until the summer and then see if she wants to try again. But I _know_ that's stupid, and holding out hope will probably just end up hurting me.

I don't know what to do. She's one of my best friends but I like her so, so much. She says I'm the sweetest guy and that I was her rock, and I _so badly_ want to be able to continue being her ""rock"", but I totally understand where she is coming from...

I'm just struggling to sort through my feelings I guess. Its really rough.",18Mar2018,3
118,"Hi so I've had a best friend since two years and we were in the same school and same class. Now it's coming to the end of our GCSE and we all have to do A levels and my best friend had confirmed it too. I was really happy to hear that she'd be doing A levels with me aka she won't leave me alone.

Yesterday she texted and told me her dad's friend had told him that A levels is an institution where your girl could go and date a guy and teachers won't give a shit about it , so she's vulnerable (yk Asian parents). Anyhow there's NOTHING LIKE THIS. The problem is that her dad had been brainwashed easily and now he believes that over religious friend and hes really strict and all that shit so he won't let hee do A levels he has said it so it's final. 

My best friend and I kept crying for like two hours over Snapchat, she told me I'd find someone better than hee but no... I'd rather kill myself and i don't want to lose hee, she's been a part of my life through kith and kin. She has been there for me when there was no one to support me in hard times. Shes the one who has kept me from killing myself twice. I don't want to lose her. She's the rarest person ever and she's really special. She had goals to achieve just like I do and now her parents are shattering them.

I told her there's still hope and he may change his mind. I told her that I'd come up with solutions or might as well talk to her parents myself but I don't have the guts.

119,"Hey helpful reddit folks...this post might be long and rambling because I'm not really sure exactly what I am asking for or what I'm trying to say. WARNING: This post describes animal cruelty, although I'll do my best not to be too graphic. So don't read any further unless you want to cry.


I saw a photo yesterday that is really messing with my mind. It was an article about cats that are used for food in other countries. In the photo it showed some already cooked cats and then a bunch of still alive cats thrown into a sheer, colorful gift bag, all ready to be processed. In this photo I remember seeing one cat that looked like it had it's arms wrapped around another.


I quickly looked away, scrolled up and backed the fuck out of that page. All night I kept thinking about what I saw and of course, I was beyond sad. The image even made it's way into one of my dreams. This morning I woke up and it was one of the first thoughts that I had. I'm clearly haunted by what I saw.


This happened to me once before, a few years ago when I had just joined reddit. Someone posted a pic of a tiny, wet dirty kitten in another country. In this photo, the kitten was standing on the guy's shoe, desperately clinging to him, reaching up for help. This photo disturbed me so much, I left reddit and didn't sign back in for 7 months, for fear of running into this photo again.


When I did log back in, I searched for it, not to see the photo, but to read the comments to see if there had been a happy ending. I found the post, closed my eyes as I scrolled past the photo and found that the guy who took the photo decided he could not help the kitten and left it to it's own defenses. I'm still not over it, as I still think about that kitten, but it no longer devastates me like it did at the time.


As for this photo yesterday, I kind of feel like I should look at it again, but I don't know why. Why would I want to see it again? To desensitize myself? I don't know. I'm old (49) and I've seen a lot of bad stuff in my lifetime to the point where most human interest tragedies no longer completely ruin my day. They make me very sad, but they don't wreck me like they used to. But for some reason, animal cruelty is something that I just can't process at all. This shit really fucks me up.


So...I guess what I am asking is:
1) Should I look at the photo again? Will it help me understand something? Make it easier to think about? Why do I even have the desire to view it again?


2) I wonder if there is anything I can do about this horrible cat-eating problem in other countries. I want to help if I can. I didn't read the article but the blurb said the photos were taken by a ""cat rescuer."" So it sounds like someone is trying to call attention to the cat's plight.


3) What can I do to forget about what I've seen? Or am I not supposed to forget? How do I get the disturbing image out of my head? What do you do when this happens to you?


Any advice anyone has will be appreciated. Any thoughts you may have, I'd like to hear them as this is really mind-consuming and I'm an emotional wreck today. And if anyone wants to read the article or view the photo here is the link, but I gotta warn you it's very NSFL: (I removed the link because it might be why my post seems to be deleted.

125,"Hi all! I'm an Australian female whose salty as shit rn about a sexually frustrating dilemma!
So recently I've met a guy whose pretty damn special to me but we've come across several complications during intercourse. 
I am experiencing an intense pain within my vagina whenever he well, enters it. 
Initially it was non existent, then it began to appear near the end of sex and now I can't even let the guy in without literally pussying out due to the pain. It feels like an intense burning, like all my walls have closed in and have been consquentially set on fire.
We have used both silicon based and water based lubricants (finding the water based to be way more comfortable but not as long lasting) but neither really assist anymore and we're using a shit tonne don't u worry. 
I thought maybe I had an STD so I got the blood test and urine test but came up clean and healthy. I also got a pap-smear and a discharge swab and came up healthy too. 
I began to suspect endrometroitis and went in for an ultrasound (external and vaginal) and also came up clear and healthy. I keep asking the doctors 'so what's wrong with me then' and none seem to have any answers and others look at me like I'm insane.  Like guys... I asked one doc what's happening and he said 'maybe his penis is too big'...multiple other sources including other docs have explained that vagina has the capability to stretch over a baby's head (obviously) and (if the pelvic bone wasn't there) the tissue can actually spread over a bowling ball so...his advice seems weird.
My guy is being super respectful and patient about it and we've tried other methods but I'd still like to get back to normal. 
He says it might be psychological and I fucking hope it's not because while it's easy to fix a physical disability it's bloody hard to fix a mental one... 
Don't even know why it would be a mental one because I happen to hella like this guy and have only started to stress out now that the pain is there... 
So like
I'm salty as shit and am actually starting to believe that I'm insane...

126,"A friend of mine tried to play myself, my husband and her ex husband all against each other (as we three are friends and were so before her ex husband married her). 

Upon being called out on her inappropriate behavior she gave all parties involved the shittiest, most narcissistic apology I’ve ever had the displeasure of listening to. It was literal 20 minute “apology” of pointless explaining as to why she did what she did (she views herself as self defeating and insecure and she was jealous 🙄) with no real apology or admittance that she wronged anyone. 

I’ve tried for almost a year to be a faithful, dependable friend for her (at her ex husband’s request) as she has a myriad of both mental and physical health problems and this is the first time she’s ever lived away from her dysfunctional, yet close knit, family. It’s been fun most of the time, she is a sweet gal and I enjoy her company, but she has lied and continues to lie about some important things and frankly she’s a bitch to her ex husband all the freaking time and it irritates me.

With this latest incident I’m honestly torn about remaining her friend.  I don’t want her bullshit to add stress to my pregnancy and I definitely don’t want her to try to sabotage my marriage again. 

If cut her out entirely, she will not have a friend at all in this state as her ex is out of the country for work. She has no possibility of moving back home unless $3000 drops out of the sky.

I’m honestly trying to forgive her but I don’t think that forgiveness will include lining back up for more of her lying and schemes And it makes me feel so guilty.

I’m making my decision firmly rooted in the idea that I’m doing this for the continued good of my family. But cutting her off makes me feel guilty because she isn’t mentally or physically well and she is liable to do something even more stupid than the last stunt. 

I just want to make sure I’m doing the right thing.

128,"So I finally  quit my retail job, being sick of the BS for a long time, my last day is tomorrow. Here's the rundown of my job prospects:

I have been applying for PSAV (audio/visual setup company for hotels/events) for the last year and I finally got an interview. Being I don't have the experience on paper it took a lot of work conveying to them I can do the job. In my 2nd interview the lady basically said I got the job and she found a property, high end resort nearby, for me to work at, I just need to meet with the director there to ensure they want me at the property. This was Wednesday, she said he would call me within a week to setup an appointment,  which he hasn't, so I will be calling on Monday.  The job is 14 dollars/hr and part time. I know a guy who's been doing it for 2 years and makes 18, and my friend works the union jobs doing it for 28 an hour. This is a job I find fun and interesting and I am working on my Associates degree in IT, I feel like 2 years work experience in audio visual plus my AA in IT will be huge to get me a job in the field. Also, I'm in the southern California desert and business dies down a lot in the summer months.


     Now, I had an interview Friday for another nearby high end resort as a bellman, it's minimum wage plus tips (11/hr) and full time.  The interview went great and the guy who works there that recommended me tells me everyone said I stood out and I am definitely the front runner. There is no room for movement here, in a year or 2 I'll still be a bellman making minimum wage. The job has good benefits and good discounts at their other properties. Also, the summer months here reach 120+ pretty regularly and standing outside in that doesn't sound fun. 



    Backstory, I just turned 30, been doing security for 12 years.. I love helping people in the hospitality industry but I love tech I think even more. I'm leaning toward risking it for the PSAV got.

152,"We live in FL, aka flea paradise. I took my cat to the vet for a wellness check and the doctor found fleas. So I get some bravecto for my cats. My cats stay indoors and have never had fleas before. 

Naturally, I informed my roommate and asked him to treat his dog for fleas, reasoning that they are getting on when he goes outside. 

My roommate never takes his dog to the vet. He insists there are no fleas based on his observations and refuses to treat the dog or have him looked at. This dog has scratched an entire patch of fur off it's own hindquarters. 

This makes me pretty uncomfortable with my living environment because we have carpet. I have begun keeping my cats in my room and told him I don't want his dog in my room. We would sometimes hang in each other's rooms.

Am I overreacting? I just don't feel like I should have to confine my cats to a 12x12 box for the rest of the year because my roommate is an irresponsible pet owner.

I thought flea tick prevention was common knowledge if you have an animal that goes outside, especially in this environment.

I had problems with math when I was studying (because of that I dropped my studies, because I couldnt keep up with other students, I was learning everything really slow).

I am worried, because I woke up 1 hour ago so I should have a fresh mind -  instead of that I am just frustrated.

P.S I just realise some more things. I drank crazy amount of pepsi/cola for about 3 years. I dont know if this could do some damage to my brain but I feel so impatient.
I am reading things in hurry, jumping from one word to another. I barely could read three pages of reddit posts (just the titles from the front page), my eyes were just jumping away from it. I feel so crushed and uncomfortable.",18Mar2018,1
154,"So my friend dated this girl for a little and broke up with her five months ago. He's now been with another girl for a few weeks. We were all at a party last night and I hooked up with the girl he dated a while ago. He tried to fight me and swing at me when he found out and can't stop saying ""fuck you you're a faggot"" over text. Are friends exes off limits? I'm a 18 year old dude if that changes anyrhing.

Edit: They dated a year and a half ago but hooked up a few times 5 months ago, so it wasn't official 5 mo ago they just hooked up a few times. AND by hooking up we just kissed, not banged.",18Mar2018,3
155,"This is such a first-world/one-percent problem and I feel like an idiot for even asking but I appreciate any advice. 

Okay so quick backstory: I spent the last 5 or so years in education and a couple before that unemployed, so I was basically free to do whatever I wanted with my time. My last full time job was a shitshow where they treated their employees like dirt and worked us into the ground (a colleague actually died on his way to work after being scheduled back to back shifts that only gave him five hours to go home, sleep and come back at six am. He came off his motorcycle at speed and died instantly). 

I graduated last July and sort of half-heartedly looked for a job while I still had money saved from university to live on. During that time, my dad sold his house in a major metropolitan city and moved to a city about half an hour from me. His new house cost less than 1/5 of what his old house sold for, so he gave me the money to buy the house I was renting and we agreed I would pay him back half the cost. There are four other people living in the house who are now my tenants, and the rent from them covers all the house costs plus my expenses and even a little bit of savings. I found a full time job local to me that pays more than minimum wage, is useful to society and a good place to work. They even bring in fresh fruit for the employees for free! I've basically hit the jackpot and I know this.

The thing is, assuming nothing changes it's going to take at least ten years to pay my dad back and after almost a decade of essentially have no responsibilities, I'm finding myself resenting having to give up the majority of my time. I'm both a fairly lazy and independant person to start with and the thought of another ten years of having to work to someone else's schedule and plan my life around a job is already starting to feel overwhelming. I like the job well enough, ten years isn't that long in the scheme of things and I know I've basically switched the game of life to easy mode at this point but I still can't help feeling this resentment/anxiety/whatever it is about no longer having the freedom to do whatever I want and I worry that I'll get five years in or whatever and just burn out. I've considered trying to progress in the job to a team leader role and beyond, earn more money and pay down the debt faster but that seems like a lot more pressure as well and honestly one of the things that drew me to the job was it's simplicity: I can just work and then go home and not think about it. It's only been a few weeks since I started working (technically I'm not even out of training yet), so I guess my question is: is this feeling normal? Will it go away? How do I transition into getting used to working full time again without resenting it for taking over my life?

Feel free to roast me for my non-problem now.

156,"Hello everyone. I´m in a (for me) complex and hard situation to be in and I would like some advice.

159," I met a person (say V) through a common friend, for the first time. We talked and found each other interesting. Then we started chatting over WhatsApp, met couple of times for the movies. Slowly slowly we both started liking each other. We started hanging out together. We used to spend every weekend together. Our feelings for each other started becoming strong. V loves me more than I love V. We weren’t committed to each other but indirectly we were, it wasn’t official.

I am kind of person who commits only when I see future with the other person. I used to like V a lot but I was not sure about my relationship with V in future, say 10-15 years after. I took 2 years to finalise that yes, this is the person I want to stay with in my life. I decided I’ll never leave V.

During those 2 years, we used to talk all the time, we used to spend most of our time together. That was an amazing phrase of my life. We were mentally, emotionally and physically attached to each other. V was sure about our future, that we are going to be together no matter what. I don’t want to fool V by passing my time for 4-5 years and then moving on with someone else. I wanted to be 100% sure. In these 2 years, there were some instances which made V think about our relationship. I was talking to few friends, whom V think that I’m cheating on V with those friends. V assumed that I was having physical relationships with other people as well, which wasn’t true at all.

One instance was V saw my and a friend’s (Say H) chat. In that chat, H was asking me about my sexual preferences. By these instances, V started having anxiety issues and went in depression.

I was always loyal to V since starting. After that chat with H, I stopped talking to H and made H cut from my life permanently.

In these 2 years, there were many situations where because of fight or anything, I didn’t use to talk to V and told V many times to move on in life. But V didn’t. V stayed with me during those 2 years. I even said it’s over between us many times, though we weren’t committed. These instances made V more depressed about life.

After so many fights, misunderstandings and complications, there was a time where V and I didn’t talk for almost 20 days. It was the time of Diwali. I messaged V on the day of Diwali, we talked and it was almost normal between us. We were together again. We again had a fight in December 2017. V wasn’t well. V came to meet me outside my classes. We met, ate sandwich. I was tensed and worried about my studies because I was due for my CA final exams in May 2018. That time we we were just roaming from here and there. Wasting time roaming here and there. I told V that I need to go home and study. We had a fight and I left V and went home. V was ill. V thought that I don’t care about V and also I’m not committed to V. V thought that I’m not attached to V. V started worrying about future like, what if I leave V forever. V would be alone then and after seeing me leaving V when V was ill, V was almost sure to move on.

V downloaded Tinder and made a friend (say Y). Me and V were still talking but we were talking less because we had a fight. V met Y, they became good friends. They started going out, spending time together. I was alone, studying, waiting for V to talk to me. 10 days passed, still waited for V to talk to me. On the 11th day, I messaged V and started talking.

Later, V told me that V met Y on tinder and they are good friends, like minded and V likes Y’s company.

Yes, V had almost moved on, leaving me under a thought that we are together and we’ll be together soon. But I didn’t know that V and Y’s bond was increasing day by day. We had a fight on that too, that how could V do that? How could V meet Y? This fight was our biggest fight. December 25, 2017, yes I still remember the date. We had a huge fight.

After 2-3 days, we talked again on a condition that V would cut Y from V’s life forever. Things were going okay between us. Then I came to know from one of my friend that V and Y had kissed. We again had a fight on that. V told me that V and Y both were drunk. They were not high, but a little drunk when they kissed. Somehow we solved that issue and then I express my feelings for V to V that I love V and want to be together forever. I also said V to cut Y forever from V’s life. V said with the time, V will do that. V assured me that V will make everything normal as before. V stopped talking to Y, blocked Y everywhere. Y called me thrice and abused me really bad. Y shared my number with Y’s friend. Y’s friend also called me many times and abused me to the core. I told everything to V. V said V will handle it, said me not to worry. V promised me on New Years that V would cut Y forever from V’s life.

Now we were in a relationship, we went for dates and outings. Things were getting back to normal. But what happened in these 2 years made V, emotionally weak. V still loves me but V is controlling attachment for me. And I can feel that. I can feel that V is not the one who V was during those 2 years. I moved to my hometown for my studies for 5 months in January 2018. V and I used to talk over calls and messages, sometimes video calls as well. Life was going good. Then for like a month (continuously) in between V stopped replying for hours together. Whenever I called V asking where V is? V replied V is out. I asked me you didn’t tell me that you are going out. V replied sudden plans.

Now we fought many times because of either V not replying or V going out and small things. I started developing anxiety issues. I also doubted that V is with someone. This whole thing went on for a month. I was going mad here, full in anxiety and trust issues. I even consulted a counsellor so that I can divert my mind from these things to my studies. Life was not going good.

Yesterday, V told me that V met Y couple of times and they talk over phone as well. They even plan their Saturday for some music concert. V had told me about the concert which V didn’t say that V is going with Y. V said with some friends. V and Y meet many times for evening chai, talks over phone calls. V said they just talk casually and nothing more than that.

Y is the person who along with friends abused me to the core. Y also said few people in my life, that I’m only for sex. Y also tried to pull down my image in front of a person whom I know.

V and I again had a fight and this is the time I lost respect for V. V said I’m overreacting and making it a big issue. V is constantly telling me that they have talked and met casually. V knows what all Y has done in my life and V is still talking and meeting to Y.

According to me, even a small kid won’t see someone’s face who abused or harmed someone whom that kid love. And V is still not getting the point. V is like they are casual friend.

What should I do now?

This whole scene has freaked me out to the core.

V broke my trust.

V made fun of my love.

I lost respect for V the time V told me about V talking to Y and meeting Y.

And what I’m getting in return, to listen that I’m making a big deal out of this small thing and overreacting. V again and again is saying they just met casually. They have met quite a couple of times.

I broke off with V.

How would someone react in this situation?

Can anyone please advice? Am I wrong? Am I overreacting?",18Mar2018,1

I have one friend in the group who isnt an ass, but just wont stand up for me. The whole group is basicly led by one dude that has a grudge towards me.

169,"So I started my first real job post college last year and there’s a yearly event that’s pretty huge, with a fancy three course meal, free booze, and big name entertainment, where you meet your coworker’s spouses and mingle. I like my group of coworkers and was really looking forward to this, getting to know them on another level and letting my boyfriend meet my coworkers because I think he’d really click with some of them. This was supposed to be on a Saturday, first time I’d be going. The day before, Friday, my boyfriend said his friend wanted to hang out and asked whether he should go see him or hang out with me on Friday. We live together and he’d either be going out all night or staying home. I said do whatever you want, I’m up for hanging out or a solo night, but I’m booking you all Saturday. As a joke, I don’t book him, just saying I really wanted to hang out with him. He had a really good time Friday with his friend and I was happy for him and texted him before I went to bed to have fun and that I was looking forward to hanging out with him the next day. The next day I wake him up and say I want to cook him breakfast and am being affectionate, but he’s kind of distant. We’re just hanging out, not doing much but talking, I showed him videos I thought he’d like and he was laughing, and I started taking things out of the fridge for breakfast. We’re just talking then all of a sudden he has his headphones on and he’s talking to his friend, and they’re starting a co-op game and he’s on mic with him. I ask him if he’s playing with his friends, he says yeah, I said ok. I decide to just cook myself breakfast. He asks if it’s alright that he plays with them and I was kind of upset and just said “whatever”. He’s like are you upset, I’m like yeah I’ve been telling you all this time that I wanted to spend the day with you and I turn around for one second and you’re playing with your friends, committing yourself to a game (they aren’t quick). It’s like this most days of the week, he plays with them for hours. He says he can quit the game but I say I don’t want to hang out anymore, just play with your friends.

I said that because I don’t really want to force him to hang out with me, it felt like wanting to hang out was only on my end, and I was just sad about it. He always says he’d prioritize me over games but when it comes down to it I don’t think he does. So I just went into the other room and watched movies and ate my food, he spent the whole day with his friends.

Later on I’m getting ready for the big event and I’m still upset and he’s asking me if I’m just going to have an attitude the whole day. I said it just upset me that I’ve been talking about spending the day together all this time and he goes straight to playing with his friends that he’s spent most of the week with already. He says well you could’ve said something, I said I just wanted to feel like you wanted to spend time with me too. While we were having this conversation I was getting ready for the work party. He tells me he doesn’t even want to go with me, because I’m being a bitch to him for no reason, because I should’ve just told him to get off the game and spend time with me. I didn’t want to do that, I just wanted to feel wanted.

At this point I just leave again and go to our bedroom and lay there, if he isn’t going I can’t go because we paid $120 for the tickets and I’d be the only one without a spouse, and also I was just sad and didn’t want to have to explain an empty seat.

He comes and tells me that he thinks I’m like this because I have no friends, and that he isn’t saying it to be mean, but just that I dump all my stuff on him because he’s the only person I have in my life, and that it’s too much. And that I don’t understand what it’s like to have friends and want to hang out with them. Which is true, but it just made me more depressed at the moment, because I wanted to try to make friends at the big event. I just felt like the biggest loser in the world. Plus I don’t discourage him from seeing his friends except for when we’ve barely been seeing each other. We’ve also had fights because he sometimes says he’ll be home at like 11pm and I’ll be waiting for him and he’ll be having so much fun, which I think is great, but I tell him I’d like to get a text if his plans change and he’s going to stay out until 5am, so I’m not waiting for him. Not that he can’t be out, just I’d like to know. He says this is crazy and that he shouldn’t have to report to anyone.

The rest of the night he was unsure of whether he should break up with me, and asking if he was an idiot for being with me. But he said he wanted to be with me but that the social thing was just too much.

Since I went through some traumatic things around puberty I’ve had a pretty boring, depressive, personality and no one has ever been interested in becoming my friend, understandably. I don’t push it with people, I don’t want to force myself upon people who don’t like me. People usually don’t find my sense of humor funny and I don’t really find other people’s jokes funny most of the time but I laugh out of politeness. I have a stutter, nervous blinking thing, and randomly shake in social situations out of fear, because I’m such a failure in them. The people I do find funny I can’t really become friends with, because I’m not funny on their level, I don’t have a quick wit.

My boyfriend is my only friend and the only person who laughs at my jokes and gets me, but he says it’s stressful because he’s the only person I go to and it’s too much for him, which I get. But honestly, I’m 25 and have been trying to make friends my whole life to no avail. People used to make fun of me as a kid saying no one would ever want to hang out with me because I sucked that bad. He keeps telling me, you know there are other people you can go to and use as a social outlet, but I have been trying and I have no idea how to do that or I would’ve done it already.

Things I have tried:

1. Therapy
2. Toastmasters for 2 months.
3. Going to facebook events for stuff I’m interested in
4. Saying yes to all social events at work and through toastmasters, which at the time was a party every or every other weekend
5. Reading and doing exercises related to the book how to win friends and influence people
6. Watching YouTube tutorials on how to make people laugh, be funny. I only found a few and none of them were any use, if there are better ones out there I’d like to know.

Is there anything that stands out that I can do? If I sound batshit insane I’d appreciate if you could point out in what way and how I could productively stop being that way, because if I don’t understand why I can’t do anything about it.",18Mar2018,58
171,"Apologies in advance for the jumbled thoughts.

I've been with this girl for about 5 years; on again off again type thing. The two years of our relationship was marred by snooping on her part. She looked through everything: my phone, my facebook messages, my internet history. Things would come up that I did years before we'd met because she had looked so deep, and I would get yelled at for hours (stretching into weeks) due to them. It turned really toxic because of that. She had an issue with me looking at porn, and if my 'History' tab showed in my browser history, she'd freak out and assume that I was looking at porn. 

We broke up for a few months (still hooking up occasionally, saying 'I love you,' 'you're my soulmate,' etc), then got back together. A few weeks into this round, she got drunk and made out with this dude at a party. I was pretty pissed, but decided ultimately we could work through it. I kind of exuded disappointment for a week but then moved on. It came up a few times throughout the next few months, but when it did, she would tell me I wasn't allowed to bring that up, it wasn't fair, to be with her I needed to forget that happened, etc. Then she broke up with me a few months later because we weren't moving fast enough. She wanted to move in together essentially, but I'm kind of wanting to take it slow since last time the snooping issues didn't come up until a few months into it.

We got back together a few months into the fall because some very dramatic events put us into each other's lives again, but it didn't last long. Then near the beginning of this year, we started hanging out. Nothing's official, but we're basically doing all of the relationship type of stuff except there's no label; we've both decided to be exclusive with each other for the time being.

Now my question is am I just fooling myself. Will this ever work out? Do the on again off again things level out eventually, or are the barriers up front too much to handle?

I know it may have been years ago, but the toxic invasion of privacy from years ago still affects my mindset with her. I have no secrets, I have no privacy as far as foundational stuff in my life. She knows EVERYTHING. The cheating thing still makes me uncomfortable when she goes out. Largely because she has said multiple times she was going to change her relationship with alcohol, and she hasn't. I don't think she's a bad person for wanting to go out and get drunk, but I don't know if I have the mental fortitude to stand that knowing she tours with her band and drinks at bars, does coke, and blacks out sometimes multiple nights a week.

Do these things level out? Is history greater than issues? I can't really tell the difference in a material issue and a superficial one.

Just looking for a little guidance regarding these items.

172,"So, this is weird. I don’t know where to start. 
This discussion has come up a lot in my relationship &amp; even with my counsellor, but I have no hobbies or passion. 

I mean I have *interests* I enjoy reading, movies, drives, the beach, cooking, photography, the gym, concerts, etc. But I don’t do them. I can’t make myself do them. I am bored and kinda sad all the time. 

This isn’t a phase I’ve come to learn as of this morning. This has been going 15 years strong. I heavily rely on other people to entertain me. I get sad when I can’t socialize or find a friend to spend the day with. Sometimes, even a little angry if I keep asking every friend I have for many days or weeks on end. For the last two years, I’ve lived several hours away from my friends &amp; family so I have had a lot of ‘ME’ time that isn’t turning out so great. Making plans to see friends has become more difficult and frustrating because of the distance, and not having many friends where I am now. 

But I realized, I have no joy in hobbies or my interests. I bought a new dslr, but can’t motivate or entice myself enough to go outside and photograph things and come home and learn photoshop on the new laptop I got to edit photos. I like to read, bought some books, can’t get past the first page. Think about going to the gym, then think nah no energy/boring/etc. I look up recipes then find no desire to make them. If I do, I get bored halfway through the kitchen process and the recipe suffers or it does well but I don’t make anything else cause that was enough and wasn’t as fun as I’d hoped. I fall asleep in movie theatres and pause movies/get bored at home when I try that way. If I find a concert, have no one to go with or the day comes, I talk myself out of wanting to go. I can’t give myself joy or something? 

I wanted to be a writer my whole life. So, I used to write. Now? It’s constant writers block now, or after 5 mins my creative spark is blown and I don’t feel like continuing. 

So every day I wake up with this list of ideas in my head from the night before of how I will fill the next day. Instead I wake up, lay around unmotivated, clean the house and do dishes/laundry, find all of thats done and lay around staring at nothing or checking reddit or doing activities for a max of 5 mins before I lose interest. I take a lot of naps cus I’m bored and have nothing to do. But there are things to do why can’t I do them? 

My S/O tried to get me into gardening and interior design and renos and wood working and none of it has interested me. I feel like the only person who just has nothing they truly are passionate or care about or do. 

My one friend has horses. If you know a horse person you get that sentence immediately. Another is into fitness and body building. Another paints and does art and spends all their free time doing that. Another is into sports. Watching it live or on tv, or playing it. All the time! A few friends live for Roller Derby or dance. Another is into makeup and I see her doing cool looks daily, just because she enjoys doing makeup for fun.

174,"So I missed a week of college last week (came back on Wednesday night) and I spent Thursday and Friday working my ass off to catch up. I'm caught up, and have a couple of bits I need to complete, but I like to save some stuff for mid-week so I don't get bored between lectures/lessons.

I am a fully independent male, and even though I live with my parents I look after myself (washing clothes, making my own dinner etc) and I am an adult. Despite this I can't stop my fucking mum from nagging me to do my college work, even though I have completed what I wanted to do and am not behind.

This is really pissing me off, and I've had a couple of arguments over Saturday/today about this, yet still she nags me to do something. I'm about to fucking leave and stay with my friend, but obviously that's something I would rather not do.

Any advice?",18Mar2018,3
176,"I want to cut down this post length by abbreviating a few things.

K = my friends ex girlfriend and my current girlfriend
E = my friends current girlfriend

My friend brings K out drinking with us one day and I became interested in her. Here I had met K for the first time, decided to go up and talk to her, and we hit it off immediately. My friend and K had a 1 year or so long relationship in the past, and even lived together. They had bickered and fought a lot, so they decided to keep their relationship as just friends. I never knew who K was during this time, and barely even knew she existed. I had asked my friend if it was ok to pursue K and he said he encouraged it because he felt that we would work really well together.

Going into this I was never really bothered by the fact that they had dated in the past, given that it happened so long ago (2 years ago) and my friend is currently in a committed relationship with E. 

6 months ago my friend went on a huge trip to Europe, and broke up with E temporarily. K visited my friend in Europe for a small part of the trip. I found out recently that my friend was pushing K for sex the entire time but she consistently refused because she has no interest in him. K says they had made out twice during this time and that’s it. K comes back to the USA, and shortly after my friend comes home from his trip. They hang out and catch up a bit, and end up having sex. K says that the sex was very bad and she has zero feelings for him, and that they had sex simply because she had not have had sex in a while. My friend gets back together with E and, as he has expressed to me before,  is absolutely enamored by E. 

It is not until a month later that I meet K for the first time and hit it off with her really well. We dated for about a month before making things exclusive. We have now been official for about another month and are pretty serious about each other, having already met all of my other friend circles, met each other’s families, and started a band together. 

This new information has begun to make me feel really jealous, and very bothered. Given that this is a pretty fresh relationship, I’m not sure if me breaking up with her is the right decision, because we have a really good relationship so far and I don’t want to get caught up in feelings of jealousy. I realize that all of this happened before we started dating and that it would be wrong for me to judge her or not trust her because of this. She has made it clear to me that she is only interested and dedicated in seeing me, and that she has not had feelings for my friend for a very long time, and that the sex a month ago had nothing to do with their previous relationship. K assures me that she will never hang out with my friend 1 on 1 ever again as long as she’s with me. 

I can’t help but feel a pit in my stomach over this. I can’t tell if I’m making a big deal out of nothing or that this is a viable reason to consider breaking things off so early. I just wanted to ask if anyone has been in a similar situation, and if it’s not a case of “it was in the past, before you started dating, just let it go” what would be the most appropriate way in handling this. 

TL;DR Current girlfriend of 1 month dated my friend 2 years ago, was never bothered by it until I found out they had sex a month before we started talking. Me and girlfriend are crazy about each other and my friend also currently in a serious relationship",18Mar2018,3

- I’m currently 17 years old, but when I was 12 I had a friend who was my previous best friend- we were really close and stuff. When we went on a school trip I decided to hang out with my other friend (she was on her own and we were in the same class) whilst my best friend sat with her sister. I thought everything was good till I got a note passed to me calling me a terrible person and how I abandoned her, there was also a lot of name calling- she also continued this and refused to listen to any of my explanations. this is what sparked (this was not the only thing put plates a major factor) in my issues with mental health.

5 years later I’m in a much better place, I cut my ties with her, spent some lonely months on my own but in the end managed to find a loving group of friends who I treasure dearly. Yesterday morning I wake up to multiple dms in instagram from her, my insta account is private, so it was repeatedly requesting for her to follow me, I refused each time. But she’s persistent and that scares me. So I get DMs saying that I’m not worth it, that I don’t look at her in the eye (I’ve tried to be on a friendly term but she refuses to speak to me) and that she repeatedly asked if it was me (she knows it is) should I block her?? I’m afraid that it will lead into something bad, but I don’t want to be in the place I was in 5 years ago.

I haven't moved out because of financial reasons and because honestly I am scred to totally lose the relationship...I know sad. I have never had many close friends, and I honestly think he's the closest relationship I have ever had besides for my parents. I also love my neighbors because they have been good friends, even though they are closer to him. I am very quiet and it's hard for me to get to know people. I currently work at a vet hospital as a kennel technican and make $10 a hour at 35 hours. I make about $550 every two weeks after taxes. I have found a house to share with 3 other people but the rent is $540 with utilities, $240 to move in.  I have a large dog, so it's been difficult to find many places to move in to
 I have been used to paying about $400 with utilities, already spending most of my income. I have about $1800 saved up now. Should I try to move in to the house and hope to find a better paying job soon? Or should I just move home with my parents, who lives an hour away from my job and friends?

196,"Please help me out here, this might be the biggest realization I've ever had in my life. I'm new to this sub. I'm a 20F, in a southeast asian country, in my 3rd year of college, and still living with my parents. Dad worked overseas his whole life so I only get to spend a couple months each year with him, so we aren't really close. But we're on good terms.

Mom

* says I have to tell her everything and not keep secrets from her

* in high school she wouldn't allow me to commute on my own. I lived 1 hr 30 min from my high school. I had to be fetched by a sort-of school bus everyday.

* still wouldn't allow me to date, for she believes in ""courting"". She is so traditional. You know, says i have to bring the guy home and she has to meet the guy first and make sure he accompanies me when i commute home before I can call them my boyfriend.

* used to look at my phone messages back in 6th grade- 1st year high school. I was flirting with this guy and she got mad at me when she borrowed my phone and discovered our messages.

* Would freak out if I don't go home on time. Ffs I'm in college now (not living in a dorm unfortunately, travel time from uni to my house is 1 hr 30 min), and every time I have an impromptu meetup with one of my friends who live in a dorm/actually anyone who lives 2 hours away, and come 8 pm I'm still not home, she'd bombard my phone with text messages and if i don't reply, she will call me. Upon calling, (this has happened a couple of times before) she'll SHOUT and it was so embarrassing because my phone (~7 years old, basically really old, has a lot of problems) only receives calls on loudspeaker and whoever i'm with, will hear her nagging, asking me where tf i am and why I didn't tell her where i was going and i could end up dead or lost or whatever with her not knowing where to find me. Then I had to cut short the meeting with my few friends (only have like a couple of friends throughout hs to college) abruptly and she said they'd HAVE to accompany me to the nearest loading station so that i'd be safe, etc.

* When I finally get home at around 9 pm she'll talk nonstop about how I should text her where i am all the time, etc. How I couldn't understand because i don't know what it's like to have a child, ""especially a female child"", YEAH MOM BECAUSE I AM TOO HELPLESS TO TRAVEL ALONE, How I made her look stupid because she's been worrying all night where i am, TO BE CLEAR I DIDN'T WANT TO TEXT HER MY CURRENT LOCATION EVERYTIME I GO TO MY FRIENDS' PLACE BECAUSE I KNOW 100% SHE'LL JUST TELL ME IMMEDIATELY TO GO HOME OR THREATEN TO GO THERE HERSELF TO FETCH ME
Checks my grades every semester to make sure I'm not failing
Would treat my virginity as her virginity. Like, would always accuse me of being ""Easy to get"" or something like that every time she senses that I must be talking to a guy. She believes in courting first before dating. Thankfully i've had a couple romantic and sexual experiences in the past (kept secret) or else i'll still be clueless on how relationships work @ 20.

* Would not let me lock my bedroom door

* (this is for my younger sister, 12 F) she is in 6th grade currently, a couple months ago she and her group of friends decided to go out and eat at this nearby ice cream parlor near the school. Mom wouldn't allow sister to go by herself and literally stayed in the same table as the group of friends to watch her. I was there also and i feel sorry for my sister.

* also wouldn't let my younger sister join a girl scout camping on her own. She accompanied my younger sister camping in the campsite (she was 12 and in 6th grade) because ""she has mild case of epilepsy"" and would be afraid if anything happens to her

I really want to move out but I have yet to look for a job. I only have ~1 year of college left before i graduate and even then I think i still won't be able to move out of the country away from my parents because of my scholarship that i availed. Basically in exchange for the 4 years that I availed the scholarship, I must work 4 years in the country before I can work abroad.

* would be friends with me on facebook and would basically tag me in every post/pictures whether it be in a family gathering, eating in a restaurant, etc.

In past couple of days my dad started like that guy that feels that he has to prove himself in the crew so he constantly picks on the weakest guy is mean to him.


He started talking like he's not my dad but some guy from my school, it's weird and it's really rude.


Yesterday i showed him some stuff on youtube and she started telling me that i watch idiots (i didn't show him anything stupid or something or any ""angry gamers"" or shit like that). While we were watching the movie i complained that characters are really unlikable and he started telling me to shut up and that i'm annoying. He did this throughout the day. Every time i showed him something i played on guitar he made a face except when i played sweet fucking home alabama. I know i'm not that bad, i recorded myself playing and listened to it to make sure.


I don't know if he's trying to act ""cool"" or some shit because when i talk to him or am in the same room with him i feel the same way when i am i sit close to one of those ""popular kids"" that are rude and are constantly trying to maintain dominance by bullying other people.


I was improvising on guitar and he told me angrily to open, i opened and he wasn't looking angry but he said ""first of all you better quiet your playing down, second of all this sounds absolutely horrible"" I watched him in confusion because he never just came in and told me my playing is horrible. He started explaining how shit i am and started talking about stuff about music he has no idea about and then said again that it sounds awful. I told him ""okay, even though i didn't ask you for your opinion"" to which he got really offended.


Seriously, what's this shit about? Even if i am horrible you don't fucking get into your son's room and straight out tell him that.


He never acted like this before, it seriously feels like i am living with a spoiled ""cool kid"". It's not really my playing, it's everything, he just started acting and talking like he's 14 or something. He acts like that only towards me and it's just a weird vibe being in the same house as him for the last couple of days. 


Edit: i said ""i didn't ask for your opinion"" after he told me i was horrible because i was getting really demotivated and annoyed at him for acting that way, i don't usually say stuff like that to my parents",18Mar2018,8

We have been looking for places together to let together with a few others to move in end of August but slowly we have lost various potential groups of people to live with though various circumstance and her mother has recently expressed that she feels we shouldn't move in together (as far as I know this isn't personal). We are now out of people to join and live with, even for just a single room in a house with friends. Should a room such as this come up of course, there will be no hesitation in taking it so she's not having to build new relationships or live alone in her 3rd year of University. In this event, I myself will find somewhere else. 

I was hoping someone could give some advice on the situation; should we just bite the bullet and move in together with random people knowing that more people think we shouldn't move in together than people that think we should?
There is also a risk of the relationship between myself and her mother, up until this point we have been on great terms and as far as I know that hasn't changed, we're just unsure how to approach this situation. 

Thank you.

P.s. this may seem like a silly situation as a lot of people would just say ""find a house share, you can't always pick who you live with"", but I care deeply for her and I have noticed social anxiety in her and when things go wrong she has a involuntary habit of keeping it to herself and not standing up for herself, at least with her friends she is in a comfortable environment where she can express concerns etc. ",18Mar2018,2
202,"Hey reddit,

I'm an incredibly heavy sleeper, and it's starting to affect my life in negative ways. I sleep right through my phone alarms regardless of the tone, I've slept through three different radio alarms, and anybody who tries to wake me up typically has to try very hard to do so.

Every night my body decides how long I need to sleep, and refuses to get up earlier than that. I have tried to get to bed earlier than usual, but it only inconsistently works. Even sleeping as early as 10 PM, I can and have slept thru to 9-10 Am. Unfortunately I can't attempt this often because my work schedule pushes me into night shifts, ending around 10-11 PM, and it isn't uncommon for me to have to come in the following morning at 8. Some have suggested naps, but I'm incapable of taking them; sleeping for any intended amount of time results in sleeping a full 7-9 hours.

This in particular is an issue, and I'm becoming too dependent on other people waking me up in order to get onto a schedule. I'm likely going to be living in a dorm room soon and it's going to entirely be on me to wake up, and I don't want to miss any more work or class.

What can I do to improve my ability to wake up on time?

204,"You could say that I'm in a bit of a (quarter-life) crisis. Every story I hear about extraordinary scientists, writers and artists points out how they were either a genius or started very early on or had a brilliant idea at some point. I'm neither of these - although parents/teachers/professors have praised me for intelligence/giftedness (and an IQ test agrees if you care for that kind of numerical estimate), I don't feel like I'm particularly smart. There's so much to learn and know in the world and I barely know the tiniest fraction! I'm onto my second master's degree, likely to start a PhD soon, but don't feel that I've contributed anything substantial to the world yet. I write passionately, but my skills don't seem ""good enough"" to me and neither do my ideas. I hear people sing praises of the extraordinary genius of many scientists and great writers - and can't help but wonder if that's something I will always lack, that you can be quite good with practice but that the last step to making a great invention, writing a masterpiece or advancing science is always the spark of genius. And that it manifests early, that you have to be faster at everything than the rest. I have to study for my exams, have to read things two or three times to understand or memorize and I'm curious about everything but fear I can't ever do everything I want in life anyways. I read like crazy, research outside of my fields, teach myself skills that fascinate me (tried programming and physics recently!) but I don't know if that matters if I can never make a difference.

So - is there a way for someone who's not stupid but not one in a billion either, who loves learning and is curious but certainly not the brain the world was waiting for, to still uncover a bit more about how our world works, or to at least leave it behind with a new piece of art? Is the solution just ""practice"", or are there things that will still always be beyond me despite working hard?

Most of them are like ""oh my god you're so pretty, cute, gorgeous."" Idk whether I should believe then or if they are just messaging me for shits and giggles. 

Honestly if I were to have sex with a guy, I would probably back out at the last minute.

208,"My phone has an incredible camera. Initially when showing it to a friend, he was impressed by it. I told him that whenever he wants, he can just ask for one from me (this was about 2 months ago). I said this, as he is the type to recognise boundaries. However, he keeps asking whenever we're hanging out and I've probably taken 100s. The thing is, his own camera isn't bad, but he prefers mine. How do I let him know he's ""overstaying his welcome"" ?

my son asked for help from a high school counselor for depression and self harm and was told to leave the school and not come back untill he was seen by a psychologist 3 days later was told needed to deal with this and get him back in school or the where going to call cps and the truant officer unless it was dealt with by the 4th day. I am looking for a group or someone i can talk to in order to fight the school on this policy and the inappropriate way they are dealing with this situation any advice would help he goes to rock hill in ohio

update 
i called about 5 places that same day soonest anyone could see him was 3 weeks. Lucky i have a friend who goes to therapy and her therapist agreed to see him. she said around 35% f teens go threw this depression stress unable to communicate their feeling properly all lead to this. she said you should never make the child feel like they did anything wrong and isolate/punish them which the school did if he had been suicidal it could had lead to something really bad. She feels that he is not a danger to himself or anyone else. the school did not respond to this in a appropriate way they should have never told my son to leave and not come back until they see a therapist he plainly said o i dont want to kill myself or anyone else. to answer some of your other questions its sometimes easier to talk to a counselor or friend then a parent and if you think theres something wrong with our relationship because to spoke to someone who is there to help and talk to you dont have a good idea how kids think and feel.",18Mar2018,168

He's not like that with me.

He is closer with his mother, but he can still call me sometimes. Even when he's at home, he would rather spend time with his mother and sisters as opposed to me and his brother. Even when he was young, he always wanted to be around his sister and her friends, but not his brother and his friends. He's always around women. I want him to start being around men more, and spending time with me and his brother. I think it would be good for him.

215,"(Please help me)

I have been lurking around reddit for a long time now and I have seen various threads about this kind of issue but now I think I really need some advice.

My father works overseas and comes back home every year for 3-4 months. Everything was normal but as of now, I am 19 yrs old and my father has come home for this year. At first, I thought it was okay, all these hugging and kissing because I thought that he was just doing fatherly things. (I know, I might be paranoid about this but please hear me out on this.) He has this habit of asking for hugs and kisses on the cheek every time I get home. At first it seemed fine but now, when he hugs me, he always tries to squeeze into my breasts and when I try to go away from it he always forces me to go back. Many might think that this is just a fatherly act of missing his daughter but some strange things happen now. At one moment I was watching television while laying on my bed, he suddenly entered the room and asked for a kiss. I thought it was fine until he kissed my thigh. I do not know if this is pretty normal for a father but this issue has me scared and uncomfortable of going home. At first I shrugged it off but on another occassion he tried to do it once more but this time I had a blanket on. He removed the blanket and attempted to kiss my thighg again. I put the blanket back on and told him to leave. This has really crept me out ever since. He even attempted a third time but I forcefully refused. I am very uncomfortable about this and I do not know if I would tell my mom and sister about this because I don't want to cause a commotion within the family. I think my sister would believe me but as I am writing this, she is asleep. I think my mom would not believe me and say that he just misses you. I don't know what to do.

My boyfriend told me to ask advice here. He's the only one who knows about it.
This thing has bothered me since I can snoop around my father's phone and sees him having many girls on messenger. 

I am now here, asking for advice on what should I do next. I would gladly refrain from contacting the officials because I think I can settle it with my Mom and Sister but if it gets worse, I'm thinking of calling the officials on this matter. Thank you.",18Mar2018,3
216,"Last night my girlfriend became very upset with me and almost broke up with me because I was drinking. I never thought I had a drinking problem, because I have learned my limits with alcohol and while I have had some very bad times with it, I have had way more enjoyable times. My girlfriend claims that I cannot stay away from alcohol and that I do have a problem. The two times we were together and drunk went badly. The first time I went into a drunken rage, tossing a bench, but due to something with my mother and I did not harm nor verbally abuse my girlfriend in any way. The second time we were drunk together, she started talking about one of her exes in front of me and it made me very upset. She claims I was yelling at her, pushing her away and being borderline abusive in response to her. Our friends that were there at the same time of this event said I did no such thing except have an attitude about it with her and I refused her help while I was laying on the bathroom floor, but I have her the benefit of the doubt. Another incident while I was drinking happened while she was away at a concert. She called me while I was intoxicated and told me that she was leaving me for one of the performers. I stupidly reacted and got mad and even threw my phone into a lake. I also ripped a newsstand out of brick at my school because of my rage. I have stopped drinking in front of her since then. She was at home and I was back at my dorm from spring break last night. The last time I got drunk before last night was over a month ago, and before that 3 months ago. My dad was an abusive alcoholic and my mom is addicted to opioids, so addiction runs in my family.

220,"Long post ahead:

Ever since I can remember, my mother drank alcohol. It never seemed to be a huge problem because she was loving and was a good mom for most of my childhood and early adolescence. 
It was around the time I turned 15 when my dad left us. He was an OTR truck driver and called one night while he was out and said he wasn’t coming home that weekend. He had found an apartment and he was leaving my mom. We also found out he was seeing another woman (who is now my stepmom and the mother of my half brother). We were both devastated, but my mom took it way worse than I did. She relied on my father as a primary care giver because she didn’t work, and of course, she loved the man. It drove her into a deep depression and her drinking got worse. 
The first time I learned that I could no longer trust my mom was when I turned 18 and was going to enroll into cosmetology school. My grandparents overseas had established a trust fund for me that matured when I turned 18 and since I didn’t have my own bank account yet, they wired the money to my mom’s. My school’s tuition was about $8k and the money they wired over was about $7k. Several months after being there, the owner took me aside and told me I was behind in payments. She showed me an itemized list of payments due and over due that included the initial down payment which turned out to be only $1k. I realized my mom had only put a grand down for my school and stolen the rest from me. I reached out to my dad who became livid when he heard the news. I have never... ever... gotten my mom to actually ADMIT she took the money for herself. The closest I got was her telling me that “it was her money to do with what she wanted to and she had bills to pay”. 

Fast forward 11 or so years (I’m almost 30).

I’m now married, have a new career, and a 4 year old son. Life is pretty good except my mom is still a pain in my side. 

Ever since my dad left her, she’s become dependent on me to hold her hand and help her through life. She won’t do anything to help herself and relies on me entirely to get her through tough situations in life. She’s very depressed (as am I - I’m bipolar and see a therapist and am on medications that really help me), drinks a ton, has no friends or family left, and works at a chicken coop 6 days a week. 

I’ve developed an alcohol dependency myself and a few times I’ve tried quitting for periods of time and told her to not bring hers over. She respects it for a few days, but eventually starts doing it anyway. She was babysitting our son for the hour or two between when my husband goes to work and I was still at work and she’d being it over and drink a whole bottle before I got there. It created a lot of tension between her and my husband. He has recently changed his work schedule so that he goes in later and can wait for me to get home, therefore cutting my mom out of the equation completely. She would complain about not spending enough time for herself at home and having to spend so much time at our place. Several times I told her we could find other arrangements but she declined so I’m left unsure and confused by what she wants. 
There were several times when I would try and tell her about people out there who could help her if she’s feeling depressed. But once again, she expected me to do all the work for her and I’ve set boundaries that I’m not willing to do that. There are a lot of times when she calls, completely drunk, crying, and complaining to me about her problems. It’s just so stressful having to deal with that. I should be the one going to her for advice, not the other way around. I’ve never been able to do that though (if anything I go to my MIL instead). 

Most recently my mom betrayed my trust again by telling her coworkers (people she talks shit about and says she hates) something extremely personal that I recently went through. She told me she did it. I was mortified and absolutely irate. She never once apologized and to this day acts like nothing even happened. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. She’s 60 with the mind of a child and I can’t deal with it anymore. I love her and just want her to be happy, but it doesn’t look like that’s happening anytime soon. I’m so stressed whenever I talk to her and after I get off the phone, I’m immediately in a sour mood.

I have done Sex at 17 with a Prostitute, she told me that you will never have a gf cause I am not beautiful. What I like is her brutal honesty, but I understood as you won’t get hookups, my friend understood as she didn’t like me physically, I feel like people don’t like the way I act or react to situations. 

Same happened again And again. I only got once to my life where I knew more about my friends but she refused an open relation with me. 

 I also hate women who always mentions why I don’t have a gf or that I need to search, If I found someone I like I might get interested (people seem to be the same everywhere). 
I can’t even do hookups since this day (honestly only one that I was really lucky) 

Judging my experiences with dating, it seems to me like I only dated girls that were slutty and lasted 2 weeks nothing more and maximum 3 months as friends. And as for trying to get a girl, I always end up checking a girl that already has a bf or even two who had a husband

I wonder why I always look for the chick who has a bf, maybe I found them responsible more than single ones or maybe more experienced or I can’t tell honestly ? 

Honestly I just like to know how you guys if you are not single how and where you met your partner and if a female reading this, on what basis you choose to crush on a guy.

225,"I told this guy that I liked him, he said he had similar feelings. However when it came down to me asking if he would like to just stay friends or try something more after hanging out once alone, he said he just wanted to keep hanging out and see where it goes, take it slow, and that if a romantic relationship happens, it happens.

We've hung out alone 2 times since then and once with a group, and nothing has really happened besides just being friendly with each other. He does pay for meals, but other than that nothing suggesting being more than friends, but then again I haven't really done anything to show more than friendship either. 

Prom is less than a month away, and I would like to ask him in person. Problem is, the past two weekends he has had stuff going on, so he hasn't been able to hang out. And given the unique situation, I don't want to freak him out because he said he wanted to take it slow. 

So my idea was just to ask him in between classes, but I'm not  really sure this is the best idea. I would have to say something like ""Hey, would you like to go to prom with me? You don't have to answer now, just take time to think about it."" Because I'll have to rush to my next class. 

TL;DR
Guy friend and I have feelings for each other, but aren't dating because guy friend wants to take things slow/see if it happens while we keep hanging out. Would like to ask him to prom, but can't really do it completely alone because he's been pretty busy recently. I could ask him in between classes, but am not sure if that's the best idea given the situation/short time to ask.

Since then I’m constantly questioning myself if I should continue with what I’m doing and what is good for me. I’m far from happy with my studies at the moment and made the decision to start an undergraduate in history next September, something what interested me since I was young. I feel a continuous pressure from my parents to carry on with my current studies because what they say it gives me a high job-guarantee (which is true compared to history). Something that scares me of the most right now is continuing with my studies and getting a job as soon as I get a degree and having to work for the rest of my life. Something I want to prevent at all costs, but something I feel as an expectation of society and my parents in particular.

234,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I literally just made this account to ask this advice because everyone else in my life would be biased. Also, posting on mobile so formatting will probably suck, and there's a TLDR at the end. 

So it's gonna be a long one because I hope to get the depth of my indecision across. 

Basically, I was in a not a confirmed relationship with a man who I deeply cared about. He was my first sexual partner and we were friends before we ever crossed into a possible romance, and being with him was easy, and fun, and it felt right. 

It wasn't always easy, of course, because all relationships take work. I couldn't ever say I was actually dating him because that would mean announcing that to my family and dealing with them. I was also planning on leaving the state and/or country in about a year no matter what, so I didn't really feel comfortable committing to someone just to leave them. And he had a bad habit of being a little clingy and jealous when I mentioned the other men in my life. But we communicated well and worked out those things best we could. 

So, you know. It was really good in the beginning. Like, we went on family vacations together and saw each other two or three times a week. My family and friends liked him, his family and friends liked me. The sex was amazing, and fun, and really easy and natural. Never had bad sex with him actually; all our kinks pretty much lined up. 

And then, like I'd been planning for two years, I moved away. We tried the whole long distance thing, and pretty much that's where we imploded.

For about a month, it was okay. Difficult and we missed each other but we made it work. But then, as things are want to do, it changed. 

Some of the rules I'd set down were ignored. I'd already told him I couldn't text him during work; that it wasn't appropriate and I wouldn't actually get anything done if I was only paying attention to my phone, and he respected that. But suddenly, now that I was across the country, he needed to hear from me all the time, ALL THE TIME. Like, if I didn't get back to him in an hour, it would be another two or three increasingly pissy texts. And after work it was basically a phone call fight about why I was ignoring him.

I also had to talk him down daily about the new friends I was making. About 50% of them were other men, and all those jealousy issues he had were brought to forefront. He was constantly questioning my friendships with them and trying to catch me lying/cheating. 

It didn't help that my sex drive basically plummeted. As it turns out, and I had no idea that if I'm not actively having sex with someone on a nearly tri-weekly basis, I pretty much camel it and never get aroused after about a week or two. I did what I could, sexting, naked facetiming, etc, but I'm sure he spent days wondering why I was no longer really into it. 

After two months of basically fighting during every conversation, I called it quits. It wasn't easy, and I was pretty torn up about it, but I was also trying to start a new life in a new place and wasn't really juggling all of it very well. 

A week later, he calls me and asks if I would let him into my apartment if he was outside. Turns out, he was! He stayed a week with me, unplanned and unannounced, and we had sex, even though I assured him, several times that his being there changed nothing and we weren't getting back together. I AM a horndog, and I did really care about him. 

But, the problem was, we weren't so careful about protection. I stopped taking the pill because the state I moved into had some more strict rules I was working around, and I didn't really have a doctor here, and my health insurance at my new job didn't cover it like the old job used to. He didn't bring a condom because he 'didn't want to assume anything'. 

You see where this is going. I got pregnant. I needed an abortion. There are days when I can barely take care of myself, mentally, financially, emotionally, and I don't think I could be responsible for another human being. I would probably have gotten help from him and our families but there would have also been heavy pressure to get married. I also didn't want to raise a child that I might resent because I would've given up my entire dream and life goal to raise it. Doesn't really matter why I got the abortion, I've already had it. 

Here's where my real dilemma begins. He was really torn up that he'd knocked me up, and the subsequent abortion because he knew how it would affect me, mentally and emotionally, and he paid for it, too. I was completely awful to him though. I said a lot of things I didn't mean, and it basically boiled down to: you are a selfish asshole, I hate you, lose my number. 

In my defense, I was not in a healthy place. I was struggling with the move and building a new life, financially and socially. I was trying to overcome my mental health issues. I was angry and guilty about the abortion  and really really sad and scared. I felt like I'd been taken advantage of and (whether it's reality or my mental health) almost manipulated into that situation because he knew about all these previously mentioned things, and also my general need to please the men in my life due to childhood trauma. He was also always in charge of bringing a condom in our previous sexual history and since I literally had no idea he was gonna show up, it was his responsibility to come prepared. 

But logically, especially now, I understand, it takes two to tango and I could've said no to him at any point. He never forced himself on me and I pretty much consented. I also realize now that he was also pretty upset and confused and hurt and was also doing his best. 

So now, I'm feeling like I want to reach out and apologize for how I reacted to the whole situation. It's been a year and I've been celibate and single and basically unable to move on. My best friend says I owe him nothing, that he used his knowledge of me, my unstable and lonely situation, and the force of his physical presence to pressure me into sex. Part of me agrees with her because that's how I felt then, and how I sort feel now, but another part of me, still probably feels very close to him and worries that I can't move on without closure, without knowing if he's moved on. 

So. Do I reach out and clear my conscious, possibly forcing myself to feel more guilty about the abortion and subsequent fallout and giving him a chance to come back into my life? OR do I power through this inability to move forward and start something that I'm possibly not ready for? 

TL;DR: had a great relationship until long distance ruined it, got pregnant had an abortion, felt manipulated into the sex but feel awful about how I treated him. Do I apologize for treating him like shit in order to move on even though I feel like he doesn't deserve it? OR do I start something new I may not be ready for? ",18Mar2018,1
235,"Sorry for potential grammatical errors, not my native language.
So, let’s begin. I can never express my actual feeling to people that I love/that love me. I’m a pathological liar and spend a lot of time just thinking to myself what I want to say, but never actually end up saying. 
I believe that this should be contributed to my rough childhood. Our dad left us, mom is an alcoholic, and my older brother used to be abusive. Because of that I always feared saying something wrong to anger my brother. I never liked showing off things that I worked on (like drawings and such) or liked, to essentially my only friend (my brother) until I was old enough to go to school. 
I still to this day lie on a daily basis and never express my deepest fears and feeling to anyone that I actually care about and just vent in to the abyss, just like I’m doing right now, but this time I’m actually seeking help. What can I do, how do I increase my self-esteem, stop lying and opening up to people?

236,"I'm sorry if this gets big, but I'm so lost and I hope you can help me. I'll add a tl;dr at the end so you can skip this madness.

I was always really shy but when I was little I still could do the things I liked and enjoyed. I sang in the school choir, in the church choir (I love singing), I danced and was involved in several activities in church.

But then middle school broke me. Other kids started bullying me because 1) I have glasses, 2) my teeth were crooked and had an overbite, 3) had (still have) a lot of hair in my legs and body and 4) didn't have much money so my clothes were handouts from my cousins and a lot didn't fit well. At that time I grew overly conscious of my body (adolescence didn't help) and I started to try to hide myself and my feelings, so others wouldn't mock me.

Things didn't get better in highschool, since a lot of my classmates were from middle school. I wasn't that bad physically (only had the overbite) but I had become really shy and withdraw. It came to the point where I was nervous just to share my favorite bands.

When I went to university things got slightly better. I stayed in my city because of money, but I got to know new people and a group of 4 friends (all guys) that (I thought) liked me. I spent the university years quite content yet I couldn't really relate with others very well because I felt I couldn't ""show"" the real me. Because of this all interactions I had were meaningless and people quickly got bored of me because I don't have a personality.

In conclusion, all that bullying made me shy, nervous, anxious and I can't even talk with people right. Now I'm 26yo, almost 27 and 1) I have no job nor experience, 2) no car license, 3) no life prospects, 4) live with parents and grandma. I barely leave my house anymore, staying weeks in (unless my grandma needs to go to the hospital/get meds), I have no friends, I have no skills and I'm not even sure I chose the right course because I don't know if I want to be a biochemist anymore. Therapist is a no, because I have no money and here it's either paying or waiting 3 years for a doctor.

I don't know what to do. I thought about trying theatre to overcome the shyness but I feel I won't be able to do it. How do I overcome this? Any idea please

237,"Hey Reddit!

So a little context. I am in my mid twenties and I'm an English teacher. I got pretty good grades throughout school and university (not excellent, but pretty good) I have a great group of friends, a good social life and I like the way I look. 

My problem is that professionally I am and have always been wracked with self doubt. In almost every job I've ever had I've felt incredibly nervous, as if at any second somebody is going to find out I'm completely incompetent. It doesn't matter if I've been waiting tables or teaching grammar, I feel like deep down I'm just not smart or capable enough.

It's a really crippling insecurity to the point where I think it effects my performance because it's blatantly obvious I'm not confident in myself. It kills me because I'm a generally happy in my own skin kind of person, I know I'm far from perfect, but I always thought I knew who I am and I didn't need to seek reassurance from others. 

I guess what I'm asking is how do other people do it? How do you find inner strength to tell yourself that you are good enough? ",18Mar2018,2
238,"My fiancé (I’ll call him X) doesn’t have a super great relationship with his father (I’ll call him Y), but by not inviting him to the wedding, we’re worried we’ll permanently sever our ties with that side of his family.

X was raised mostly by his mother, but for a period of time (age 1-8) Y had partial custody. Y lost custody because of neglect and drug abuse, and X remembers periods of physical abuse as well.

Later on, X’s aunt accused Y of raping her when she was 16 (X would have been around 1 year old), and Y moved out of state. Y never had to stand trial, and never admitted to any of the allegations against him.

After college, X moved to live with Y for a short period of time to attempt to repair their relationship, with mixed success. Y was manipulative and made false accusations against X’s mother, and also denied neglecting or abusing X when he was younger. X ended up moving back home and more or less ending the contact between X and Y. After we got engaged, X briefly reached out to Y, but that didn’t really help their relationship at all.

X’s mom doesn’t want Y at the wedding because of X’s aunt having to see Y (and because Y currently owes over 20k in unpaid child support).

At this point, we aren’t even sure if Y would come to the wedding, or if it’s worth inviting him, but X &amp; I aren’t sure what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated! Our wedding is in May, and we have sent out invites to everyone except Y &amp; Y’s wife/young son.",18Mar2018,4

So I want to be more social at school. The problem is, I go to school in a place where people smoke and drink A LOT and are addicts and very unhealthy about it.

244,"Hey, guys. As the title says, I'm sixteen and tired of everything. Caution, rant ahead!

I don't have the attention span to read books anymore. I would regularly shred through at least a dozen books a week in my childhood, but now that I'm older I can barely sit still for an hour, reading in tiny chunks here and there, now and then. The books all sound the same, anyway, nothing new or innovative to take from them.

I've gotten bored of the internet. I spend more time staring at my empty email inbox, contemplating what website to visit next, what game to play, what podcast to listen to, than I do actually reading or playing or listening to anything. And when I do, I quickly find myself bored of it all. Like a cheap thrill, this temporary high you quickly grow tired of. Every news story sounds the same, and I can't find the energy to care about all the plane crashes, terror attacks, and cancer research the world throws at my phone every morning, this constant deluge of information I'm too tired to actually absorb. Today, a shooting. Tomorrow, the Vice President has been caught embezzling funds. The day after that, an exclusive documentary about children in Kathmandu. It doesn't ever end.

At the same time, despite how tired I am of the internet, I can't fathom even an hour without it. I am incapable of so much as using the washroom without texting or scrolling at the same time, and those times I forget to bring my phone I end up reading the labels of soap bottles until I think I'm going crazy.

My family and I travel at least once a year, all over the world, and I've long come to realise that, if you just blink out of focus, a street in Beijing feels like a street in Adelaide feels like a street in Stockholm feels like a street in Toronto. It's all the same, and this romanticism of the foreign isn't all it's cut out to be when every modern city is built the same way, concrete and glass and the same brands of car the world over. The youth act the same, the adults are all just as tired, and there's the same McDonalds down the road. The trees look the same, the kitchen tables look the same, the lakes look the same. No matter where you are, you wake up in the mornings with the same morning light streaming through the window, the same common bird calls and the bustle of cars below.

No landscape is pretty enough to look at unless it's been digitally enhanced, and every historical monument is so riddled with tourists that all I want to do is hide in my hotel room and avoid the crowds.

Food doesn't excite me anymore. I've eaten so much food, and of so many flavours and varieties, that it all just starts to taste the same. Just the thought of going out to eat makes my head hurt. I feel like I've had enough lobster, prepared more ways than I can count, to feed a village forever. All the food cultures of the world just don't cut it for me anymore, and the excitement of being able to order any cuisine from the comfort of my phone has long faded. I hate eating now, I guess. It feels like a chore, this unsatisfying sensory overload of flavours that all just starts to melt together until I can barely distinguish one from the other.

I've slept so much that sleeping feels like a chore, no matter how silky the sheets I buy. There's no enjoyment in cuddling up in bed, especially with my chronic back and neck pain that just makes everything feel achy and gross. Like a constant grey sky, this numb drizzle which peppers the sidewalks and the sky and you forget what sunshine looks like. Sluggish. Being asleep and being awake are the same stripe of tiring, and sleeping often just feels like a continuation of being awake. Dreaming isn't beautiful or blissful anymore, nor is it terrifying. It just is, as routine as brushing my teeth or catching the bus to school.

School is interesting, I guess. I'll be seventeen when I start university next year, and eighteen by my second year. I'll be able to vote, then. I enjoy learning, and research. I fully intend to publish my own academic works as soon as I can, and I recently got a theatre review of mine on the papers. It's exciting, but there's so much down time between projects, results, that I just don't know what to do with myself on weekends without assignments to do. Plus, school is just as boring as it is interesting. No matter how ambitious I am, no matter how much I try to take every assignment to the next level, I just find class boring. I feel under-stimulated, I guess, and I find myself eating in class a lot just to pass the time.

..

..

Wow, that was a lot. 

I guess I just really needed to get that all of my chest, huh? But here we return to the title question: what the fuck do I do about it? I can't make time speed up, I can't put my body on autopilot and only regain control to live through the fun parts. All I feel I can really do is continue living like this, tired of the sensory overload and the sluggishness of time.",18Mar2018,1
245,"I'm 25. Normally, the default response would be ""do what you want, you're a grown man"", but my mother enforces the ""my house my rules"" thing, leaving me no choice.

Whenever I run out of money, I ask my father, but i'm never a fan of doing that since i'm pretty much being a leech.

18:00: A youghurt 

20:00: One slice of bread with slices of banana on it

247,"Ok so I'm not the one being harassed, it's coming from another male coworker. He frequently makes out of place comments, tries to bro down with me and talk about how hot other customers are and the general vibe is that he's really creepy, awkward and makes people uncomfortable. 

He even tries to flirt with the manager who is a 19 year old female (let's call her Sarah) and he's 30 years old (let's call him creep). I was an employee along side her as I witnessed her transition from being a lead cashier to a manager, shes super sweet, kind and very gentle, soft spoken, who doesn't have it in her to confront him despite her explaining to me how uncomfortable she feels. She even asked me how I would get it to stop if I was in her shoes. Hence why I'm asking for advice on how to approach the store manager.

He's pretty good at his job, we're very sales driven and he's like the stores frontman/greeter. He's very enthusiastic and high energy which is exactly what the company is looking for. I don't know if the store manager knows about it, but I don't know how going about doing this.

I've worked there longer and have seniority, I'm also respected and good at my job and know my manager would take me seriously, I just want to know how some of you would word it. I don't want to make over the top claims and get him fired, I really just want the managers to approach him to to tell him it's inappropriate and harassment. 

Examples of things he's said:

Sarah and I talking about sales for the hour while Creep stalks up behind her and flirtatiously says in an exaggerated voice ""how you doing"". He did this twice all within 5 mins apart.

Another cashier was in the booth with me while I see Creep very obviously staring at her butt. When I approach the other cashier she tells me he does it often (she's also 19).

I've heard him talk about how hot some blonde is when she walked in and other similar things.

They don't seem really bad, but it really is his age and how uncomfortable it makes the other girls feel.

253,"For context, I'm 29 and most of what I'm talking about is from when I was a teenager, thirteen/fourteen years ago. 

I used to do community theatre in my home city and there was a guy who kept getting cast in shows that all the kids called ""[Name] the Child Molester."" It wasn't just a general creepy vibe, he actually did things:

* was constantly touching/picking up little kids who clearly didn't want him to

* ""accidentally"" walked into the girls' dressing room many times, and on at least one occasion managed to snap pictures of prepubescent girls changing

* kissed my friend's sister, who was about eleven at the time, on the ear backstage in the middle of a show when she felt like she couldn't scream or make a fuss

* CONSTANTLY taking pictures of everyone without permission and posting them on his website. It was also sort of generally known that he owned a private server. 

Basically every single one of the kids knew he was a complete creep, but the adults dismissed our complaints and said they ""had to"" keep casting him in shows because there weren't enough men around to play the adult male roles otherwise.

I no longer live in this town but still have a lot of friends there who are involved in community theatre, and it's come to my attention that this fucker is STILL getting cast in shows with children.

Now, he never did anything to me and I have no concrete proof of anything, but I'd be willing to bet that he'd fall for one of those FBI ""I'm a twelve-year-old girl looking for action in a chat room"" honeypots and/or that if they looked on that private server, they'd find a child porn stash.  

I'm generally a believer in due process and I wouldn't want to like, hire some vigilante hit man to take this fucker out or anything like that, but I and every other person who interacted with him back then knows there is something very wrong there and it's killing me that people are still working with him. I have told many people about this shit in private messages, but nothing gets done. Nobody wants to rock the boat. Nobody wants to say, ""No, you're a creep and I'm not going to associate with you,"" never mind anything more.

Couple months down the line, now we’re hookups. Every time I see him we end up fucking or doing something sexual. He was my first kiss, took my virginity and he ticks absolutely every box that I could ever want in someone. Every. Single. One. He’s perfect and beautiful and friendly and kind and caring. 

He’s emotionally unavailable and has tons and tons of other girls that he fucks. He knows that I know he fucks other girls, it does hurt a little that he does but we aren’t together so I can’t say anything, y’know.

277,"I'm 36/M and back in school. There are all ages here, but obviously a lot of young people recently out of high school. I've had a couple classes with this one girl (she's 19) and we're currently working on a project together. While we're not exactly going to be close friends outside of school, we are pretty good friends during the school day (just to be clear: this is not a romantic thing. at all). We recently added/followed each other on Facebook and Instagram just as a way to sort of stay connected since we probably won't see each other after this semester.

Here's my question. She has her Snapchat username in her IG bio and I know from talking to her that she uses Snapchat far more than anything. Would it be weird for me, as a 36 year old guy to add a 19 year old on there, even if we're sort of casual friends? I just ask because I know people will add all sorts (parents, teachers, coworkers) on Facebook, for example, but I have no idea if Snapchat was viewed as casually as that. I have an account (though I hardly ever use it), but I have the idea lodged in my head that it's almost exclusively a young person's app and I don't want to inadvertently come off as a creep or something.",18Mar2018,1
278,"Hello, r/Advice. I think I messed up bad time.

Some info: I am 19 years old male, and I have no experience on dating. I met this stunning girl around a month ago at these house parties, and we had a connection instantly. We basically spent 5 hours straight just talking about life and music. I noticed how much we have in common, and so I got interested in her.

Fast forward a month, we met at another party. We spent the whole night together (8pm-4am) together, talking and having fun. She clearly seemed interested, as she grabbed my hand and placed it on her breasts. We cuddled on the couch for a while. We also shared the same bed, and we were close. No sex wasn´t involved though. Note that we were both slightly drunk on both parties.

The thing is, I´m afraid I messed up, as I contacted her today and told her I´d like to take this to next level. She said she likes me, but she doesn´t know what to say as I asked so early. She didn´t completely turn me down, though, as we will probably meet another time in parties. How should I fix this?

280,"So I suffer from a debilitating health condition and have many online friends who also suffer from the same condition. It's a very difficult thing to live with and a very isolating condition, because of that we rely on each other for support in online groups.

If things go badly it could destroy a friendly, (therapeutic if you will) relationship or make things awkward; but I have a very you only live once attitude and feel if I don't try I will never know if I have a chance.

The downside is I could be seen as taking advantage of a group set up to support people. But on the other hand pretending relationships can't happen and people aren't human and don't have human feelings is unrealistic in my view.

I went and I sat down and i was so nervous about this group i didn't realise who was next to me or behind me. I began to pray asking God to heal me and to show me a sign that I will be okay and if I will ever have someone fall for me for good and not be in a abusive relationship of being used and lied to. 

They called up a group to come sing to start the youth event and guys...when I looked next to me there was this absolutely handsome guy. And he went up and he began to sing worship. I couldn't stop smiling ever since. He is everything i dreamed of since I was 12, someone who fears God and can sing! I havent told anyone but i been going to this church to heal and maybe join choir. But I kid u not as much as I try to ignore these emotions that i like him...he appears sitting infront of me.

I saw a friend and ran up to her only to find him infront of her and I said hi and he looked at me, smiled and said hi. I feel so dumb for feeling shy and not talking to him...he stood by and he left.

286,"I'm a high school junior trying to get into an Ivy/other top schools for medicine. I've been top in my class (#1/#2) for my whole high school years with an extremely high GPA. All honors Freshman year, 2 AP classes Soph., 4 AP this year, and was on track to doing 5 AP next year. Currently, I (feel) that I am extremely qualified to get in, considering my classes, my grades, my extracurricular, my background, etc.

But recently, I've been getting more tired. Sleeping more often. Saying ""eff it"" to some homework (which I've never done in my life). Blanking out in AP Physics class(which I absolutely detest). My family is really poor and they have a lot of expectations for me, which I've always been able to meet and exceed. 

Last Friday, I walked out of my Physics class, smiled at people leaving, went to the bathroom and broke down crying. I walked the halls for a while after, beaming at people when they said hi, trying to refrain from breaking down again. I went to the library, sat for one hour crying, then got myself together and went through the day.

Am I burned out? I never thought so. Am I stressed? I've always thought I could handle everything. Was that a mental breakdown I had? Maybe I was just overreacting.

But my dad, after I told him, (I tell my parents everything for some reason lol) he basically told me ""fuck it. nothing matters if you become sick.""

So I made a list of everything that I do (sports, clubs, classes, extracurricular) and I'm going through them and asking ""Does this make me happy?"" The thing is, there are some key ones that I know will make my next year hell (AP Chem, state council, committees I'm already a part of, sports) that I'm considering taking out. My question is, should I do it? 

My father already told me take out what doesn't make me happy but unless someone forces me to, I can't seem to make myself go backwards (go from AP science to honors science, from being involved in committees to not being involved, etc.). I wish my dad could be a parent that didn't trust me so much with everything. I wish he could just tell me: ""No. You are not taking these many classes."" I'm so afraid that I'm going to continue next year like this year, and with me already falling apart, I'm not going to make it next year.

But my family is on welfare and government assistance and I NEVER want that for me or them. I want to get all of us off of it as soon as possible. Should I risk my health for a future? Will it be worth it? I'm 17, and I feel like I don't know shit, so any advice is welcome.

Thank you.

TL; DR: Should I continue being Ivy league material (which will benefit my future and success for my family) or focus on my mental health (which will mean dropping classes/activities)?

290,"Hi Reddit, I'm hoping for some insight into this negative cycle I keep experiencing. I grew up in a chaotic family. As a child, I had feelings of depression and a general melancholy ""neutral"" mood most of the time. This has continued up until now but seems to have gotten worse. I recognize that I may have clinical depression and am planning to see a psychiatrist. Before I do that, I want to see if there's anything I'm doing wrong (or if my thoughts can be changed). No matter what I do or experience, I am always feeling bored and anticipating something else. I could be sitting at the pool with friends and I'll probably be the only one ready to go back inside even though I know I'll be even more bored at home. Today I went shopping with a friend and after a couple of hours, I was ready to leave even though I wasn't looking forward to doing anything else. Even when I'm having what others would consider a good time, I feel bored and discontent. This same principle has applied to bigger circumstances like life goals, jobs, relationships, etc. Each time I achieve something new, I am surprised at how little it affects my happiness. It's like my brain is waiting for some big ""moment"" when suddenly I am going to find happiness externally. I know this isn't the case and want to find happiness internally, but it seems like I am incapable of this. I meditate, exercise, eat well and spend time with loved ones. I keep my house clean and do my best to keep myself put together. Am I just depressed? Or is there something I'm just not seeing that I could change to find happiness?

**TL;DR** I've always experienced extreme melancholy and boredom, even when doing things others would consider enjoyable. I take care of myself, exercise, meditate, eat well, and spend time with others including my loving fiance. I'm not sure what more I could do to find internal happiness. I keep waiting for a moment when I will, but it hasn't come yet, and I'm beginning to worry it won't. Am I just depressed? Or is there something I'm just missing?",18Mar2018,5

300,"Alright. Here's the whole story. 
My sister-in-law (SiL) started dating this guy a few months before my wife and I got married last years. THey started dating during the planning stages of the wedding and some of the preparation. Since then, he's thrown more red flags than a pent-up soccer referee. He's tried to isolate her, won't let her hang out with any of her friends alone (and insists on always being there when she does, even though he hates her best friend), has been rude to all of us, excluded us, lied, make her feel like dirt, yelled at her for spending $12 on herself, thrown temper tantrums, etc etc. My SiL has talked to him about this numerous times, and he changes until the heat dies down. Then everything is fine and dandy again. We've tried to warn her about him and every shown her how specific examples of his behavior are working against her. My mother-in-law even talked to her and told her directly that the guy sounds and behaves just like her ex-husband/wife and SiL's biological father, and my SiL has even derided *him* as abusive before.
Yet, every time she's ignored us or downplayed it or what have you.
Now, some 10 months into their relationship, they've decided that they are getting married. He's even trying to impose all these wild rules on her like she can't go where *she* wants for her wedding dress. 
To further complicate things, it's tearing my wife apart and she feels guilty because she had pushed my SiL to use a dating site. That was how she met this guy. (Which, I might add, led to a former co-worker of mine recognizing him as the dude who stalked her and harassed her on that same website. SiL didn't listen or care.)
I really don't know what to do or say anymore. I keep telling my wife that we have to let SiL fall and fail, but she can't accept that. She's headed for a mental breakdown. My mother-in-law isn't helping much because she wants SiL to be happy and for us to get along, yet that asshole SiL is dating makes it clear that he doesn't want anything to do with me or my wife, even if he claims he does. And I know it's going to lead to a huge blowout in the future because he already announced his intention to ask me to be a groomsman (along with my best friend, who he doesn't even know). I already know I'm going to say no, not because I don't like him but because he NEVER made an effort to get to know me. He claims to be supportive of me, citing a car accident a few months ago that I had, yet when I asked my SiL to drive me to the insurance company to sign papers, he *had* to come along and acted miserable the whole time and like I was a burden. So, yeah, why would i want to show support for someone like that? Again, huge blowout ahead from that when I say no and he throws a tantrum over that next. Then my mother-in-law will try to guilt me into it, etc.

Tl;dr: Sister-in-law dating red-flag/abusive asshole and they want to get married, causing family turmoil, huge blowout coming soon.

I hope someone can offer me advice on what to do before this escalates too much further, or any of us suffer some sort of breakdown.

302,"*long as hell, sorry. Had to rant somewhere*

My friend does these things that not only disappoints me as her friend, but also seems to piss other people off. Let’s call her Erika. 

1. Erika and I are both very busy people with school and work, but we used to make time to see each other every once in a while. But every since she started dating this guy, she not only stopped hanging out with me but all of our other friends. For example, we’d planned on seeing Black Panther a week or so after it came out and then go to dinner afterward. This was two weeks of planning by me and another friend (let’s call her Jane). The hangout, btw, was Erika’s idea but she didn’t plan it because she “got busy.” Anyways, we found a groupon type coupon for the tickets and made reservations at a nice restaurant. Everything is set to go, then she cancels last minute because her boyfriend asked her to go to dinner with him that night. Jane was more pissed about this than I was, but I was pretty annoyed. So she ditched us and we go with our plans. Then Monday comes around and she’s “soooooo sad” that she couldn’t hang out with us. Then she suggests another hangout the coming weekend, but everyone’s busy and she gives all the busy people grief. This is just one example. With her, this behavior is simply rinse and repeat. 

2. Everything has to be about her, even if she can’t relate and especially if she’s not the one being talked to. For example, another friend (let’s call her Eileen) lost her dad last summer from a sudden heart attack. Of course, she’s going to be in mourning, but she specifically tells us NOT to make a big deal out of it until she’s ready to talk about it which is fair. This is her personal life and just because we’re all friends, doesn’t mean we deserve unrestricted access to her life, thoughts and feelings. Everyone but Erika understands and respects this. Erika keeps pushing Eileen to talk about her dad, which culminated to this huge fight between them with Eileen eventually slapping Erika hard in front of us, a couple bystanders and one professor before storming away in tears. Eileen turns this into a “woe is me, I just got slapped” and breaks down in front of everyone. No one stops to help her because we’re all running after Eileen to make sure she’s ok. 

3. This one happened recently and the more I think about it, the more pissed off I get. Last year, we worked on something huge and actually got recognized for it. I’m thrilled for us both, but she later tells me that she doesn’t feel like she deserves it. Well, that totally kills my joy and I feel guilty even thinking about the award. So I ranted to another friend who goes to a different school (so she’s pretty much a neutral party) and she tells me that I shouldn’t have to feel guilty just because Erika doesn’t think she deserves it. I sleep on this and decide that yea, I’m done feeling guilty. So I distanced myself from her for a while, then she reaches out to me to ask if we’re ok. Obviously not since she basically guilt-tripped me into feeling shitty about this award. I tell her exactly what I’ve been feeling about what she said and did and why I’d been distancing myself from her. She then goes on this spiel about how she’d been dealing with “personal problems” (and I’ll explain why I put those in quotes) and that she was “sorry” I felt this. Not “sorry I guilt tripped you into feeling shitty like you just told me,” but a “sorry YOU feel this way about my behavior that I refuse to acknowledge.” She then asks if we’re ok. I’ve left her on read. I want to tell her no, it’s not ok and as long as you continue to gaslight me like this, it never will be ok. But I don’t know how to say that without causing more drama and this more stress for myself. 

4. She always has “personal problems” that interfere with our friendship. I don’t doubt she does, everyone does and everyone deals with them in their own unique ways. That’s fine. The problem I have with her is that this is her go-to excuse to get out of everything. But if I have genuine, personal problems, I have to get over it without even being allowed to talk about it when I want to. For example, the ONE time I skipped class last semester (because I got in a car accident on the way to school which I was told wasn’t my fault even though at the moment, I thought it was), she gives me grief by saying how I skip too many classes and how I hope to pass the class and graduate on time. I was like, BITCH. I only skipped this once and last time we checked, my grade is 5% higher than yours and that’s with me sleeping through most of class and you taking meticulous notes of every single lecture. 

5. She chews with her mouth open. I just... no. I’ve told her to close her mouth and chew, but she acts insulted when I do. It’s disgusting and no one needs to see your food turn to mush. That’s fucking gross. 

I know these all sound like the mini plots of some crazy telenovela, but all this drama only happens around her. Every other aspect of my life, from family to school to work, is relatively peaceful and (I might even add) a little boring. But boring is sometimes good. Boring is great in comparison to the living breathing embodiment of drama that is my friend Erika.

I don’t know what to do with her at this point. I want to either tell her to quit being dramatic or (worst case scenario) cut her out completely. For my own sake. 

If you have to play devil’s advocate, I guess that’s fine. Maybe it’ll help me understand why she’s like this and how I can deal with her. ",18Mar2018,1

305,"Hey, so basically I saw this YouTube video where this guy refused to play with people who donated money to him on his stream, and I thought it was wrong, and so I shared the post, and I went to right a constructive comment, so I began with “Wow, you”, and then I stopped writing, I looked at it and thought it sounds like I’m being aggressive or hateful towards this person, and it wasn’t something I’d say, I obviously got really sad over this, and I realised he doesn’t have to play with them if they donate, I would if people donated to me, but he isn’t instructed to do that, so this is what I wish the case was, I wish I was someone who when they saw that video, they didn’t agree with the persons view point, but they wouldn’t share a post about it, they just wouldn’t agree with it, I never set out to write something that came off as aggressive, or persistent, and that’s why I deleted it because I didn’t want it to seem that way, as I would never do that, and I just feel really down.

I am concerned about how I seen to hate lots of Ted and Fred's other friends. With Ted, it's not so bad, he has a few, but I only hate two of them. The reason I'm concerned is that I only began hating them AFTER they became his friend.

With Fred however, I worry that I am forcing him to be my friend, and making him too worried to about my feeling to not tell me the truth. I don't know if he would do this to me, but I feel that I'm become more suspicious of him the more we hang out

309,"Hey guys,


So I am currently in my first year in pharmacy school and I am not sure if this is the path for me. I studied kinesiology in my undergrad and have not finished my degree because I was accepted in to pharmacy school before finishing it. I enjoyed my time during undergrad to an extent (it's hard to enjoy writing final exams and projects) but the material wasn't always the worst. 
 
Now that I am in pharmacy the physiology aspect of the material is still nice, but once the lectures get in to the chemistry aspect of things (which it is very heavily focused on) and the drugs that we need to extensively know I start to hate life (not literally, but just describing how boring I find it). I am not sure if this program is for me or how I can find out if what Im feeling is temporary. I spent one day in a pharmacy helping out and it was not enjoyable to say the least, quite boring to be honest. 
 
I personally enjoy exercise and fitness which is why I may have enjoyed my kinesiology undergrad much more, but I find it hard to return to that because there is not many jobs you can get with just that undergrad degree. Medical school is out of the option because my CV doesn't come close to kids who have been rejected or accepted for interviews. I would think of Physiotherapy (Physical Therapy) but it is only slightly less competitive than medical school and if I were to drop out of pharmacy school then it means I am also dropping out of the only school that offers Physiotherapy in my province. 
 
I've recently taken up music making and video editing and I find those things to be very fun and I am quite passionate about them (not sure if this is just a honeymoon phase). I do not know if I would associate as these being hobbies or if I could do this as a job type of thing or if I am just looking for any sort of excuse to get me out of pharmacy school.
 
I've stuck through pharmacy past the first semester because I know for a fact I am guaranteed a job and it will be high paying so that has been my only motivation thus far, but as time continues on I find this motivation to be less and less appealing.
 
I know I've been all over the place, but that is literally how my mind is currently working. Any advice or communication from anyone would be awesome in helping me figure things out!",18Mar2018,3
311,I have asked my friend to hang out twice but they declined both.  I asked them the first time to hang out at a coffee shop since I wanted to try coffee and they declined saying they don’t like coffee (which is totally understandable).  Then I just asked them to hang out some where else since I will be performing my guitar their and they said they would check their schedule (which I’m guessing means no).  They asked me twice before to hang out with friends and I said sure.  Am I just looking into this too much or do you think that they don’t want to hang out with me when I asked them?,18Mar2018,1
313,"Every fucking day I drag myself to school in hopes of remembering whatever the teacher has regurgitated onto the board. I do all these past exams in school and show little to no improvement and have applied to colleges in hopes of becoming something I'm not even sure I want to do. I have one friend and decide to stay in doors all day jerking off or forcing myself to revise for a test I know I'll fail. I seriously don't remember the last time I was happy.

I'm always looking back into the past and thinking how awesome I felt being in blissful ignorance. I want to do well for my exams, yet I don't revise months prior - only days. I always regret it and end up fucking my exam up. I honestly don't think I can take much more. I have a History exam tomorrow, my last pre-exam before my finals which are in 8 weeks. I have only just started revising for my real ones a few weeks ago so I've basically fucked up my pre-exams. My teachers are going to bollock me yet again, making me feel even more shit, and I'm going to cry myself to sleep again. I'm sick of it. All of this shit. This fucking kack that's built up inside of my mind mentally is eating me alive. I don't think I can take much more. I hate how introverted I am, how I'm mentally week and feeble to be able to do anything successfully. I don't know where I'm headed. How do people have life figured out, what makes you get out of bed every day? What makes you happy? I'm scared for my future, I'm scared that I'm going to go through everything again in college.

315,"Ever since I was 13, I've been communicating with people on the Internet because I've always craved companionship. When I was 16, my parents found out that I was doing such a thing and got angry. They made me drop my online buddies. The thing is, because I lacked strong companionship in real life, I always went back to talking to people online.

Flash forward to now. I'm 20. My parents still have the same attitude, but now my father recently told me that he prays nothing happens to me because of the fact that I'm talking to people I don't really know. He told me that it's dangerous, and that I'm putting myself at risk. 


The main reason I do this despite the risks is because most of my attempts to connect with people from college or work have fallen flat. For some reason, whenever I talk to people on social media, I ""click"" with them better than people I actually know face-to-face. I've tried time and time again, but things never work out. My father thinks I'm reaching out to the wrong people. 

I'd be inclined to agree. 

Now I'm at a crossroads. Part of me has kind of realized that this IS dangerous behavior, and I don't really see these people are true friends. On the other hand, if I cut myself off from them, I'll be alone again. I just got over this bad bout of sadness (it's still there, kinda, but I think the online communication allays it to some extent), which I'm afraid may come back full force if I drop my online buds.

Any advice on this? Is my father right? ",18Mar2018,1

329,"A little background beforehand: My friend ian and i met during our senior year of high school. For the first two years after graduating I always thought he was cool. We are part of a large friend group who are still just as close in college as we were in high school. 

For those of you who aren’t familiar, a “finsta” is a fake instagram profile teenagers often make. The difference between a finsta and a normal instagram is that finstas are private and only accept close friends. On a finsta, one will make comedic posts or vent their frustrations. This is important for later.

Before I go into the rest of the post, although it may seem like I’m being rude or mean, I truly just want to help Ian. He isn’t being himself. 

Lately, I’ve been concerned for Ian. He is angry all the time. He’s started to exhibit extremely racist thoughts and even though I try to explain to him why he’s being bigoted and hateful, he doesn’t see what’s wrong. I never attack him, I always just try to help him realize he’s better than that. 

He believes firmly that black people are leeches of society and are the root of all our country’s problems. He hasn’t always thought this, as far as I know, but lately he’s been very vocal about it. He has been borderline alt-right lately. The reason i don’t drop him immediately for being racist is cause he needs help. He needs me as a friend, even if he doesn’t realize it.

Beyond his racism, he is becoming more hermited lately. He lives at his parents house still, during his junior year. He has an iffy relationship with his parents, and always complains about how miserable he is at home, but he refuses to move in to our apartment, (which we’ve offered many times because we think it would help him get out of this funk we all see that he’s going through.) He is more than capable of paying rent with us, and we would be accommodating to him, we truly just want him to stop being miserable and enjoy the next two years of college with us.

He also always has to be right, even in normal conversation. He will argue to death that he’s right even when there is a pile of evidence suggesting otherwise.

He is truly terrible with girls. It isn’t just that he’s a little shy, but he is disrespectful and mean, but then he gets upset when girls don’t like him. For example, oftentimes he sends screenshots of him insulting his matches on tinder about their looks. He also has extraordinarily high standards, and will point out the flaws of even the prettiest girls. He commented on one of the most attractive girls we know being too fat. It’s okay to have preferences but he goes out of his way to insult women whenever he can, and it makes me uncomfortable.

Lastly, the event that triggered me into making this post. Today I found out that Ian direct messages a girl who is currently a senior at the high school we graduated from. The message was a little bit creepy, bordering r/niceguys territory. The girl posted a screenshot of it on her finsta, and I immediately knew it was him based on the way the message was worded, but asked her if it was him regardless, and it was. It made me sad to see him get flamed on social media, but the message was creepy so I don’t really blame the girl. 

I just want to help my friend get out of this dark place he’s currently in. He hasn’t always been a racist, sexist, douchebag. I just want to help him. I don’t know if he’s depressed or what. He’s just always so angry and I can tell he’s gonna go down a dark path if he doesn’t get help. I’m hanging out with him in a half hour, and I’m gonna try to have a talk with him. If any of you have any advice I would really appreciate it. Thank you.

333,"Warning - long post!
I feel like such an idiot. I have been working as a cashier for almost six months, and I guess I ended up being short today for a second time. By how much? I have no idea, I wasn’t told. The person covering in for our assistant manager who just left told me he would look into it and that I could go home. I felt so frustrated and awful, because a few months ago I ended up being short by three dollars. Ever since that day I promised to be more careful. When the customer hands me the cash they have, I always announce the amount out loud before I enter it into the POS system to ensure that it is correct, and so that the computer calculates the correct change. When I give back the change, I try to fan out the bills I have so I see them clearly, and I usually count them out loud. I have a feeling that I got screwed over by a customer who ordered two bean burritos. I gave him 2.95 for his change, and then he asked if he could get change for a twenty, he kept randomly handing me bills and asking me for change for this and that, making me easily confused as he kept changing his mind… I felt really uncomfortable and wanted to say something but kept quiet as I feared about angering the customer. My managers have been drilling me for good reviews and lately no one was doing the surveys I was giving them, so I feared about ticking one off customer off. I felt very dubious after I closed my drawer because this guy was just really throwing me off with all this random cash he had, and I was just panicking. I really hope that I did not screw up with that, but I feel like if anything, that is where I messed up. We were not very busy today, but we suddenly got busy around like three o’clock, and I guess I had this possible slip up happen within that hour. I really hope that it is not that bad. I have been trying so hard to be more careful, and I screwed up once again just because I did not want to anger someone. Work has been awfully stressful the past few weeks, so that does not help. To make matters worse, we had an incident from hell on Friday. Our general manager disappeared leaving only four of us. We can manage on four people, but for some reason, things were moving extremely slow when we had a lot of customers. The other girl who was on drive through was doing the dishes in the back, and I noticed that a customer was waiting in the drive through to pay for his meal. Since I was working up front as cashier in the lobby and had no customers ordering, I decided to help. I told the guy his total was 10.75, and he only gave me a ten-dollar bill, meaning he was short. I gave that bill back to him because I figured maybe he didn’t have the coins or wanted to pay with either a twenty or a card, so I open the window, give it back to him and reminded him it was 10.75, and I closed the window for a brief second since it was just a little windy. Well, I open the window again, and he gives me only three quarters (the 75 cents) …. I ask him for the ten, and he tells me that I have it. I almost instantly panic because I KNEW I GAVE IT BACK TO HIM IN HIS HAND SINCE HE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO EVEN OPEN THE REGISTER IF HE DID NOT HAVE THE EXACT AMOUNT OR MORE. Even though I was sure of myself, I decided to look around the area to see that maybe I didn’t hand it back or if I made a mistake. After all it was an extremely busy day and I was feeling dizzy, so maybe I was in the wrong. But that bill was nowhere around me.  I had to contact my shift leader and the girl on drive through since that was her regitser, and it was a mess explaining the situation. We looked for the bill by the register, under, above, and outside the window, it was nowhere. The shift leader decided to count the drawer to make sure it had the right amount of money, and he determined that the $10 was not inside. After ten minutes my SL decides to just give this guy his food for free, and he storms off in his truck. I felt so bad about this. Funny thing though, is that the next morning (yesterday) as I went to change the menu boards on the drive through outside, I found the $10 in the bushes nearby. It must have blown away after I gave it back to him. I almost laughed before panicking, as I thought “if I take this bill, they will think that I probably had it all along!”. I decided to leave it, but then another fill in shift leader who came from another store ended up walking outside where I was. I decided to tell him the story and asked what I should do with the bill. All he says is “finder’s keepers, I know nothing!”. At first, I thought “eh, okay” and then I thought “what if this is a test?”. Then I started feeling guilty, and I thought I did not need that money, and it was a loss in profit. If I did not return it, that would be stealing. I decided to hold onto the $10 until the next day to tell the SL that was present during the ordeal that I found it and would try to put it in the drop box, and after I told him this morning, he said nothing… Like??? I am really frustrated on the lack of communication. I hope he doesn’t think I had it in my pocket in the first place! I was going to put it in the drop box today, but after being short, frustrated, and not given any validation on dropping the money vs. keeping it like the other SL told me, I forgot. I feel like I’ve got blood on my hands. I feel stupid and awful. Last month my assistant manager told me that I am one of the best cashiers at the store, and a lot of the managers there depend on me for getting good reviews, and the customers often compliment me on my service. I feel awful for being short a second time and for this stupid situation with the $10. I do not want to be called in for a meeting or fired… I am really scared, and I just feel so stupid. I work hard, and I don’t want to be viewed as an unreliable idiot. I wish I did not crack under pressure. This job has been stressing me for various reasons, and after these past few weeks of being understaffed with four employees not showing up yesterday, rude customers, and all this nonsense, I just want to quit. It is my first job and I just feel awful about my mistakes that have mostly been geared by fear. Sorry for so much detail, I am terrified and stressed.…

In short: My drawer was short today for a second time after working as a cashier at a fast food restaurant for almost six months. After the first time I promised to make sure that I would never make that mistake again and took steps to prevent it from happening again, but after some confusion with a customer, I messed up again and feel terrible and afraid.

336,"Hi,

I am about to finish my first year as a freshman in university as the spring semester is about to come to a close. In my first year in university, I feel as if i haven't made any solid connections - I never have anyone to do anything with on the weekends, I have no one to run to or talk about anything on a personal level with; basically anyone that ive come to click with. 

In high school, I could say i was a fairly popular guy. I had many friends and before anyone says they were fake friends, the guys i was friends with are currently still my closest friends. The only problem is that they are far away as i chose to go to uni somewhere i could be independent and learn how to live on my own. 

I don't want to go home yet, but I also feel as if im stuck and that I dont belong. I go to a fairly small university, and i mostly feel left out seeing as most people already have their own friend groups. I dont know what to do as it gets lonely not having anyone to hang out with and explore. I feel as if i havent been able to experience "" the college experience.""
