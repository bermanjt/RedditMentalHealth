1,"The other day my mother was talking abut going to church this Sunday, as we haven't went in a long time, but used to go a every Sunday when I was little.  I said I don't know if I believe in Science, or if I believe in God, and we've discussed it twice since. She is a firm believer in God and says she knows he is real, but I said  I don't know because, although I want to believe in God, there seem to be a lot of holes in Christianity. We haven't been arguing, really, but it's more been a discussion, like I said. She said if I became an atheist it would be her fault for not taking me the Church enough, and I know I'll constantly have to have this discussion with her every time I see her. Now, every time I see her I feel awful, every time somebody mentions God or Jesus I feel awful, and thinking about it makes me feel awful. The reason we are starting to go back to Church is because she may or may not have cancer, and has rethought a lot of things. I'm not against going, but I just don't know if I'll be able to believe in God again, and I feel horrible that she'll think it's her fault. 

Also worth noting - My sister is in college, she is a Christian, but not devout or anything. My dad isn't really religious, but I think he believes in God (My parents are divorced but I see him just as much) and I'm 16. Please help, I don't know what to do.",19Aug2018,1
2,I've been trying for a few years to become the most loving and accepting version of myself I possibly can but I keep getting bitter and angry when it comes to Muslims. The reason for this is because I am an extremely feminine man which is very explicitly forbidden in Islam and I feel very defeated and upset because no matter what I do and no matter how kind or loving I am I will always be a bad person and a sinner through the lens of Islam. How do I move past this bitterness to acceptance and kindness?,19Aug2018,0
3,"there has been times when i have found a guy attractive and when we start talking, i’ll find myself get over it and get bored with him. i feel bad sometimes. 

recently, there was some guy i had a “crush” on for a while. we follow each other on social media and he replied to a post of mine on instagram with a dm. i was caught by surprise that he would message me because we don’t actually know each other. we live in different states, i found out about him through his photography. so he was like this random person online who i found really attractive but i never did imagine i’d actually meet this guy, let alone get a message from him on social media. the conversation we had ended up being longer than i expected. we talked about a bunch of different things. i was kinda half expecting/wanting him to leave me on “seen”, idk i guess as we messaged each other, i kind of didn’t find him that interesting anymore. i don’t know why.

4,"I am a 20 year old university student. As a person I am very self-aware, and I identify my short comings and things I need to change. But I just don't do anything about it. These past years as I am growing older into adult hood, it is becoming an internal and external problem. In University I lack discipline and my grades suffer greatly from it. I always seem to be tired, and have a lack of motivation to do anything productive. Over the past couple years I have tried going to the gym to maybe increase self-confidence and help fix my low self-esteem issue, which is a big problem I have. I am a very skinny guy 125lbs 5""10, though after going to the gym on and off I could never really do it because I really just disliked it. I disliked being there, lifting the weights, finding the time for something that I really didn't like was tough. I gained some muscle, but it didn't do anything for myself. Another problem I have is fapping. I have noticed that it has become a problem in my life. I do it too much and find myself craving to do it when I haven't for multiple days. It takes a lot of energy out of me, and since I lack the discipline and motivation, I have a hard time stopping. 

I am just not in control of my life, I worry about what other people think 24/7 which gives them control of my life. I don't feel valuable, and I lack self-worth, since I don't get good grades, and I feel like I am wasting my parents money as they send me to university. There is a part of me that wants to get fit as it will improve my confidence, but at the same time I don't think it will. I think I am just creating these things and tell myself ""once I have this, or once I am like this, that's when I will have confidence and be a man"". 

I honestly just don't know where to start, and how to begin. I need someone who was in a similar situation to tell me what they did to turn their life around, and start enjoying life.",19Aug2018,1
6,"So for context, I work in a care agency that works with teens and young adults. They have a training program for youth mentors, they train us to help teens develop skills and better their personal, academic and work lives and be sort of a support in their lives and help them out with whatever they need or want. We are not therapist or counselors, we sort of do a little bit of everything though we have a lot of restrictions about how we interact with the teens and we're supposed to keep it strictly professional but also be able to tend to the client's needs, this can be difficult because of often times they'll need something and it's just out of bounds to what we can do and then you're sort of unable to do anything.

Anyway, Everything's going great until some of the exercises become kinda dumb, like come up with compliments for people you don't know, sometimes without even knowing their names, this is supposed to be an exercise in identifying and working with each individuals strengths. my problem with this is that if I'm gonna work with someone I would assume I'd have some context about the person's case, not someone randomly coming into an office and I'm expected to have an idea of what's gonna work right away. I tried explaining this to the trainer and she just said that they'd been doing it like this for a decade so it's fine. I was screaming internally. There were more things like this that lead me to believe that after protesting or pointing out things I didn't like about the exercises, the main trainer kind of isn't very fond of me.

The thing is, I want to put in an application for a position in my workplace and I need this training to be able to be considered and hired. My worry is that the trainer will not recommend me as a candidate for being ''difficult'' i.e. expressing things I thought were not helpful/right about the exercises and the material. She also said I was rude three times. I never intended to be rude, one time I was just asking for advice in Spanish to the auxiliary trainer and she said that I sounded rude. The other two times I was just writing and didn't pay attention to something she said and the other time I was actually upset and came off angry, so I give that she she was right in noting rudeness that time.

What can I do to get a positive recommendation note? I have two weeks to get on this lady's good side.",19Aug2018,1
7,"Hi Everyone. My spouse and I are facing a conundrum. I'd like to simply lay out the facts and ask for some advice as to whether to say yea or nay to this opportunity.

**Current Circumstances:**

* We live in a city that is family friendly, has a low cost of living compared to the national average, and weather we can tolerate
* We have several strong, mutual, genuine friendships that go back nearly 20 years
* We have twins, 4 years old, pre-school
* We live in a school district with one of the top public elementary schools in the state, and we found a private school option that follows the experiential learning philosophy we both value
* We got a great deal on our house and currently pay less than 10% of our gross annual income toward the mortgage
* We each have jobs that are VERY secure, afford us life-flexibility, and offer excellent benefits
* My spouse's job is in their field of interest, but it is \*mundane\*
* My job is pretty much a perfect balance between challenging and relaxed -- a rarity in my field
* The city we live in lacks diversity and global perspectives
* The food where we live is pretty lacking
* The job market is decent, but not amazing
* Commuting here is easy -- everything we need on a week-to-week basis is less than 5-10 minutes away, and almost everything in general is within 30-35 minutes away

**Potential New Circumstances:**

* My spouse received a job offer at the company they've admired and wanted to work for for years
* The intent would be to use that job to learn more deeply about how corporations approach systemic, organizational, large-scale change, as this is what my spouse ultimately wants to pursue in their career
* This means working at the new company for approximately 5-6 years and then leveraging the experience and clout obtained through that company to move on to the next step in their career (with potentially another city-change in between 5th and 6th grade for the kids), at which point we would settle down through the kids' middle school and high school years
* The city where this new job is located has a 20-30% higher cost of living
* Our combined income would be 20-30% higher
* Selling our current house now would net us approximately 30-50k in profit
* The public school options aren't as ideal, though somewhat comparable schools exist
* To live in the district for said schools, we would need to rent and we would end up paying about 25% of our new gross annual income toward rent
* There are similar private school options available as here, though we would receive less financial aid due to our increased combined income
* We have some friends / acquaintances in the new city
* Commuting in this new city is... problematic and congested
* The new city is somewhat more diverse, and the new company itself has a global workforce and culture
* The new city has better food

**My Questions:**

* What would you do? What factors would you weigh most heavily? Is there anything we aren't already thinking of?

Thank you in advance!",19Aug2018,1
9,"So my boyfriend works overnight shift and came home around 8am today. We fell asleep together around 9am, then at around 12pm I woke up to him very carefully moving over me to get off the bed. I ask him what he’s doing and he mumbles something about not wanting to wake me up. I roll over and go back to sleep. As I’m drifting off I smell something gross. “Did this mfka really just shit himself?” I think to myself. 

I’m laying in bed scared to move. After roughly 10 minutes he comes back in the room and I pretend to be asleep. He has changed pants. I “wake up” and ask him why he changed. “These are warmer, it’s cold in here,” he responds. I pretend to doze back off while I hear him quietly but frantically trying to clean the shit off the bed. Eventually I actually do fall asleep and I wake back up to see him laying on a towel playing on his phone. I ask him why he’s on a towel and he says he spilled his drink. Fair enough. We officially wake up around 5pm and he is hiding the stain on the bed with all his might and I pretend to not notice.

He is gone to work now and I have all the linens in the washing machine and I’m going to wash them multiple times lmao. I also cleaned the stain off of the actual mattress. Should I tell him that I know he shit the bed, and that it’s okay and he shouldn’t be embarrassed? Or should I just replace the sheets and never speak of this to him?

TLDR; My bf shit the bed and I’m unsure if I should tell him or not.",19Aug2018,192
10,"\-This might be long, sorry-

So, I guess I just need to vent right now. I hate how my life has been lately. I mean, my life has always been pretty shit, but it's starting to weigh down on me again. Right now I'm 21 years old and about to start my second year in college, but I honestly don't want to go. I don't know why! I was so happy, proud, and excited about finally going to college, but now...I just don't want to do it anymore, I really would prefer finding whatever job I can find, so I can move out of my grandparents house and live on my own. But I don't even know if I will be able to find a job without at least a bachelors degree. And that's the other thing, I'm extremely poor. So the idea of going to college for a bachelors or masters degree and gaining lots of debt that I won't know if I'll be able to pay off terrifies me!! I also just feel like I'm not living the way I should at my age. I should be going to parties, starting relationships (as of now, I've never been in a relationship), exploring the world, making friends (I only have one friend), DOING SOMETHING!! But instead I just sit on my computer all day watching YouTube videos or Netflix films. And I know I could be making those changes myself, and I really am working on it, but at the moment I am struggling with social anxiety that keeps me from approaching anybody, and shutting down when I ""fail"".

I just feel like a failure honestly. I don't know what I want to do with my life. I just feel like such a boring person, that if I were to die tomorrow, barely anybody would be at my funeral and I wouldn't have done anything with my life.

So I guess what I'm asking is if there is anything I can do to make me not so depressed about my situation? I'm looking at starting new hobbies, but I always get bored and give up...And I feel like making goals for the future depresses me because it's so uncertain due to my financial situation.

12,"I was with my boyfriend for over 3 years. I've been in quite a few relationships, but none like this. I had never been happier than when I was with him. Turns out he hasn't been happy for about a year but kept it going for some reason, and I wasn't fully aware of this, he just seemed distant because of his new career. 

Anyway, he left me last night. Gave the whole ""I still love you and I feel like shit for doing this and you're beautiful and talented but this needed to happen, we both changed, I grew up"" spiel. He even told me that hypothetically there may be a chance to try again one day which I believe is a lie but I'm desperately trying to get my mind off of that being a possibility.  

I'm absolutely shattered. Worse than I have been in any breakup. We planned on kids and marriage and moving out and then this happens. I've been crying non-stop, even at work which is inconvenient to say the least. Everything I see reminds me of him, every song, every place. I can't escape it. 

I wish I could hate him so it was easier. But not a single part of me does.

Is there anything that helped you get over a bad breakup? Any help or advice or anything is appreciated.

18,"Since I was 19 or 20, maybe earlier, I wanted to do youtube on the side, or as a temporary full time career. I am 22, never have been employed, never graduated from college (The amount of classes I have passed can probably be counted on one hand) have never owned a car or a full on license (outside of a learner's permit), and up until recently I lived in what could be considered ""the middle of nowhere"" with no access to town or cheap, easy, and safe transportation or sidewalks. I got a ElGato Game Capture HD for Christmas of either 2015 or 2014 (by my request) and my mom got relatively cheap (between 20 and 50 dollars) video editing software (by request, and for ""school"") for me less than a year ago. I still don't have a decent mic, or any sort of working webcam outside of my laptop, and I barely know how to use the editing software effectively.

  
My family have spent over 100 dollars on things I would have used for a youtube gaming career, though after reflecting and having several failed channels, I am wondering if I should just give up on it entirely. I have also heard of plenty of horror stories from other Youtubers about crazy fans. I have also done a lot of creepy and shameful things offline and online (under my real full name), and I feel that could be used against me if I blow up. I was also planning on doing a big video defending a controversial figure, which would probably make things even worst. Another thing I realized is that I have a voice and maybe even a face on youtube which can be traced.

It feels like I have a million reasons to not do youtube, though my family has spent money on the things needed for it, by my request. Should I just give up on that dream? Is this a self-fulfilling prophecy? What should I do with my ElGato?",19Aug2018,1

20,Im a 29 year old male I started a job a year ago and I made fast friends with a girl we had similar interests she was really nice it was just really easy to be around her.  She was very giving always seemed to be a great deal. Everyone tried warning me about her and that she was trouble and I just assumed they were hard on her because they were jealous she was so great and nice (misery likes company deal) but eventually we got emotionally and physically involved not that it matters but but she made the first moves and eventually she told me she wanted to be with me and I wanted that too but long story short she decided to go back to her ex but still wants to be friends with me which I told her I respect her decision even though it broke me. But I can’t just be friends I have to figure out how I’m going to move on. And I can’t list all the little details about the relationship but it goes in cycles I try and get away she finds a way to pull me back in I’ve lost weight I can’t sleep I’m emotionally wrecked I’ve looked up the steps of emotional abuse and she has followed them to a tee. I care about the person I thought she was she won’t leave me alone I’ve tried so hard I’ve told her endless times and blocked her on social media out let’s it’s like she doesn’t even see them.

21,I'm 23 and I'm a giant failure. I failed my first year of state college and was just never ready for it. I've been in community college for 4 years. I want to be a mechanical engineer. I finally thought I had fixed a lot of my problems and was moving forward when I took 2 summer math classes so I could catch up and take 3 classes in the fall but halfway through my second one I found out due to the class scheduling that it didn't matter if I had taken the classes or not because the time period wouldn't have changed. This absolutely destroyed my motivation and I got a D in that class. My main problem is maybe my home life. My parents had very high expectations and I manage to fail them everytime. My parents are the only educated ones in my dad's side of the family so for them the fact that everyone else is finishing and I'm not is devastating . I honestly feel like I can't live here and progress because of how strict my mom is. Personally I'm not happy with my parents. They loved me a lot but they were very unexperienced and not too keen on trying to integrate into American culture . I often feel like I want to do things but I'm conflicted by it. I fear seperation however because I have no money and I've wasted so many years that I have no choice if I want to try and have a life without overwhelming debt or the like. It was my birthday yesterday and it was only another continuing line of disappointments and misery for me. Every year feels worse then the next. It all seemed to be getting better until I found out I wouldn't even be able to take the classes I want. Not only that my dad lost his job 2 months ago and has yet to have any success. My mother is so rooted in her beliefs and traditions yet expects things that are not alligned with those as well. She literally yells and cry's for days and its very taxing for me mentally because it has happened so much it destroys my state of mind I literally don't know what to do I'm looking for a job and trying to figure something out but I also don't have anyone to talk to and I don't trust talking to my parents because my mother often just offers nonsensical solutions based on faith. I do play video games and that is a big contention point but frankly that's the only social interactions I have and the only thing i can find any joy in these days.

Him and another guy (I'll call him Mr.fullahate) that I used to be friends with (I had enough of him when he threatened me and tried to give me ""rules"" I had to follow in social situations. I know, ridiculous) got bent out of shape and thought I was, and I quote ""bashing their social group"".

At one point he even took 15 minutes out of his day to type out this really long message of everything he didn't like about me. He's even said I was ""desperate for a boyfriend"" because I told him I was feeling lonely. The main thing that cracked our friendship right down the middle was this huge argument we had over something really petty. Let me just mention he pranked me a few days before this. So my friend and I pranked him that we were dating. For about ten minutes. He got really mad and said that this happens ""every time"". I've pranked him about 2-3 times in the whole time that we were friends (which is about a year). I asked him why he was so mad and he said it would ""hurt my feelings"". I took a guess of what he may have been mad at and he assumed I was calling him names. Let me just clarify that I asked him a simple question. Even worse, he's now DATING my best friend. Yeah I know right. I'm scared he's going to spread rumors or lie to Mr. fullahate and he's going to threaten me again.

I have this preoccupating with my  breast. Namely, the size.   


Growing up I was always the ‘big boobed girl’ I developed early. Like, age 11, and it was always the physical feature closest related to me. By the time I was 12 I was a D cup, which looked huge on my otherwise very skinny frame. In high school I had an hourglass figure and G cups which I’m sure were the source of my sudden raise in social rank once I began to dress better. My breast were always commented on and talked about by my friends and family. Either favorably, or the butt of jokes (which I found both annoying and funny). I wasn’t a huge fan of the male attention they gave me, but since I liked girls more in my youth anyway it’s not like I was validating myself by it. In fact, I don’t really like when guys comment on them at all. My preoccupation with having  a big chest is completely for myself.    


I’m north of 30 now, and I’m beginning to lose that metabolism I coasted on all my life. My breasts are as big as they’ve ever been, 32K. However, I’m beginning to gain noticeable weight (170 as of yesterday’s weigh in). I’m getting heavier. I have a muffin top. I’ve got love handles that have taken my hourglass figure away from me. Looking at myself in the mirror makes me sick. I look at porn stars and models famous for their large natural chest and I so badly want to be like them. I wanted to get pregnant or take hormones for ages to help my bustline, but I’m not willing to deal with the additional weight gain that typically comes with. I want to keep being known as the ‘busty’ girl. I venomously envy women with macromastia and feel like my life would be better if I had an even bigger chest.

I’ve tried just about every ‘natural’ remedy you can think of. I drank herbal enhancement teas, took pills, did exercises, fenugreek supplements. I even tried to induce lactation in hopes that it would up me a cup size or two. I’m just short of going in to the clinic and begging for estrogen shots. I’ll take them every week if it means I get my huge boobies. I’m really serious about this.    


I have to buy my bras at specialty shops. I’m way overdue for a new one, but I’m deathly afraid of going because I’m scared my current size will be smaller than what I am now.    


I feel like they’re not big enough. I want them to look massive against my figure, but I’m not willing to deal with fakes. They have to be natural, or as close to natural as they can get. I’d really love to relocate my love handles to my breasts, but I can’t afford the surgery. I’m scared to lose weight because I know breasts are mostly excess fat and they’ll be the first to go. Being chubby with a chest any smaller than what I’ve already got makes me physically ill to the point where I’m willing to hurt myself. Even thinking of it as I type makes my stomach heave. I can’t stand the thought. I like breasts of all sizes and shapes on other women, but with myself I have to be busty. Either as I am now or even bigger. I honestly feel like I don’t want to live unless I have big breasts.  
 

So, um. How crazy am I? Is this something I need to see a therapist over? I think it is, but I’m afraid of being either misunderstood or laughed at.   
 

For those who want to armchair psychoanalyze me: I was never bullied for my appearance growing up. I don’t have issues with attention-seeking. My husband tells me that my breasts are huge and he loves my figure just the way it is and I’m not easily swayed by adverts or people telling me what I ‘should’ look like. I just really need to be bustier.  ",19Aug2018,2

39,"Hey, so I’m a 16 year old male teenager who constantly comes up with creative ideas and I’m looking for some advice as to how I should go about a clear progression to making myself successful in one/some/all of these different avenues that I want to take in life. Before you offer your help/thoughts/opinion, here are the different main concepts that I want to do.

I’ve always wanted to be a “creator”. That’s what I want to do as a career. I constantly think about it, for hours every single day. Here are the main creative avenues I’ve decided I want to try to pursue, or at least consider.

First, I want to be a music artist. I can sing fairly well, as well as understand music theory and can produce my own music using software such as FL Studio. I have spent money on gear for music making. I’ve considered getting a partner/partners to help me make music, and release it, but it is hard to find people who share my vision or are interested in working with me with the chance of pay if the music is successful.

Second, I want to be a writer. I want to write books of poetry regarding emotions and life experiences and lessons I’ve learned. I want to write TV shows and movies. I’ve considered in the past being a journalist, but I think I’ve decided I’d rather focus on writings more personal to me than news topics. But again, would love to hear your thoughts on that and if I made the right choice.

Third, I want to be an actor in my own TV shows and movies, provided I end up writing them. I always would envision myself as one of the characters, and because of that, I feel I would be best at nailing the performance of the envisioned character.

Fourth, I want to be someone who creates social media-based photography and videography. I have invested in quality camera gear, and understand photo editing as well as movie editing. I’d create comedy-based pieces and such. These would be projects done on the side of the other creative options, more so as a way to connect with my audience more on a personal level. They’d be released on all major social media sites, such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram.

Fifth, I want a podcast.

So, those are some of my creative avenues I’d like to take. The others would involve some form of success beforehand, whether that be traction or money, before I can comfortably pursue them. I was inquiring about your thoughts on what I should do. I know I am young and I have some years to figure it out, but I hate not knowing how to go about becoming a success in the industries I want to go into. It’s almost like I need a mentor or manager or someone to help me process this all better. All my creative avenues come back to the core concept that I like to tell stories, whether fiction or real to me, through different mediums. I’m very curious as to what I should, and was wondering if you had any thoughts, or potentially yourself or one of your connections who would be interested in contacting me to discuss further. I can answer any questions and discuss my thoughts. Just let me know your thoughts, but to some it up, my question is, what should a creative teenager with no major successes like me do in this situation?",19Aug2018,1
40,"I (23f) was sent home from work an hour and a half early because my boss wanted to teach the other workers a lesson. They are all 15-18 and do not like to work. They simply stand around all day and make the rest of us to the work.

41,"I work at a busy coffee shop in a small town where almost all of our business is made from regular customers who come in almost every day.  One of our regulars moved out of state about a month ago but is in town this weekend and stopped in this morning.  I talked to him for a few minutes just about simple things like how his move went and stuff. He asked if one of our baristas was working today because he wanted to see her while he’s in town. 
 
I had seen this customer and this barista (who we’ll call Kim) talk to each other for over an hour during slower times at work multiple times so I figured they had a good relationship and said “she’s not here today, but she’ll be here tomorrow afternoon if you’ll still be around.”  
  
A couple minutes later I was doing work in the back room and one of the girls who was working with me told me that this customer makes Kim super uncomfortable and the only reason she talked to him like that was to be nice. She then tells me that she sent Kim a text just to warn her that this customer would be coming to see her tomorrow.  
  
About an hour and a half later when our manager came in he pulls me aside and lectures me about giving customers people’s work schedules (which I wouldn’t call what I did at all) and tells me that Kim is trying to get her shift for tomorrow covered now.  Normally I would be happy to help with that but I have to pick up my wedding dress tomorrow or the shop will consider it forfeit and I’ll be out $1500.   
  
I tried calling Kim as soon as I got off work to talk to her and at least try to apologize but she didn’t answer my call so I sent her a text. Nine hours later now and she still hasn’t responded to that either.   
  
I really feel terrible about the whole situation and just want some help trying to make things better.   
  
TLDR: one of the regulars at my coffee shop recently moved away. When he was in town today he asked about one of the baristas that I thought had a good relationship with and I said she’ll be working tomorrow. Now she’s upset and I feel terrible.

42,"So I have a really bad habit of biting and picking at my nails. It makes me feel good or feel this weird euphoria when I do. Not sexual, I just like biting and picking at my nails. I guess my wake up call and the thing that made me realize I seriously have a problem is when I went through 20 or so minutes of pain and blood just to get a nail that I had previously picked to see if I could get more. My fingers are sore, and now there is no nail, I was able to get the whole thing off and I currently have a tissue with some tape over it because it was bleeding so much, I don't have any bandages right now but I will get some soon. For a while, I was able to get rid of the habit but it came back after a while, I don't know why. I seriously need help but I don't know what to do or where to start.

I made the mistake of not locking/deleting regular youtube when I reset the phone and looking at my searches today, I can see he's been searching for naked girls within the past 24 hours and has watched some inappropriate, weird, borderline pornographic content. 

How can I make sure he can only access parent approved apps? And that my settings will stay as they are when the phone switches on and off? 

Please help. He loves his games, kids youtube and minecraft and I don't want to take those away from him permanently. But I will also do what it takes to ensure this doesn't escalate as I am aware that soon he'll be able to use a browser and then it's all over -- I've explained to him that there's things on the internet that can't be unseen but I suppose the drive to look at naked girls (at 7yo, which seems extraordinarily young??) is too strong.

46,"I’ve heard that many colleges require 4 credits of a foreign language to graduate, but I have also heard that this is only true for very few schools. I have free tuition into a college that only requires 3 credits(which I have), but I know that some require 4. There is a decent chance that I will go to this free college, but I may also get a scholarship to a better school that could change my decision. This fourth language credit will be a hard class with lots of homework, studying, and tests, and I may not be able to get an A in it, so that may affect my GPA. I would really prefer not to take a 4th language class in college(if it is required), because I feel that I would forget a lot of the knowledge that I have learned. It would also be easier in high school. I am very torn between these two decisions, so I would love some input. Thanks!

47,"I'm 17 and I fight a lot with my mom. I get frustrated because I come from an immigrant family, and my parents aren't used to someone who questions them whatsoever. Today, my mom called me an embarassment and a spoiled brat, and that the only way she knows she's not a terrible parent is that my younger brother, whose 14, turned upright (he's an angel, obedient, perfect). I know that I am very lucky- my parents can afford to send me to classes, get me nice clothes, etc. But I don't ask for that much- I rarely go shopping or spend money, and I am aware of the ""cost"" of their money- I rarely ask for money except to go for coffee once a month. My parents do spend quite a bit of money on classes though, but I do thank them for that. I do chores when they ask me to, trash, dishwasher, cleaning, etc, though I should do more. I know I'm rebellious, but today, my mom called me really spoiled. We were talking about money for a class this morning, and she told me I should get a job- and I asked her if we could think of other options, because as a first semester senior, college apps does take a lot of time. I didn't tell her she has to pay it- I told her I'd quit the class, apply for grants, etc. My mom got really angry at that, and snapped at me, which made me frustrated. I later told her that I had not been rude and that I didn't understand why she got angry, and she just said that she expected me to be rude so she wanted to stop the conversation. It frustrated me that she was angry when I didn't even do anything wrong. That day, she complained about everything I did (and I won't lie, I kept telling her to stop)- about the most mundane things. When she told me that I'm always closing the bread wrong and it'll spoil (I know its not anything major, but she yelled at me and that was the 5th time in like 10 minutes she was looking for something to yell at- my grade in a class 3 years ago, a fight 2 months ago, why I'm a bad teenager), I snapped and told her I'd pay for the bread if it did, since I'm the only one who eats that bread anyway.

She got so angry at me- she hit me, called me an embarassment, the very definition of a spoiled brat because I had no right to say that when she pays for everything else. I know that was rude, but I had kind of mentioned it in a more sassy way rather than trying to be insulting, and while I understand what I said was rude, I can't understand why she was absolutely furious and called me the rudest, most spoiled kid she's ever met.

48,"My boyfriend is, like me, looking for a job after graduating college this past May. I interviewed for a job this past week, and was told that they have 10+ openings for the same position (research tech), and that they have hired people from many different backgrounds in the past. His degree isn’t in a strictly related field (mine is) so i told him he should apply as well. I am in the final stage of applying (reference checks) and he just got an invite to do an over the phone interview. We went to Colleges that are closely affiliated with each other and are across the country from the area this job is at. 

So the question is, how do we go about this? We don’t have many pictures together on social media (maybe 3), and I don’t want this to hurt our chances of being hired. Should he say something during his phone interview? Should we say something later on if we are both hired? Should we say nothing at all, and “fall for each other” as we begin working?

49,"So, I was raised to bottle up everything inside and basically pretend to be insensitive to everything- which isn't really sustainable. 

The result of this, is I have become insensitive to a certain degree- for the most part. Or at least, I can go a very long time thinking I am. And then every once in a while I break really hard at seemingly small problems. But they're usually just the icing on top of it all. 

And THEN, when someone like a family member, boyfriend or friend notices and asks I absolutely always tell them I'm ok and am just tired, sick, etc. Which no one buys cuz I'm easy to read, haha. 

But I can't seem to ever tell them the truth! Or let things affect me normally as they happen. I've tried so, so hard for years to let myself just feel emotions and not push it back, but I still do it every single time. I can't ever bring myself to open up to other people- I personally think the root of this is because of the whole ""being sensitive in front of others is weak"" mentality I grew up on, which I know isn't true, but I can't seem to shake off of myself. 

Now, I know I should see a therapist or counselor or someone of the sort. But in the meantime while I'm looking into that, is there something I can do? Something small that might help me start the progress of feeling normally again? I'm so exhausted from it, and it definitely has caused me to push people away before. I want to be done with it, or at the very least, get some progress. ",19Aug2018,1

51,"Normally, I'd leave this kind of stuff alone, since I've never felt like it was my place to comment on how someone else was handling their family issues. However, my friend's wife confided in me some bad news. To care for his grandmother, they started off taking out a home equity loan, which ran out. Then, he started taking money out of his retirement fund, and even those funds have now run out. Now, he's planning on taking money out of their kids' college funds to pay for his grandmother's care, and I hate that idea. 

This all started a little more than a year ago. His grandmother lives with him, and one day, she slipped and fell, breaking her hip. They did the surgery, and he urged her to stay in bed and let herself heal. She ignored him, and got out of bed just two days after the surgery, and promptly broke her hip again. This pattern pretty much repeated itself several more times. 

My friend hired nurses to help her with day to day things, but she surprised everyone with her fanatical insistence of standing on her own two feet, with no one to help her, no cane, no walker, nothing at all. Since the nurses were only there during waking hours, she got up in the middle of the night to try to walk, and fell. In total, she's undergone 7 hip surgeries since this started, and each time that she fell, she exploited some blind spot to get up unsupervised. She got up while the nurse was in the bathroom. One time, she told the nurse that she wanted water to get them out of the room so she could try walking. 

So now, on top the surgeries, which they've apparently been having trouble with getting insurance to pay for, they have to hire two nurses to watch her every second of the day, and this has been a tremendous drain on their bank accounts. To me, this seems absolutely insane. My friend is now almost 50, and he no longer has any retirement savings, he might lose his home, and he's even thinking about dipping into his kids' college funds (one kid is starting her senior year of high school right now, and the other is starting his sophomore year). 

His wife is on the verge of leaving him because she feels like he's squandered everything they have on someone who isn't long for this world anyways. The kids are about to have their college funds obliterated. But at the same time, I can understand his feelings. It's not like he can just say to his grandmother that he's not going to pay for her care anymore. And there's no one else he can really share the burden with either (his parents are gone, and he never had any siblings. Meanwhile, his aunt, the actual daughter of his grandmother, has refused to help pay for anything). 

What should/can I do as a friend? I've held back on saying anything since he never asked me for advice, and I know he's the kind of guy who would tell me to shut up and mind my own business, but I feel like I should really step in at some point and talk some sense into him. That said, I can't think of a solution either, so I'm just as confused. ",19Aug2018,3

58,"Let me start by saying that I had a horrible time in college. I was a ball of stress all the time in regards to my grades, project deadlines, etc. I could barely function and I had an extreme coffee addiction. I also was most definetely depressed at the time, although I didn't know it. I cried nearly every night because I was barely holding myself together and I would often sit in my room alone and sulk. One night I even attempted self harm by burning my arm with a lighter.

Now, I know people had/have had it way worse than me and my experience isn't by any means unique. My college was also payed for by my wonderful parents so I was not really financially stressed. I will be eternally grateful for them. This is something that I am uncomfortable sharing because I don't wish people to view me as spoiled.

I have been graduated for 2 years now and I have had a recurring nightmare where I have been enrolled in a class but I am either failing or have not gone all together, and due to this I won't be able to graduate. It's quite frequent and I always wake up in a panic. Lately I have been trying to teach myself Chinese and I think perhaps me studying is what set off my nightmare this time. Anyways, I was speaking with my boyfriend about it and casually mentioned maybe I have some form of mild-ptsd or trauma. I am not in anyway trying to negate someone with actual ptsd or anything of the sorts, I am able to live a normal life. I realize that this claim was far fetched and took it back instantly - referring to ""oh well maybe I just have some form of trauma"". This set my boyfriend off. He started yelling at me and telling me that I had college payed for therefore I shouldn't have been depressed, how I had a normal college experience and by me saying these things I am insulting everyone with ptsd.

Am I over-exaggerating? I'd just like to say, I KNOW I don't have ptsd and I am sorry to anyone that this post may insult. I just feel like my experience had some last impact and I don't know how to articulate it without being offensive. ",19Aug2018,1

He will be sharing a bathroom with our 4year old so I definitely will make sure to clean that when needed.

I'm not ready to talk about it and dont want to tell my family as talking about it with them will just make it more painful and don't think I will get any benefit out of it.

63,"I am pretty much in with a ldr with a girl I met on vacation. I had a lot of crushes before but nothing like this. I really liked her. After I gave her my number she didn’t text me for 3 days and I feel into a slight depression. We eventually talked and both like each other so, last week I said hi and she didn’t text me for like a week. I was like okay no big deal.

64,"I guess a bit of context. I rarely go out. I would consider myself a good 17 year old kid, I don’t really go to parties or do anything that isn’t at home. In fact the only time I go outside is to drive my dad to work for reasons that I prefer not to talk about. Bottom line, I don’t go out.

I want to so desperately change that. I really want to explore things that interest me and one of them is music. One of my favorite artists is coming to my city in around a month and a half. The tickets are cheap too and I have enough money to afford it. I have told my parents this and my dad said he would like for me to go, however my mom also wants me to go but with her. Now I understand her, I really do. She only goes out to work and almost nothing else due to financial reasons. Although she doesn’t really know most of the songs, she wants to go. I don’t know if I’m being rude but i don’t want to go with her. 

I also don’t have any friends that like Latin pop just because they aren’t fans of pop in general. That leaves me with four options. Go with my mom, go alone, Go with a friend who doesn’t want to go, or not go.

 If I don’t go, it’s nothing too bad as I’m used to never going places but I would feel terrible and regret almost certainly on that day. 

If I go with a friend or my mom, I feel I wouldn’t have as much fun at a concert. Is that bad to think? My mom is also pretty sensitive and doesn’t understand my reasoning for going alone. It’s just not the type of music I would feel comfortable singing to with my mom right there.

If I go alone I feel I’m going to feel that.... alone. I asked my therapist what I should do but he didn’t tell me anything and just agreed with me how the outcomes aren’t that great. I just want to do something alone for once. My parents are in the middle of a toxic relationship and life with each other too. The only reason they haven’t separated is because they can’t afford it. I feel so lost and would appreciate the help. ",19Aug2018,1

Now, I’ve narrowed down my majors down to geology, biology, and comp sci; I know I have room to double major and graduate in time (4 years) but I’m seriously stuck because I don’t know which 2 to choose and I basically have to commit this semester to a track because I pissed my first year away on filler math/science classes and now I have to dive right in to major courses or else I won’t have enough time to complete them. I love geology and have several connections in the department, and i am also very passionate about animals and plants and biology stuff but I’m not sure about the job prospects besides academia or the oil industry. I know that comp sci could land me a job easily enough and I know I wouldn’t struggle learning it, and my parents would be really happy if I chose that route.

Unfortunately I’ve had that all my life. I’m 24 years old but since I was about 7-8 my mom has been in almost every possible scheme she could find. Avon, intima, Mary Kay, trying to sell shit from catalogs that no one will ever buy. When I turned 15 she would try to convince me to sell her products to girls my age in my high school, it was mortifying, but I told her no. I always knew it was a scam but no matter how much in debt she got she never got it through her head. To this day she’s selling Mary Kay and complaining about her debt and the boxes piled up in her room of unsold product yet every month she makes $2500 purchase of more product. She owes people money and I can’t even visit her with my daughter without her trying to sell me something. She’s my mother, I’ve tried speaking to her but she insists I just don’t support her and her “dream”. I grew up never having clothes that fit me, she’d buy me one pair of shoes every year and we never had anything in our house just so she could make her Mary Kay purchases. I can’t keep seeing her go down this path.. my whole family knows this is unhealthy for her but don’t know how to stop her. I’m willing to sacrifice her being mad at me for a while as long as she realizes she can’t keep doing this to herself.

71,"Okay, so Idk what drugs the people making our schedules were on, but last year, iirc the juniors  requested their classes in March and in April (I think), we got our schedules and I didn't ask for half the classes I had. We were encouraged to ask for changes to be made, and to make a long story short, I asked for changes to my schedule twice and I still had 2 classes I didn't wanna be in!

At enrollment, I asked for schedule changes for what I was expecting to be the last time. Well, my senior year started on Thursday and yesterday, my counselor took me to her office and told me the I couldn't take the class I asked for because it was an hour I wasn't at school (I'm a part-day student). So I was disappointed and had to choose other classes. Well, we had to jump through some hoops to figure out how we can change my 2 unwanted classes and to replace one of the classes, I needed to take theatre arts or foods II.

The issue here is I hated the theatre teacher when I was a freshman. I had him for intro to theatre and idk what I did especially to deserve his disrespect because it seems like everyone else who's had him adores him, but he'd ignore me when I raised my hand in need of help and do other rude things that got on my nerves. I can't remember those other things, so that may be a sign they weren't that serious. 

Now the foods II teacher who I was expecting to be the teacher who taught the other foods classes and I thought was okay is actually a seemingly universally dreaded teacher. 
Everyone badmouths her, saying she's difficult to deal with, she doesn't let you do anything, she says things that are out line (an ex-friend told me she asked him if he was special ed) etc. I haven't heard a single good thing about her.

I'm in a dilemma here. Idk if I should take the class under the teacher I despised  but everyone else loves and I may be able to start over with or the class under the teacher everyone despises but I might be the one person who at least won't be miserable with her since I've never had her.

This happened early this mourning but I got news of it this evening.

My baby nephew passed away today. 

They don't know of what yet but my sister found him laying in bed unresponsive. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To the grieving subject, ever since I was small I found it hard to outwardly show sad  emotions. I remember for my grandma's funeral a while back when I was at least 6, everyone cried but I just awkwardly sat there. Fast forward to middle school, I get a friend who just lost her mom. She's on a unstable mental roller-coaster and all I can do is awkwardly watch from the sidelines while everyone grieves and helps her.

Now that this happened today, I know my sister is going to be in a state that can't be fixed, at least, completely.

87,"Throwaway account  but here I go. i Will try to keep this short and to the point. 

 First I think I need to say that I have been brought up in a very religious family. Both parents are Christians and have extremely conservatives values on most things. Because of that I myself was also very conservative and lead a very mundane life. I used to go to church every Sunday and of course participate in everything church related. Was a counselor for kids , didn’t drink , didn’t smoke, didn’t party ( and had a very harsh view of people who did any of those and of course completely condemn it). However over the past few years a lot  of my views ,ideas and perception of things have changed. Last year alone I started drinking, partying, smoking and was way more open to a lot of ideas. However one thing that stuck with me throughout these years is the idea that I should save my virginity for someone special. I always thought that I would save myself for some girl from church and that we would get married and we would both loose it to each other. However I am realizing now more then ever that this might never happen as I don’t talk to girls much less from church. I have never dated, never kissed a girl, never held hand or anything. I have also been reading a lot of the r/redpill posts and agree with almost everything said on there. In consequence I don’t think I will ever have a desire to form any kind of relationship or have a commitment with any girl. What I am getting at is that  I was thinking of loosing my virginity to a hooker but I am still debating this. TBH I have been kinda thinking of going back to church and giving this whole thing another try but at the same time i don’t really see the point since i Curently truly believe that marriage is BS.

89,"Prepare yourself guys, this is a long one. 

So I live with four other people in total. So there’s five people in the house. One of them is my boyfriend who I’ll call Paul, there’s another couple “Lucy and Ryan”. They are very close with my landlord/roommate. My other roommate is my landlord and long time friend. I’ll call her Sarah. 

Sarah has a dog, has had this dog for like five years now and she self insists that he can’t get along with other dogs. Lucy an Ryan recently, like about three months ago, got a new puppy. To which Sarah was being nit picky and saying that their new dog HAD to get along with hers or the new dog couldn’t stay. And what do you know, they get along just fine, 

After Sarah found out that her dog could actually like other dogs, and with Lucy’s very persistent comments on how I “needed to get a dog so hers had one to play with” me and my boyfriend Paul decided to get a dog. Not only because of their comments but because we want one as well. We’ve already spent money on a dog bed and a leash and a couple other very generic items in anticipation. 

We made a trip to the pound about a week ago, and found out they were doing a free adoption day on 8/18, today. 

I informed all roommates of the plans to get a dog. ALL. OF. THEM. Sarah said that it would be easier for her dog to get along with a puppy, but besides that, never said much unless it was to ask if we knew what we were getting and are we excited and such. 

Paul and I had no idea what we were going to get, because we didn’t know what there would be. But we got up early today, waiting in line for three hours, and finally got to go and chose a dog. 

There wasn’t a single puppy left, so we went on to other adult dogs. Nothing we could do about it. We found one particular dog that looked like a bear with a lions mane. He was gorgeous and I couldn’t believe no one had wanted him yet. So, we decided on him. Got all the paperwork done, be he wouldn’t be ready till the 27th. 

Sarah messaged me to warn her if we ended up coming back with a dog that day, to which I replied about there being no puppies and so we got what was probably a one year old, 1 and a half at most, dog.  

And at first it seemed like we would be able to “see how it goes” with her dog. But when we got back home, all hell broke loose. She said “I don’t care what you want, it has to be a puppy. My dog NEEDS a puppy or else he can’t get along with the dog. It took three months for the new dog and my dog to get along “(it didn’t)” and you went against what I wanted and just got what you wanted” 

As if I would have gotten a dog I didn’t want to please her. So I suggested we do a meet and greet with her dog and the one we chose. But she said “you deliberately disobeyed what I said and I JUST KNOW MY DOG. IT WONT WORK.” 

And the tip top of the hat, she said if we went through with the adoption, she would evict us. Because it’s “her house and we are breaking her rules.” 

If she was that serious about a puppy then she should have sat me and my boyfriend down and explained that. But all she ever said was that it would “be nice” for us to get a puppy. 

She also went on to say that our other roommates bought their dog so we would just have to buy ours. Our other roommates did not buy their dog. It was free. Completely free. As the dog we chose would have been.

After she got confirmation of that, it “didn’t matter and you should have listened to what I said.” 

My boyfriend got into an argument with her over  it. I got into an argument with her over it. She started crying saying she “didn’t want to be THAT person.” Yet she couldn’t even do a meet and greet. Couldn’t even TRY to let the dogs get used to each other. I ended up calling the pound and leaving a rather unhappy message on my part about being sorry and we couldn’t get the dog anymore. I am hoping it gets adopted because he’s adorable and really chill. 

But as for the advice, what do I do now? How do I handle the tension very obviously floating about? 

We have already decided we are still getting a dog, but now we have to pay for it, which could be anywhere from $10-$175 from the other adoption places in my town. And it’ll be a damn adorable puppy that I want them to get no joy out of at all. It’s MY dog not the houses dog and she’s being a complete bitch by not even trying to have a meet and greet. I really don’t have words for the anger. 

Anyway, yes, how do I approach this tension now? ",19Aug2018,1

My first year I dropped out half-way through because I wasn't ready for that type of commitment. The second and third years, however, I wasnt invited back to any of them about half way through Rush /Recruitment Week.

(If you don't know, Rush works as a process of elimination. Day 1-2 you visit all 10+ sororities, day 3-4 you visit about 5-7 of them (or less), day 5 you visit about 3 (or less), and day 6 you ""Bid,"" which means you choose which one you want to get into the most. At the same time, the sororities are asking back different girls that chose them. I hope that made sense ;-;)

Today ended Rush week 2018. I know about the reputation sororities often have on college campuses, but I see friends of mine that are in them all decked out and hugging each other, having fun at events, covered in glitter and fun stuff, etc. and I can't help but feel left out and wish I had been 'one of the chosen ones.'

fast forwards a few weeks, i cant stop thinking of her. At this point, im still torn and im regretting not at least trying to get to know her better. I come up with this plan.

The event went well, i got to get to know janet a lot better than before. However, i sorta friendzoned myself cause i felt really insecure about myself.

Thus, although it killed me, i made a new really good friend who had a lot in common with me.

Fast forwards a couple more weeks, and my own friends are setting up a house party. Just drinks and chill. I ask janet if she wants to come too and shes like sure. So, she gets to hang out and meet all my friends, cause i think shes a really cool girl. So, my friends get to know her, and they seem to get along even better or something. I feel a bit jealous but im like whatever, im not ready for a relationship yet.

Anyways, janet and i keep talking and over time, she starts to stray away. i asked her what is up, and shes just like nothing much, etc. and our friendship sorta just died down. We just stop talking and im like huh, guess she doesnt wanna be friends anymore. However, the next day, janet posts a picture of her and all my friends i introduced her to. I was shocked and mad. i didnt know why i wasnt invited or why she stopped talking to me and so i asked my friends. it turns out, they told her that i had a crush on her (since i never gave them an update), and because of that, she didnt want to be friends anymore. 

This all happened in june, and as of today, i honestly at this point dont know what im supposed to do. idk if im supposed to laugh, cry, be mad. I lost all trust in my friends, who betrayed me. I lost hope in the one that i felt love towards. my depressions come back, i feel like no one wants anything to do with me. I have no idea what i did wrong. I didnt know that it was a sin and a crime to like someone. Please help me out.

tldr: i crushed on a girl, but i was insecure so i never asked her out. I let her meet my friends, who in private told her that i have been crushing on her for a long time. Obviously not liking me back, she cut me off, and thinks im not human. Yet, she continues to hang out with my friends that i introduced her to. At this point, i have lost trust and hope the vast majority of my friends and i also lost a new friend being her. What am i supposed to do? ",19Aug2018,19
94,"Hi. I have some compounding feelings going on, and I need some advice. There's a few different things going on, so please bear with me. 

I'm 23F and never been on a date, been in a relationship, kissed anyone, etc. I just sort of always thought it wasn't something I was supposed to do. I know that doesn't make a lot of sense since it's a natural part of life, but the way I grew up really fucked up how I see myself. I'm in therapy and working on it.  But I still have things like anxiety, abandonment issues, low self-esteem, body image issues, etc. Like I said, I'm really trying hard to work on these issues. They're preventing me from growing as a person, from being happy. I'm learning to accept that wanting to be loved is okay and not a sign of weakness. 

Last month, my close guy friend, who led me on for almost a whole year, suddenly told me about a girl he had been seeing for a few months. I'd been in love with him for months, so I was really confused and confessed my feelings. Tl;dr is even though what I did was selfish, he's not mad, wants to remain friends, etc. I told him he has to set the boundaries given everything... we talked for a few days, but we havent spoken in almost two weeks since then. I refuse to be the only person putting effort into maintaining this friendship.... after everything he said, for him to not put in any effort is really confusing and really hurts. But I guess I get it. This is how he sees our friendship, regardless of how important he says I am to him or how he says I'm one of his closest friends. I'm really trying to move on. I don't believe he never felt anything for me bc he actively flirted with me, checked me out, etc. But it doesn't matter. It's a dead end. I have to respect him and let go. And I'm *trying*.

So, I decided I would download a dating app, cuz clearly this whole meeting people IRL thing isnt working for me. I installed Bumble a few days ago..... I cant make myself swipe right..... like, swiping left isnt hard at all. But I just cant make myself do it. Declaring interest in someone makes me uncomfortable. I get anxious. And there's too much pressure by only having 24 hours. I don't want to match with someone and not message. I don't know. The whole thing is uncomfortable. Part of me is intrigued by the whole thing - matching with someone is kind of a little thrilling, right? But I guess part of me really isnt ready. I'm still in love with my friend. But I need to be ready. I need to move on. Im tired of being lonely, of feeling that ache in my chest. But it feels like I would be using someone to do that, and I'm not okay with that. Like, I genuinely want to connect, but I'm emotionally conflicted right now.

My best friend just told me last week that she got a boyfriend. I'm happy for her. But now literally all my friends have significant others. All of my roommates have significant others. And I guess I'm kind of scared. I'm the odd one out. It's not rational, but I guess I'm scared they're all going to walk away from me, that I'm going to become less important to them and then I won't have anyone. I'm also starting to reach the point where my lack of history is *weird*. And so I feel like I'm in a strange and uncomfortable position, what with personal and societal pressues, my issues, my wants, my fears. And I don't know how to make heads or tails of this.",19Aug2018,1
95,"I’ve been close friends with this girl for years. She’s been my friend through getting a relationship, a tough breakup, and helped me out if need be.

96,"Im a junior in high school. Summer before sophomore year I had a girlfriend who went to a different school whom I was together with for a month then she outright cut all contact with me and avoided me. Fast forward a year or so and Im here with a crush on a girl (my first crush since then) with a locker next to me in high school, shes new to the school, and beautiful. She smiles at me in the hallways and such, and we talk at our lockers, but my fear is that shes faking and I cant shake it. That relationship summer of sophomore year shot my confidence in these situations in the foot, and though i really like this girl, Im not only scared of the rejection, but also the fact that she could lie to me until she finally cuts contact with me. And then there's the possibility that she doesn't like me, and then i embarrass myself and then have to see this girl every day for the rest of my years at this high school. And have no chance with her. Its a shitty situation to be in. I really want to trust her but I cant, just by instinct. But i think more of the problem is my fear of her not liking me at all. Any assistance is appreciated.

PS: That ex-girlfriend did end up unblocking me and telling me that \*""She needed her space""\*, fucking bullshit.",19Aug2018,1

102,"I'm a Mormon student attending BYU as a Junior and currently going through a faith transition. I'm looking at transferring schools to be closer to family and sanity, since BYU is driving me up-the-wall. The downside to this is that ASU, the school I'm looking at transferring to, would increase my graduation time significantly. I have around 3 semesters left at BYU, which would transfer to about 5 semesters at ASU. Is it worth it to transfer over to ASU, or should I just tough it out at BYU and hope I don't go crazy?

103,"I currently work for a tech company in the retail side of things. 

Shortly after being hired I was given a promotion by the managers for a role that would allow me to be more hands on with the work I do which I was super excited about. I was told that my training would start shortly after my promotion got approved. It was approved back in June and I still have no training. 

A few weeks went by and I was pulled to the side by the manager of the store I work in and was told that my training would be pushed back due to the people that were currently in my role were not working up to par with what they had wanted so they would re-train those people and then move forward with my training. I was okay with this hiccup in the plan but it has to be done. I was told that my training should start mid July, great. Mid July comes and goes, all the re training had been completed and they've even started training other people who got the role after me already, so naturally I asked again seeing as other people are getting the training I still need. Two days after asking I was pulled aside once again and told that due to customer reviews and time spent per customer they were going to have to             re-evaluate my promotion as its not what they want. This was understandable, I just needed to work a little harder and I would get my training, until I asked a different manager who was not aware of my situation to look at my numbers with me. We sat down and pulled up everything, My scores were good, my time was right on with what they said it had to be and everything was good, I was told I was doing great, This is when I asked him why I was told that I wasn't doing good and would be demoted to which he was concerned about because he wasn't told anything about me being promoted or demoted and that he would look into it. 

I still continue to push hard and get my numbers in better shape and I manage to get them even better, today I asked once again right before my manager was leaving for the day, She told me that I had been doing great but that my training was still in question because she had heard that someone had seen me on my phone during a Sexual Harassment training video and that I shouldn't have been so because of this I wouldn't be trained yet. Another excuse she gave me in the same 5 minute conversation was that she had been away on vacation and was still trying to catch up with things and so ***no one*** would be getting training. later on that day I found out that two other people would be receiving the training I still need starting Tuesday and that someone else had started their training for another Role today as well. 

I've been told I should contact HR by other employees who know whats going, I just don't know if this would be the right approach, I don't want them finding out and then we have tension or they just straight up start being negative towards me. I genuinely like the job and enjoy the people, but its now been 3 months since I've been promoted and still have no training. ",19Aug2018,1

105,"Throwaway. 100% serious. 

I (33F) am in love with my doctor (59M) of more than a decade.  Without giving away too much personal detail: 

I had a life-threatening illness in my early twenties and he is one of my many specialists. We are both single, never married, no kids, straight, we have mutual friends we both avoid for no reason, and are both in the medical field, we even live in the same area. 

I have had lasting problems from the illness, and have many doctors, but he is my favorite. He is well known in his specialty and is known to go the extra mile for his patients. He is everyone’s favorite doctor. Yes, he is much older, but sexy, and I’ve always had a crush. 

He has always been professional and respectful, but we definitely push the boundaries of a doctor-patient relationship with our conversations. I’m relatively bright, and he is brilliant. We play off each other’s intellect and mutual interests. Lately, our connection has deepened, and our consults are like the best dates ever, beginning and ending with long hugs with back stroking/patting. 

Last consult, he fumbled through my imaging (he is NOT a radiologist) pretending to show me my (normal-looking) images while he poured his precious heart out to me. About his existential crisis and misanthropic loneliness. About the despair he encounters in his job. About the fallible design of the human body. About the movie Noah’s Ark. About how he always wanted kids and just it never happened, but how he wonders now what kind of world he’d be bringing them into, etc. I just stared and listened actively with my best golden-retriever “I adore you and relate to all your emotions” smiley face.  

The nurse knocked and opened the door and said, “Um, when will you be done so I can tell your next patient?” He was like, “we’re almost done, 5 minutes.” Then, she closed the door and we suddenly found ourselves on the topic of sexual tension and jealousy in work relationships, as he wished me luck on my new job. In a lighthearted tone, I said something to the effect of, “I trust no one, that’s why I’m single. Live close, visit often is about as far as I’ll go.” And he smiled at me and said, “Well, I’ll be here. I’m not going anywhere.”  

O. M. G. 

I was so nervous and scared that I’d lose control of myself, I rushed out of there flustered. Now, I’m obsessing over what he said. I’ve adored him for so long. What if he feels the same, but can’t reciprocate because he is my doctor and works for a public hospital? What if he is just depressed and vulnerable and not really into me, but trusts me to listen? Perhaps it is simply too taboo for him to consider?

The laws and regulations in my state basically frown upon doctor-patient romance, but if the patient gets a new doctor first, then it’s legally OK to go for it. I’d even be ok with keeping it on the DL for a long time. The thing is, if he doesn’t feel the same, or doesn’t want the relationship to evolve, I would be making a *huge* mistake by changing doctors and propositioning him, because he is the *best*. It could also end in disaster and make things even more awkward. 

Still, life is too short for this tension and mystery to go on much longer. Despite the age difference and the doctor-patient relationship, I want to give him my all and do my best to make him the happiest man alive until one of us croaks (probably me). 

If it is meant to be, it should be done the right way. Last thing I want is to get him in trouble, make him uncomfortable, or ruin his career and reputation. 

Reddit, I’m trying not to be a lunatic, but what he said is killing me inside, and I’m emotionally repressed and obsessive to begin with... If I’m just completely insane and need to move on, I can accept that. Please tell me how to proceed.  Respectfully, Patient ",19Aug2018,1

107,"hey everyone, I am in need of some relationship advice.

To try to condense things and not ramble on about shit I will try summarize all of this as much as possible. Thanks to anyone who is actually willing to read this and give me their feedback.

Ive been talking to this girl from my school (college) for about five months. Started off with her breaking up with her ex and immediately coming to me as a rebound. I mean this girl literally hit me up the second after she broke up with her ex. 
Side note: I have been notorious for picking up girls right after a breakup. 

Anyways I snapchat her for a while and eventually she ends up inviting me to her sorority formal. So at this point things start to get a bit more serious. At this point im hanging out with her on a daily basis. Then at the end of the semester we had a bit of a falling out, and we just kind of left in a limbo state where I didnt really know what was good. 

I pretty much dont say anything to her for the first couple weeks of summer, but at the end of may she finally hit me up. At this point I hadnt talked or seen her in a few weeks so this was a nice suprise. So after three weeks we start texting each other again. She tells me how she misses me and we should hang out etc. etc. you get the point. 

We start texting each other for a while and things get pretty personal. So we text each other every single day for the whole month of July. She asks me to come over and hang out a decent amount of times, but she lives close to an hour away, and they were weird circumstances. I digress but I finally go over to see this girl at the beginning of August. 

Note: I paid one of my friends to drive me to this bar (close to 40 mins away), and soaked a $45 Uber charge to get back after seeing her. 

So I go to the bar and I finally meet up with this girl. Everything seems to be going well for the most part and she is really happy to see me. We ended up making out for a bit, and I ended that night on good terms. But I went through a lot of hoops and hurdles just to get to the bar to finally see her. 

This is where everything starts to go bad for me:
Flash forward to the next week, and I meet up with her again but this time its where I go to college. I needed to move stuff up to my apartment so I was in town the same time as her. She asks me to go to her apartment to hang out. So obviously I go over there, but when I call her to open up the door shes not even fucking there. She literally called me to go to come over, and shes not even at the apartment like what the fuck is good with that? 

I end up meeting her at the bar later that night and she seems to pretty much dub me the whole night. This was not even a week later from the point when we hooked up. SO im thinking to myself like wtf did I do, why is this girl just not into me this week? She starts chatting up all my friends and shit, but doesnt really talk to me. SO at this point idk if shes trying to make me jealous or if shes just a flat out hoe. I just know for damn sure it was making me pretty damn pissed off. Later that night she ends up ignoring my calls and texts and answers my friends texts instead. Which made me even more fucking pissed.

Note: If you cant tell im getting even more mad as im typing this. 

To say it lightly I was pretty fucking dissapointed with this night, and the fact that she was ignoring me at the bar, etc. etc. 

The next day she texts me like were all fine and dandy, but I was honestly still pissed off from the night before. I play it cool and pretend like it didnt bother me all that much. 

The next week we were talking but not as much as we were before. There definitely seemed to be something going on, like some tension growing between us. (I dont know if its because we both have big egos or what the fuck it is.)

Fast forward another week (this past thursday) and I end up going to the same bar as her. I didnt necesarily intend to go to the same bar, just worked out that my friends wanted to go there as well. Sooooo this is where it gets just great. Long story short I got kicked out of the bar and had to sneak back in. She texts me to come and see her. but after I got back in though she wouldnt leave her spot at a table to come over to me. I found this to be annoying, but I finally go over to her and her giant group of fucking friends and say hey. I try to sit down next to her, but she says ""my friend is sitting here and hell be right back""

SO at this point Im like did you really just say that. I just snuck back into the goddamn bar and walked all the way over here and I cant even sit down! SO I just have some petty bullshit talks with her, but I leave cause I was fucking pissed. This girl will literally be the biggest flirt when were texting and how she misses me and shit, but when it finally comes time to actually see each other she completely fades on me. This is extremely off putting because one minute I think she loves me, but when I see her she just dubs the shit out of me and pretends I dont exist. 

Im not sure why she is playing these games with me, but im pretty fucking sick of it. I'm not trying to have a superficial relationship with someone over the phone, when they act totally fake when I'm actually around them. 

Today (Saturday): Ive been trying to focus on more important shit in my life, and not focus on her. I feel like if we give each other some space then well be okay, because Im not even joking would text her all day and that would consume the enterity of my thoughts. 
She texted me later this night and was being playful, but I was honestly being a dick and being short with her. She finally texts me 
""Im confused, I feel tension"" 
me: What do you mean? (I knew exactly what the fuck she meant)
her: Idk I just feel rattled 
Me: well okay...thats pretty vague.

She then proceeds to post a pic with a dude from her highschool on snap and say ""best formal date ever""
I know this is a direct shot at me to post this, and she is just doing it to make me pissed. 

In Summary: This is just one giant rant about whats been bothering me for the past couple months. I really do have strong feelings for her, and I think she does too but I dont understand a lot of it. Obviously I cant fill in every single detail but this is the best overall descirption I can give of the scenario. My main dilemma is that I have literally wasted my entire summer focusing on this one girl, and things are seeming to be falling apart as soon as we are going to go back to school. We both move back in three days and I didn't really want to go back into the semester with this kind of mindset. This girl is absolutely gorgeous, but has been putting so much extra stress upon my life. So Reddit I ask you this very question. Do I pursue this girl for the first couple of weeks and see how things work out, or do I cut my losses and just start the whole process over and find someone new? 

If youve actually made it to the end thank you I appreciate you, and Im sorry for the emotional ranting I feel like I just have to vent in some fashion.",19Aug2018,2
108,"Let’s just clarify one thing: I’m not suicidal, just extremely depressed.

With that said, let me lay down my conundrum. I have a terrible nicotine addiction(used to smoke now I vape,) I weigh 350 pounds, I’m addicted to video games, have practically no real friends as I talk to none of the ones I had because I lost my job and I have terrible spending habits. 

On top of all of this I failed my first year of college because I took too many credits in my first semester and opted to retry a few classes I failed. I crashed my car back in November and now I have zero reliable transportation methods. I lost the only job within a reasonable walking distance for my level of (non-)athleticism and I now am starting another year of college with a loan to pay with no money, no car to get to a job and public transit so terrible I can’t reliably get anywhere and my nicotine addiction is putting me in more debt by the week.

I feel lost, I feel hopeless and I feel like I can go nowhere.

And I wanna know, do you think it's possible to contact him in any way without being a creep or weirdo? like a letter, twitter, instagram, mail?

111,"I have a Samsung TV from about 2010, and whenever I make changes to the visual settings set as contrast, backlight, and brightness, the TV will *always* flash black and then reset the settings I prefer to the default ones.

This means that among other things, the contrast is set to 100 (which renders anything I'm watching to look darker than ""The Godfather"") and the aspect ratio is adjusted strangely, leaving the image cropped and distorted. 

I've tried many things, but nothing seems to work. Does anyone know what to do in a situation like this?",19Aug2018,1
112,"Hello guys! Maybe you could shed some light on this weird weird thing that's happening to me with everything.

So basically, there are small projects or things I want to do, I think of myself as a simple person who seeks simple pleasures. But when I think of doing something, I don't wanna do it, I don't do it but I'd like to do it. I'd understand if it was something that's ""boring"" or that requires discipline, like learning a skill, I know that kind of thing takes effort not to quit but right now I'm talking of exclusively pleasurable activities. Things that I would do in the past without giving it a second thought.

 I don't know how long I've had this problem but if I had to take a guess it's been 2 years or so since I graduated college so who knows maybe there's something there. I actually don't remember my life when I was in college, not that much, I can recall events of it but I'm not sure what my routine consisted of back then. Because of my situation I've spent almost all my leisure time on a computer so there's that. Me being on the computer almost exclusively is something that hasn't changed since the moment I stepping in highschool. I'm 25 old nowadays. 

My life is and has been in a situation or so to speak so there's no big thing I'm attempting to do, they're minor things, here are a few examples:

\-I want to watch Anime/Tv Shows I've put off, NOPE.

\-I want to play certain games of the past I've always wanted to experience, NOPE.

\-I got a closed beta Key for this game and I played it a little, I wanna play it consistently, NOPE.

So what I end up doing is talking to friends or taking part in online chats to talk nonsense or watching some youtube videos. I'd like to spend my time doing the things above rather than these things but ALAS nope.

 I'm open to questions.",19Aug2018,1
114,"Sorry for the long post! 

I just recently had a talk with my boyfriend about acceptance and moving forward. We had already talked about his hurt and mine, however he feels like I haven’t fully talked it out and I think he is right. 

Backstory: 

Several years ago (I was 18), I had connected with an old high school friend on tinder and we got together. I had met up with him twice prior to the event, and I always had a friend with me during those two previous engagements, however my friend left me during the third. 

Some backstory: The guy I met up with was about two years older than me. We got along fine and I saw him as a good friend and attractive. One day I knew I was going to meet up with him again for the third time and I assumed we were going to go a little further. But I made it clear that I wasn’t interested in going “all the way”. I texted him this prior to meeting up. 

That night I went to his place with my friend and we had a few drinks. I was nervous so I had several shots and was extremely intoxicated. That didn’t stop him from pursuing more than just second base even though I made it clear I didn’t want to go further although it wasn’t made clear in the moment. During the whole night I was going in and out of consciousness, and looking back it was obvious I was in no position to give consent.  
(Also during this time, the friend I came with had left me with this guy in his apartment in a different city, he left because he had work in the morning). 

The next morning was rough to say the least, and I even texted and APOLOGIZED to him, who technically raped me because I knew I was a wasted mess. I say “technically” because I honestly feel that what happened was partly my fault, because I made the choice to drink. 

I don’t feel anger or hate toward the boy who violated me even though I made it clear that I didn’t want any of that, I feel like it was more of my fault than anything else and that I am to blame. 

I just want to know, should I go and talk to someone who has experience with these situations or should I just let it go? 

TL;DR:

A guy pretty much raped me and I feel like I am to blame. I don’t feel anger or hate towards the person, I just feel like it was my fault and I should let it go, but I think it still has an effect on me, even though I don’t dwell on this. Should I talk to someone about this professionally? Or just let it be as it is because what’s done is done?",19Aug2018,1
115,"I've never been to a concert before but have always wanted to. I'm a fan of Metric and when I saw that they were on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins I knew this wasn't a chance I wanted to miss. I'm pretty into getting the best experience out of things so I bought center-stage front row tickets. I know its my fault for buying two pretty pricey tickets with no actual idea if I could get someone to go with me. I wanted to prove to myself that I could go out and do something like this so thats why I bought these tickets. I told myself I thought it would be worth that hefty price even if it was just me, and that I'd try to have fun without anyone.

I've had a pretty hard time the last few months and I wanted this to be something I could treat myself to so I did't feel so lonely and isolated in myself..

Although I have many dear friends and a loving family, i feel this way from time to time. And it usually hits me suddenly and leaves me in this sad state for days and sometimes weeks. Along with feeling alone, i have also this feeling of being lost, underachieving and not being of any value or worth. Is this a normal thing to go through given that Im quite young (20 years old)? Because I realize that I still have years of college and goals and achievements are probably going to come later in life. But still, this feeling still finds a way to bother me nonetheless.

117,"Going 35 mph. The car just ahead of me on the right breaked really hard, so they didn’t hit he dog, but then the dog ran right in front of me and I was unable to stop. 

There were some cars behind me but I didn’t want to slam on my breaks and potentially create a pile up wreck. 

A girl in the car next to me driving away then proceeded to scream ‘DUMB WHORE!!’ at me as she drove away, after seeing what happened(?). 

After, I called 911 to report it and drove back. It appeared dead.  I’ve spent the last 2 hours bawling my eyes out feeling guilty and sick to my stomach, as I am both a dog lover and part time dog sitter. 

I was actually driving across town to dog sit when this happened. 

I don’t have the best track record driving, as I’ve been in 1 accident before and have taken out a few tires on curbs, but I really feel like the dog just...threw itself in front of my vehicle. It was dark when this happened.

It's hard to explain but as a child watched mom n dad go through a nasty divorce and dad ended up w moms best friend. Being 6 and the divorce being nasty, I had to hear a lot of fucked up things about both parents dad calling mom a pill head/Slut mom talkin shit about dad etc...... fast forward freshman year, I'm on the right track playing baseball for my school but not seeing much time. Baseball was my life @ the time. Sophomore year mom moves me schools bc we didn't have the $ to compete in this highly political school district. Was still a lot of daddy ball.  I decide I'm not gonna play bc I'm a dumbass. Fuck up with the drugs even tho I'd say I'm responsible. Started selling weed was better than everybody made a lot of ect.... sold some other drugs. Now I'm 18 just graduated and realizing that I really fucked up. I'm just not even the same person anymore.

119,"Been at this job for two months. Applied for an office job - was supposed to be just reviewing data and running reports - typical Data Analyst desk job. (this is for a large and well known company) Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for the opportunity but holy crap...it's a shit show. 

The first week should have been a giant red flag, when they didn't have any of the new hire paperwork completed,security told me I wasn't on the new hire list, we had no computers, we had no desks, we had no office supplies and our trainer literally was just hired, so they had no idea what they were doing either. Two weeks in they threw us on the phones, with absolutely NO training during our third week in. The phone calls are from upset third parties that apparently our department deals with and they consistently berate us (Answering phones calls was NOT listed on the job description or was mentioned in any interview prior to hiring or even in the sad excuse for orientation.) 

My nerves are literally shot, and I am in a constantly on the brink of panic or hysterics. My computer was down for three days, THREE DAYS with literally no IT help or intervention from management. I had to sit and twiddle my thumbs for three days knowing full well, no one had the time or resources to cover any work I was unable to get to. When my computer was finally up and running, I was expected to work overtime and stay late to catch up, for an issue that was out of my control. I am a single parent....there is no way I am able to stay until 8pm each  night. (It's a 9-5) I hate this job. 

Long story short, the workload has only gotten worse - but like I said, the pay is decent and my coworkers are all great, aside from the clueless management. Am I being a big baby about this?

*I won’t be putting the real names of anything or anyone*

Ok so this might be a long one. I work at a retail store that is targeted towards teens. Since school is starting back up pretty soon we have been getting busier and thus needing more staff. My manager hired a ton of people back in July. We were sort of desperate for all the help we could get so pretty much everyone who applies gets the job. We have had to have lots of meetings/discussions about following the rules, smoke breaks, gossiping, and what not. So our manager, Kara, has been pretty strict about things. Well recently money has been going missing from the registers. $10 here, $20 there. We had all assumed that either the new hires are not good at giving change, or someone has been stealing. Yesterday my coworker named Casey was visiting with a friend from school. They were talking about managers being strict and what not. Casey’s friend works at a well known store next to the mall. Kara had told us she worked as a manger at that particular store a 6 months age. She told us that she had quit because she couldn’t keep up with the hours there as she had just gotten pregnant again. Shortly after she got hired as a manager here. (At our store managers and co-managers do not get paid hourly, so they get paid with commission. So they don’t even have to work a lot, as long as they are reaching their sales goals they get paid well.) We has asked him if he knew Kara and he did. We then find out that Kara did not quit her job, but she was fired for stealing almost $10,000 from the cash registers. This obviously blew our damn minds because she seemed like a trustworthy person and a model employee. We decide to email our district manager anonymously by creating a fake email account. But then we lost access to the account so we decided to wait to email her again with a different email. Later on when we are closing the store, Kara is counting the tills and says something along the lines of “Wow everytime Ellie is working, money goes missing” to Casey. We find this kind of odd of her to say because she basically accused someone of stealing money. I assume she is trying to cover her steps by pinning it on someone. Well this morning Casey tells Ellie what Kara said. Ellie obviously gets super pissed off and decides to call corporate and tell them about Kara’s past. Ellie then confronts Kara about what she said last night. Kara tells Ellie that she hasn’t reported to money missing and that she’s been replacing the missing money with her own personal funds. I personally doubt that because Kara talks about struggling financially sometimes. We don’t really know if anyone will respond to us because there is only one manager and our only co-manager just quit three days ago. 
My question is this: What should I do? Should I pull her aside and talk to her about what we heard? Or do I let corporate contact her? ",19Aug2018,1
123,"First off, this is a throw away account. I just don't want this to be connected to my main since I'm usually a silly shitpost guy on it, and find it hard to all of a sudden make something this serious. (if that makes any sense)

Generally, growing up was very tough for me. Was molested 3 times by different people in my life I though I could trust (two in elementary school between 1st and 3rd grade) and the other was in middle school. I was on the wrong end of so many of those ""Hey, I dare you to ask X out then reject them immediately hahaha!"" things from elementary to end of middle school. Things sort of brightened up in middle school, but that's mainly because I'd just refuse to go outside or become close to people, and felt I could never be hurt if I just never let people into my life in the first place.

All of those events put together really fucked me up and gave me sever trust issues. Whenever anyone would try to become close with me my only thoughts are ever ""they don't really like me or care"", ""they're only pretending they like me because they think of it as some sort of joke"", ""they only want me to take advantage of me"", ""they'll just go behind my back and hurt me because humans don't actually care for each other like that"", ""it's all out of pity/ to make them look better"", etc.

I know these thoughts are irrational, but at the same time I still feel their very true. I've been able to get over it to an extent where I managed to make a close group of friends, and even had some people say they liked me (people I didn't know personally so I felt it was easy to assume it was more of a lust or something shallow since I never talk outside of my friend group), but I'm just too afraid to let anyone into my personal bubble and keep everyone at an arm's length emotionally and physically. I'm tired of feeling lonely, sad, and empty, but I can't get myself to allow someone to fill the void. 

I'm so scared of it since I've never seen anyone be genuine about their feelings towards me like that, and always feel everyone always has some sort of ulterior motive when they in most things they do/say. Same feeling goes for when people suddenly try to get close to me in a relationship sort of way. How do I get over it so I can possible feel happiness for once?

TLDR; How do I get over my severe trust issues to start a relationships?",19Aug2018,1
124,I have the urge to piss on my dogs head. I’ve pissed all over my house and cat. I just find some relief in pissing on something I own. I hope to piss on my daughter one day when she’s born. ,19Aug2018,0
125,"I really don’t have anyone I can go to looking for advice about this. I don’t have friends, and my parents are grim about my options to say the least. I understand I may be wrong or maybe there are things I haven’t considered. I’m looking for advice, a new perspective, or your success stories if you’ve been in a similar situation. I will try to make this as concise as I can while still providing specific details. TL;DR at the end. 

I am 22. Neither myself or my family can afford to put me in college right now. I didn’t make great grades in high school so financial aid that won’t put me into debt for the rest of my life isn’t an option (I believe?) I have I still have no clue what I’d even go for or what I want to do with my life. I did go for about a month after high school, I wanted to be a nurse at that time. It was a BIG financial burden to my parents, they were basically going to live on ramen noodles and ruin themselves financially to try to put me through school. My guess is it would’ve lasted a year then they’d tell me they can’t help me anymore and I’d have to stop going anyway, although they deny that. My little brother was also diagnosed with something he desperately needed treatment for around the same time. They say they would have put my college before his treatment, which I didn’t and don’t agree with. I had also been having lots of second thoughts about becoming a nurse, and decided it wasn’t for me. It was too late to change my classes, so I dropped out. 

I’ve worked as a CNA and Med Tech at assisted living centers and other long term care facilities since I was 17. It’s what I know and it’s what I’m really good at. It also pays much better than say, retail or office work. Not to mention fast food and other similar jobs that are easy to get. It still doesn’t pay enough for me to pay all my bills and save to move out or go to school. I started bartending when I was 21, while working as a CNA as well. This had me working 6-7 days a week, every week. I’ve always struggled with depression and bad habits, but this schedule really messed with me and I couldn’t handle it after doing it for about a year. I was doing damage to myself and to people around me because of being overworked and so stressed. This is when I made the most money, I was actually able to start saving small amounts of money after bills were paid. 

Being a CNA and a bartender are dead end jobs if you don’t want to advance in the medical field or be a bartender til you die. I can’t do it for the rest of my life, I’m well aware. How can I figure out what I want to do? The few things I’m interested in attempting cost money and time I don’t currently have. Working in the cannabis industry, teaching English overseas or going into psychiatry all cost money to get started. I’d have to move, go to college or ESL school, etc. 

Do I have no real options? Am I lazy? Is working a job I would loathe more important than being happy and healthy? How can I find something that meets my needs and gets me where I need to be? I feel lost and alone. My family has a lot of problems in addition to the financial ones. I am not encouraged, I don’t have a lot of support. In fact my parents barely talk to me or my brother and barely know anything about me as a person even though we live in the same house. If I were to bring this up to them, and I’ve tried, the answer is basically “We are miserable too. That’s life. Suck it up. You don’t have to be happy, you have to be successful”. 

I’m looking for a happy life, it feels unattainable. 

TL;DR- I am stuck in a dead end job that doesn’t pay enough to cover my bills half the time, but it pays more than most jobs that would hire someone with no experience. I am having a really hard time making goals and finding out what I even want to do with my life career wise. The things I’m interested in require schooling or money I can’t swing right now to get started. I have an unsupportive family. I have no friends. I’m looking for advice from outsiders looking in and people who’ve been in my situation. Thank you for your time",19Aug2018,1

I used to get into a lot of trouble at a pretty young age, I started drinking when I was 12 and smoking at 13 but I cleaned up for a while and completely stopped for a while. Recently I got in trouble because I ended up drinking twice this summer and got caught both times. My mom has been threatening to make me quit my job due to this. This job means the world to me and honestly it really gives my life a lot more meaning. This job is also most of the reason I changed myself and stopped doing stupid stuff. Unfortunately I fell back and made a couple mistakes this summer. My mom has been pretty pissed and she's been verbally and physically abusive since it happened. She's been telling me I'm a terrible person and I have problems and she doesn't love me. This job means a lot to me and I want to keep it but I don't know if I want to be stuck in a house with all this conflict. Honestly I don't think I'll ever be perfect and completely stop my bad habits. It's difficult to do, but I certainly have cut back. I have the option of moving in with my dad who's rarely home about 45 minutes away. They have a chick fil a 2 miles from his house that's hiring right now and I could apply there and try to start fresh. Problem being that I don't have a good relationship with my dad and I would lose the 1 friend I have if I did so. My dad is strict and doesn't like compromise. For example: my dad thinks that i shouldn't be allowed to wear shorts at all, he doesn't allow me to spend any of my money from work.
I have to save 100% and he's childish. He's 46 years old and he sits around watching cartoons all day and playing games on his phone. I could
make it work here or there but there are issues on both sides. If I move in with my dad I escape my mom who can be abusive at times but I have a good relationship with whenever we aren't fighting, or I could stay with my mom possibly lose my job because of her and not have to go to a new school and lose friends. I don't have a close bond with my dad and don't think I ever will and my job: I love the people there, but what's the point if I'm gonna lose it? I have no idea what to do. What's everyone's advice?

127,"Pardon the title. 2 AM post wont get many views, but why not ask for some advice.

I made a key:

A - Primary Friend - My school
B - Secondary Friend - Other school
G - B's girlfriend/My friend - My school

I got out of a long-term relationship half a year ago and i've been reconnecting with some friends. One of the friends i've known for a while (A) is friends with someone who up until now i've only been aquanted with, but we've hung out a few times and he's a pretty cool guy (B). I dont see B often at all, he goes to the university one town over, but i've been hanging out with my friendgroup at my college, which includes A and G, B's girlfriend. G initially got into the friendgroup because B brought her around with him, but she integrated and is more a part of it than he is. I've been hanging out with them all summer, and I caught some feelings for G a couple months ago. Now, I thought about her a lot and I always have a good time when she's around, but I knew that I couldnt do anything about it and decided we could only be friends.

Some context: She's nice, she's smart, and we talk and get along pretty well. Shes a freshmen and the rest of my friends, myself included, are sophomores. She's bubbly and fun, and since she's so nice to everyone I have a hard time determining whether or not she's flirting with me (I use that term loosly, because all that means is she talks and makes physical contact with me more than the other guys in the group. She still has a boyfriend.). I very well might be reading to much into it, but its what i've noticed.

However, last night I overheard A talking with another friend of mine, saying how B is waiting for her to find another guy(they've been dating 1.5 years and I guess he wants to move on). They say that he is just leading her on, and neither of them seem to be on board with what he's doing. Instantly, those thoughts I entertained months ago are back. What are the odds anyways? She's in my friendgroup, so that in and of itself is a predicament, but this on top of that creates an interesting situation. Firstly, should I ask her out at all? If so, should I attempt to wait until he breaks it off, or should I just try to hang out with her more, or maybe something else? Should I talk to A or B? Since she's a freshman, should I avoid it to let her be her in this new environment? There's just a lot going on here, and maybe some of your thoughts could help me decide what to do. ",19Aug2018,1
128,"Been friends with someone since college, over ten years ago. I was part of his wedding party, and him in mine. We don't talk regularly, but see each other and catch up every few months, with a sprinkling of texts here and there. 

This year, we both had tragedies fall upon our families. His father died completely unexpectedly, and mine was the victim of a drunk driver and lost part of his leg. 

His dad died first, back in January. I dropped everything, drove two hours to see him and be at the wake. To be there for my friend, without asking. 

My dad's accident happened in June - I haven't gotten so much as a text. Not even as little as an acknowledgement to one of my several Facebook posts updating on his condition. 

I realize death is worse than losing a leg, but both are still tramatic incidents that, to me, dictate emotional support from close friends. Even it's it's merely an acknowledgement - ""Sorry that happened"", and move on. Just to show the person you're there for them, whether they need you or not. 

What should I do? I feel weird coming at him about this, and I know he knows what happened, so it's not just ignorance. ",19Aug2018,1
129,"I'm not sure whether or not I should return to university in September. Everything is prepared for me to return, but I've been battling mental illness for the last few years. The doctor managed to get my psychosis under control awhile ago, but I'm still struggling with depression.

I'm scared that if I return, I'll just end up flopping out and failing (my instinctive reaction when I'm getting overwhelmed is to disappear and avoid the problem). On the flip side, I'd like to return because I'm getting fed up of doing nothing every day, but I also don't want to fail; pissing away so much money would destroy me, and I already feel like a failure - having it reinforced would not help.

I don't know what to do. I feel like both options are bad choices.",19Aug2018,1
130,"Some setup to try and keep this post as brief as I can. I'm in my early 40s, married, father of two young children. I live about 1,500 miles away from my mom, who is in her late 60's. I love her dearly, always have, always will and overall we have a fantastic mother/son relationship. 

She's retired now, and has been for a few years, and my impression of how she spends her days and weeks are that she spends the majority of her time obsessing over how much she misses her grandkids, a considerable amount of time watching videos on Facebook, and the rest of the time inside doing very little for herself. I've tried to have some serious conversations with her about how she could use her time better, but it doesn't seem to register. A quick browse of her Facebook page regularly reveals nothing interesting of her, but photo after photo of her grandkids, to the point of it being obsessive. 

Secondly, and though I'm sure that many people will say ""moms always worry, that's just how they are,"" my mom is an irrational worrier and ruminator. She loves to give unsolicited advice without ever pondering whether or not the recipient would know it. I've had to tell her so many times that it's bothersome, that it makes me feel stupid, and even gave her a way to analyze whether or not she should dish out advice: ask herself if a reasonably smart, somewhat successful adult would know what she's about to say, and if so, to just keep it to herself. For years I've felt like I get no credit for my achievements in life, adulthood, etc. when I'm literally being told things like ""remember that doorknobs are the dirtiest thing in the doctor's office."" We're talking life 101 advice along the lines of ""remember to put your underwear on before you put your pants on"" type of stuff. 

We've talked about this before and I've told her that my impression is that her ""currency"" in life is wishing she could change things for other people, caring excessively, and emotion. She's often so serious; you can just see the look on her face, the mood in her eyes in any one moment that she's just looking for something she can change, have someone do differently, etc. 

Also, she constantly veers towards the negative response to something rather than anything positive. Case in point: told her today that my wife and I got everything lined up with my wife's family to watch our kids later this year when we travel out of town for a wedding (her family is about an hour away from us). Rather than my mom getting excited for us, or simply saying ""that's great,"" she got stone faced, silent for nearly a minute while I told her about the trip (we were on FaceTime) and the first thing she says is ""well am I not going to get to see the kids any time soon?"" It's always like this. She brings on the self-pity as fast as possible. She's envious that other family gets to see the kids instead of her even though the reality of it is that my wife's family live close, and my mom doesn't. All she should have said was ""can we find a weekend for me to come up soon?"" But no. It's just instant read-between-the-lines that she's jealous of someone else's time with my kids, and gets upset about it.

Lastly, with regard to the conversation today, she had to throw out the same thing she always does for no reason, which was to ask if my wife has any problem with her being with us. We've had this conversation so many times, she always asks it, and the answer is that my wife has nothing wrong with her being with us, or us with them. What we don't like is her wearing out her welcome quickly by being imposing, thinking she can control our kids, her sense of seriousness all the time, etc. We never feel like we're just adults hanging out. There's always this air of walking on egg shells that some big conversation or big point or big generic advice is just around the corner. It's exhausting.

I really need to find a way to confront her about this in a peaceful way, because it's taking a toll on me every time it happens. I end up obsessing over it, bottling it up, worrying too much about when the next moment comes up that I feel this way, or how long it will take to fade away. She constantly sets herself up for disappointment or to be let down, because she builds up big ideas, big hopes to change things. 

So, the advice I'd like is about how to as nicely as possible talk to her and tell her a few things: 1) I love her, and I want better for her than the impression I get of her daily life, which is doting on her grandkids on Facebook, sitting on the couch, and obsessing over how much she misses her grandkids. 2) The big serious conversations about various things, and all the basic generic advice, need to stop, because to be honest it makes me feel like I'm stupid and that she can't see me for having a good head on my shoulders. 3) She needs to stop thinking / asking / wondering if my wife has issues with her. She doesn't, AT ALL. It's just what I said above, basically a desire for respect in our own home and a sense that she shouldn't be giving us advice about what we do with our kids. 4) I need her to find something to be happy about FOR HER, whether it's on her own or with my stepdad (her husband). Part of me wants to talk to him first, to just be honest and I say I don't know how to tell her this stuff, but what's his perspective and can he talk to her about how I feel? Can he stimulate any desire for her to do something every week for her that makes her happy.

Anyhow, long post, but any advice on the best path to take will be most appreciated. I've had some tough conversations with her before, some emotional conversations where I had to be really blunt to make my point, but this time around for some reason, I need it to feel more permanent, more long-lasting that I've politely expressed my feelings, how all this affects me, and that if she hate's seeing me feel this way, she's the one who can change things.

131,"So basically I've been at my job for a couple months, and I've casually ran into this worker who noticed I was kind of nervous over doing certain things (as any first timer would be, some don't judge me!) and basically he always offered his help and said if I need anything to let him know. Basic stuff, nothing weird.  

As time went on we talked more and more &amp; I realized he is just such a nice guy. I love his demeanor and his cheerful attitude, it's just really attractive. So yeah, I'm attracted to it. 

 Also at the end of our shift we just sit for like an hour talking about life and he never mentions his gf when he talks about going home and doing stuff. He listens to my at home drama and he gives advice and it's nothing more than that. We leave the building say our goodbyes and call it a day. 

The only thing is, I've sensed he likes talking to me at the end of the day, like  he wants me to stay so we can talk. Like he'll ask me if I have a minute, or if I'm sticking around.  

I am kind of a lonely person right now, and honestly I don't know if this is just in my head and he's just being nice or if he's interested in me in some way.  Should I stop the after hours talking and just go home? I'm only talking to him because I like him.  And honestly if he's taken why am I bothering right? Please someone knock some sense into me.

132,"Hello! I’m 21 and there’s a lot happening in my life right now. I know that it’s just growing up and growing older, and that’s just life. But I recently have felt the weight of all the change that’s happening hit me all at once. And if im being honest, I’m just plain scared. 

I’m finishing up college, I’ve had a boyfriend for 3 years now, we’ve been best friends for 10 and we’re trying to move in together very soon. Marriage isn’t far off at all. And I’m so incredibly excited about these two things.

I’ve lived where I’ve lived for my entire life. Same state, same area. All of my family is getting up and moving. I know my parents want to do the same. I’m very close with my family, and not having family around makes me feel very deeply about the whole thing.

I’ve wanted to stay in this location my whole life. I built up this entire life I wanted around staying where I’m at. I wanted a career first and I had this whole idea played in my head. Now all I can think about is how I can stay around family, and start my own family soon. My grandparents just sold their house and will be moving in less than a month to a different state. They’ve lived in that house for 30 years. I have a lot of childhood memories attached to that house. I’m having a harder time than I thought I would letting go of that. 

I’m scared to have to really take my career seriously. I’m scared of my family leaving. I’m scared of being alone. I’m scared of everything happening so fast in my life and I feel like I’m scared I won’t be able to process it all fast enough to just enjoy and soak up every moment I can while it’s happening right in front of me. 

How do I fully soak this all in while I have it now? How do I deal with all these changes happening? I know change is a part of life, that it never ends. It’s just all... a little bit more new to me? And I’m trying to figure out how to navigate it all. HOW do I navigate it all? ",19Aug2018,2

138,"I was a member of a forum that was popular a few years ago, but has since died down to pretty much nothing. It was just a casual forum where you could share your opinions and talk about small stuff. I spent a lot of time on said forum one summer, because I was lonely and had a bunch of free time. I made some friends on this forum so I made an email account for them to contact me at, and put it on my profile. This forum also had an option where you could message other members directly.

So this member, we’ll call him Kevin started emailing me and messaging me every day, but i didn’t think much of it because he probably just wanted to be friends and I thought he’d stop when he realized I was ignoring him/not interested. I stopped using the forum shortly after this started so I didn’t really think that much about Kevin. 

Recently I logged in to my account just for fun and this guy has been messaging me multiple times a day for for years even though I haven’t been on the site and I never responded! He made multiple accounts that he messaged and emailed me through. He will start off with something like ‘ hey, whitefarila baby, how are you doing today honey? you are so perfect’ and then finish with ‘ fine whatever; ignore me. you’re the one who will regret it bitch.’

139,"Hello, I need some advice involving someone I know (my cousin). I don't know where to start, so I guess I'll just start from the beginning. \[Warning: long post with no TLDR\]

Situation 1: This was about a year ago, I was hanging out with him and he told me about how Starbucks had this ""1 for 1"" promotion, which I interpreted as a free drink. He asked me if I wanted one if he was buying a drink so I said sure (it's a free drink, why not?). He also told me that if I didn't go with him he would've drank both by himself anyway so it was a good thing I was with him. Note that this was literally my first time doing anything involving Starbucks (I don't drink coffee) so I have no idea what the ""customs"" are. Anyway, everything seemed fine afterwards, but when I got home, I told my one of my brothers about it (they both know Starbucks) and he gave me this ""What??"" with this look of incredible disbelief. **Apparently, there's this unspoken rule when it comes to Starbucks where if there's a ""1 for 1"" promotion, the two people are supposed to split the bill.** (I'm not sure if it's limited to Starbucks). This was news to me. So, when we met again a couple of days later, I asked him about this rule and he said: ""yeah"". So we calculated the money I owed him and I paid up... yep. 

I never went to Starbucks ever again.

Situation 2: On to the more recent stuff. I have a spare laptop lying around and I've been trying to get rid of it for a while. None of my siblings' friends wanted it, nor does anybody I know. But he recently started talking about how slow his computer was and I was reminded of the spare laptop sitting on my shelf. I know from the technical specifications that it's better than his present computer, so I offered to give it to him. **I repeatedly emphasised that it was free** with no strings attached. He agreed to take it, said he'd come around to pick it up. One week later of him complaining about how bad his computer was, I offered again to deliver it to him and asked him when he was free. So we fixed a time and I went over with the laptop. I put it down, made sure everything was working before I left. Not a single ""Thank you"". Didn't seem to show any interest while I was setting it up either. I did give him many chances to rethink whether he really needed it or not but he said that he definitely wanted it so... I don't know why I felt slightly bitter afterwards. I thought that people usually say ""Thank you"" in situations like these but I could be wrong.

Situation 3: Alright, he's down with some kind of sickness that prevents him from leaving the house. But, there's a bookstore in my country hosting a limited-time promotion for a small discount on all their books. Apparently. Because I received a message from him asking me if I could buy it for him, **using the discount**. Now this discount wasn't the typical discount ""coupon"" I'm used to. It's some new ""digital coupon"" where you have to show a picture in order to get a discount. I've never used anything like it in my life. And I ended up forgetting about it completely by the time I got there. Before I made the purchase, I did message him again with the price. He said thanks and that it was cheaper than he expected, so, thinking I had all my bases covered, I went to checkout. The discount would've saved roughly $2-3. Now, I'm not trying to brag about wealth or anything, but to me, I don't think it's a big deal, as I usually just buy books at the price stated on the back cover. So I delivered the book to him and gave him the change. A week later, I received another message. He just remembered the discount and realised that he shouldn't have had to pay the full price. So, now I owe him that $2-3 which I'm supposed to give to him later or something when we meet.

I know some people might think it's pretty obvious as to what I should do but I honestly have no idea (that's why I'm here in the first place). 

Situation 1: **Was I actually supposed to pay half the bill?**

Situation 2: **Despite emphasising that it was free, is it wrong for me to still feel bitter that he didn't say ""Thank you""? Or does ""free and without strings"" also exempt the need for a perfunctory gesture of appreciation?**

Situation 3: **I did confirm the price before checkout...right?**

If the answers are too obvious, it probably seems like I'm lamenting. But like I said earlier, I genuinely don't know. I don't want to write a whole story about myself but I seem to have some form of autism. (Did an online test for Aspergers, came out ""likely"", but whatever, online tests.)

Thank you for reading this wall of text, hopefully you can give me some insight as to whether I'm being petty or not. I'm not sure if I should just stand my ground and insist that I don't owe him the money or admit that it's my fault and go with it (for 1 and 3). I've asked my nuclear family and they all agreed that the Starbucks rule should be followed even if I didn't know beforehand. Even if I shouldn't have had to pay him, I'm not going to demand the money back because it's over, but even so, I want to know if what I did was right.",19Aug2018,1
140,"Hi, so this is probably going to be a long one. Last May, I got together with my boyfriend. It was a really sudden and unexpected experience. I had known him for years but never really got to know him. He hit me up 11 days before I was moving to South Carolina for a surgery my  mom was having, and it just felt like the stars aligned or something. I felt like I loved him immediately. It was just this connection I can't even explain, and it's still there. I moved, things went downhill with my mom, I ended up moving back to NY to live with him. I was only 19 when this all happened. He is older than I am. Anyways, he's a recovering drug addict. I knew this way before we even got together. I learned more about his past experiences after we started dating and living together. He ended up relapsing really bad over the winter, but it was definitely a slow decline before shit truly hit the fan. His relapse was ugly, like really really ugly. He no longer was the man I fell so in love with. He turned into a different person. He even physically looked different, and not from drug use taking it's toll, but because I could see his soul was broken and his energy was dull and dark. He did a lot of hurtful things to me outside of having to watch him kill himself. I don't even want to get into those things because it honestly brings me shame and fear that people will think I am naive and stupid and lacking in self-respect for even getting back together with him, or for putting up with it as long as I did. 

He went to rehab and got sober. By this time we had already broken up and I had moved out, had to rent a room in a random lady's house because the environment had gotten so toxic. I had started to become toxic and was using drugs and alcohol as an escape myself. Even after moving out, breaking up, and before he left for rehab we still saw each other frequently and continued having sex. When he left for rehab, I felt relieved. Things started to improve, I knew I couldn't get back together with him. There had been so much hurt and betrayal. So much questioning about who this guy even was, how he was capable of such things cause he never appeared to be that way to me. Rehab was 30 days, he got out and somehow had the expectation we'd end up together after it all. That he went to rehab to fix our relationship. I still can't understand how he would expect such immediate readiness and forgiveness from me. A month goes by after he left rehab before I finally agreed to meet up with him and talk about it all. Seeing him brought up a lot of feelings. We started to text more, then we started to text everyday, next we started to hang out on the occasion. It eventually turned into us hanging out every Sunday which has always been both of ours days off work since we started dating. During these hang outs, I could see how much better he was doing. We connected again. Goofing around, conversations that fulfill my soul, him getting to know who I had become after all of that. I grew so much from that experience despite how painful it was. I started doing yoga everyday, eating healthy, this deep spiritual connection had grown as well. I felt really happy. I faced my issues of forgiving others and resentments and anger, realized I didn't want to be that person I was and have tried really hard to overcome a lot of my own issues. Things felt normal for us, except we weren't seeing each other romantically again at this point. But I kept having these creeping feelings of wanting to display affection towards him, my love towards him, and intimacy. You see, he's really all I have. I've spent my whole life moving from city to city, state to state.. no one sticks around. I dont have any close friends, I feel alone, but he's always been there. He's my best friend. He knows me like no one else does. Truly. I feel so raw, naked, and vulnerable around him and it doesn't terrify me. I have never felt such comfort-ability with another human being. Back to the point here, we started seeing each other again, I brought it up, figured we may as well test the waters. Things have improved. He has taken action to improve the things I was unhappy with even outside of his relapse. I notice them, I tell him I do and I appreciate all of his effort. But communication has always been a really big tough spot between him and I, we've discussed it a lot and how to work on things and how we need to work on things. Very little improvement. He seems physically incapable of being vulnerable enough to communicate during the more sensitive topics. My communication skills aren't great either, the difference being is I do talk but sometimes can be a little aggressive or I don't take the best approach. Sometimes blunt crosses into rude. I know I am not perfect. I can be really angry and feisty. I have been working on this area because it's something I've always struggled with that I want to move past. 

Okay, so FINALLY getting to the point here, we've been seeing each other romantically again since June. The past few weeks/month, these really icky anxieties and thoughts keep resurfacing. I am fear-stricken at points that he's using again or cheating on me. I just have a pit in my stomach sometimes. I can't tell if that pit is fear or intuition. Regardless, I brought it up to him, but not going to lie, it was brought up after he stopped replying to me at 930pm and I'm a night owl and around 3am FB messenger had said he'd been active like 20 minutes ago. I was already feeling paranoid before this incident. During the past few times we've had sex, he can't keep it hard, and that only ever happened in the past when he was on drugs. Or he's just been more negative lately. Sometimes I will catch him one-eyeing his phone. I just keep feeling suspicious. After texting him that fb told me he was recently online, and some other conversation, I eventually just told him that if a lot of fears and paranoia of him using or cheating keep resurfacing and that I want to work through these things together because I can't keep doing it on my own. Trust issues don't just magically disappear. It's been something I've had to work through on my own for months now. He gets livid over this. He turns into a fucking child when he's mad. says things that are kind of manipulative, can't understand why I would even have fears of these things he did to me in the past, makes it seem like I'm always asking too much from him and says I keep accusing him of things. I don't accuse him of anything, I am just telling him that lately I keep feeling anxious about him relapsing or cheating on me. He just gets so angry, and then he'll be like ""I'm sorry I love you, I know I hurt you etc etc etc"" and it just seems like maybe he is unaware of how manipulative he can be sometimes. I can totally understand why he would feel upset over hearing this since he's trying really hard to heal emotionally and spiritually from his addiction. I just don't see why he lacks so much empathy towards why I would have these thoughts sometimes. It's not even like I'm sitting here constantly worrying he's getting fucked up and hiding it from me. They just arise every now and again. Lately, it's just been more frequent and I just wanted to talk with him about it and figure out how we can work through it together. Like said, I know my communication skills aren't the best either, I dont want to portray myself as an angel here. But when he blows up and acts so defensively, it honestly only deepens the feelings of doubt, paranoia, and suspicion that I have sometimes. 

I guess I just need some help knowing if I could approach things differently, if I'm the bad guy or if I'm being gaslighted. I need suggestions on how to build trust and how to communicate more efficiently. I need help on building my intuition. I just need help. I feel really uncertain and confused. I love him so much, I just feel like our communication is complete shit and I feel like the dynamics of how we work together in a relationship aren't entirely aligned. ",19Aug2018,2

143,"I’m part of a college rowing team (club) and I really enjoy it, but every couple months we’re required to test, which is 8-30 minutes of absolute torture and by far the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. And I’m the slowest on the team of 20 so it’s not like I’m competing with anyone for the top spot. My slowness prevents me from being in boats with the others, which means I don’t get to spend time with them, which makes me the black sheep of the group and nobody knows what to do with me.

I know you’ll say “quit” but I really love the sport and the people because they’re friendly enough, even if they’re not as friendly with me as they are with the ones who actually contribute to winning competitions. I understand that I’m just a liability to the group, but the group makes me happy.

Testing does not make me happy. We have another test coming up next week and it’s one of the 30 minute ones, and knowing that it will be torture to appease no end I want to skip, which gets to my question: should I skip or should I do it? 

I will still be the slowest person, by the way. I’m slow by such a large margin that there’s no way this test will make a dent. Is it foolish of me to stay with the sport? Bear in mind that my only friends in college have been made through this experience.",19Aug2018,1
144,"Long story short: ex bf and i are still friends. After i broke up with him, he was devastated and he suggested we should remain friends because he needed me in his life because he’s was going through a lot. We talk almost everyday. Whenever i take too long to text him back, he just keeps sending me a bunch of memes to keep conservations going....
I have no feelings for him anymore but i can tell he still has feelings for me. 

I live in an apartment at my college town about 3 hours away from his hometown. He comes to my college town for game days/events. He texted me and asked if he could stay with me in a couple of weekends. And I said “no” and he asked me why, and i said i have 3 other roommates and 5 people in one tiny apartment is a crowd and actually an annoying burden. He hasn’t texted me back yet. I’m also casually dating other men so i don’t need my ex snooping around my new apartment. 

Basically, how can i get him to stop asking me to hang out with him and stop him from thinking he’s welcomed in my apartment? He really still cares about me deeply and he never really takes no for an answer.... i just want an easy escape from this guy but communicating with him never really works. ",19Aug2018,2
145,"So I recently just started this new job about a week ago and it is my first full time job out of college where I majored in Chemistry. It is second shift (2-10:30), pays $17.50 an hour, and is about a 45 min to and hour commute. During my orientation for this job I received a call from another company saying how they wanted to interview with me for an open position at their company. The company I work for now is a smaller food manufacturer and this new job is a large pharmaceutical company that is only a 7-10 minute drive from where I live and is first shift Monday to Friday. I agreed to do the interview. So my question is, if I do somehow get offered the other job at the pharmaceutical company, then what should the pay and/or other factors be to make me leave my brand new job and take the new one?",19Aug2018,1
147,"Hi guys, I'm just wondering about your reasoning behind this.

Many times I talk to or acquaint myself with a guy, somehow the conversation will end up with finding out if I have a boyfriend. 

Later on when I will talk to these guys, they will always ask dumb little questions about my boyfriend such as ""would your bf like that?"" ""I wonder what your bf would think."" And it honestly makes me so uncomfortable. I would prefer not to talk about my personal relationship with these people who I'm not close with. 

I once told a guy off for constantly asking about my boyfriend and he got really defensive. 

What should I do to prevent this from happening again? ",19Aug2018,1
148,"I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible at first. I (21M) met a girl (24F) on an app a long time ago, about 2.5 to 3 years ago. We were getting along just fine &amp; talked for 2-3 years up until now. We became good friends but hadn’t met in real life. Yesterday she went absolutely insane &amp; was totally pissed &amp; now it got to the point where she’s calling the police on me. I didn’t even do anything wrong &amp; now I’m freaking out &amp; need to tell people. 

(This next part gets more in depth; all of this isn’t really meant for advice too much since I know I should just never talk to her again &amp; drop it but I just need to tell people &amp; I feel horrible inside)

We started talking a lot and eventually moved to another app. Everything was going great and we got along so well &amp; we had some great moments even though it was just messaging each other. It even got to a point where we started thinking about each other sexually &amp; just a few days ago were talking about having sex &amp; meeting up in about a month. It would’ve been kinda like a FWB thing if it had worked out. We both sent sexual stuff to each other, pictures and video, especially me just a week or two ago. We even had 2-3 phone calls but they were normal talking &amp; not sexual. So everything was going really good for 2-3 years like I said up until this point. 

So she has said some weird things about me before or acted weird. I didn’t think much of it. But yesterday she went batshit insane &amp; started freaking out at me, harassing me, &amp; calling me bad names for no reason. She said I have a child’s brain &amp; called me insane &amp; fucked up in the head. I’ll tell you what happened &amp; what I did “wrong” ......... I disagreed with her on society things &amp; had different opinions/views than she did. 

She said I’m a sexist &amp; called me a ton of bad things. One thing I said was about how society tells men that we shouldn’t cry &amp; it’s an unmanly thing to do. Another thing was when I said women are much more emotional than men are &amp; men try to not show emotions. There were maybe 2 or 3 other things that I said that she didn’t like. 

So there you have it folks, I had different views &amp; opinions than she does &amp; now she has called the police on me when I’ve done nothing wrong. That was my “crime”. She said to stop messaging her &amp; she never wants to talk to me again so I guess I have to listen to her even though I feel like shit now &amp; feel like I just wasted tons of hours of the past 2-3 years talking to her &amp; being friends with her. I even asked if she could help me get better &amp; she could teach/help me get better but she just wanted me gone immediately &amp; now hates my guts. ",19Aug2018,1
149,"So originally I'm from Montana, it's great we have bears and mountains and stuff. But, it's hard to make a living here since most of the jobs revolve around hospitality, retail, or some form of customer service. Plus wages are minuscule compared to what I was working for in SLC, Utah. It's also hard because I'm from a toxic family, mostly my father who has a unhealthy obsession with me. 
In combination with the stagnant job market, my father is making it miserable to live here. I love him, but kind of don't like him if that makes sense. He will call multiple times a day, and if I don't pick up those calls become frantic, one right after the other. When I finally do pick up, he starts with the scare tactics of using this deep booming angry voice ""where have you been... so you couldn't even call to let me know you're okay?"" I'll defend myself, tell him I was busy, etc. And he shoots that down, undermining the fact that I'm an adult, and trivializing my daily work as if it's child play. Then he says ""well I guess I know you're fine, bye"" and slams the receiver. Now's a good time to mention that I am a 24 year old female, and I have been living on my own since I was 17. This has been my relationship with him even when I lived with him. He's an alcoholic, can throw the most fierce of temper tantrums and fits. Would and still tells wildly bigoted jokes to anyone who listens, even me, though I tell him over and over than I don't think it's funny. He doesn't get it. He also makes inappropriate sexual jokes in front of me, and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. He will call, and when I tell him my plans of going hiking, or maybe driving to see my grandma, or doing this or that he always shoots it down. ""Well you shouldn't be doing that by yourself!"" ""You shouldn't be driving by yourself out there!"" ""Why the hell would you do that."" 
Which is why it was easy for me to anticipate his reaction when I was going to Salt Lake City for the summer to work and spend time with my friend. I was really scared to tell him, because of his fierce ""in the moment"" reactions. His fit was catastrophic. ""Well what's going to happen if I need you!? I guess you don't give two shits about me. You can't drive down there by yourself! I don't like this, not one bit."" He would call multiple times a day to say things like this, and scrape at any other reason he could think of to shoot this down. I went anyways, and had the time of my life. I'm a Sophomore going to the University of Montana for a degree in Education, so the plan was to be there from May 12th to August 16th. 
I was teaching preschool, under the guidance of more experienced teachers. I was making good money, and got to explore SLC with my best friend. I realized even after almost 4 months passing, that I wasn't ever really happy in Montana. I always had a nagging feeling that something was wrong, or something bad was about to happen. There were always alarm bells in my head. My dad would call multiple times a day, and would repeat the same behaviors if I didn't pick up right away. 
It's also worth mentioning I met a guy in SLC, about three weeks of me working at the same school district he works at. We hit it off. Him and I had so much fun exploring the city, and just hanging out with each other. Just to clarify, I did tell him that I was just teaching for the summer, but after 3 months of dating he wanted me to be his girlfriend, and insisted that we can make it work. He knows about my dad, and after some eavesdropping on the conversations between my father and I, he agrees that something seems ""off"" about my dad and the was he expresses himself. 
Fast forward again, I love it here and don't want to leave. But I feel like I have to since I'm registered for classes, and my dad is expecting me back. I was planning on leaving on the morning of the 16th, but saw the night prior that I had a big screw in my tire. Called and told my dad that I wouldn't be able to come home until the next day, and it was silence on the other end of the line. ""Well surely someone is open that can fix it tonight..."" I told him no, it's 8:30PM, nothing's open. ""WELL FINE THEN, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT"" I asked him why he was getting so angry and raising his voice and he said ""IT'S LIKE YOU'RE JUST DOWN THERE TAKING A GOD DAMN VACATION."" I hung up on him. 
He called and left a message apologizing, I called back, and he tried to act like nothing had happened. I made a mental resolve to call him on his shit, and not let him sweep this under the rug like he always tries to do, and told him he hurt my feelings. He did the ""well, yeah, I don't wanna talk about it. It's over."" I told him no, it's not, because if this happens again, he's just going to push me away. He wouldn't talk about it, so I dropped it. 

I came home, and I'm miserable. I moved back in with my slob of a roommate here in Montana, my dad can randomly show up at my house again unannounced and come inside without me knowing it, and now I have to hunt for another job quickly before classes start. All I feel is stress and anxiety. I want to move back, and that has become the plan. 
Initially I wanted to go through this semester first, then move back. But I hate it here so much that I kind of want to cancel my classes (stupid, I know), and just work in Utah until I gain residency and can apply to the university there. 
My fear though is how do I break this to my father? I don't want to do it in person, because as tough as I like to act, he still scares the shit out of me. Should I call and drop the bomb? Should I try to have someone else there? 

Sorry for how much of a word dump this was, I felt like I had to thoroughly explain the circumstances for why I feel like I need to move. ",19Aug2018,2
150,"I’m an 18 year old living in Utah, having just moved two months ago from the Seattle area. I met this amazing girl, let’s call her J. And I mean AMAZING. 5’1”, blonde hair, blue eyes, cute nose, sweet personality and adorable laugh. The thing is though, I met her just about a month ago. Considering that amount of time, I feel like her and I really clicked. We’d text on and off again, but when we would text it’d be fun, though she says she isn’t a good texter. Just last Friday (8/17) there was a community dance/social thing I was invited to through my friend, which he and I are great pals. An hour and a half rolls by and sure enough, J walks through one of the walkways to the big gym where the dance was being held. Immediately my heart raced and I kid you not, ran and hugged her so tight and spun her around. She also claims she isn’t a hugger, but that moment spoke otherwise. Anyways, we danced and it was the most fun I’d had since I’d gotten to Utah. A couple more hours pass and she says she wants to go to in’n’out burger, then back to her apartment (she has 3 roommates), and invites me to come along. We go to eat, then I get to meet her roommates. THIS IS WHERE THE “I NEED ADVICE” COMES IN. It’s 1:30 am, and she’s driving me home. About half way to my house, I ask her: “do you like being spontaneous?” She replies: “oh yeah, love it. Like if you ask if you wanna hang right now I’ll usually say yes.” Me: “oh, okay. But that’s not what I meant.” Her: “it’s not? Then what? Did you mean, like, kissing?” Me: “...no comment.” I’ll save you the details, she proceeds to explain that she would be down if I was a good kisser. (Spoiler, I am). One thing she made very clear which I 100% agreed with was that this in no way would officiate her and I as boyfriend and girlfriend. It’s like she read my mind. The one thing I can’t shake, though, is how hard she was on herself. She kept telling me she’s an awkward, antisocial and ugly mess, but why would I be there with her that night if all those things she said were true? I clearly disagree with her, and I let her know it. Anyways, to the kiss. (I’m sorry I love telling stories). She kept saying “I want to, but I’m a bad kisser.” Every time I’d ask why she thinks that, the answer would be “because I’m a bad kisser.” But eventually we did kiss. She wasn’t bad at all. Except this part is where things feel wrong for me: when we finished she told me to get out of her car. I open the passenger side door, then close it again. I ask, “do you feel like I pressured you?” ..she nodded. It killed me. I knew I had ruined it. I said I was truly sorry then got out of the car. That’s the end of it. What do I make of this? We still text and she says she isn’t mad or anything, but something just feels off. I felt a real connection with her. And she showed no signs of feeling pressured. I even asked before the kiss and she said she was fine with it. Should I try to make things right somehow?",19Aug2018,1

152,"My girlfriend (30f) and I (30m) have been an official couple for about 7 months now. We dated when we were 17, broke up two years later, drifted apart and lived separate lives and then miraculously found each other again about a year and a half ago. Both of us admitted to each other that we had secretly been in love with one another all these years but never said anything. The universe works in very mysterious ways.

We’re both insanely happy with each other. Rarely fight, agree on all the important issues, speak rationally towards each other, sex life is amazing, both completely in love, trust each other, support each other through literally everything life has to throw at us, communicate on a very spiritual level.

There’s just one thing holding us back.
We don’t speak the same “love language”.

When it comes to expressing our love and how we’d like to be shown love, our expectations don’t match up. 

When I show love and what i’d like to be shown in return consists of unsolicited compliments, kind/encouraging words, undivided attention, unprovoked quality time, being very physically present and physical displays of affection.

When she shows love and what she likes to be shown is kind acts of service, giving and receiving gifts, quality time and physical touch.

While in most of those categories we both tend to leave each other MORE than satisfied, there are very tiny differences in how we express love to each other that leave me feeling....helpless? That’s not entirely the right word i’m looking for but I don’t know how else to describe the feeling.

To give some examples:

- I’m very expressive with how I feel about her. Every few weeks it seems i’ll get overwhelmed with how much I love her and i’ll spend a few minutes out of my day to send her a long text expressing my gratitude and adoration. 
Typically i’m met with a response of something very similar to “aw thanks! i love you!”

- Whenever she achieves something great in her life, big or small, ill typically send her flowers, a nice little gift or a thoughtful text telling her how proud I am of her. Again, usually met with a “thanks” as a response.

I’m not really looking for the same in return but typically her responses to my gestures leave me feeling like my efforts weren’t recognized or appreciated and that maybe I shouldn’t have done them at all.

For some way way back story: we both grew up in households and living environments where emotions and feelings were NEVER talked about and we were never encouraged to express ourselves in that type of way. We both grew up with one parent out of the household and lived primarily with our mothers our whole lives. Essentially both of us were “raised by the internet” as both of our moms weren’t really the “participate in our child’s lives at all” type of mothers. 

Although we grew up in the same type of emotionally unavailable household, somehow our love languages drifted off into opposite  directions. 

Now, i’m not here looking for what I can say or do to my girlfriend to make her understand why my needs are unfulfilled. I’m more so looking for ways that I can better recognize the things she IS doing, what I can do to encourage her to be able to speak more freely about her feelings and be vulnerable in that way although our love languages aren’t the same and what I can do to not feel so torn down when my efforts aren’t met with the same generosity.

Our relationship is pretty damn near perfect and I want to work on this to get it even closer.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",19Aug2018,1

160,"During my mid-session of four years in university, my high school girlfriend and I broke up, and that left me heartbroken. It felt like I was at rock bottom. It could not get any worse(or so I thought). This affected my relationship with my friends a lot.

I am a man of few words, but I never had any problems holding a good conversation with anybody! But after getting heartbroken, I wanted to be alone and I was curling up inside, simultaneously distancing myself from my friends! I did not discuss how I was feeling with my friends at all! I acted like everything was normal and I was unfazed!

Then, one day I went drinking with these friends and I don't know whether it was under the influence of liquor or not but I broke down and I wasn't able to hold back my tears!

In the moment, they offered me words of assurance and consolation, but as time passed I began believing they did not care about me at all and that hurt because I was able to hold onto my aura of confidence for I believed that these people were with me!

I things I started noticing after that gave me quite a shock, I did not fathom that the world around me would be so cold! I lost so much confidence and people noticed that, so my friends did things that I normally would be interested in and they started giving me signs that they could do these things better than I could and made sure I knew I will never be as good as them.

1. Why were they doing this? Was it envy? I had nothing in my life that could make anybody envious! It made me angry that I wasn't able to make them see reason or find a peaceful way to make them stop doing this to me! I was angry at myself!

Then I came to the conclusion that this was my delusion and I was being plain jealous! This is the first time I felt this way! I had always believed that I was equal to everybody and never beneath them, and I still do!

2. Do you think it was jealousy that I felt or were they being condescending?

I put this all behind and started focusing on improving myself, giving them the benefit of the doubt that I had jealousy within me and I started working so I could remove it from my system as much as possible and to this day I have moved forward believing I was at fault!

All the people I have met from that point onward have tried asserting dominance and tried demeaning me!

3. Is there no way that people can be appreciative towards each other? I ask this beacause I am ignorant towards human behaviour and I don't know which behaviour means what! I am amidst confusion that I cannot clear!

While my friend were busy showing me my place and in which level I belong, I tried telling them that the way you demean me is wrong but the conversation always ends up in conclusion that I am an egoistic and arrogant person! I just recently got a job and this is first good thing that has happened to me in a long, long time so I put up a WhatsApp story sharing this achievement! One of these friends, after reading my story, put up a story that gave an indication that I my behaviour is arrogant and I should rethink my life choices.

Now with the information that I have given you, I ask you all-

4. Is it really my fault? if so, how do I improve and rectify my mistakes and how do I make it up to my friends?

5. If it is not my fault, how do I make my friends see reason and settle this peacefully so that they stop treating me this way?",19Aug2018,1
161,Ok so about a year ago I became friends with this girl and over time I developed a crush on her. When we go out with our friends I always insist on paying for all of us. We play games online with friends and every game she owns I bought for her .  Valentine’s Day I brought all my friends a chocolate bar but I have her a basket full of stuff. I was beginning to think she was into me so I asked one of our mutual friends about it and she told me she likes this other chump. So now I’m very unsure and worried that she labeled me as a ‘nice guy’. And I don’t want to talk to her about it because I don’t want to harm the friendship. Is she into me? How can I tell?

She’s told me me countless stories of how he’d become annoyed with her and call her out of her name, and would laugh at her when she’d start crying. I think the story that broke my heart the most was when she told me she didn’t want to have sex with him and he threatened to break up with her, so she literally gave him a blowjob with tears in her eyes to avoid an argument. When she asked for my advice, I told her that I thought she was in a toxic relationship and had to get out of it. I also told her that she needed to learn to love herself, and not tolerate that kind of treatment from anyone else.  They broke up three months ago, and he left her countless phone calls saying that she’d be nothing without him and other shitty things. I thought she was getting on track to moving on from him. But they got back together!!!!! It boils my blood bc she just says that he’s getting better and he loves her and is sorry. I told myself to let it go bc it’s not my relationship. But of course, he’s right back to acting the same way. Now she’s asking me for advice.  I don’t want to say anything mean but I feel like she’s not a victim, but a volunteer.

164,"Seems like an innocent question but the anxious in me fears it's a matter of life or death.

So, long story short: I stumbled upon this girl's instagram and I fell in love like I haven't in a long time. Knowing her existence was enough to make me overcome some struggles I was dealing with and since then I'm eager to become a better person.

But because I don't know her at all other than what you can ""know"" from som pics, and because she lives in another country, I couldn't bring myself to introduce me outta nowhere. It took me months to do it but I only managed to do so because she deleted all her photos and suddenly stopped posting.

Then I began to get really anxious and for better or for worse I asked one ofthe people she followed (I assumed she was friends with) if she was okay. Turns out I asked the guy whi was her ex and he ended revealing she was in a dark place of her life, dealing with depression and suicidal thought. The anxiety I was feeling until then doesn't compare to what I'm feeling right now.

I feel like I should do something, return the favor she doesn't even know she did for me, and properly introduce myself (as she didn't read my dm because she stopped using IG).

So how do I say hello in the first place? I can't go like ""hey, I think I love you and apparently I'm the only person able to empathize to what you and I just wanna say hi... Oh, and you selfish ex boyfriend was the one who gave me you ID in this app btw""

Long story short, I was able to pull it off, but I worked a shit ton, and my anxiety from the increased stress started to get to me.

This month, I scheduled myself more time off to try and cope. The nice thing about being the chief is I make the schedule too. At the beginning of the month, one of my scribes said she planned on leaving. I wasn’t overly concerned because she only was picking up 1 shift per week, but I started to look to recruit to hire a replacement. 

All of a sudden, just this past week, one of my more experienced scribes sent me an email stating this would also likely be her last month, due to being offered a full time CNA position. This was something that completely blindsided me, and caused an increase in anxiousness yet again.

You see, the new school year is going to be starting soon. 1 of my scribes who picks up a lot of shifts is a student, and 1 of my recent new hires is also a student. This will greatly diminish their work availability to essentially just weekends.  This leaves  14 remaining shifts every week that will need to be covered, 4 of them being 12 hour shifts. As of right now, if this other girl follows through and leaves, I don’t think I’m going to have enough coverage with the remaining scribes, unless multiple people start putting in overtime. 

I’m really concerned about not being able to cover all shifts next month, and I’ve been losing a lot of sleep over it.  It’s currently 3:30 AM, and my anxiety isn’t allowing me to sleep. I recently interviewed someone who will be a great fit for our team, but she is unable to start until after the first week of September due to taking the MCAT. I can’t just hire on someone else, because training takes a long time, and this person I offered the job to was by far the best candidate than everyone else. Additionally, I might be getting a scribe transferred to my location. So I don’t want to end up having 3 new scribes, when 1-2 is plenty enough. I don’t want to end up being way overstaffed in after September.

So I’m in a really difficult position. Do I just talk to my team members and be like “hey, I really need you guys to work a lot more this upcoming month due to x,y,z...? 

This is all really difficult to explain, but I need some type of words of advice/help/anything, because I’m freaking out and it doesn’t feel good",19Aug2018,1
167,"So there's a guy in my class that isn't much fun. He takes every joke seriously, joke insults hurt him a lot and he starts crying and I get told off for it. Whenever I play a game with him and I beat him, he cries and says "" I'm shit at everything"". (His words exactly) His spelling triggers me (He can't even spell the word 'Practice'), and he is extremely annoying (He is always trying to talk to me about a game that we both play, and he doesn't stop until I get 'saved' by a friend). He also does tap dancing and he does it in front of anyone, his jokes are not funny at all, he is racist towards me (My friends are racist towards me sarcastically), he wants to play with me every time we're on a game at the same time and I just don't want to be around him. But the problem is my teacher keeps on telling me about how he 'respects' me and how I should accept him. In fact, he is the source of half of my stress. What should I do?",19Aug2018,1
168,"I had a friend thru work for several years. I thought a good friend. I eventually left that company for another similar one in town. It was the worst mistake of my life. They were disorganized and I ended up getting involved in a heated ethical dispute with them. My boss ended up leaving and a co-worker was forced out after bringing up similar concerns. As this was happening, I began to hear rumors that my friend and our boss from my previous company might come over. I asked my friend repeatedly to meet with me. I was hoping that I could mention my concerns. I knew my friend would take the job anyway (stubborn) but I wanted to at least explain what was going on. This person did not make the time to meet me and I was furious. I was so frustrated with the whole situation and felt like this person was letting me down too. I felt betrayed. 

The situation at work became more heated and was not able to be mediated. The day my friend started was particularly bad for me and I walked out after corporate failed to come up with a satisfactory resolution. The issue was not directly related to my friend. I just couldn't take it anymore.

I am not *supposed* to talk about the issue technically. I don't even want to talk about it. I'm heartbroken and devastated and disillusioned about the whole thing. I further felt that talking to my friend after they started the job would only draw them into the situation. From my point of view, I had already seen what being involved in the issue would cost and decided it was best to leave everyone that I cared about at work completely in the dark about it.  

I sent my friend a message a few weeks after I left; what I hadn't realized is that leaving when they started had made everyone think that I left because of them. It had made starting work there very difficult for them. I should have thought of that but I didn't. I feel guilty but I had a lot of other stuff on my mind at the time. I tried to explain but my friend was furious. And I was already so upset and frustrated and so I blocked them on everything. 

It's been a year and IDK what to do. I miss my friend but I don't want to talk about what happened or think about that place anymore. And I don't even know if I or others could still get in trouble for the issue. I know I did the right thing in challenging the company but I regret it deeply. I feel like l lost my friend; everyone there, people I admired, probably think I'm crazy and; the company is almost certainly doing what they were doing before albeit more carefully. Nothing changed for the better.

Is there a way to make up with my friend? I want to apologize for making their life difficult but I'm worried they're still upset. Is it all even worth it? Am I just asking for more trouble for me and others?

170,"My brother just got a job offer across the country and while I am extremely happy for them, I can’t deny how heartbroken I am. He is younger than me, but I really look up to how ambitious and smart he is, while I’m generally sort of a wreck most of the time. He is the only person who as an introvert, i really enjoy spending time with and I never get tired of. Obviously we are extremely close. And I’m petrified of what I will do once I can’t be around him all of the time.

My socially awkward so he is my only friend and I have great difficulty making friends and I think I rely a little too much on him. I know I should be grateful that I got to spend so much time with him (we’re in our mid twenties, and live together at our parents’ old home) but I feel physically sick at the thought of not seeing him everyday.

My brother makes a lot of sacrifices to make sure I’m mentally okay, and spends a lot of time with me because he knows I don’t have any friends. I feel horrible for being so selfish but I know once he finds someone he loves and has a family, I won’t be his #1 anymore and things will never be the time. But I know he has a life to live and it’s selfish to assume he will always be there to “take care of me”.

And as much as I want to join him, I’m holding myself back because i feel like in a way, he has put his life on pause for me. I know I need to learn to make it on my own but I’m so afraid.

It’s currently 4:44 pm and I woke up in panic thinking he’s gone but he’s asleep downstairs and I know he won’t mind if I go downstairs and knock on his door when I’m having these episodes, but in a few weeks I know that will no longer be the case :’(

171,"I feel like my life has been stuck in this hellhole of a family for a long time now.

There are many events like the few I'm going to list now.

I was sleeping one time, then all of a sudden, my father and mother kicked my door down and screamed at me for two hours, literally calling me out and doing whatever they wanted to do, except hit me.Another time, my parents dragged me out of my room and started calling me all sorts of names, saying I did this, did that, even sticking up the middle finger towards me, all because I called my mom an ""asshole"". They continued like this for hours. When I was like in middle school, my father took out my computer and smashed it in the garage for no reason. Recently, my parents have been purposefully waking me up, either by talking to someone really loudly next to my room or directly walking up to me while I am sleeping and waking me up.

There are many, many more things and events like this, but I won't go too deep into detail (I can if need be).

Lately, I've just been feeling down. My parents have been mocking me, using everything I ever said to them (not even that bad to be honest) against me. They said all kinds of horrible things and it is becoming more and more apparent that they won't change.

The thing is is that I depend on them for my tuition money for college. They also have a lot of influence on me (mom took access to my bank account, school accounts, etc.). I am heavily dependent on my parents, sadly, and I cannot simply just cut them from my life.

Life just really sucks right now and I don't know what to do. I really want to be independent of my family and live away from them. I know I sound childish, like I want to run away from home, but when it all boils down to it, I kinda do wanna run away from home. Home f\*cking sucks. I'm going back to college in a month, and things just keep getting worse.

I really need some practical advice right now. I posted on a few subreddits and all of the responders said I should get a job, do work-study, or something that'll make me financially more independent. I feel very helpless, powerless, and depressed. I don't want to live like this anymore, and I want to limit my exposure to my toxic family. I don't understand their problem with me; most trouble I've ever given them is I got 2 B's one time on a report card. It just really sucks right now; I'm literally getting bullied by my own parents and brother for no reason. When I try to talk to relatives, they all don't want to believe me, all of them saying it has something to do with me, not them, that I am wrong for even saying anything. This is obviously not true, but it still sucks that it has come to this. But what can I do? Cannot change someones mind. Any advice helps! List anything really! I'm desperate as crap.

172,"So I'm an overweight 27 year old male who has no degree, no job, never had a relationship, soon to be no savings, bad health and habits, no friends, no particular skills and little job experience. I know I'm in a really bad spot in life and want to get out of it, I'm aware of some basic things I should be doing, but have trouble being consistent in anything I do. 

I'm alone in this world, my family hates me, I have no friends and am on the verge of running out of savings. I've considered just offing myself as the amount I am lagging behind the perceived societal average is almost unbearably high. However, this obviously won't solve any problems, just permanently ignore them forever. So I discarded the ""easy way out"" and am looking for help in defining the ""hard way out"". 

Financially I am not making the most out of compounding interest and I hate myself for it, but with no income it's obvious why. Little to no jib experience makes it so that I have trouble getting any replies from my job searches. People just treat me like some broken idiot, which, to be fair, I sort of currently am. 

I know it's a long shot posting on /r/advice, but I thought I'd give it a shot. What steps should I take, and in what order, to get out of this 15 year rut. I've seen mental health professionals and I feel as if none of them helped my issue. I've tried meds, nothing changes my pessimistic view on things. It's all doom and gloom and hopeless, but I want to change that.

How do I make friends? How do I get a job? How do I avoid small talk questions regarding school, relationships or money? It seems to be the typical goto questions. 

I've wanted to do programming, bought books at 18, never started anywhere. This seems to be a trend. I just procrastinate living and learning and waste my time instead. Not sure why.

177,"Hello guys,

I am not quite sure if this is the best subreddit for this kind of question, so if I am breaking any rules here, please let me know and I will post this elsewhere.

Bit of a backstory: I am a white male, 25, living in Czech republic (or Czechia, if you will). I was born here and lived here ever since. Yes, I traveled here and there but never moved despite having the urge to. And I always wanted to move to US, just didn't know where specifically.

I forgot about my dream for a while because of a girl. I got married two years ago and divorced not even a year later. That's a story for another time I suppose, though. Also, bunch of other family issues that held me back.

Now, about a month ago, I met another girl. I may or may not have fallen in love, not quite sure yet. But that's not important, the important thing is that she reminded me of these dreams. Reminded me that I am way too comfortable where I am now. I have a stable, (relatively) good paying job, beautiful house to live in and my whole life in general is very, very calm right now. I never finished my university studies because I never had money. My parents never really supported me and always pushed the policy of ""we throw you in the water, you learn how to swim"". And I guess I kind of failed in this regard because I was never able to work while studying. In other words, I was half-assing two things instead of putting my maximum effort into both. So now, when I am finally secure, have money to do it and generally feel much more like an adult, I started studying Marketing Communications (long distance, my first class is this October). However, if I were to move now or within a year or two, I would have to drop the school, obviously.

Anyway, I decided I want to move to Seattle. I have some connections there that would help me get a first job (nothing too big but something to get me started). Thing is, I have no degree, I am not an athlete, scientist, doctor, artist, refugee, I don't have a family in US. So how do I go about doing this? 

My job is pretty universal, I have a lot of (work) experience, I want to work, I want to educate myself. And as I like to say, I want to be one with the nature and one with the corporate ladder. And I feel like Seattle has the best of both worlds - beautiful nature, weather, air. And beautifully disgusting companies such as Microsoft and Amazon, numerous start-ups, etc.

So yeah... the question is not just how do I do it? But also - can I do it legally?",19Aug2018,3

180,"This will absolutely be long-winded. I am incapable of keeping things brief.  
  
I have suffered from depression for a while. It started my sophomore year of high school, and was already festering when I entered college.  
Freshman year of college, my alcoholic emotionally abusive father passed away unexpectedly, and it hit me very hard. I had believed his death wouldn't affect me too much, but that was because I was young, naive, and (as always) trying to protect myself.  
Around a year ago I woke up with a feeling of dread and absolute misery. The weight of depression was tangible, and I called off work because I knew that I couldn't make it through the shift without breaking down. Instead I drove to my girlfriend and my apartment and tried to hang myself.  
Our cat came over at once and began to meow loudly while he wrapped himself around my legs. I stopped and brought him to bed and just cried. I still to this day worry that I only did it to convince myself that I was truly sad.  
My girlfriend rushed home as soon as I called her. She was not angry at me for getting fired (the bosses decided I had missed too much training due to my girlfriend and I just getting back from out of state for her grandfathers unexpected funeral). She was not disappointed in me. She just wanted to take care of me.  
She told me take my time finding my next job because she didn't want me to feel pressured, and her job paid well enough to support us both.  
I allowed my depression to swallow me whole, and I proceeded to go unemployed for 6 months. I was always searching, but I let my fear and self-pity keep me in bed for the vast majority of the time. I didnt know what I was supposed to do.  
She had always expressed interest in moving across the country to live closer to her parents and grandmother. Around 4 months of unemployment, I agreed. I think I was hoping to help her to have a better support system in case I had another potentially more fatal breakdown.  
So we moved across the country. And, as I'm sure none of you will be surprised by, depression came along for the ride.  
Since then, I proposed to my girlfriend. It took a very long time for me to make the decision. Our relationship has gone through some fairly severe ups and downs. For a long time, I convinced myself that I didnt want to marry her because we had too many negative memories between us.  
Then I started to realize, I was just afraid, as I always am. She is not perfect, but she is perfect for me. She cares so deeply for me, and her endless, determined love for me is larger and better than every negative thing in my life, internally and externally combined.  
But I have been and continue to be afraid that I am cursed. Destined to stew in my own despair and self-pity forever. I dont want to drag her down with me.  
But she convinced me that we could make it through together. And when I think about the rest of my life being with her, it suddenly isnt so bad.  
I want to get better for her, and be a good husband and eventually a good father; I just dont know how.  
I have been job hopping since college at different businesses that I am miserable at. Places that treat me like crap, or bore me to death.  
Every time I look at job opportunities, my heart tells me that I am supposed to be a performer. It is my passion, and it is the only ""career"" that I am actually happy doing.  
But I can't trust my emotions or my gut feelings, because depression has left me feeling numb for a while now. When I'm not with my fiancé, most of my emotions are mentally concocted based on what I believe I should be feeling. I only feel comfortable to be myself when I'm with her.  
I am going to be her husband soon, and I dont have any idea if I'm going to be pursuing performance art, working at a 9-5 job just so she can have stability, or if I am determined to job hob for the rest of my life. Not knowing is excusable (who really knows what the future holds), but it is my fear of failing or making the wrong choice that is preventing me from going forward with anything concrete.  
My fiancé has allowed me to take time to focus on being an actor but every time I try, I am incapable of fully dedicating myself, lest I risk discovering I'm not good enough.  
I am currently on depression medicine as well as thyroid medication. I try to take it consistently, but I miss taking them at least once a month.  
I have OCD, dermatillomania, anxiety, and often mood swings (but not bipolar). I often go months without brushing my teeth or showering. For some reason, I do not smell bad, but my teeth are starting to show signs of neglect, and it's also just disgusting.  
I occasionally will think about doing them, but I never can find the energy. I do not feel a sense of accomplishment after taking a shower.  
But, more often than not, I wont think about showering or my teeth, or my medicine, etc, for days. I'm just on autopilot, focusing all of my energy on making sure I go to work and dont get fired.  
I have seen multiple therapists before. But I have never stuck it out with one. I am so afraid of opening up to someone week after week, and hearing their advice.  
I wont let myself succeed. It's too scary to try, so I throw a wrench into the system before I can risk failing and the waves of self-loathing that will follow.  
The job I am at now is awful, but the insurance is incredible. I am trying to stick it out so I can go see a decent psychiatrist and have my medication reevaluated.  
I occasionally look for acting jobs, but I haven't brought my best to an audition since college.  
I don't know why I'm posting my life story on here. I've been very sick this week, but still had to work 40+ hours at my very physical job. Today is my Friday, so maybe this is just my release now that I finally dont have to return to work tomorrow.  
I dont expect anyone to have the magical answer for me. No simple solution exists that will make it all better.  
But I hope people with similar experiences can give me some advice. Any advice.  
I am trying to get on a diet to help me lose weight (I have always been overweight), I am working constantly so I'm at least helping to provide for my fiancé, I am constantly analyzing my decisions and actions to see if I could improve or at least apologize when i am wrong. I have gotten a dog because I thought having a best friend that will motivate me to get outside every day would help me get better. I am trying to exercise more, eat less fast food, and not make suicide jokes.  
But I also am just quitting smoking again, smoking pot 4+ times a week, sleeping in until my 1 PM shifts start, picking, not bathing, and not excelling at my job because I'm constantly zoned out during every shift.  
In the back of my mind, I think I unfortunately still believe that there is a fix all. Moving across the country, marrying my soul mate, getting a cat, getting a dog, using marijuana, changing medicine. I keep hoping that I'll just find the cure that makes me all better. But the thing that really scares me is that even with every one of those things in my life, depression is still crushing me. I feel like I'm running out of ideas on how to fight back. And it's been so long since I've been without depression, I don't really know who I am without it. It's oozed into the foundation of my personality. When I occassionally have a big mood swing and I suddenly don't feel depressed at all anymore (usually this happens once every 3 months, for an hour or two), I'm just insanely energetic and incredibly annoying just as I was in high school before depression was part of how I defined myself.  
Right now I'm focused on two main points: not letting the multitude of voices in my head take such a toll on me, and seeking help. I dont think I'll be able to handle the former without first completing the latter.  
I am struggling to stay at my job long enough for the insurance to kick in, though. I am absolutely miserable there. But I feel like I have to go to a more expensive psychiatrist because I worry that if I go to a cheap one, they wont be able to assist me as well.  
I don't want to be this way anymore. I want to be happy, successful, a great husband, and eventually a great father.  
I thought leaning on my fiancé was the solution for so long, but I eventually realized that she wasnt lifting me up from my depression, but I was dragging her down into it with me. I dont know how she wouldn't, being with me 24/7 and me being constantly unhappy and talking about this.  
I still worry that I'm just lazy. My family has always told me that I've had a problem with laziness, similar to my late father. I dont know anyone else that is like me, so I cant help but think that maybe the majority of my depression is just enjoying sleeping for 14 hours at a time.  
I dont know if anyone will read any of this, let alone all 30 chapters. I cant seem to make/maintain any friendships outside of my fiancé, and I dont really have anyone to talk to about this. I hate bringing people down with my own shit, and I never people to see how self-pitying, repetitive, and scared I am.  
If I feel like I am supposed to be a performer and everything within me tells me that it's my destiny, do I follow it? Is it ridiculous? Should it be more of a hobby?  
Are there solutions that I have been missing and should be trying?  
Am I just a piece of shit and I need to just stop letting myself stew?  
It's okay if this doesnt get any attention. I'll probably delete it (and this throwaway account) in the morning in embarrassment.  
I just dont know what to do. I feel like I'm trying so hard. I am trying to make steps in the right direction. But every time I look at my fiancé and see how much of a drain on her I am, I often wish that my cat hadn't intervened. It would have been a horrible thing to do to my family, friends, and her. But I'm a coward, and having them watch me just stagnate and rot while I fail over and over and over again is too much.  
P.S. I'm not going to kill myself. I am sad, but my cat, my puppy, and my fiancé are already more than enough reason to keep trying. And that's only a microscopic portion of the amazing things in my life I have to be appreciative for. I have a lot of good in my life, which makes it hurt that much more that I still am the way I am.  
Okay, if you actually read this whole thing, kudos. Why did you do it? Go get help for your masochism.  
Good night.

182,"My ex fiancé is incapable of having my son full time because of the life style she leads, it involves drugs, alcohol and other extreme things she has done like try to kill herself multiple times etc. I've been to court to try and get full custody but because she is the mother the courts don't care, even with all the damning evidence I have, however I got everything else I asked for from the court, like parental responsibility and the right to be on the birth certificate for example as the courts ruled there was no reason as to why she was keeping my son from me, apart from to hurt me and now I get to see him every other weekend. The only reason my son hasn't been taken away from her and placed into my full custody is because my ex fiance's foster parents look after my son full time and my ex fiancé only sees her at their house and has to ask to take him out for any period of time.

Anyway, I see my son once every two weeks and this week I get to have him for the weekend (he's 3 years old). When I collected my son from his grandma and grandads house, he told me in the car that his grandad had hit him hard on the leg and he shouted at my son and made him cry. I do not know what to do and whether to confront them about it or tell social services and get them re-involved (they are involved because of my son's mothers history). It's bad enough he has hit my son, but what makes it worse is that my son is not biologicaly related to him, as my son's grandad is my ex fiance's foster father.

185,"I was working in the accounts department for two weeks before the temporary role ended. I'll make bullet points to condense my points. I feel that this person used his authority (head of finance) as an excuse for his behaviour to harass and demean me. My experiences include the following;

* On my first day I was consistently referred to as 'gorgeous \[name beginning with G\]'. This was one of the first encounters with no previous work relationship being formed and he made it my password, and referred to me as this on the phone to someone, then he commented on me going red. I felt that it was hard to settle into the role and with others because of it, and had I been a woman I think this would have been sexual harassment
* I was loudly mocked for my handwriting being untidy and the whole office was able to hear it. He commented in front of the office 'you should have been a doctor with your handwriting'. This egged on others to laugh along
* Shortly after this, the senior member of staff training me told me something and I was struggling to concentrate because of his previous comment. I asked for clarity and was told that we were like 'tweedle dee and tweedle dum' and said that I could be the next Chuckle Brother
* Shortly after finding out my role had ended, I went back to my desk because there was 15 minutes left before I was contracted to leave. He started whispering to another employee on the outdoor staircase. I heard laughing from both of them. I was in shock after being told about the role ended and when I looked in the mirror, I was blushing. It felt like they wanted me to hear them whispering about me and I think the manager wanted to do this because I tried to assert that I hadn't used the accounting software before I left, when I was told I didn't make an impact.

Other points regarding the reasons for leaving and general management;

* I was told that I didn't make the impact he expected after two weeks. I was not once told what type of impact was required or told where I was going wrong. I was told that I took up too much of the other team's time, however I feel it was necessary to ask for guidance because I hadn't used the software before and wanted to make sure I followed their specific procedures properly- sometimes learning new skills as I went along
* I was told I wasn't making an impact but I had to consistently ask what my next job was, had to ask for clarity on their procedures because of the nature of the charity, and I was often being monitored by the other members of staff rather than being told to take a lead
* The older member of staff training me was often missing out details which was evident when the younger member of staff told me how to do things correctly. His mistakes would have then have been my mistakes.
* When I was told that I was going to leave, I found some sort of raised voice and assertiveness by saying that I hadn't used the software before, but I was unable to carry on being assertive or argue my points in that moment, and he continued to assert that I made no impact and it think I just surrended to this, and had no power to argue back. I could feel myself blushing and struggled to speak with a clear voice. The experience has left me with shattered confidence

The point of my post- was I bullied and should I make a complaint to make sure this behaviour doesn’t continue for others? He is working on a 12 month temporary contract for the charity, and the charity which is contracted by a county council (England). We had to take part in three e-learning modules including GDPR, equal opportunities and fire safety testing. I’m not sure whether to contact the council as well as the charity itself.

We have fun when we hang out, seem to agree on many points of conversation, share the same passions. When we hang out, Peter seems like a real down to earth and fun person to be around.

However, Peter always says things in text messages, and never does them, he never tells. Peter makes plans with me for the day, doesn’t message me (only until late in the day), and doesn’t tell me if he’s not able to make our engagement, or if something has come up.

Peter very often doesn’t reply to my messages, I don’t spam him or act clingy, I make sure my messages are short and to the point, he never really replies, or waits a couple hours until doing so.

Peter owes me $100, he tells me online, over the phone and in person that he’ll pay me, that he has sent the money, nothing ever comes. I know Peter has a lot of money anyway.

192,"I'm in limbo right now, or so it seems. I am a 20-something multiple-time college drop-out that works minimum wage. Don't really see this as a fulfilling lifestyle.



My situation stems basically from my academic history. I started in community college early in the 2010's and wanted to transfer to a 4-year for engineering. However; familial fallout ensured when I began to preform poorly academically. I dropped out without talking about it with my family and was promptly kicked out of the house. I was temporary homeless for a few days before co-workers at my then job gave me a place to stay until permanent residence was found. I rented from a few people. Something during the mid 2010's, I began returning to my local CC to retake certain classes that were less-than-stellar when it came to my performance. My grades improved somewhat and I was on my way to finishing the 2-year portion of my career. I then began focusing on doing physics (for some odd reasons, I don't remember,) at a 4-year, transferred there, and then promptly failed all 3/4 classes in the first quarter. Yeah, I'm a real winner. Turns out, I don't like undergrad physics and had no real passion for it. SO, I just stopped attending class. I returned back to my home town and returned back to the old CC to take some computer science and programming classes. I thoroughly enjoyed them! However; due to financial circumstances, I was unable to continue at the CC. Now, for the last 2-2.5 years, I have been doing nothing but working full-time minimum wage work and maybe some light programming, yet nothing of use.



So now, I am again looking at going back to undergrad at another school in-state. I really want to do work in computer science and applied mathematics. However, due to my frequent dropping-out and my 3/4 F's that I have acquired from my sheer stupidity, I am afraid that my academic career is over. Couple that with the tremendous debt that incurred that I am nursing while working minimum wage is limiting my investment opportunities. I could lie and say that I never got those grades, but that will not do me any good! SO, no lying is not an option. Even if I told the truth of my history, there is still the issue of paying for undergrad! With massive debt, there is no way that I can afford to pay for full-time school, service old debt, AND work a full-time job and reasonably assume that I can make it. Knowing me, I would fail miserably!



Now, this leads me to finding alternate routes in my life. I could take on trade work! My concern that I may not perform well doing plumbing, welding, trucking, etc. I really have no interest in the work and am afraid that I would half-ass my jobs due to a lack of interest. Couple that with the current change in technology, I fear that whatever jobs that I take in the trades will be automated and I will be relegated back to minimum wage work again. Also, the fact that the line of work results in severe physical breakdown of the body results in poor health later in life. Even assuming I can afford health insurance, there remains the possibility of going broke due to complications from industrial work.



Another option is for me to go into the aviation industry. I was always in love with flying. From the little single-engine Cessna, to the large 737, I am always loving being in the air. Truth be told, when I was younger (think middle school,) I always wanted to be a pilot flying large jets for a living like my grandfather did in his life. My mother convinced (more or less dictated,) that I pursue engineering rather than aviation due to the stressful nature of the job plus the way the airlines treat those with sub 10000 hours working less than minimum wage. She recommended that flying be a hobby. Nothing more. Well, fast forward to today, I realize I can do more than just be an ass-in-the-left-seat for the airlines. I could do freight, charter, or even CFI (certified flight instructor) work. Downsides are: Cost, cost, time, cost, more time, cost, possible automation, cost, cost, and oh, did I mention the tremendous cost to obtain even a simple Private Pilot Certificate from the FAA? Even under Part 61 (I think it is 61. Might be 141)?



So, to make a long story short: Be me. Went to college, fucked up. Dropped out to work min wage. Piss off family. Get kicked out. Later go back to college part time to fix bad grades, go to 4-year. Fuck up tremendously with F's across the board due to sheer stupidity. Dropped again. Looked at doing CS, loved it. Dropped out due to money. Still working full time min wage like a loser. Looking for advice on Reddit because I'm desperate to improve my life situation that I am willing to rely on the whims of anonymous strangers.



If you made it this far: Thank you so much for your time! I appreciate your gesture to hear out my story. I do, however, have a few questions related to the above:



1.) If you were in my position, how would you go about positioning yourself towards success? I leave this vague and open for you to answer in whatever way you feel is important.


2.) Should I go back to college and pursue undergrad work in CS/AMath? How should I approach my poor academic history? Graduate school is out of the question so, how could I advance my skills?


3.)If college is out of the question, should I self-teach myself CS/Math? There are many risks involved and it is not like I would have a paper that validates that I am competent. Nor would any employer want to hire a self-taught person (to the best of my knowledge!)


4.) What about trade work? What am I missing (intentionally vague question)?


5.) Should I look at aviation work?


6.) Any questions or comments you would like to say?



Again, thank you very much for your time! I appreciate all positive criticisms and remarks that you may have.",19Aug2018,1

194,"Throwaway because I've no idea who I know personally on Reddit, and dont want to freak them out.

Forgive me if I'm not coherent. My thoughts are a mess.

For two years (2016 - 2017) I knew a girl and entered a close (almost dating but not quite) relationship with them. At least from my perspective, they were manipulative and I was malleable. Long story short, they called me out for supposedly attention seeking when I questioned my sexuality, 'borrowed' about $200 from me and now that I'm unlikely to ever see her again, I'm unlikely to get it back, and tried to get really close to me, halting relationships with others, just to use me for sex against my will (among other things). I've always had self-esteem problems and have been relatively insecure about myself but they way she treated me just made me worse.

I was able to cut off contact with them late last year, and I've only seen them about twice this year. But once I started getting back into the dating scene I realised that the thought of romantic or sexual dating now makes me feel very sick. I forced myself into dating at a friends advice, he suggested it would stop if I dated again. For a while, it did. But now the feeling is back - I do like my girlfriend a lot, but the idea of relationships make me feel terrible again. Maybe its because things have just piled up lately - loss of a friend, among other things.

196,"My husband and I and his sister and her husband have had allot of tension over the last few years.  A few years ago they moved in with us while they were looking for a place of their own. At first things were really good, then a couple of weeks into their stay with us they started to get really picky about everything my husband and I did. For example if I forgot to turn a light off at night, I would find an angry note on the fridge. My husband would tell me to not confront them over it and to just ignore it, which I did. Anyway one night my husbands sisters husband asked my husband if they could go for a walk to “talk”. They were back about 2 hours later and I asked my husband what had happened. He told me that he was basically telling him what we are doing wrong in OUR lives, like the way we live, we don’t recycle, we aren’t electricity saavy and he complained that I was too clingy to my husband.
Now, after hearing this, it did turn my feelings against the two of them, after we had offered them to live with us and all they could do was complain. 
They eventually moved out and we didn’t hear from them for months until we had a family dinner. At this point I was pregnant with our first child, and we both received no congratulations from them. We moved interstate and our baby was born and they hadn’t even wanted to see their niece or even talk to us after our baby was born.  It made me want to cut all ties with them and so we haven’t talked in years.

197,"I need to vent.

Here’s some background. My family and I have never been close, but we’ve always got along. I have two sisters who live at home with my mum and stepdad, I moved out at 17. I’m now 23, living with my partner and our children (2 of which my mum completely ignore when we visit).When my partner and I fell into some financial difficulty, my stepdad offered me a job to top up our income, which was literally the best gift we could have been given.

Fast forward two years, he can’t afford to pay me anymore, so I’ve been handed my redundancy notice, fair enough, running a business must be financially straining at times, so whatever. Turns out he and my mum are continuing to go on luxury holidays every other month, just one of these holidays is 8 months pay for me!! So I’m feeling a little salty.

Anyway my sisters defend them when I tell them how selfish I think it is, again, they’ve got every right to their opinion, so whatever. But it turns out they’re all off on holiday together, I didn’t even get asked if me or the kids would have liked to come along. They kept it a secret, I only found out because I grilled my stepdad on a comment he accidentally slipped out. Granted, I can’t afford a holiday and I don’t particularly want one, I’m just a little upset that my parents can afford for my sisters to be a part of their extravagant lifestyle, but can’t afford to help me out, so I can feed my family, when I’m actually working in return. 

Anyway, I’ve got a new job, and I’m happy to support myself, I always have been, I guess I’m just feeling a little unwanted, I’ve always been the black sheep (because I’m not obsessed with money and possessions) so I’m not surprised.

Please be actually helpful here, I’m really not sure what to do.

A girl who I have considered a sister for years has admitted to me that the one time she was intimate with a man, that he forced himself onto her as she protested his advances. The incident took place over a year ago. 

Tonight, as I drove us home, she spoke of what happened. She cried as she told me which led to me tearing up as well. Seeing her in such pain and agony broke me. 

I was there for her. I didn’t want to know who had done such an unspeakable thing to her because I was angry (I still am). I was a shoulder for her to cry on, but inside, I was boiling.

After she calmed down, I walked her inside and proceeded to drive home. Now here I am, lying in bed, upset and not sure what to do...

So please, people of Reddit, how do I handle such a situation? I am so upset that I want to punish and hurt the man responsible for doing this to a girl that I have grown to love as my own sister.  How can I be there for her?

My best friend was born with a very rare genetic disorder. She had two siblings who were born with the same thing, and they died at the age of 2 and 7. She's 19. All her life she's been in and out of the hospital, getting bone marrow tests, getting her blood tested for platelet counts. About half a year ago, the doctors said that her liver was extremely damaged. She was very positive about it though, joking that she felt just fine and that the doctors were overreacting. 

Meanwhile, I have been in a relationship with someone who lives across the world for several years, now. I wanted to be close to him, at least for a semester, so I applied to go on exchange for university. when I found out about her liver, I talked about cancelling the exchange, but she encouraged me to go.

Now, I'm about a month into the exchange, and have been in the country for about two months, and I get the news from a mutual friend that she's dying, and that the doctors say she only has weeks to live.

I can't stop thinking about how I should have stayed behind when the doctors said she was sick. I can't stop hating myself for not staying in touch better. My plan as of now is to go back home, drop out of the semester as soon as possible, and try to get home in time to see her again.

I know I'm a terrible friend, and that I've failed her by not messaging her more often. I got caught up with everything else. I didnt take the doctor's warnings seriously enough. And I know that of she dies while I'm on the other side of the world, I'll never forgive myself.

Any words, would be appreciated. Give me advice, hate me for what I've done, ask me questions, I don't care. I just dont want to be alone in this stupid little apartment all by myself. Everyone in my home country is asleep at this hour, I just want someone to talk to.

So I met this girl online on a game a few years ago. She is cool and even though we play on an American server she’s from the same country as me.

We play off and on again. When she’s online it’s the only real way we keep in contact cos she doesn’t have any social media. We text sometimes but she’s careless with her phone so most of the time I don’t get a response when I do. We have shared a few photos (mostly me) but I still have no idea what she looks like. She also claims to work for a company but I can’t find it online.

Now to the meat of this and why I’m asking this question. Last weekend I went to the city she lives in for work. I had told her before hand and she asked if we wanted to meet up. I agreed. Leading up to the weekend she had said she needed to finish up some work and was nervous about the meeting. It was fine but what I wasn’t happy about was that when I asked her about details (places and days to meet) she dodged the questions or went offline. She had also said she lost her phone. 

Then that weekend rolls by and I get nothing from her. I even try to log into the game on the shitty hotel wifi but she’s not online. I leave a message to her and check again but no reply.

Look I had my thoughts about this being a cat fishing ploy but in the three years I have known her she has never asked me for money or any pictures of myself. All we have done is chatted and played the game.

2. Is it possible to get an office job instead of the common blue collar jobs? (I do have 2 years IT experience from a big company in my country but I still feel hugely under qualified) If so, do you have any suggestions on where and how to apply?

I've been trying to apply for office jobs without having any luck. If it's not possible then I just wasted my time sending my resume to dozens of companies online. ",19Aug2018,1
214,"Throughout my life I have always had a plan. I was going to seminary, get married, become a pastor, and have kids. That's what I wanted.

But life has a way of going against plans. I did go to seminary and I did get married. But then my wife became physically abusive, hateful, violent, and unfaithful. My marriage is over. 

I was working in a Christian bookstore at the time too. My immediate boss loved me as well as my associates. But my district manager did not. She has said if I ever go back then management will not be possible. My job is over.

But now I am in a crossroad. I am separated from my wife and living with my mom.

Everyone wants me to follow their plan. 

I am in the process of interviewing with a church for its youth pastor position and I would do artwork on the side. Throughout my life this would have been a dream situation but I am just not satisfied with the idea anymore.

My church wants me to stay where I am so that I can help them.

Others are telling me other jobs I could have.

I am just not satisfied with any of it. I am being tired of being told what I should and should not do. My wife ruined me. I want to go my own way and do my own thing.

What I have liked the idea the most is trucking. Being alone. Solitude. And a better income than any of the alternatives. But my family hates the idea.

Am I wrong to feel this way? I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

Tldr: I delt with abuse and now I'm not satisfied with my old plans and the plans others are making for me. I don't know what to do.",19Aug2018,1

I work in orthopedic manufacturing and he works in RV manufacturing as a welder. These are both really big industries in our area. We have about $10,000 set aside that we could use as  a downpayment on a house, or for moving expenses if we decide to move.

my best friend and her husband moved out west over a year ago now and we have gone to visit a few times and we both love the area. We have talked about moving there because we liked it so much and because we are young and don't have anyone to look out for but ourselves. We've researched apartments and jobs. But haven't applied for anything because it's a big move to make and were having second thoughts. 

On one hand, if we stay where we are we will be financially stable and comfortable surrounded by friends and family. But I fear we'll spend our life regretting that we never took a shot.

On the other hand if we move across the country to a place with a higher cost of living and no guaranteed jobs we might regret giving up everything we have here.

She’s 84, a strong believer in that medicine can cure everything. She’s seen many doctors across the country and every single one of them told her that she needs to try and walk and fight the numb leg. Her response is that the doctors don’t care about her and that there’s no hope, however I know through others experience that exercise is exactly what she needs.
She sat on her ass for the past 20 something years infront of her television so she has no will or motivation to move. She still believes that medicine can cure nerve damage.

226,"So, met this guy at his place of work. He’s super sweet and very good looking. We exchanged numbers and started talking for a while. He kept asking me out on dates but would go quiet the day before and the day of. 7pm would roll around and I’d be like “raincheck?” because it’s getting late, I’m old, and I have responsibilities to take care of. One day he actually commits to a date and it goes pretty well. Best date I had in a long time actually. We didn’t kiss at the end of the date, and that’s only because I told him I wanted to take things slow and he was respecting that (he told me later he wanted to kiss me then stated what I just said). After the date he started doing the same thing so I stopped talking to him. 

About 3 weeks later he starts talking to me again and all the same shit starts happening. Never committed to a date. And when I told him it was my bday one day, he didn’t even wish me a happy bday. I was just done at this point and had a LOT of family stuff going on so I told him I didn’t really have the time right now. He said ok, and was cool with it, but then he texted me again about a month later. 

I didn’t answer him that time or a couple of times after until last week. I figured the guy must really like me if he keeps popping up even after I’ve ignored him so much. I apologized for blowing him off and he was super sweet about it. We once again plan a date, and same shit happened. No talk day before, and little to no conversation the day of. In fact, he ended up gutting out a kitchen with his father and didn’t tell me that this was the plan, nor did he offer to reschedule. So around 5pm I offered for us to go to a car show on Sunday and he said he would. He asked me the times of the show and I gave them to him thinking he was going to continue the conversation and set a time. He didn’t.

231,"Okay so it was my best mates pre drinks 18th thing on Friday and it was a class night, I got extremely drunk considering all the free drink for once (might as well take advantage right) and we all had a great time. I threw up before leaving -maybe it was tactical but my brain wasn’t working amazing so I can’t remember - and we walked to the club, bearing in mind there’s like 30+ at the pres and maybe 15-20 actually going out. 

Get to the club, somehow get in despite my state and we’re all still having a great time. This is when things go tits up, the girl that my mate has told me he really likes is grinding hard on me so I clock that and try and grab his t-shirt and pull him over for like a solid 5 minutes but he’s not taking the bait. Another half hour passes and we just get closer and closer and then the pull. It was short and the minute I was out I ran across to the sofa with my other best mate and balled my eyes out (lol), felt like shit and he calmed me down and told me not to tell our friend what happened (so did multiple others so I just listened to the advice). The night continues and I heard later that my best mate actually got with someone else that night which I’m not sure how to feel about his later reaction now, I stupidly got with this girl again btw towards the end of the night but I really was gone at this stage (not excusing myself just stating facts). 

So next day everything seems calm, I snap him back and forth for a while not really thinking about what happened and then couple hours later the mate that comforted me calls me and says the guy knows as the girl told him, yeah fuck right. He advices me not to speak to the guy direct and just to let him calm down which I do although I speak to a couple other of my mates to figure out what happened, how angry he was and how to solve shit, one of them was the guys younger sister who I know well. 

Then shit hits the fan and he begins snapping me from the sisters phone, he says some really deep and mean stuff and won’t listen to a word I’m saying (bearing in mind I’m simply apologising and saying I know I fucked up bad, no fighting back from me). Long story short he said she was drunk and I was sober (not true as multiple people have confirmed I was indeed fucked), I only pulled her cause she was younger and I wanted to look cool (not true) and I bragged about it the day after (not true, I was just trying to figure the situation with mates as I said). I was legit shaking at this stage cause I couldn’t believe what he was saying to me and how he was reacting, things calmed down later minimally but I feel sick to my stomach and haven’t stopped worrying since yesterday. 

Last night he said he wanted to meet today and speak man to man so now that sick feeling is even worse cause I feel like he just won’t listen to my side of the story and will go in on me harder. Thoughts?

My goal this year is to find a solid group of friends. The friends I do have now are very unreliable, as they all have either other friends or are in relationships and so they spend a lot of time with either their other friends or their bf/gf. 

For a bit of background about my freshman year: I did join a solid amount of clubs, but didn’t do so until partially through the year so it was a bit awkward trying to join in. I did meet some cool people though and made a couple friends that I’ve hung out with a couple times outside of the club. 

A lot of people tell me to join greek life to make friends, but I’m not interested in a sorority. I would potentially join a service or professional sorority/frat, but I’m not sure how those work and if they’re worth it. (so if anyone can speak on what they’re like I’d appreciate it).

I do have a bit of social anxiety, and am always worried about seeming too clingy or too excited to meet someone new (if that makes sense). As a result, I have a hard time asking people to hang out bc I’m nervous I’ll be rejected, or that when the time comes to hang out I’ll be too boring. Any advice on how to overcome this?

233,"Using a throwaway here. I'll keep the story brief. 

Story so far: My girlfriend and I have been in a very healthy relationship for 3 years now. I've supported her going through school to get her RN, and she's supported me when I got in the Marine Corps. Because of this, we're currently long distance. We're both 22 years old. My parents have been indifferent about it up until now, but that's changed. 

As of late: Within the past few months, my mother has shown a lot of discontent towards her. She comes from a pretty poor family, has lots of tattoos, and just got out of a very abusive relationship. I believe my mom to have somewhat of a prejudice towards her. I come from kind of a well-off family (I don't like to talk about it to stay humble), my mother has a PhD in dentistry and her own practice, and my father works for a bank. My mom thinks she's a deadbeat that's looking to sap my military paycheck and benefits. 

What really sent me over the edge: My girlfriend developed a UTI a few days ago and is in a lot of pain, she can't afford to go to the doctor. I call and ask my mom to give her a call to check on her (she thinks of my mom as an inspiration) and she refused to. It absolutely broke my heart that my mom won't even take 5 minutes to see if she's alright. When she would do litarally anything for my family, mine won't even give hers the time of day.

She says all doctors (Which the profession i plan to study and practice) are liars and only she knows proper nutrition and health advice, which she constantly lectures me on, even though i provide her with dozens of studies and research that contradict her absurd ideas.

She doesn't believe in sewage systems and in the possibulity of mankind building them, so claims god handles sewage, but wakes up the next day and says god doesn't exist, and the next week he's suddenly talking to her.

239,"I'll keep it as short as I can, sorry if advance. I'm on mobile. 

   I met this girl, we became close friends very quickly. Big conversations took place and we had a strong understanding for eachother very quickly. 

  We began hanging out often as I asked, we formed a liking for eachother about 2 weeks in. 3 weeks in she kissed me, got into my car, said sorry for kissing me, and I kissed her again. 3 days went by of us being close and cuddly until I decided we should maybe stop this and not get to emotionally invested, incase it doesn't work out. 

   She was still a sweetheart to me though, made me lunch and the night before she held my hands close and started listing off in depth all these good things about me. I'm not used to attention like that, and it really hit me hard..

  I go to a City south of me. She goes to some mountains. I Texted her 3 times, medium-small texts. Basically ""Have a good day"" kind of texts. She messaged me by the end of her trip saying I overwhelmed her and we should stop talking. 


  Fast forward 3 months we haven't talked. She shows up at my work on my last day. We talk like nothing happened. I guess we both don't hold grudges. This shined for both of us. We parted ways,  all was well. 1 day later I bump into her at the gym. We chat, make jokes, everything is fine, hang out after and we have an in depth conversation. She gets me it feels, in a way most people don't, it is severe. I'd like to think I get her. She says I do. 

  She mentions she is moving out soon and would like someone to move in with. After beating around the bush, she asks me. Fast forward 4 days, she kissed me again. It was all good until she said it wasn't 1 day later. That the emotions are all there, but physically she doesn't feel it. This hurts, as she is the person I've felt closest to in over 5 years (in such a short time which is unlike me.) 

  We talk about it and come to an understanding that as roommates maybe we shouldn't form a relationship so soon. It makes sense. So we go with it, all for about 30 minutes until we made out again, she felt me up and I felt her up. She said this time she felt so different, she liked it and felt a spark. 

  1 day later she is at work, we text, I feel as though last time she made me lunch. So ill make her lunch.  We talked and she needed a favor to be driven home. So I did, she made her lunch and was off to work 90 minutes later. She texted me about 5 times threw her shift. I was off so I could text back. While she felt me up she went for a few areas that are off limits. I poked fun at it. 

  This morning I woke up with a bad feeling. At 6:40. I knew she worked late, and had to wake up early, so I figured I should message good morning incase her alarm didn't go off and that was the bad feeling. Can't hurt anyways. She messaged about twenty minutes later.

  Being the same morning, one day away from our first showing, she messaged me saying she is leaning more towards friends and being roommates may not work out. She doesn't feel comfortable speaking together every single day, only to move in with eachother and possibly forming a romantic situation. 

  She cried the other night telling me she wouldn't want to lose me as a friend because she loves me as a person with how close we can get with eachother. She hasn't cried in years she said either which is why the feeling hit her so hard. She said I should have more confidence to just move forward without asking all of the time if she is sure she wants to move in. I've asked like 4 times in a week, because last time she did just up and leave without any explanation, and I also want to make sure she is comfortable.. 

  I have no idea what is going on in her head, how can she be so hot and cold with me. I've told her that with me and her, kissing doesn't mean nothing. It's a big thing to me.. so I'm not sure. This is stressful, I wish she knew what she wants because I recoarsed myself for this, I can move out alone still, which was a plan of mine anyway, but now it just won't feel the same. ",19Aug2018,2

243,"So I was getting up for work and my stomache doesn't feel good so I call in sick. I had two ""work"" numbers in my phone and I call the first one. No one picked up so I left a message. I do the same for the second number. This was around 7am, my work (I originally thought) opened at 8. So anyway, after about twenty minutes I say ""screw it"" and I go to work anyway, thinking that if I show up and just say I was feeling better everything would be ok. So I get dressed and go down and all the doors are locked. I wait and wait and wait, and since none of the employees have key cards or access codes I never get the door open. I'm angry now because the place is like a ghost town so I just leave, thinking that I already called in so who cares. As I'm leaving I get a notification on my phone that my manager has posted an update on our Facebook board for all the employees to see that reads (to summarize): ""Don't call me on my personal phone at 6am we all have families and that us nit the correct way to contact work."" She didn't call me out but I knew immediately she was referring to my call. I thought it was weird she said 6am seeing as I called her around 7 but whatever. To clarify, when I was recieving my training for the job she had been using that number to text me about scheduling. So was I wrong to assume that that should have been a work number? And if you didn't want people texting or calling you why would you initiate contact using a personal number? Anyway, I walk out kinda angry and really embarrassed. I drive home and a few minutes after I sit down I realize that my work didn't start at 8 it started at 8:45 and I had set the wrong alarm, now I feel even more stupid. My biggest fear is that she will tell the other managers and supervisors and they will think I'm dumb. I'm going to apologize but I'm not sure how to go about it without putting myself as the creepy person who called the manager on her personal phone.

245,"So around 4-5 years ago I moved to England with my family (my parents, and my little brother.) My mum and dad's relationship has always been destructive, he was an alcoholic and his behaviour had sent us into debt. So soon after we moved here they split up, and after that my relationship with him crumbled. He did many things, like fake cancer to try and get back into our lives; he would often threaten legal action against my mum, claiming he would deport us and all sorts of things. Looking at it now it sounds stupis, but i was a little kid back then, and his threats seriously scared me. 

Throughout time our relationship has slightly improved, however, we live in a sort of cycle in which I open up to him, due to the guilt I feel for neglecting my father and he takes advantage of that, trying to call me all the time, talking to me about my mum (e.g calling her a whore)etc., and because of how I am I completely avoid him for weeks to months because of the stress he induces into my life. 

I think the reason his behaviour has such a strong effect on me is because of how much it destroyed me in the past. I went through a stage of deep depression that lasted over a year, I used to cry myself to sleep from the things he would say and his many threats. There was a couple of months where I even went as far as to consider suicide very thoroughly.

Now I'm fine, I no longer have depressive thoughts and I'd say I'm in fact the happiest I have been in a very, very long time...

But how should I handle my relationship with him? Does he deserve my affection? Should I be the one making an effort to mend things? I'm very conflicted, as one the one hand I do care for him and I love him, and I know that he's not fine mentally, something which he refuses to accept continuously, but at the same time I feel like it's not my responsibility to make my father part of my life when it only seems to benefit him, and destroy me internally...

All she does all day every day is smoke and sit in her chair and watch TV.  Meanwhile I've been working, going to class, and doing all the grocery shopping + driving her to doctor's appointments and most of the housework, until her friend moved in about a month ago and has started taking care of most of that.  But our relationship has been deteriorating and she honestly makes me feel like I can't do anything correctly and I feel like all of our conversations end with her yelling at or criticizing me in some way.

Am I wrong for wanting to move in with my dad?  I'm sick of living in the same stupid house breathing in so much smoke for almost twenty years.  I feel like she's not even trying to get better; I've begged her to quit smoking since I was a kid and while I know it isn't easy, she's never made a true attempt.  I'm honestly miserable here and I know I would be a lot happier with my dad.  ",19Aug2018,1

250,"A few days ago my best mate (let’s call him jake for anonymity) comes over like usual for a smoke, my brother (let’s call him logan) and his girlfriend is outside with us, and they start getting into this argument about some trivial shit, and it escalates as any argument does. I say one thing to try and neutralise the situation and then my brother Logan directs all of his anger towards me and essentially kicks off at both of us and says he doesn’t want jake in the house anymore. It’s been a long time coming with them if I’m honest, they haven’t really been getting on and they’ve both said to me in private that they don’t like the way they’re being spoken to. Every time I try and sort it out Logan makes me out to be an asshole saying that I’m choosing jakes side and then falls out with me and doesn’t like Logan even more. Now here’s my problem really, generally the advice would be to just remove myself from the situation because it isn’t really my problem, they should be grown up enough to sort this out by now (we’re all over 18) even if it just means accepting they don’t get on and just moving on. But my problem lies in the fact I’m very ill and can’t leave the house so jake has to come to me in order to see me, he’s literally my only friend and generally when I’m having a bad day, which is most of the time for both of us, seeing him and just chilling with your best mate doing nothing is proper nice. Logan however doesn’t want to see him or have him in the house, so it’s like, what? Am I not allowed to see my best friend anymore because of they’re problem? Generally I just wanna remove myself from the situation but my problem is not being able to leave the house? Logan is pretty hard to reason with and is very quick to make things personal and start arguments when trying to have a normal conversation as well so I’m in a bit of an awkward position really.

Since he is an only child his mother wants to throw us a fancy reception.  She chose one of most expensive restaurant in our town as the venue. I barely have any family so it will be 90% his aunts and uncles and cousins we barely know. The problem is we are struggling financially and I feel this fancy meal is a waste. She went ahead and planned this with no input from us. I wanted my fiance to tell her we could have used the money she spent on the event for a down payment on a house.

260,"Here’s what happened;

On February 15, 2018 I had the worst asthma attack I ever had in my life. It started as a regular....typical attack. I immediately got my inhaler and took a couple puffs. But it didn’t work. (Never has my inhaler just “not worked” before that point.) within 45 seconds my breathing ability was rapidly declining. So I took 14 more puffs as an emergency precaution. But that didn’t work either. I got up and walked to my friends room where he immediately called an ambulance. At this point, I was completely literally breathless. No air coming in, no air coming out. It stayed like this for about a minute and a half. It was uncomfortable and probably the single most torturing experiences of my life. I was 10 percent certain that I was going to die. I wish it stopped there but it doesn’t. I started to all of a sudden feel relaxed and tired. My hearing totally shut of,  I started to see in tunnel vision and most of all I felt happy for some reason. (I still remember every sight and every smell and every slight emotion I felt at that moment.) about a minute later all I see is blackness. I went in to the deepest sleep anyone could ever imagine. As if I didn’t exist. Idk how to explain it..... I wake up in the hospital on a mechanical ventilator, tubes in my veins and over 10 doctors, nurses etc in my room giving me care. Turns out I had died for 14 minutes but they were able to bring me back. Final diagnosis- status asthmaticus and respiratory failure. My question is, how do I stop thinking about this? I have had flashbacks on this day every single day so far and I kinda want them to stop. I wouldn’t call it ptsd or anything, but the thoughts of that day are extremely vivid and I remember every single detail and they make me extremely stressed, anxious and sometimes hopeless. I’ve been thinking about this more and more.....or more like it pops in to my mind spontaneously but yeah. I’d love to learn tricks to divert my brain from thinking about this so often. Thanks!

270,"So I have had this friend for 7 years. We were pretty close had really good times, never really got into arguments, only once. Recently her boyfriend broke up with her and was taking it hard on her own ego. She started to change a lot as a person and began focusing on her looks a lot. While she was going through her breakup i was going through something myself with really bad anxiety and agoraphobia, so even though I couldn't physically be there for her I was as much as i could over the phone and saw her when i was able to. I would spend hours on the phone with her and we would talk about her issues and my own and she seemed understanding.

Anyway, she would make fun of people a lot, call people ugly call them retarded and stupid and losers, and began to get very cocky to compensate her feelings of getting dumped. I did not like how she was acting so i would ty not to engage in those kinds of conversations. She then began working out at the gym everyday talking about how hot shes going to be and how hot she is now and how much shes grown as a person since the breakup. I began getting annoyed and I think she began to notice. 

As I began getting over my agoraphobia One day i hung out with a friend of ours and posted pics on instagram. I had spoken to her through text, but once i posted those pictures, I never heard from her again and she began ignoring me. I said happy birthday to her, no answer. I was upset but at the same time because i didn't like how she was acting, I didn't care too much. I eventually deleted her off social media because she was constantly looking at my instagram stories and things i posted. She then blocked me. I never got a real reason as to why she started ignoring me.


just for background for next part I work and i am currently in grad school for education getting my masters, so, and I do suffer from anxiety and mild depression so sometimes i can be negative about things but i am seeing a therapist and i am trying to work on things.

Now she spoke to my friends(the one i posted pics with, the day she stopped talking to me) brother, and told him that the reason she stopped being my friend was because we were going in different directions and she was trying to be positive and go to the gym everyday, and I was always negative and that we had our minds in two different places. 

This got me very mad and upset and i feel like shes being extremely hypocritical considering she talks crap about everyone she knows, makes fun of people, sends her friends pictures of people to laugh at them. She also constantly posts bikini pictures and pictures showing off her ass for attention on instagram and is obsessed with getting likes and attention online, which i can agree is something i am not into or can relate to, or respect as a person. But this did get me down a little because i am going towards my career, im working towards something and even though i have anxiety and my mind can go negative places sometimes, to end a 7 year friendhsip over that is ridiculous to me and the opposite of what she claims herself to be. 

Should i even entertain her thoughts or just let it be and live my life. I want to defend myself so bad and tell her off but its not easy. Shes found all new friends who are younger then her and into partying so that is the state of mind she is in. ",19Aug2018,1
271,"Some setup to try and keep this post as brief as I can. I'm in my early 40s, married, father of two young children. I live about 1,500 miles away from my mom, who is in her late 60's. I love her dearly, always have, always will and overall we have a fantastic mother/son relationship. 

She's retired now, and has been for a few years, and my impression of how she spends her days and weeks are that she spends the majority of her time obsessing over how much she misses her grandkids, a considerable amount of time watching videos on Facebook, and the rest of the time inside doing very little for herself. I've tried to have some serious conversations with her about how she could use her time better, but it doesn't seem to register. A quick browse of her Facebook page regularly reveals nothing interesting of her, but photo after photo of her grandkids, to the point of it being obsessive. 

Secondly, and though I'm sure that many people will say ""moms always worry, that's just how they are,"" my mom is an irrational worrier and ruminator. She loves to give unsolicited advice without ever pondering whether or not the recipient would know it. I've had to tell her so many times that it's bothersome, that it makes me feel stupid, and even gave her a way to analyze whether or not she should dish out advice: ask herself if a reasonably smart, somewhat successful adult would know what she's about to say, and if so, to just keep it to herself. For years I've felt like I get no credit for my achievements in life, adulthood, etc. when I'm literally being told things like ""remember that doorknobs are the dirtiest thing in the doctor's office."" We're talking life 101 advice along the lines of ""remember to put your underwear on before you put your pants on"" type of stuff. 

We've talked about this before and I've told her that my impression is that her ""currency"" in life is wishing she could change things for other people, caring excessively, and emotion. She's often so serious; you can just see the look on her face, the mood in her eyes in any one moment that she's just looking for something she can change, have someone do differently, etc. 

Also, she constantly veers towards the negative response to something rather than anything positive. Case in point: told her today that my wife and I got everything lined up with my wife's family to watch our kids later this year when we travel out of town for a wedding (her family is about an hour away from us). Rather than my mom getting excited for us, or simply saying ""that's great,"" she got stone faced, silent for nearly a minute while I told her about the trip (we were on FaceTime) and the first thing she says is ""well am I not going to get to see the kids any time soon?"" It's always like this. She brings on the self-pity as fast as possible. She's envious that other family gets to see the kids instead of her even though the reality of it is that my wife's family live close, and my mom doesn't. All she should have said was ""can we find a weekend for me to come up soon?"" But no. It's just instant read-between-the-lines that she's jealous of someone else's time with my kids, and gets upset about it.

Lastly, with regard to the conversation today, she had to throw out the same thing she always does for no reason, which was to ask if my wife has any problem with her being with us. We've had this conversation so many times, she always asks it, and the answer is that my wife has nothing wrong with her being with us, or us with them. What we don't like is her wearing out her welcome quickly by being imposing, thinking she can control our kids, her sense of seriousness all the time, etc. We never feel like we're just adults hanging out. There's always this air of walking on egg shells that some big conversation or big point or big generic advice is just around the corner. It's exhausting.

I really need to find a way to confront her about this in a peaceful way, because it's taking a toll on me every time it happens. I end up obsessing over it, bottling it up, worrying too much about when the next moment comes up that I feel this way, or how long it will take to fade away. She constantly sets herself up for disappointment or to be let down, because she builds up big ideas, big hopes to change things. 

So, the advice I'd like is about how to as nicely as possible talk to her and tell her a few things: 1) I love her, and I want better for her than the impression I get of her daily life, which is doting on her grandkids on Facebook, sitting on the couch, and obsessing over how much she misses her grandkids. 2) The big serious conversations about various things, and all the basic generic advice, need to stop, because to be honest it makes me feel like I'm stupid and that she can't see me for having a good head on my shoulders. 3) She needs to stop thinking / asking / wondering if my wife has issues with her. She doesn't, AT ALL. It's just what I said above, basically a desire for respect in our own home and a sense that she shouldn't be giving us advice about what we do with our kids. 4) I need her to find something to be happy about FOR HER, whether it's on her own or with my stepdad (her husband). Part of me wants to talk to him first, to just be honest and I say I don't know how to tell her this stuff, but what's his perspective and can he talk to her about how I feel? Can he stimulate any desire for her to do something every week for her that makes her happy.

Anyhow, long post, but any advice on the best path to take will be most appreciated. I've had some tough conversations with her before, some emotional conversations where I had to be really blunt to make my point, but this time around for some reason, I need it to feel more permanent, more long-lasting that I've politely expressed my feelings, how all this affects me, and that if she hate's seeing me feel this way, she's the one who can change things.

281,"Hello. 

Vacation is almost done and it's about time I started studying for my exams.

The reason I'm feeling the anxiety is because a lot of things had happened this year.(I'm not usually panicking)

I'm going to be 20 y/o next month. My parents have been renting a house for around 30 years, which is... A lot. And that was the life I always knew. They recently bought a house, around 25km away from the town where I used to live. They're working abroad, a lot - in order to pay the bills. It's hard.

They insisted that I should take the driving lessions, so I could drive a car etc. And, well I know you don't have to be an Einstein in order to learn how to drive BUT I failed the theory exam, and it's costly to retake it, and thus I'm under a lot of pressure because I know how hard it is to earn the money. I'm afraid of failing again. I don't want to fail. There's a huge pool of questions (1900) and they're randomly chosen (41). The very thought is... Hurtful.

I also have 4 exams coming up on college and I'm not sure how to prioritize my time, I'm trying to find motivation but it seems to me that the more I try, the harder it gets. I must change the approach and I don't know how to ignore the pressure...

What would you suggest me to do? How do I focus? How to cope with it?

I'm having troubles with anxiety and pressure due to certain circumstances. The exams and the driving school are likely the cause of it. I need an advice.",19Aug2018,1

We went to couples counseling and he has admitted to being controlling and says he has changed but I feel trapped in my marriage at this point. I don’t know if I should stay or go. I hate being with him.
- Pushed me constantly to move out of parents house at 17 (it was not a good situation to live in it was emotionally abusive) I eventually moved in with his aunt. 
- Pushed constantly to text whereabouts
- If I didn’t text him for a couple of hours he would get extremely angry. Claimed he was worried about my well being
- I had to ask for permission to see friends 
- If he didn’t approve of said friends it would be a massive fight and I wouldn’t end up seeing them after all 
- Pushed me to cut communication with my mother/sister
- Any fight we had he would bring up the fact that he always bought dinner and/or gifts for me and this is how I ‘treat’ him for it 
- Once all of these things were simply a behavior for me he became more relaxed and it’s not really an issue any more 
- Always kept track of past misgivings and brought it up in a fight 
- If I had seen a friend or went to a family members I wouldn’t be allowed to do it for a really long time again. ‘You did this recently. Why do you need to do it again?’ 
- Always make fun of the way I spoke or the way I did something wasn’t good enough. I was constantly worried about doing something the correct way. It doesn’t happen so much any more because I know the way he likes things done but this happened so much in the beginning of the relationship 
- If I was ever late to going to his house even ten minutes it was a huge fight and he made me feel extremely guilty. I learned to always be on time or early. 
- If I was ‘good’ I would get to go somewhere, but if I was bad he wouldn’t take me to eat 
- He would read messages over my shoulder. -Eventually I didn’t have any one to text so this wasn’t an issue so much any more 
-Didn’t let me wear makeup ‘who are you wearing makeup for? You don’t need it’ ‘why are you always wearing so much makeup’ 
-He is never wrong in an argument 
-Wouldn’t let me get my ear pierced

283,"So my mother, who is 50 y/o, told me she is 98% sure she is going to lose her job that she's been working at for 20+ years by September.  I don't have much details about the firing as she is too scared to tell me why.  All she told me is that she knows things and if I were to say anything to anyone, it would make her lose her job that much quicker.  I have advised her to talk to HR about it but she says nothing will come of it.  The information specifically revolves around her boss who is actually my ex-stepmother.  My mom feels like part of the reason of the incoming firing is because I divorced her daughter.  Just want to restate that it is PART of the reason, not the main reason so far as I can tell.  

So here are my questions:

At her age, what resources can she use to find a job that will pay either close to what she makes or just as much?

Should she not talk to HR about what she knows and move on?

Thank you in advance for any and all responses.",19Aug2018,1
284,"Sorry, this is long and sounds ranty, but I promise there is a point.

Basically, I've (24f) been with my boyfriend (25m) for five years. He's lived with me the entire time as her was not in a good living situation at the time. Out of the five years, he's probably helped with bills for about 2 years total. I have maintained a full time job the entire relationship and even make about $13,000 more a year now than when we first got together. He, however, has been unemployed about 4 months now after FINALLY sticking with the same job for over a year and actually being really successful at it. Throughout the years, I have tried to break up with him, but he can just be so sweet when he needs to be. I tried breaking up with him after I cheated on him (thats a whole different story), and he asked me to stay after wrong doing him, because he claims I'm his happiness. I don't want his misery on my conscience, but I remind him that it's unhealthy to depend on another person for their happiness. The point I'm trying to get to is, I got offered a job 5 hours away for $8,000 more a year. The company, however, does not help pay for moving expenses and it's almost impossible to try to save up enough to afford the move when I'm currently paying all the bills. My boyfriend wants me to take it so we can get out of this city (he grew up here, I've lived here about 6 years now). The thing is, though, if I move, I don't know if I want him to come with. He is such a jealous person and I fear he'd make it impossible to try to make new friends out there. I'm s very social person, and he immediately shuts out 90% of people and then I'm left making excuses to justify why he is an asshole. This is my dream location and store and I know I should take it, but logistically I can't afford to in the next few months. My car is broken down and I need to pay my license reinstatement fee, both things I could afford if I wasn't nervous about spending money on stuff I need in case a random bill shows up because I know it's me that has to pay it and I know my boyfriend will call me irresponsible if I'm short on money for it. In this time span, though, of course I've made his car payment and paid his insurance and shit because I don't want him to go without. I hate how in my head he is.

So after all that, basically what I'm looking for is: Do I not take the job and stay financially safe-ish for now? Do I move 300 miles with my current boyfriend and hope things get better? Or do I take a risk and move out there with just me and my dog? The third sounds the best and so freeing, but am I even going to be able to get my shit together in time for it to be feasible? I have until Friday to accept the job and I have to be moved up there before November.",19Aug2018,2
285,"I think it is. I’m 20 and a transfer student to a new college. Because of my age, I am in a special co-ed townhouse with other people 20+ years old. I’ve never been away to college, only community college, and because of this both of my parents want to move me into the townhouse. I think this would be mortifying because: I’ll only have 5 housemates so I’ll definitely stick out, we are in a townhouse on campus not a dorm, these students probably have their own cars because the townhouse is on the edge of a huge campus with no bus service so their parents probably won’t even be there, and I think overall it sends a red flag to my housemates that I’m either a weirdo and/or have helicopter parents so they won’t want to be friends. 

My dad and sis are trying to convince me this is perfectly normal and okay though so I’m not sure if I’m overthinking.

288,"This is my freshman year of high school and I just moved to a new state across the country 3 months ago. The school year started about a month ago and since then I’ve been completely alone (during lunch, in the halls, I sit alone in class, and I’m a shy introvert). So about 2 weeks ago I got switched into a bunch of new classes. 2 of those classes are with upperclassmen, which is where I met actually met somebody. He started to talk to me and I was able to carry the convo. 

The next time we meet he invited me to eat lunch with him, and we go to the guitar room(he plays guitar) to eat lunch. Basically he introduced me to his friends (he’s a sophomore and his frens are pretty much all sophomores with a junior and a senior in there) and we eat lunch in there pretty much every day.  So now I’m thinking i might have a friend group to be around when we decide to eat in the stage and we have a great time talking and hanging out(even though I was pretty quiet). So next time we eat we do the same thing and we have another class together later in the day, wich is when I see him again. 

Normally he sits with me but behind him is one of his friends and usually she has her friend sit next to her while he sits next to me. This particular class, however her fren is gone and he moves with her. For some reason, (this happened before once) I got really hurt inside so I just stared at the clock all last class while I overheard them laughing together and I guess that also hurt cause I was almost crying inside. (I’m pretty good about containing my feelings inside)

I have a bass guitar, unfortunately, I don't play it that much. It's been 6 month since I last touched it, so I'm thinking about selling it. However, I'd like to try one last time to get into it before finally giving up.  


I love that instrument, however it's a bit hard to play, thus I don't see that much progress and if I don't feel progress I just stop. How can I get motivated to play it, at least, 30 minutes a day? What's the mindset I should have? What can I do to get a feeling of progression?

291,"Brief backstory: my in laws are a hot mess, financially, pretty much always have been since I've known them. They have an adult child with an unspecified intellectual disability that relies on them for food/shelter/transportation/medical care/etc., but is fairly high functioning otherwise. 

Recently had a conversation with my MIL about their retirement planning. They have about $300,000 saved and are in their sixties. Counting on inheriting money from their parents which will bring total retirement savings to around $1,000,000 if they're lucky. No grasp whatsoever on how little money that is in today's world. Thinks ""it'll be fine as long as we don't have any major medical issues."" No will in place. No life insurance. 

The most alarming part of this conversation was the intimation that their plan for their adult child when they die is perhaps to send her down to where my spouse and I live (a major city). I don't think they'll have any money set aside unless they die tomorrow, the adult child has no infrastructure in place where we live, and we don't live near any family or have any additional resources for her care moving forward. In laws don't have good records of her care in their current state so we'd likely be starting from zero. 

My question is - what is our liability if this were to happen? How can we protect ourselves from being saddled with care that we can't handle for a disabled adult? We have three small children of our own and not too much of a relationship with the adult in question, and as terrible of a choice as it is to have to make, I just can't envision myself assuming the level of care monetarily, emotionally, and physically, that his parents currently provide for her. (Please don't flame me, they currently pay for her food, lodging, medical care, cellphone, internet, clothing, toiletries, and they transport her to and from her nominal job. She's not good with hygiene so they have to help with that. She's messy so MIL does her laundry and cleans her room. She's a relatively strange and often belligerent person with not a lot of direction. I just can't envision myself doing all of that for her for the rest of my life without resentment. Husband travels for work and home life/child care is frequently 100% shouldered by me.) 

Anyway, any advice on how their situation shakes out in general, but specifically in regards to their needy child, would be appreciated. Particularly if spouse and I are named as caregivers for this child in the event of their death. Thanks in advance. 

Edit: in laws are in relatively poor health in their late sixties. Thought that might be relevant info. ",19Aug2018,1
292,"I've struggled with my depression since I was a kid. I saw a therapist when I was maybe around 9-10 for awhile but stopped because the therapist moved and my parents couldn't afford it or something.

Anyway, I've gradually sort of gotten worse over the years but for the past few years it's been very difficult to deal with. I've been having breakdowns where I just feel miserable and cry. I've been feeling pretty paranoid a lot, and also like I have very little control over the things going on in my life.. and a big thing is that I have mood swings. I can be mostly fine and within minutes I'll be really upset or angry about something.  I've had some outbursts that I'm really embarrassed about when I've had some time to cool down and think about what just happened.

My boyfriend told me he thinks that I need help, and may even need to be on medication. We are adults and live together, but we're still young and I'm still covered by my step dad's insurance. I don't really know how to go about finding a good therapist, and I don't even know that we can afford it or if the insurance will cover it. My boyfriend said I should talk to my mom. Explain to her how I feel, what I've been feeling with, and ask her for help figuring all of this out.

My mom is great. I go to her for help all the time, but for some reason I've typically kept my mental health issues pretty quiet. She has no idea what I've been dealing with and I feel like I don't even know how to tell her about all of it. I don't know if I'll be taken seriously or if she'll believe me that it's really that bad. I'm scared she'll think I'm just being dramatic, or making excuses to be lazy (I don't have my license because I'm terrified of driving, don't have a job because I'm scared of people/doing something wrong, etc).

What are my options? And, if I do go to my mom for help, how do I go about that? ",19Aug2018,4
293,"I'm going to be 1000% truthful in this post.. I'm going out sad man. I'm 20 years old and in college, but It's been a year and a half since I've even come in sexual contact with a girl, and when that happened I literally fucked for a good 15 seconds. This was when I lost my virginity to some broad I worked with. Reason why it was only 15 seconds was because it was 5 AM, a nigga was tired and ready for bed, and I was nervous too. My dick couldn't even get hard because of the nerves and shit. Besides that, to this day, I haven't gotten shit from a girl. No head, no sex, nothing. I've talked to numerous girls and have had them show sexual interest in me, but it never spirals into anything. To put it in perspective, I've probably could have smashed 5 or 6 girls by now if I knew what the fuck I was doing. My life is just on autopilot right now, and I don't know how to regain control again. On top of that, cold approaching girls just isn't my thing. If me and the girl have something in common, then that makes it a lot simpler, but seeing someone just walking down the street and speaking to them is nerve wrecking for me. There have also been times where a girl will be throwin pussy at me, and I won't even ask for the fucking number. I won't think about getting it mid convo, but afterwards I'll realize I missed an opportunity. I just really lack the hunter mindset that most niggas have. They see what they want and they go get it. I'm like a novice when it comes to that shit. Talking to girls isn't my problem, it's finding the courage to go up and get a result I struggle with.

should I build a custom PC right now considering I'm going to be leaving for USMC basic training in a couple of months? 

- Further explanation &amp; information: 
Currently I'm about 2-3 weeks 4 at most before officially swearing into the Marine Corps. It's a for sure thing.

I have wanted to build a custom PC for so long but money has been low. Currently I have the opportunity to build a PC with the value of $5-7k with only $400 so it's really good money wise. On the other hand though, I have wanted a motorcycle for so long. I was thinking of finally getting one once I'm in and even tho it's just $400 going towards the PC (Max $500) anything helps right? 

I already have a MacBook but it's not really useful for gaming. Initially I wanted to make a midtower PC but found it wasn't practical to carry around a 70lb computer every 6ish months and for a bulky case on a military dorm with two people. If I do make it it'd be a mini itx

308,"Hello. I am a High School Junior. I have known this girl (a Sophomore) since I was in sixth grade. We went to the same middle school and now are at the same high school.

In middle school, we didn't talk that much, but we were quite close outside of school. We would go to eat, see movies, etc. and were close enough that we would regularly go to each other's family dinners and those types of things. A sort of brother and sister kind of closeness in a lot of ways. We held hands, hugged regularly, and shared anything we felt like sharing without hesitance. All in all, it was a great friendship that we both enjoyed.

Being a stupid middle schooler, however, I developed ""feelings"" for her and decided to tell her so when she was in sixth grade and I was in seventh. She was clearly uncomfortable and unsure what to do. She told me to forget about that and act normally, and I kind of did. The relationship stayed fairly normal, but it was sometimes a bit weird. I would try to act too romantic (in an eighth grade idiot sense) and stop when she showed she did not want me to be like that.

Fast forward to me moving to high school and we did not talk at all. Since we were not at the same school, we did not see each other at all. Frankly, I tried to forget her a bit and move on. We talked a few times throughout my Freshman year, but she was really cold and nothing like before. I shrugged it off as her feeling weird about me not talking to her more.

Once she came to my school, I tried to become her friend again. We share like 90% of our hobbies, so text conversations between us could go on for like 5 hours straight about something as specific as types of notebooks. Despite this, she would never start conversations over text and would greet me in person like I was a casual acquaintance. 

We started to text a lot in one week in the middle of the year, and I decided to give her a PS3 I was getting rid of when she expressed that she was going to get one. In the past, she would express extreme gratitude for something as small as my family taking her for ice cream. She would write thank you letters, bring gifts, and sincerely seem grateful that we were doing things for her. Despite this, she barely thanked me at all. She acted cold and didn't seem to care at all that I wanted to give her a console to help her.

Since then, we have chatted here and there, but I am still just confused. If I send her a text, we can chat for hours, but she would never send me something first. If I ask her to hang out, she is weird and distant. She acts like we do not know each other despite our families being really warm to each other.

However since I handed in my notice lots of people have being highly curious why so I mentioned my supervisor is a nightmare and I have since found out 1 person quit already because or her another has moved onto a different team and another guy complained to HR.

My decision about leaving won't change as she gave me the incentive to apply for other jobs but my new job is working in a different country and a great opportunity.

314,"So I kinda made a friend in my apartment who is 5-6 years elder to me. Today morning we both were in the lift and we're just casually talking when things kinda escalated and we made out. I think that she's really attractive and hot and everything but I felt like what I did was really wrong. Today evening she called me over to her flat but I made up some excuse cause I was scared. I'm almost certain that she wants some kind of a ""fwb"" relationship but I really don't want that. I live with my parents(I'm 18) and she has 2 flatmates. My parents also have spoken to her a couple of times and they seem to like her. I'm afraid now cause if they ever meet in the apartment or the lift it'll be mad awkward. I can't stop thinking about this since it happened. I kinda liked it but I really want to cut it off. Is there any way I could tell her that I don't want this kinda relationship and just want things the same way as they were? I'm afraid this will ruin everything. ",19Aug2018,1

318,"I apologize in advanced for any mistakes (I’m on mobile) 

I love my stepfather to death. While he’s not my real dad, I’ve always considered him like a father. He recently got heart surgery and he’s being really stubborn about going back to work when the doctor told him he needs to rest. He’s like a kid and refuses to listen because he thinks he’s invincible. My stepfather and mom are divorced, but we’re still pretty close with him. My mom and my stepdad own two houses along other little things. The names on these properties are still in my stepdad and mothers names because the divorce was amicable. One of the houses that they own my younger brother lives in with some roommates to help pay the mortgage. My stepfather lives there half the week and lives in the other house the rest of the week. My relationship with my stepdad is nice. I love him almost like a father. He was there for me along with my mom when I got pregnant and the father left. He’s been amazing although he can be pretty rude sometimes (I just excuse it because he’s pretty old). But he knows we love him. He has kids of his own (adults now) but when he married my mom, they went NC with him. My stepdad and their relationship was pretty bad. I guess my stepdad wasn’t the best father to them growing up and they resent him. That didn’t stop them from holding their hand out every time daddy had to pay their car insurance, phone bills, 3 kids private school tuitions etc. My stepdad was essentially trying to buy their love. Once my mom married him, she saw how much debt he had, she was super upset. My mom worked really hard to get her credit into a good number. She saved up so much that she never bought anything for her self. She was very frugal with herself. So she told him that she needed to stop paying for all of his kids things and that if they truly loved him, they would stay even if he wasn’t handing them money. So once my stepdad stopped the cash flow, they dipped. At that point only one of his kids was the only one who had contact with him and she basically called my mom a gold digger and how dare she. Pretty funny considering the only gold diggers here were her and her greedy siblings. So there has been no contact at all between them all. So stepfather just got out of surgery and among my siblings and I and my mother as well, we don’t know how to talk about the uncomfortable subject that is death. My younger brother cries every time our mom brings up the fact that he needs to talk to our stepdad so we know what papers are going to be needed to deal with. He doesn’t want to talk about it and it’s the same for me. My stepdad thinks he’s Superman and thinks he’s going to live forever. My older brother isn’t as involved. 

How do we  bring the subject up? I am married and live some states away. I have my own money and I’m not looking to ‘keep’ anything. My thoughts on it are basically, I didn’t work for it so it’s not mine nor do I expect anything. My stepfather fixed up the other house he lives at. It was in really bad shape and he worked on it on his own for about 2 years. It’s a beautiful cabin. Along with the other house where my brother lives and helps him by renting it out to other people so they can pay for the mortgage. 

I don’t know about any wills or paperwork but if I know anything, it’s that as soon as my stepdads kids hear anything about their dad getting sick or anything, they’re going to be swarming in like flies to poop. My stepdad is pretty hurt that they won’t speak to him and the fact that he can’t see his grandchildren. I have a kid so he has one grandkid from me (my son doesn’t see ‘step’ anything, that’s his papa) but he’s pretty sad about them going NC with him. He doesn’t speak about it at all and we don’t bring it up to respect his wishes. 

How do we bring up wills and all of the death related stuff without offending him? ",19Aug2018,1

Don’t get me wrong, we have a lot of fun when doing his ideas and when it comes to more serious matters he’s an excellent friend who’s there for me when it matters, but casually it feels like he’s a control freak. The last 5 or more times we hung out, it was because I said yes to his ideas.

It even took another friend (I’ll call him Jim) of ours to point out that he shoots down every song suggestion I have in the car when he’ll play like 10 songs in a row for him to stop doing that. I get that it’s his car, but it’s like c’mon you usually give Jim’s song suggestions at least a chance and he asks way more. Which is silly because he tends to like my choices more than Jim’s.

I get this weird feeling that while Mike really likes hanging out with me, that he has trouble taking my ideas seriously. 

His idea for game night? Sure! 

His idea to do a video for Youtube? Sure! 

See a movie Jim suggested? That at least gets a maybe that could turn into a yes. 

Go to this museum I’ve been talking about for weeks that’s cheap? Nah too far, but going to this burger place on spec that’s almost as far is totally fine as long as it’s Mike’s idea. 

I tried a really simple idea lately since I’ll only have 1 more opportunity to hang with for months before I go back up to college: Let’s watch this movie I love that I think he’ll love? Jim backed me up on it and we were all set to do that... but all of a sudden nah Mike wants do this other idea he had instead. Literally every time.  I got sick of it and flat out told him that I didn’t want to walk around a street fair instead of watching the movie, but now that just makes me feel like I’m whining. 

I don’t want to have to guilt him though because then he’ll just try my idea out of feeling bad and that always feels shitty for me. I want him to try it because he takes my ideas seriously. I guess I have no idea about going about that though. Help?

He is becoming difficult to deal with and it's hard to contact him from time to time. Mind you he has a dangerous hobby and doesn't return calls for days from time to time. His reason for being a new age caveman is that he has too many things to worry about already.

331,"I’ve finally quit cello after 6-ish years of playing. My depression has been the worst these past years and it’s gotten a hold on the things I used to love. 

However, after finally pulling the plug on my music career, I haven’t felt this confident in i don’t even know how long. 

My teacher was borderline abusive and while that may sound normal for most musicians in orchestras, it is not the right mindset for the no-audition group in a public high school orchestra. There’s a certain amount of watching your teacher tell the class that you’re failing or being told that you’re “not musically competent” you can take before you quit. 

I have a very close relationship with my mom, so close that she mama bear-ed her way into the school demanding a change in my schedule. Only her and I know about me quitting cello. 

My dad on the other hand, is totally in the dark. He’s always been musically inclined and to this day can still bang out a rockin’ bass solo. When I expressed my interest in music when I was young, it was like he finally had a daughter he could connect with, which was true. Our relationship is built on him praising my music. 

It’s hard to form a relationship with my dad on other things because he’s a loner who stays to himself. I don’t want to lose what progress I already have. 

My new schedule is set in stone. I’m so scared of disappointing my dad that it keeps me up at night. School starts this Tuesday.

Supporting Info: F 22, diagnosed Vaginismus 2 years ago, undergoing therapy. Very strong cultural background where marriage into other ethnicity is highly forbidden (don't ask.)

So, currently I have joined POF, with no actual intention of ever getting into a serious relationship or even having casual sex, which isn't possible at the moment. I love going on dates though and meeting new people, having a nice evening with them and just having a laugh really. But as soon as it comes to the 3rd date I bail out, coming out with an excuse in order to not see them again, as I know it's not going to work long-term wise (90% of these dates are with men of other cultures) or even short-term wise (due to lack of sex because of vaginismus). So I'll go on a few dates with lots of men, obviously not simultaneously, and when things begin to get more serious I bail out.

338,"Recently, I’ve been noticing that my friends don’t really reciprocate their friendship like the way I do. I treat my friends how they like to be treated but I feel like they don’t treat me how I’d like to be treated.

I’m always someone my friends go to when they’re upset. I let them vent to me and give them advice, but it seems like every time I get upset and want someone to vent to, I get ignored and pushed aside. I try not to let it bother me because maybe they’re busy, but my friends possibly can’t be that busy EVERY time I’m sad, right?

Last week, despite being extremely busy because I was trying to unpack my things to move into my apartment, my friend called me, drunk and crying and I listened to her for 20 minutes. She was walking around lost and I kept asking her if she needed a ride back to her room because I’m pretty sure what she was doing was public intoxication, not to mention it was hot and people probably thought she looked crazy. She finally asked me for a ride and I let her cry all over my back seat and I come to find out she lost her key at a mutual friend’s place, so I drive her back. Throughout the ride, she kept asking if I could drop her off at a restaurant down the street from where she lived so she could eat, but she was drunk and looked a hot mess and I said we can go through the drive through and I’ll pay. We get to the friend’s place and she goes in and I’m waiting in the car for another 20 minutes before she calls and tells me to go home. I was little annoyed so I asked her not to ask me for anything else for the rest of the day unless it was an emergency. She’s been ignoring me for the rest of the week because I told her I’d lost some respect for her since she’d made me drive her around and wait around in the heat when I just didn’t want her to get into any trouble. She has a lot of my stuff that I let her borrow over the summer since I couldn’t take it home and I’ve been asking for it, but she’s been purposely ignoring my messages. Despite “ignoring” me, she’s been checking my snapchat stories.

Yesterday, I wasn’t feeling well and I invited some of my other friends over to watch movies and play Mariokart and I even baked brownies, but no one came. Come to find out, they all went to a party and didn’t even bother to tell or invite me. Even though I couldn’t have come since I wasn’t feeling well, it still sucks because I made all these brownies for my friends and nobody came.

Now, one of my good friends came to town and told me he’d visit me today and I cleaned up my apartment all nice and he forgot and he’s already driving back home.

I’m tired of trying to do nice things for my friends, only to get pushed aside and forgotten every time. I know it’s one thing to be busy, but ignoring me and forgetting to invite me places really hurts or just not even telling me you’re coming when I prepared all this stuff really hurts. It’s exhausting and I don’t know what to do.

tl;dr, My friends don’t treat me how I treat them and now I’m stuck eating an entire batch of brownies alone.",19Aug2018,4
339,"On Friday morning right as I was leaving for work the power went out. Even though it wasn't stormy outside I thought nothing of it. The same thing happened two weeks prior - the whole block was out and the power company fixed the problem by the time I got home from work. I moved here (Ypsilanti, MI) from the east coast 5months ago and it just seems like infrastructure just sucks a little more out here.

I go through my work day and run errands afterwards. By the time I made it home I'd completely forgotten about the power going out in the morning. None of the lights or outlets in my apt have any power. But the empty unit across the hall that my landlord is fixing up has the lights left on. The hall light is on. All of the other residences/storefronts on my block have lights on in the windows.

It's after hours for DTE at this point. I call their automated system and they say my area's problem was already reported and fixed hours ago. I report it again and fall asleep.

I wake up early the next day (Saturday) and talk to a DTE rep. They send a signal to my meter and say there's no problem with my meter, ask to make sure I switched my circuit breaker back on, and tell me I need to have my landlord look over my apt.

And so I've been calling and texting my landlord ever since 9:30am yesterday. Not a single response. Maybe she's out of the country and didn't tell me? No idea.

I hate feeling like I have to rush though stores because if I take too long I’ll miss out on other stores. I hate feeling like I can’t leisurely walk around a lake because it closes in an hour and cops like to ticket people for after hours. I like having time to allow more things to happen and for things to be more spontaneous. Ie: Walking around a lake and seeing a cool wooded trail and having time to explore that too without worrying about closing time. You get the jist.

I have some friends who take forever leaving and my bf is even one of those people. They’re all great friends and respectful and caring and all the good traits friends should have. I’m not dropping them over something so petty.

Buuuuut I need to figure out how to not feel so overwhelmed and stressed. I’ve even had mild panic attacks and yes, I am medicated and see a counselor but we haven’t quite figured out a plan that is clicking with me so I’d like some help from other perspectives.

I want to just relax and chill and appreciate the time we have. I want to realize everything can still be done on my own time myself, or done at another time. Deep down I know this but I can’t seem to act on it.

I feel let down, overwhelmed sometimes to the point I can’t think clearly because I’m so stressed. I shut down, essentially.

I’ve talked to my friends and bf about this. They hear me out and they understand. They even try to be earlier sometimes and help find a compromise. But sadly, that’s just how they are as people and at least I am never ditched or rescheduled on. I do appreciate that, we still have fun but regardless, I still panic internally and sometimes externally. I hate it.

Right now me and a group are heading to mall of America. We now have 2.5 hours to explore so we have to omit some things such as the arcade and amusement park area and sea world. 

But because of some people being terrible with starting things early we didn’t leave early. And there’s accidents we’ve had to avoid which impacted our time. We don’t live close enough to do this again anytime soon so it is what it is.

But see? That’s exactly why I like doing things earlier. I expect accidents or car trouble or something out of our control affecting us. I can’t change people. I can only explain it from my perspective and suck it up when things happen. But selfishly, in the back of my head I tell myself if we did it my way we’d have room for error :/ I can admit I can be stubborn and selfish.

Is being in a genuine relationship really like telling eachother everything and being super close?? Like, how the movies portray it. I know it's not all shits and giggles. I know people fight and dont get along in relationships sometimes. 

Like I've always just had my mom and my mom never had a lot of positive relationships. My dad is a deadbeat and stopped talking to me years ago. 

I have a step dad but I dont see him as a dad, or even a father figure. He's always yelling, he makes me and my mom clean everything. He doesnt clean, he doesnt even do his own laundry. I dont know how she can be with him. And if it isn't clean I'm automatically a disgusting slob. There's so much more.. 

I kinda know that all guys aren't like that. But my brain doesn't know that. So everytime a guy tries to get close to me, I'm thinking of all the guys that have left me. It's like everyone leaves me. So I leave them. Because in my head it's less hurtful if I leave first.

The friend (48y ?), let's call him bob, is maried, with 2 children that are in their twenty, and who are also friend with me. I realy like his spouse, she too is a friend, but I always had some mixed feeling with him. He look nice and is a pretty good talker, he also know a lot of joke. So he is realy liked in general.

Bob and Mary always were pretty close, they are both musicians and can be talking for hours. I don't realy know when the idea of them being together apeared on my mind, but that probably was some time after our breakup, when I noticied them being a litle too tactil for a maried man (when her spouse was out of town). But at that time I thought I was jealous, and that was my mind playing trick with me (also, I thought that was a realy dangerous idea, that can do a lot of damages, true or false).  I  forgot that  idea for some months.

For context, I'm actualy in vacation with the three of them and orher friends in a remote RBnB. She chosed the room next to him.

But this moring I saw some pretty obvious events, i.e. while Bob and Mary  were sleeping, my friends (including his spouse) leaved for grocery shoping. she wake and go in the kitchen when I am. She tell me she is realy sleepy and will return to sleep. She then close the kitchen door. Note that I could see their doors from where I was sitting. But not anymore since she closed the kitchen door. That was what make me decided to test the idea, to shut it down. I followed her and sited myself in front off their rooms so that they can't leave without seen me and me seen them. And I waited lying on some cusions with my earphones at full volume.

Then 1 hours latter, I see his doorknob slowly moving and his head looking outside... And meet my gaze. I probably looked sleepy. Then after 5 seconds of eyes lock, he slowly closed the door. Then nothing for 2min. Then I ear the car of my friends comming back. I still didn't mooved. Then he leave the room fully clothed. Then I ear her talking in the kitchen... that's when I remembered that he had a window/door on the garden. She then leave the kitchen, in pyjamas, see me, and enter her room where she was suposed to be.

So I dind't saw or ear anything. But, I can't  think of any other scenario that meet the events. I didn't confronted yet, but they know that I saw them.

I can't ask advice to my friend that are here, they don't need tout know, and will probably be hurt if they learn. I think I need to confront her, since she is the closest to me, then him, then tell his spouse.

I want to do the right thing.
I'm probably a litle jealous.
I'm hurt.
I don't want to hurt.
I feel betrayed (even if we are not together anymore).
I'm afraid of the consequences.",19Aug2018,1

359,"I am currently applying to a graduate program and I must submit a supplemental application.   One question asks to explain any extenuating circumstances that impacted my academic performance.  Would it be appropriate to mention my sexual assault?
The summer before my junior year,  I was raped  by a coworker.  I did not report the assault because I was scared of being kicked out of my university because my private, Christian university was known to do that to victims and I didn't want to hurt my family.  The only person I confided in was my best friend.  
My academic performance began to plummet because I not only had to deal with emotional issues but my financial aid was also dropped because although I was solely responsible for my educational expenses, my parents claimed me on their taxes and my father recieved a substantial raise.
I eventually overcame the shame and guilt and finished another graduate degree in part to strengthen my GPA for the program I am currently applying for.

360,"Long story short: ex bf and i are still friends. After i broke up with him, he was devastated and he suggested we should remain friends because he needed me in his life because he’s was going through a lot. We talk pretty much everyday. Whenever i take too long to text him back, he just keeps sending me a bunch of memes to keep conservations going and he blows up my phone until I respond....
I have no feelings for him anymore but its obvious that he still has feelings for me. 

I live in an apartment at my college town about 3 hours away from his hometown. He comes to my college town for game days/events. He texted me and asked if he could stay with me in a couple of weekends. And I said “no” and he asked me why, and i said i have 3 other roommates and 5 people in one tiny apartment is a crowd and actually an annoying burden. He said “i don’t feel like getting a hotel”. Even though he has many friends in this town that he can stay with... 

I don’t want to spend my weekend with my ex. I just wish he would stop coming to my college town. Whenever he’s here he just always asks me to see him. He never use to go to my college town that much until I transferred to that college. Im also casually dating other men so i don’t need my ex snooping around my new apartment. 

TLDR; Clingy ex bf thinks he needs me and he is always relying on me, how can i get him to stop asking me to hang out with him and stop him from thinking he’s welcomed in my apartment?

When I was like 9 or 10 yo my mother started complaining about anything tye whole time and doing stupid things and ruin my life (she didnt wanted to but she did) and I didnt want to go to school bc the people they bullied me (not physical so nobody cared except me) but I didnt want to be home bc my mom talked all the time and came random into my room and shouted at me when I showed her that she made a fault.
And my older sister always lied and stole things from me but my parents never believed me (especially my father).
Now my mom isnt the worst, my sister is. 
For example my mom thinks she has to clean my room but she thinks she hasnt too so she is just trying to tidying it but is basically just taking important things (sometimes for school) away and forgetting where they are

362,"I am 19M who just graduated high school of May 2018. I am of Native American blood from my mothers side. When I turned 18 (and had proof of HS diploma) I was given money for being Native American. This money has been building up since I was a child. The amount that was given was 22k. 

I was soon pressured into buying a new car (11,750; 5000 down payment, the rest financed) by my dad, which obviously at the time was exciting. However, through hindsight it feels as if he wanted me to buy something that would ground me close to home. He spoke to the financial rep of the college I was wishing to attend, privately. After the phone call, he quickly said that it was a no go. The living expense would be too high.

Now I am not enrolled to any college and it is August of 2018. Obviously, the fall semester is starting soon and now I’m kind of crap out of luck to get into a university. Sure, I can attend a local community college, but as I am seeing all of my peers and friends ship off to school, I am bummed about not being able to share that experience or continuing my education in pursuit of a degree.

366,"Hey all!

First off, I love my mom more than anything in the world. She is always there for me and I respect her very much. Im currently in high school and over the last 3 months I lost 30 lbs. Now that I lost the weight, I have become more invested in weight lifting. To fill my protein macro, I ordered a protein powder called Naked Pea (Im vegan due to religion so I couldn't take the egg/meat based ones). My mom canceled the order( without asking me) and ordered some other powder because she said it was better. Normally I would say ok and move on but this time it was different.

For context:

For the last year my mom has been a part of this WhatsApp group that spreads health and pseudo health advice. Granted, some of the advice has been good such as peel apple skins and try to eat foods with less pesticides but a lot of the advice is either weird or wrong. For example, at least half of the group are antivaxers and they were trying to convince the other half of a link between birth defects/degenerative diseases and vaccines (NO LINK). In response, I wrote a 10 page essay (this was during summer break) and gave to my mom explaining the miracle of vaccination, how many diseases that killed millions have been eradicated, and about herd immunity. She then agreed that vaccines are good but she remained in the group and was too scared to speak up. (Again, like 30 to 40% of the advice the group gives is proven but the rest is pseudoscience). 

The Naked Pea powder I ordered was GMO free, natural, harsh chemical free, etc..

However when I asked my mom why she cancelled my order she said that pea powder is bad. I looked it up to make sure and there is no evidence to prove her statement. I told her but her response was, ""Its bad, the group leader said so and he researches these things more than you. IF you want you can order the pea powder""

Recently, she has also been watching all these videos about what foods cause cancer and some pseudoscience videos and getting all stressed out. Its wierd because she doesn't implement many changes onto her eating habits but just tells us that most of what we eat is a carcinogen. I know she is only doing this for my benefit but I don't know if its going too far. Again, some of the advice the group gives is good so I don't want her to leave the group. **What should I do?**

This post is much less serious than the vast majority on here but I still need advice.

Thanks!",19Aug2018,5

372,"I'm really confused about a hookup that I had with a girl I'm seeing and her response to it. In the past, we have talked about how she was planning on having sex with me but was hesitant cause of her virginity.

We were going about our normal hookup routine, we both took off each other's clothes and got down into our underwear. I fingered her and then got on top of her and start to dry hump her. (For some reason, she is scared of getting cum on her, so she never gives me a handjob.) After a little bit of this, I reached down and angled my dick to thrust into her, as this is something we regularly do. We went about this for a little bit and then I decided I would try and take it further and reached down and moved her underwear to the side a little bit. In the past, the natural friction has moved her underwear to the side and she seemed okay with it, but this time I was trying to take it further.

I then angled my dick into her and started thrusting slowly and trying to get it into her. She wasn't extremely wet (my guess is her underwear soaked it up some), so it took a little bit, but I could for sure tell my dick went into her as she was pretty tight and her vagina basically clenched my dick. (I'm also fairly thick so I think that's why it took a little bit to get into her too.) I only ended up going about halfway into her and then thrusted like one would normally do. I was a little hesitant on if it was okay, and am kicking myself in the butt for not checking in with her, but she kept kissing me back and kept rubbing my back/holding me as I was on top of her. She never said anything objecting to it or even looked distraught or uneasy. It was a pretty fun and exhilarating time cause she was so tight. I was closing to coming, so I pulled out and finished off to the side, and we went about the rest of our night. We watched some Netflix and then fell asleep, nothing out of the ordinary.

Fast forward to a couple nights ago, we were hooking up again and we ended up having sex again. She asked me if this time counted as losing her virginity. I was a little baffled because of the other night and told her that I had moved her underwear to the side. She got pretty upset with me and told me she didn't realize that I had moved her underwear to the side and is now not talking to me. I apologized profusely and feel incredibly guilty for not checking in with her, but I thought everything was okay because she kept participating and didn't say anything. I literally thought to myself at one point: ""is she okay with this? yeah she has to be because she's still participating and she's not saying anything"". In the past when I've tried to go down on her or do anything she's not comfortable with, she has no problem vocalizing it. I feel extremely guilty for not asking if it was okay, but am baffled that she didn't know I had moved her underwear to the side.

A week ago I moved out into a new place, I have 3 housemates, but I have a locked room for myself. This is the first time I'm living without my parents and all this freedom and choice is pretty much really overwhelming for me.

The beginning was fun, we all drank together, partied together, I had some friends over and they hit it off really well with my housemates, but after a while everyone started doing their own thing, and I'm starting to notice that I don't really have my own thing.

I'm not working yet since my previous work is horrible to reach from here, college starts only in 2 weeks, and there's not a lot to do in this place. I have some books I can read, I have some shows to watch, but it doesn't really satisfy the emptiness I feel of living on my own, I feel like I'm missing out on something, like there's so much to do and I just can't get a grip on how I should fill my days.

It also doesn't help that my best friend and I had to take a break from each other, since my love for her was hurting me badly. She and I used to do everything together, from going to the theatre to playing games or partying in the city.

I don't really know what I'd like, maybe I just feel lonely, maybe I'm suffocating over all this freedom and choice, maybe I'm just having a bad day, but I'm really confused and kinda empty and hope someone can bring some advice to my situation.

After i broke up with him, he was devastated and he suggested we should remain friends because he needed me in his life because he’s was going through a lot. We talk pretty much everyday. Whenever i take too long to text him back, he just keeps sending me a bunch of memes to keep conservations going and he blows up my phone until I respond....
I have no feelings for him anymore but its obvious that he still has feelings for me. 

I live in an apartment at my college town about 3 hours away from his hometown. He comes to my college town for game days/events. He texted me and asked if he could stay with me in a couple of weekends. And I said “no” and he asked me why, and i said i have 3 other roommates and 5 people in one tiny apartment is a crowd and actually an annoying burden. He said “i don’t feel like getting a hotel”. Even though he has many friends in this town that he can stay with... 

I don’t want to spend my weekend with my ex. I just wish he would stop coming to my college town. Whenever he’s here he just always asks me to see him. He never use to go to my college town that much until I transferred to that college. Im also casually dating other men so i don’t need my ex snooping around my new apartment. 

TLDR; Clingy ex bf thinks he needs me and he is always relying on me, how can i get him to stop asking me to hang out with him and stop him from thinking he’s welcomed in my apartment? He really still cares about me deeply and he never really takes no for an answer.... he thinks of us as best friends so he has it stuck in his head that i should be there for him....i just want an easy escape from this guy but communicating with him never really works.

394,"This is a long post so please try to bare with me, and please don’t see this as a sob story it’s really not, I assure you. 

Ever since I was a kid, or as early as I can remember anyway, I’ve been doing voices. I’d spend hours making up random characters with all sorts of accents, showing off to my friends at school, then as I got older, I often used bedtime stories while babysitting my nieces to practice.
I’d also enjoy learning to replicate some of my favourite characters  with the dream of voicing characters in movies some day. I’m not a terrible singer either apparently so that would help I guess?

However as it tends to do, life happened and that dream took a back seat to paying my way, so I followed in my grandfathers footsteps, by joining the Army. I served close to 5 years which included a tour of Iraq, but I singed off due to an injury I got in peace time that effectively ended my career, and still effects me daily. 

That was 11 years ago, and I’m 33 now, 34 in October, but civvi street is still an alien place to me, and I’ve struggled to adjust and to hold down any long term steady employment ever since. 
This is due to many factors I won’t bore you with here, but I will say, living in Tyne and Wear certainly doesn’t help. 

Anyway to try and cut this story a bit shorter and get to my point. I find myself without employment again, I’m about to be married and I’ve not long since moved into a slightly bigger flat, so you can imagine I now have some debts to pay, and it’s becoming harder and harder to find work around here with the old qualifications I got in the Army not being particularly relevant anymore.
And I can’t afford to go to college or university and keep a roof over my head, without a job. 

I want to be able to utilise the one thing I’m genuinely good at, and I say that without an ounce of arrogance. Putting voices to characters and bringing those characters to life to make people laugh or cry or both, has always made me happy, and they say if you find a job that makes you happy, you never work a day in your life. 

The problem is I haven’t the slightest idea of where to start in terms of where to go for auditions, or to get representation or any of that sort of stuff. 
I imagine there are many more layers to the process I have no idea of too. 

I know it seems so silly to try and chase a dream at my age when I’ve got so many responsibilities, but I feel like I could have real potential to make a career of something I’m good at, but with absolutely no way to utilise it. 

Any advice on what I can do to at least try, would be extremely appreciated.

Every time we fell off I would promise myself that never again would I put myself in the same situation again and yet his suave talk and my weak barrier always welcomed him back in. He would let me leave when I was “done” wait  weeks or even months until the hurt was gone and then he’d come back when my guard was starting to pick up, squeeze his way back in, and a few weeks later he’d be gone. This latest time I let him back in for the millionth time and he made me upset bc he got himself into a situation that he shouldn’t have been in and then got mad at me for being upset?

396,"I (26, male) just talked to my best friend (26, female) and she never wants to talk to me again. 

For the purposes of the story, we will call her Jane.

I met Jane almost exactly a year ago and, man, was it a weird beginning to a friendship. We were so hyper-competitive that we were constantly taunting and testing each other. It was fun, but jeebus, it was also so infuriating sometimes. Still though, (amazingly) we slowly became friends. We began to eat lunch and dinner together, go to parks, and Skype when we had the ability. 

The more we spent time around each other the more we began to admire until, one night, we became intimate. We had already spent quite a bit of time together, but once we became romantic, we started to spend every moment together for a solid month. An important note, however, is that we did not become boyfriend and girlfriend. 

You see there are two very important details about Jane for this story:
1. She is a single mother
2. She has been abused in a multitude of ways from nearly all her previous boyfriends.

So despite our fantastic chemistry, she was worried that we were going too quickly (which is fair) and wanted to step back into friends. I was hurt by it, but I understood her reasoning and having a child makes all of that much more complicated so I agreed. Of course, none of that really changed us being flirty with each other, nor did it really change the fact that we spent almost every waking free hour together.

Fast forward two months later (last week) and she confesses to me that she is interested in starting a relationship again. Her initial fears having been blown out of the water by how consistent I remained with her even after she turned down the possibility the first time (which legitimately made her afraid I was going to ghost her). 

By this point, however, I was mixed on the idea of getting in a relationship. Not because I did not like her, but because being in a relationship was a large commitment for her. She had made it clear that if we got in a relationship with eachother then it should be because it would (almost certainly) lead to marriage. To me, it felt like if I got in a relationship with her then it was almost the same as already being married. It felt like such a large commitment and something I wasn't sure if I was ready for. Honestly, I probably just hyped it up in my head a lot, but I'm not sure.

Now we get to the problem. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, kept that to myself, and began to lead her on. Small things like tempting her with a kiss and teasing her about if she wanted to be together or not (she was being coy about it, it was cute). I know I screwed up on this. I should have been straight forward with my feelings and that what I did was selfish. At the time I thought that I just needed a little bit of time to really think of what was best, of if it was fair to get with her when I had these doubts, but I didn't restrain my advances along with those questions.

That is not the only problem however. When we first became intimate we started talking about what we like (as everyone does). The emphasis here was on communication, explaining all of our kinks and limits to each other regardless of how they may sound. The problem is that I did not tell her all of my kinks. To put it simply, I am very rough and *very* dominant in bed, almost to an insatiable and twisted degree. I don't know why I have those kinks, but I do, and I have been ashamed of them ever since I was a teenager. I told her quite a bit about those kinks, but kept back some of the darker ones. To be perfectly honest, it was because I was scared. Scared that she would look at me like I was evil and that it would make her distance herself from me.

On Thursday, both of those problems came to a head at the same time. We got into a deep conversation where I told her that I was unsure of whether or not I was ready to get in a committed relationship and then, later, my kinks. 

As I mentioned before, she has a history of very bad relationships, and I think both of things happening at once terrified her. It all started to feel like she was being manipulated from the beginning, that I was trying to groom her into a tortured side sex toy. She began to panic. She immediately wondered why she had been so stupid as to trust me so much when I could not trust her back. She felt deeply deeply betrayed.

We did not talk again until this morning and she told me that she ""wishes me the best in life."" I was blown away, I knew I had screwed up, but I didn't think she would want to completely cut contact. I talked to her as calmly as I could (note: at no point did we start yelling at each other), I pleaded and begged with her, we both cried a lot but she was adamant. She couldn't go through all of what she had gone through again and she couldn't be with someone who couldn't be honest with her. Not long before she left, she asked me not to use her daughter against her which just shocked me, I had never, and would never consider having done that but she was at a point where she truly believes I possibly would.

I am writing all of this several hours later and I am just feeling so... scared and hollow. Even if it is only as friends, we are so good for each other in so many ways. We selflessly supported each other, communicated insanely well, and would laugh and enjoy each others company so much. All in a way that I have never experienced before with anyone else. I am so so so terrified right now of never being able to talk to her again but I do not know what to do. She is at a point right now where she doesn't believe a word that comes from me and thinks I meant only malicious things for her. If I try to talk to her then she may very well just completely change location, phone numbers, and everything else so that I will never be able to find her again. 

Please everyone. I need advice. ",19Aug2018,58
398,"So I just moved to the city a couple of weeks ago. Got a new job I'm starting soon and overall have had a pretty good time getting a apartment and walking around the city. Today I was in a walgreens just getting a few things and there was a homeless women in front of me, I could smell her from a isle away and we were both walking to check out. She was buying like three different kinds of liquor, not that that pertains to this story/question. She was in really bad condition, scratches all over her skin bleeding and I'm pretty sure she much of been on her period because her legs were just draining of blood. She was checking out at one counter and I'm checking out at another and she got checked out before me and as she was walking to the exit she just slide right across my body with her coat and stuff. In my mind I freaked a bit because her stuff was very gross. Once I got home I bagged my clothes I was wearing and took a shower with lots of soap. Now, I know you all think I'm just overreacting but you did not see this women, not trying to be mean to her but she could of had head or body lice or bed bugs all over her.

401,"Okay so I have been cheated on in the past and I know I have some trust issues so I always try to bend over backwards to give people the benefit of the doubt and if I’m being jealous I usually assume I’m just being crazy and dumb. But l just can’t shake the weird feelings I have about this. Please tell me if I’m being over dramatic.

My husband has a big heart, and has been saying since last Christmas that since he has no children yet, he’d love to buy gifts for a little girl he knows whose being raised by a single mom. My heart was so full of pride at the time, he’s such a good man. 

A few months later, I was looking at his Snapchat (with his permission, it’s a long story) and I see he had messaged a beautiful girl I’d never seen before “you have a nice smile 🤗”  in response to a selfie she’d posted. I admit I got more than a little jealous and started asking who she was. He told me that she was the single mom he’d wanted to buy gifts for. Now, about 6 months later, he asked me if I would mind if he asks her to get lunch with him this week. I said yes, but I wondered why. He said he wanted to get to know her before Christmas so it wouldn’t he awkward when he takes her and her daughter shopping. Obviously I feel he is trying to do a good thing, and I definitely don’t want to get in the way of him giving a little girl a good Christmas, but it just seems weird to me that he would feel the need to go this far. I asked if I was going to be included in the shopping trip (it is my money too after all), and it was clear he had not really expected me to go, although he said he didn’t mind. I asked in that case couldn’t I go to lunch with you two as well, and he got frustrated and told me that would be weird. He said it would make it look like he couldn’t go anywhere without his wife tagging along. I don’t see why it would be weird if we were both planning on gifting her daughter, and why WOULDN’T I want to be a part of that? What’s wrong with introducing us, I mean, wouldn’t most people expect a married man to bring his wife to meet his friends?

Anyway, I've been dating my bf since I was 16 and I'm 18 now. Before my 17th, he was kicked out by his mum in London and came to the south to live with me and my family. Aside from my family being dysfunctional and sometimes violent, we've been fine. 

Recently my brother (20) had a violent spell and nearly choked my cat to death and beat her badly so I was going to send an abuse report to the RSPCA where we got her (and her sister cat) but my boyfriend was extremely against it for some reason. Watching my brother nearly kill my cat was traumatising for me so I explained to my bf that I love them, and I didn't want them where they weren't safe and would rather them be rehomed somewhere where they'd be stress free. My bf was extremely against this and he ended up yelling at me and demanding I didn't send the report. This was three weeks ago.

Since then he's been mad at me for every little thing; misunderstanding me and bringing up things from the past. I'm a person who likes my space, and so is he so we spend a lot of time in separate rooms which has been fine until now. He complains  about it and shouts about how I won't get alone time when we live in our own place. He also hasn't been wanting to be intimate at all and gets almost disgusted when I hug him.  

I've also grown accustomed to this behaviour so I'm sort of desensitised. I used to cry and ask why he was mad, but now I  feel like 'oh he's at it again' and growing an attitude. I try and repress sarcastic comments but he loses his temper so damn fast now I'm getting tired of it.  He's currently bringing up really minor things such as that he hates the fact I'm bi and he told me 'if you're going to identify as bi still  after dating me then go fuck a girl, I don't care anymore' . 

I love and care for him so dearly and it kills me when he loses it. I feel like he doesn't love me anymore. A month ago I found him Google searching 'I'm in a long term relationship but I like another girl' but he claimed he was curious. I know he doesn't talk to any other girls and our friendship circle literally consists of two people (both males) so I have no idea what to do. 

Whenever I try and sit down to talk to him it ends up in him losing his temper and getting quite scary. What can I do or say to help us stay together and/or face our issues ?

I've only had one job (it was a pizza place waitress for reference), and it only lasted a couple of weeks. I ended up quitting without a two weeks notice for many various reasons, one being that I didn't feel respected as an employee.

407,"Alrighty guys.

So I currently share a house with my friend (21M) and his girlfriend (22F). I will call my friend Steve and his girlfriend Sally. 

Steve and sally have two dogs which are not trained at all. They have peed and popped up the living room numerous times before being trained, and I was the one who took the initiative to deep clean the carpet with the end of those incidents. The dogs have been house trained since.

After the continuous accidents, my roomates dog had chewed up a PS4 controller, and they replaced it (tried to go around it by only replacing the singular part that was chewed, however the whole control was damaged.) Since the incident my roomates asked us to pick up our important things so dogs don’t reach them. Sure, fair enough. However it is the common space and I shouldn’t need to be Constantly scared if I leave something out. However I do agree to do my best of taking my important things with me so dog doesn’t chew them. 

Newly so, a few weeks ago I accidentally left an expensive ($160) item where one of the dogs could somehow reach. Sally was letting the dog roam free, knowing that it chews things up, and the dog chewed up my headphones by digging into a secure spot they were in. Sally approaches me when I am off work, saying she will replace them. She admits she was not watching the dogs. 

Come yesterday, I ask sally when she will be able to replace my item, since she had made that promise. Well, she tells me that Steve and her have decided to pay half since it was my irresponsibility for leaving them out after their warning. Saying at some point, I need to take responsibility.

However I do not agree. I talk with Steve, my friend, and he says he’s made the call to only pay back  half of the item since their warnings justify their dogs behavior. I absolutely do not agree. I think they should replace my item (160$) and I would do the same. I picture dogs to be children, and they were not being watched. Furthermore, it’s the common room. I didn’t accidentally leave them in their room. Sally was not watching the dog, who knowingly is a chewer. I understand that I could of taken my headphones but I should not need to live in fear that if I do not put something away, it will be destroyed. 


Steve is justifying his stance by saying that I am responsible for my things being destroyed since he had warned me. Therefore he is only willing to pay half. This is majorly damaging my friendship with Steve in my mind. Before this I would of trusted him, but fear sally may be influencing his thought. Am I wrong? I need a more objective stance. Friends and family say that since they are their dogs, their destruction is their responsibility. When you have pets you pay a security deposit to withhold any damages they do. How is this any different, when they are damaging my property, my name is on the lease, etcetera? To me a dog should never chew anything and if it’s known should be watched at nearly all times.

I also will add Steve is a rational person and his response to this is unexpected to me. 



Thank you, all advice is appreciated 


TLDR
Roomates dog chewed an expensive item of mine and they are only going to pay half of the damages. Their justification is because since they warned me that their dog is a chewer, and they cannot afford to pay for broken items, I am half responsible. I do not agree because this happened in the common room, and also roomate was not watching the dog at the time. I am trying to understand their perspective but I do not feel half responsible for their dogs behavior.

408,"I was banned from /r/therapy for posting this there asking for free therapy on a sub devoted to it (which isn't making any sense to me), so that's why I'm reposting it here instead of there.  Proof I'm not just talking out of my rear end:  
[https://i.imgur.com/pS7H2kZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/pS7H2kZ.png)

The info is in the link but I'll copypaste it here as well.

Female massage therapist slapped my head to the point of unconsciousness yesterday, but I mostly feel better.

I went in for a thirty minute massage and asked her to start with my skull because it helps me relax very quickly. I don't know what the heck was going through her mind, but as soon as the massage starts (I'm on my back) she starts slapping my face and skull, that's all I remember aside from waking up to her shaking me and saying I fell asleep (which I assumed was correct at the time, why would I argue) and my massage is over. I didn't even remember walking into the place when I first woke up, I didn't recall the face/skull slapping until later either.

I didn't grow up in an abusive home. I had an uncle that would beat me when he babysat us, because he would go for my younger brother and then I would pick a fight with him to get him to take me on instead. Which of course is stupid since there's no way I would actually be able be defend my brother, it was just take the beating in his place.  It was especially stupid because you get older and everyone tries acting like all of your physical and social problems are your own, you get nothing for that kind of protection for others, just more abuse as an adult. Anyway. I didn't enjoy the beatings, they only happened a few times though because eventually I told my mom and we didn't get babysat by him anymore. So. This is what's weird. It's like I paid for a massage and randomly ended up getting my ass kicked instead, and I feel fantastic. Mostly like there was some kind of validation there, that somebody took my money and beat me up.

What's the therapy reasoning behind this? There has to be some kind of logic.

Adding to what was submitted (what I was planning to do when I went back and saw I had been banned), I realize part of it is probably endorphins releasing to protect me from whatever damage may have just been done.  But beyond that I am feeling some kind of emotional release for the reason mentioned, and considering I wasn't a fan of the beatings I got from my uncle when younger, it wasn't some ""returning home"" nostalgia sensation, so I'm wondering what the logic behind this is.",19Aug2018,1
409,"right now I’m at my dads house and I have terrible social anxiety. I hate talking to people unless they’re my family. And my dad has a girlfriend and her daughter living with us. I’ve known them for a few years but I barely see them, and it’s weird to see them and talk to them. It’s like a stranger is living in my house. I’m not used to that at all, my whole life I’ve been used to my dad living alone and me being comfortable in his living space. And I’m not going to make him or even say to him that I hate being here bc of them, bc idk how he would react. Sometimes I wonder if he puts them before me. But he’s always told me even b4 the house that no one would get between us. Well that happened and idk what to do. Rn it’s 6:17pm, I got up at 7 am bc I heard what sounded like footsteps upstairs from my dad (my room is in the basement) and when I walked up it was my step mom.. big disappointment. Even though it seems like a minor thing, to me I was really disappointed, I was thinking I’d finally get some alone time with my dad only to see her sitting there.

410,"Hi! so I’m kind of upset, I am living in a university apartment this semester. I just looked at the floor plan and i have the smallest room with 1 window, but we all pay the same. I was thinking of texting one of my roommates asking if she wanted to switch to see if i could have one of the bedrooms with 2 windows. I know it’s not a huge deal but for me, it is. I have all early classes this semester and I think having more natural light will help with my internal clock. Is it rude for me to ask my roommate who i haven’t met yet to switch with me?

413,"Sorry for the long explaination, needed to get all the info across. If you do end up reading through, thank you for lending your time to help!


I work at a small airport as a lineman. I try my best at the job being respectful and kind to everyone. I bust my ass without complaining and do the jobs other people really don't want to.

For example one of my coworkers wasn't feeling well, I fueled all day for them while they sat and got paid. I never complained about it and always asked if they needed anything trying to be the most kind person I can be. 

But the other day I was tired from the night before (because I'm an idiot) and we had a competition going on which means more than 3 times the fuelings we would get on a busy day. We had 3 linemen working that day and the competition ends at 7 an hour before we leave. Around mid-day I asked if I could leave an hour early (7pm) and they said ""yes it wouldn't be an issue"". So because they said yes I decided take all the fuelings for them so they could relax and do other linemen duties while I do the awful work.

When I was about to clock out the one of the ""supervisors"" told me to not go because I leave to early all the time. One of the linemen who said I could leave early said ""why are you trying to fucking leave early, we leave at 8"". I've worked here for 6 months and left early 3 times. The supervisor that told me to stay has left early at least 10 times the last 6 months.  She has less duties and get paid a lot more than me and normally when I'm doing work she is sitting watching Netflix. I tried to fight it for a bit without raising my voice or being rude and it ended up with me sitting quietly until 8 (normal clock out time). When I left I didn't say goodbye or anything because i felt betrayed. 

The next day I wasn't working but one of my best friends (who is also employed here) was. The supervisor and other linemen who were working with me the day before were on for that day as well. And throughout the entire day they were talking about how I was lazy doing nothing while the others were busting their balls working their asses off. Every time I went to find those two they would be sitting with their feet up while I was stationed in the non-air conditioned fuel truck waiting for planes to come in. I never complained about it because they were letting me leave an hour early. They continued to talk smack about me behind my back about my work ethic and how my life is outside of this job.

I really want to quit as i keep getting more duties at this job without a pay raise or benefits while being disrespected and underappreciated. I want a job where if I work hard they notice. Even if I don't get a pay raise for months or years as long as they say good job once in a while I'm down.



But what do you think? This is my first time in this sub so sorry for the long explaination but I'm at a crossroads and don't no where to go next. Please let me know what you think! I'd really like to hear the advice reddit has for me! ",19Aug2018,5
414,"(Apologies for formatting, on mobile)

So to contextualise:
I’m at a period of high stress in my life right now...
I’m finishing a masters degree, looking for work, getting job rejection after rejection, running out of money and have a bunch of family issues to contend with.

I feel like because of this stress, my emotions go somewhat awol, and the only way I can describe it is that they are incredibly intense OR just nothing at all.
During periods of the latter type I don’t realise this is happening, but feel that I am acting in ways that are self sabotaging my own happiness (ending my relationship, ignoring workload etc) so therefore adding to my stress and increasing the emotional imbalance.

Because I’m not aware of it at the time, I make decisions which have lasting consequences without feeling a great deal about them, and only see the damage and realise the emotional state I was in when it’s too late. 
It’s now getting to the point that I can’t really tell what my own wants/needs etc are, and what are just my irrational emotional thoughts...

I’m writing here to ask for advice, just to see if anyone else feels or has felt similar to this? Do you have any useful coping mechanisms? 

Thanks a bunch x

416,"I'm a technician at a private practice; there are less than 10 women who work with me on a daily basis; not including two doctors (one who is the owner.) I have been with the practice for about 4months. In the beginning I manager was sweet, concerned about how I was doing with the information I've been taught since I was new to the field at first. At around the 3rd month I noticed two people (manager and another co-worker) who has been there for about 5+years whisper  frequently. At first I assumed maybe it was about non-compliant patients, but over time I kept hearing them gossip about other co-workers and sometimes comments about myself. Even the owner will lecture me at times and then go to the other doctor to talk about how I did this wrong and that wrong and how she needed to correct me. 

On another occasion I ask about an order for a patient who wanted to get a shipment sent to her ASAP but we only had half of it at the time. I asked the manager if we were planning on shipping the received product since it was a rush. Her response, ""What would be the point of that if we don't have the complete order?"" Mind you I had gotten chewed out for not bringing up a rush order a few weeks before and was trying to cover my butt this time. 

I feel like there are instances where the senior staff members treat us like we are incapable. They make remarks that make me feel uncomfortable or say things I would expect a family member or my mother to say to me; someone I've known for YEARS. I have been threatened to be fired; I have been told by upper management that I ""think I know everything and it needs to stop."" 

I don't expect to be coddled or spoken to calmly or to even have fair rules in the medical field. But I feel like there is so much gossiping and talking about other people/ inappropriate ways to handle situations in this office. I since then have been keeping to myself and only focusing on my patients.

What can I do to keep moving forward in this environment? I need the PCE for PA school and the experience but also I care deeply about my mental health.

TIA!

418,"24/M For about 6 years, everyday I worked towards getting my dream job. Having this goal kept me very focused. About a year ago I achieved my goal and got my dream job. It was a surreal feeling - 6 years in the making. I moved over 1800 miles to a new city and left everything behind to take my dream job. After about 8 months I had to quit my dream job due to several different reasons and move back home with my family. I came back home four months ago to a decent job, and although I am happy to be with my family and friends again, I feel so lost not having a goal to work towards. I feel like I’m just existing. I feel like I want to help people or be a part of something but I don’t know what. I am not religious at all so I want nothing to do with church but I honestly don’t know what to do with myself in my free time. Before I was always working towards my goal, doing whatever I could to improve my chances of getting my dream job. I no longer have that and I just feel lost.

420,"She was my best friend since we were kids, we were desk mates in elementary and highschool, we would talk every day go out all the time etc. But time went by and we grew apart. 

She started doing drugs and hanging out with shady people and I didn't wanna be around for that. I tried getting her to quit, I even introduced her to my group of friends but she ended up falling in love with a guy I had a thing with and that wouldn't be a problem itself, except she was trying to make him hate me so he can be with her instead. She was constantly high on god knows what, I couldn't even have a normal conversation with her, mind you I was a dumb teenager too, always drinking and stuff, but she was genuinely lost. She'd smoke some shit (not weed) and then stare at the ceiling for hours, not being able to form a sentence. She'd fall asleep while smoking then wake up and light that shit again. It felt like my friend was turning into a vegetable. 

Well, I cut contact with her after she tried to make the guy I was hooking up with hate me and after several months, we talked again. She was better, she had quit drugs, went back to Uni and actually graduated. I took her out with me and my friends and that's how she ended up meeting her future boyfriend, he was genuinely a good guy and she fell for him instantly. They were so in love with each other that they were planning their future together, and he was really good for her. Well at that time I was going through some shit myself so I cut contact with everyone, including her. She tried reaching out to me for two years but I would never reply. I even deleted my Facebook account because she kept spamming me there.

A few days ago I was feeling nostalgic and I went on Facebook, and would you look at that she had just messaged me the day before. I felt bad, I genuinely felt bad for ghosting her and it felt weird not talking anymore after being friends for 15 years. So I reached out to her and she was excited to catch up. Well turns out she broke up with ""the good guy"", cheated on him with some fuckboy who had a girlfriend of his own, then he ended up beating the fuck out of my friend, which she seemed to be okay with. She is also back to doing drugs, except now it's weed and pills. She is proud of it, thinks it's way better than the shit she used to smoke.  I honestly don't know, but the kicker is she lives alone now, moved out of her parents' apartment and even has a job. That's fine and all, except all the weed/cigarettes/pills are expensive so she owes money to a lot of people and she can't even pay her bills. She knows I saved up some money since I quit smoking and she's been hinting at how broke she is, also keeps asking me if I know any easy ways to get money. 

I don't want to lend her money and I'm pretty disappointed she went back to her old ways, she's pretty much always had abusive boyfriends (except the ex she cheated on who was treating her really well) but I always thought she's gonna grow up and stop taking shit from people. I don't know whether to admit contacting her was a mistake and move on or try to help her somehow. I don't know how to help her, I've tried in the past but nothing worked. She'd promise she was gonna quit and then call me few hours later, barely able to talk. Basically I've been through this shit before and I dont really want to get involved. She's always been extremely clingy and she's spamming as I'm writing this, complaining about being broke.

Now those bands are broken up, I lost that job and I don't know how to move forward. I am financially and somewhat emotionally dependent on my parents at the moment. My room mates both work at an independent movie theater that is IMO  the best part time job to have in Nashville for a musician trying to get somewhere with their art. It pays decently, it is very easy and flexible, it has a diverse and cool team of employees and the films they show are usually great. 

However, when I've tried to get a job there, I haven't been contacted back and when I ask my room mate for help he doesn't seem to want me to work there. The two times i've asked him to help me get a job there, he's blown it off or said that they aren't hiring. I think it's because he doesn't want me to work there. But I understand that he doesn't want to be around me all the time. And i'm not sure I want to be around him. I just know that it's a great job and it really frustrates me that he seems to have control on whether I get to work there or not. 

Am I being obsessive about this job or am I just too afraid to go around my room mate and get a job there?

I've decided I want to ask her for a second chance so I can make thing right.

At the start our relationship was great and we really loved each other, but in the last month I went on a trip for 2 weeks and when I came back I got occupied between my exams and the final project fo my PHP course, and because of this I didn't give her the attention I should've. 

I've also realized there's a bigger problem inside me and it's that I fear doing something wrong, and many times I've ended up doing nothing when I wanted to do things, just because I was afraid that it'd hurt our relationship. 

I really want a second chance but don't know if I should ask her now or wait some more time, I know that just a few days ago another guy asked her out and she rejected him. 
We still maintain a good friendship (because our groups of friends collide) so I'm afraid that if I wait longer she'll only see me as a friend.

426,"On July 4th I was at my friends Jane’s house. My friend kept having attitude for some reason. At one point her grandmother mentioned wanting to go to a nursing home simply because she’s old. I work in one and see certain things so I’m like no you’re so wise and functional something can work but not a nursing home. Then my friend snapped and said well she wouldn’t be in a nursing home in your city. I just ignored her. 

Then she got annoyed when there was miscommunication about a day trip we were supposed to take because in that pay period i was talking taking off for two other trips one with her and one with someone else i couldn’t take anymore days. So she got mad.

 Then after dinner us plus her family were talking about a situation between her sister Zoe and her roommate. My friend got heated and yelled that no one ever listens to me. Just like Kay(me) during her bad relationship that lasted two years. (It was a toxic relationship that lasted almost a year. And ended with bad heartbreak.).  I was so confused because I had nothing to do with the conversation so I turned around and said like the only difference between us is I made the same mistake with one guy and you keep making the same mistake with different guys. She huffed and went upstairs. Then came back down later like nothing had happened. So I just shrugged it off.  

The next day she asked if I was mad at her I told her no. But I was a bit upset because she knows I’m still healing over that time. She apologized then demanded I apologize in return. She’s always snapping at people out of nowhere and I was tired of it so I said no and if she’ll throw my mistakes in my face I’ll snap back. Then she tried bringing up old drama from 2 which’s ago which was small but I apologized back then when she told me it upset her. I told her I’m not going to go tit for tat with her and bringing up old drama will solve nothing. I was heading to bed so i told her to have a good night. Then she got even more mad. 

And another friend told me to just apologize because she was really hurt by my comment. Then then I realized it wasn’t worth losing a 10 year friendship over stuff so petty. So I apologized for hurting her feelings. And I haven’t really heard from her since.

Cliffs; had a petty argument. I refused to apologize. Realized I was wrong and apologized. Still haven’t spoken in almost two months.

428,"A little over a year ago I got a tattoo of Princess Leia at a local tattoo shop that was highly recommended to me. A small (very small) portion of the tattoo was a cover up. 
When the tattoo was finished I noticed areas that, for my taste, I felt needed more detail. I wanted the tattoo to be in the likeness of Princess Leia, not to look EXACTLY like Carrie Fisher. Most of the tattoo is great but I feel like the face on Leia is lacking detail. The dress is also lacking proper shaping that I feel could be easily fixed. Since getting this tattoo, it seems to me like the artist isn't proud of the work he did on me either. He posts throwbacks of his work on Facebook and Instagram CONSTANTLY to attract new customers, but not once has he ever posted a picture of my tattoo. Not once. I would out right post about this on Facebook, and ask for advice from friends as well, but a lot of people know and like this person. He's friends with a lot of people I'm friends with so I'm scared to say I'm dissatisfied and feel that some touch ups should be done, and I personally feel they should be free, these are things that weren't my fault and that I've noticed over time.

436,"Some background: I met this girl about four years ago via my boyfriend. She, her boyfriend and my boyfriend have all been friends for about eight years. The dynamic our group has is my boyfriend is primarily friends with her boyfriend and I'm primarily friends with her. In the past six months, she and her boyfriend have behaved in ways that have led us to decide we don't want to keep being friends. 

Our relationship changed drastically after we all went on a vacation together this past May. She and her boyfriend failed to prepare financially for our vacation to the point where it was almost insulting that they accepted to come on the trip in the first place (literally didn't save any money for the trip, despite having known about it for a year and a half). This might sound a little cold, but I knew their financial situation- they had been spending money on concert tickets, Disney tickets, etc. in the preceding months but only had $180 to their name when the trip came. They also turned down almost every invitation we offered to hang out during this vacation, despite the fact that the purpose of our trip was to celebrate my boyfriends' birthday. That includes times where the activity didn't involve spending money, so it's not like that was why. We all stopped talking for the most part after the trip- I think they could tell that my boyfriend and I were really bothered by their behavior. However, about two months after, she asked me to foster her kittens for a short while due to her living situation (don't worry, nothing terrible). Anyways, while fostering these kittens, I realized they'd given me and my cat fleas! When I told my ""friend"" this, she did not apologize or anything...just responded with ""okay.""

During this whole period, I have not told my friend at allllll about the feelings of pain I have. I know I probably should have reached out to her after our trip, but I did not want to make things awkward because we actually still had a concert set to spend with her in early August- all of our tickets were together, so it was unavoidable. So I tried to keep things distant, but kosher. I had already made up my mind that I did not want to be her friend, though. 

As far as where things stand now, I have no idea what the mature thing to do here is.  My boyfriend is feeling similarly about her and her boyfriend, so we are both prepared to make a clean break. However, this is my first time dealing with this situation, where I am essentially wanting to ""break up"" with a longtime friend.. I think she still wants to be friends with me, or at the least she is clearly upset that I have been somewhat cold to her, but she has not reached out to me in such a way that would allow me to naturally segue into telling her that I'm done talking to her. Do I just let the friendship die without saying anything? Since we had been really good friends before all of this, is it worth reaching out to her? I am honestly really hurt that they treated us the way they did, so I am admittedly feeling kind of a lack of closure, but I wanna do the ""right thing"" here, even if that means just letting things go.

442,"My friend is involved in a friends with benefits arrangement. She asked me if she was unsure she was being too emotional or seeing at the situation objectively. I understand a friends with benefits as something you agree to that has no emotions. She trapped between seeing things from an objective perspective and a human one. She repeated she was only human.  She was upset her bed buddy who is also her coworker asked out a client during her shift. That was her fault for settling. I explained to her he was exploring his options. He can ask out whomever, wherever and whenever if they agreed to not be exclusive. She was also mad that he asked her if she was seeing someone else and she told him the truth that she still was talking to her ex and had feelings for him but became upset he kept it a secret that he liked someone. What he does during his spare time is none of her business. She should not be mad he kept that from her. Just because she was honest, does not mean he has to be honest. He does not owe her anything. I thought she should not have expectations. She also was mad he mentioned his ex girlfriend while she lied naked beside him after sex. I told her maybe he was thinking of something else or whatever their doing reminded him of something. If she removed all emotion from it, she would see the situation clearly. She was also angry he mentioned preferring larger breasts to her. She said she doesn't feel good enough. I asked her if he ever told her she was not good enough and that is her insecurities speaking. If he's with her, he's pleased with her body and he saying that probably to set boundaries. I thought maybe she was being sensitive about his jokes on flat-chested women. She should have told him she did not like them. I think she should talk to him before cutting him off.  I do not necessarily see him as a jerk. ",19Aug2018,1

445,"So I wanted to spend my Sunday alone and just relax on my own. I even cancelled plans from a friend that day because I was generally just not feeling it. That day, my father was going to have some of his friends over for lunch and to talk. Well okay, that's fine, I'll just stay in my room, right. 

About half an hour later, I get a text from my father telling me that he wants me to come down to talk to a kid that one of his friends brought over. Of course, I am upset by this, as my planned day was ruined by his failure to accommodate guests that *he* invited. 

Anyways, I've had to spend time with this kid before, so I already knew that him and I weren't really for each other. We just weren't the kind of people you'd see hanging out. That and the four year age difference (him being younger) made it so that I didn't really want to have to spend my Sunday with him. We don't have much in common, and as he's four years younger, we don't really have the same sense of humor or anything. 

We also do not really have many video games or any entertainment for multiple people in general, so finding something to do with him is difficult. We ended up playing on the xbox 360 for a painstaking two hours, not saying much, until we both came to the consensus that we were bored and didn't really want to be there. I gave him access to the wifi, and told him that he can do whatever, and if he needs anything, just knock on my door. I then left to my room.

What would you have done in this situation? Was what I did wrong? What's some good advice I should maybe keep in mind the next time this may happen?",19Aug2018,10
446,"Hello and thanks for reading. I’ll try to keep it short. 

My lease ends at the end of September. I’m not renewing because it’s already at the top of my budget and they’re raising the rent significantly. I have one of three options: 

1.) Move in with my mother. In doing this, I can save nearly 100% of my paychecks (with the exception of little bills like gas/phone). But, I’d be a 45 minute drive to/from work and I’d have to get rid of my two cats due to my mother’s allergies. I’m devastated at the thought of giving away my cats because I’ve had them since they were babies - it’s been years. I’ve tried to find a friend/relative to take them, even coworkers; no one can take them in, either one. My only thought would be having to take them to a shelter or finding a stranger online. Admittedly, this is what has been the hardest for me so far. I just can’t bare it. 

2.) Move in with my best friend and her wife. If I did, I could save a few hundred bucks a month and get to keep my cats. However, they also have two cats. I have two boys, they have two girls. I have no idea how they could react to one another. In conjunction to this, my besties aren’t financially stable. They often go on leaves at work and go unpaid for weeks at a time. They’re always struggling and I’m afraid to put my money/credit on the line and potentially ruin a good friendship. Their apartment is also quite small. We’d all be very close all the time. 

3.) I could find a new apartment that’s more affordable. This is the most ideal option, but I just don’t have the money for it. I don’t have anything in savings because I moved into this apartment (I originally expected my boyfriend to move in with me. Learn from my mistakes, kids.). I don’t have anything saved for a deposit, first/last, fees, etc. My credit card is currently maxed, and so is my loan/credit. 

What’re your thoughts? Any insight/advice would be appreciated. ",19Aug2018,1
447,"This is a follow up to a post I made here but deleted out of fear someone would see and put the pieces together. I dont intend on doing that again.      
But the short of it is, I took the risk, and went across the country to meet a friend I met in a roleplay group. And I fell in love (with the city).            
I come from an economically depressed small town in the Midwest where theres nothing to do but watch paint dry, and few opportunities to advance my career at all, let alone in the field I choose.  I have a mound of student loans Im paying on and no car.      
In comparison the area I visited was paradise. There was something to do every day to the point we missed out on doing a lot. I ended up checking job opportunities after I got home and there's tons of work - even if not in my field now I could save. It was also strikingly beautiful  - the air was cleaner (less humid and no fracking dust) and there was just all this color.       
The person I stayed with said they'd help me out if I moved. Would get me a job, help me get my license, would introduce me to friends and help me make connections. I even noticed a change in myself while I was there. That I wasn't depressed or anxious anymore, that I spoke up more and smiled more and was more social than I had ever been.      
And the second I got home, it all piled back up on me like a ton of weights.       
None of my family wanted me to go. My parents have retail jobs in their 50s, and the rest of my family picked similar paths. No one except a cousin in the navy has gone farther than DC and I live in Ohio. I myself have a minimum wage job. Their logic was that I had loans so I shouldn't be spending any money on anything until I had them gone. But at this rate itll be 8 years minimum until they're gone, and I'd saved money for a previous trip that fell through by saving all my quarters.       
They screamed at me before, during, and after this trip. That I was being selfish and stupid and childish. That I have no idea how the world works. And maybe I don't.  But doesn't that mean i should see the world to find out? Because by that logic I should stay in this bubble all my life.      
Getting another job here isn't an option. There's simply no work, much less in my field. My family whom I live with is so angry with me that I'd even consider this trip, much less going on it, that I know that if I left for good they would never speak to me again. And already I feel the animosity. I can understand some of where that comes from , the being scared for me especially. But I handled myself well, and i came back. I've been trying to repair things slowly, and I know itll take time. But even so....          
My family ignores how miserable I am here and calls looking out for my future selfish.       
My friends all see how miserable I am here and how i have been since I got back. They want me to go.       
I'd appreciate any thoughts anyone might have, whether it be on what to do, how to handle leaving, or questions to answer. I'm just so conflicted right now that it hurts and it's affecting my ability to think and eat. I dont want to hurt my parents, but I dont want this life. ",19Aug2018,4
448,"Its really frustrating because I have been looking forward to college for so long. All I want to do is go back to my old life in highschool, which doesn't make sense because I hated highschool. I don't even know why I'm not happy here. I've been to parties and met a lot of new people, so it seems like I should be having fun, but I'm not for some reason. I want to call my parents and talk to them but I can't, because every time I try, I just start crying. ",19Aug2018,2
450,"I met them two days ago at some party and we kind of became friends. I hung out with one of them yesterday and we had a really nice time and talked about so many things. Also, we texted a lot since the party but I haven't even texted the other one yet. I got really close with the first one and we kind of already bonded, while I haven't really talked to the other one since the party yet. I went out with both of them to the mall today and I felt like such a third wheel. I barely even talked to them because they were kinda busy joking around with each other. I'm not mad and I understand them because they've known each other since they were little kids, they are neighbors and they are like a brother and sister. They also insult and tease each other (in a playful and friendly way, they don't actually mean that) and look like actual siblings. They are so nice towards me but  I feel like that means that they don't trust me enough yet, as in they don't wanna joke around with me because they're afraid they'll hurt my feelings or weird me out. I feel like I'll never get that close with them to the point where all three of us can joke around freely and be comfortable with each other. Am I just overreacting? And are they acting that way simply because we don't know each other that well yet? Please give me an advice, I really don't know what to do.",19Aug2018,1
451,"Im currently working a job doing concrete restoration. Im 18 and I've been at the job for 2 months. I only recently graduated and am taking this year off to work however i hate my job. It requires me to live 3 hours from home in a motel room. The job and work itself isnt bad but im isolated from everyone i know, and the town i work in is a very small fishing town with nobody and nothing to do. The money is better than any minimum wage job i could work at home but its taking a toll on me mentally. I come home every weekend (friday one week, saturday the next) but every sunday night is absolutely dreadful thinking about going back the next day. I have about 3k in the bank and it is very very early on in the year, but i won't be home permanently until the end of November. Its lonely and dreadful and i feel like im missing out on everything going on with my close friends and family. My question is, should i quit even though i have no other job lined up? Or should i tough it out?",19Aug2018,2
452,"2 women on tinder yesterday after 5 messages got their snap and gave some small talk on Snapchat and then asked them out. They said “okay” when I took initiative to ask both girls if they are free on these days with a time. I just let it go and if they are interested can message me on snap to go out. Third girl today. Got the snap and asked her out for drinks or dinner and drinks. Same approach and she just blew it off and ignored it by asking how tall I am since I’m 6’4”. Do I just do the same and just stop messaging her on Snapchat with small talk and if she’s interested can ask me out or at least put some effort? I know tinder you gotta follow rules 1 and 2 by being attractive and it’s a competition or majority of women just want attention. I’m not good at escalating through text and trying to flirt or be sexual. I’m better at feeling women out in person. Rather not get blocked. I wanna know if there’s a better approach? After you get Snapchat or number. Do you just be sexual or try to flirt and don’t care about getting blocked. Or try to ask them out for drinks or whatever and if they blow it off. You just keep them added or keep their number and if they get back to you some other time, awesome, if not move on?",19Aug2018,1
