3,"I am not much of a social butterfly, so I do not have strong group of friends. i have made one best friend (F) and we have had a good relationship for the last 5.5 years. 

Around last year, I met another dude through this best friend of mine, and we really bonded. After my female best friend this dude seemed good charcter and soon became my second best friend. 

I was there for him when he went through his break up, and when his grandparents and everyone else in his family was having a tough time. 

When I broke up, i sought him for similar kind of support but something was really off. 2 weeks into this January, I see him fool around with my ex-gf. we had been dating for nearly a year and this ex-gf had created a lot of emotional and mental problems for me. I relied on this bestfriend for solace,... and he does this to me.... 

I tell my female best friend from whom I know this kid. she agrees that this was low but is still in communication with this dude.. 

is this acceptable? should I break off with my female best friend too? How can she hang out with somone who has such a low character ? I want to bring this up to my female best frined, but I fear that I may loose this 5.5 years worht of relationship... what Shoudl I do?

4,"We've been texting for a few weeks and finally met yesterday. He was exactly how I imagined and we had an awesome time. My brother and his friend came with because it was a festival, *but they were not with us,* until he insisted we all eat dinner together because he felt bad that they didn't have enough money to eat. We also spent a little bit of time with his friends.

Anyway, I don't know if it was considered a date or not, but we were alone 80% of the time and it was awesome. Lots of laughing and talking. I like him and I want to see him again soon, but I'm totally unsure about how he feels about me because I'm bad with signals. So what should I do next? 

We only exchanged three texts since yesterday, one where I said we got home safely, him saying he was happy we could make it, and then me saying that we need to do something (alone) again soon, which I also told him last night and he said the same thing back. How soon until I ask to do something else? Also how can I tell if he's even into me as more than a friend? ",18Feb2018,2
5,"So I’m 15 and TWICE as I’ve been walking down my road the guy who lives opposite me has been driving and has stretched out his car to look at me and has looked me up and down all while he is checking me out and smirking to himself. The first time I was super scared and confused once I realised he lived so close to me. The second time he even parked to try and talk to me but I got scared again and turned around then kept walking in the opposite direction. But then after I got home and processed what happened I became so turned on and I loved it!!! 

Now I have always known he is a drug dealer and I think that’s part of the reason why I am so attracted to him, the danger that surrounds him draws me in. However... he is also married and has a  young child ( maybe more than one). I’m so confused why this married FATHER is checking me out.  Bare in mind he does not know that I am 15 OR that I live  so close to him. I know his schedule, when he wakes up..leaves the house...comes back home etc.  And I have tried to bump into him many times but it hasn’t worked .  If I really REALLY want to I can bump into him properly but I’m scared.

I love the danger and that a powerful rich cash man like him is looking at someone like me. I don’t know how far I would want to take it with him if we ever did properly bump into eachother , kissing sex etc 

Please keep in mind this guys is DANGEROUS. He told a man that lives near us that he hopes that he dies a slow and painful death....he said this to an OLD MAN.  Pretty crazy. I don’t know what to do , should I leave it or see where this adventure takes me??? PLEASE HELP AND DONT JUDGE.

9,"Hi all,

Throwaway account because I'm feeling extremely embarrassed about this whole situation.

I have been with my partner for 14 years now.  There is a significant age difference (26 years), which has never really bothered me because I have always liked older guys.  When we met he was in his 40s, but now 14 years later he has just turned 60.  I am 34.  His health issues are starting to get more serious, which is very hard for both of us, but of course much harder for him as he can no longer do the things he's always been able to do.  There is a lot physically wrong with him.

We are very comfortable together, we have a great routine, enjoy spending time together and laugh a lot.  We don't, however, have sex much, if ever.  We've had sex twice this year, but prior to that hadn't had sex in about three years.  It's intimate but doesn't really inspire me.  I was starting to think maybe I'm asexual.

... But then I developed a ""crush"" on a guy who works in the same building I do.  This has happened to me a couple of times over the years but usually after a little while it dies out.

This one isn't going away, no matter how much I try not to think about him.  On top of it all, I'm getting the strong impression that he really likes me back.  Like the grown-ass adults we both are, we've been avoiding each other and not making eye contact.  It's really silly.  I think people at my work are aware of and enjoying watching this high-school-level crush between us, which is also awkward.

Now, my partner always makes a lot of comments about how badly he feels for me being stuck with an “old man” and how I should go out and get banged or something.  I have always said no to this, as I never wanted to.  I can’t do anything hurtful to my partner, I love him and want to look after him and make sure he eats every day.

If only I could forget about this guy except he’s there every day being adorable and my brain just won’t stop thinking about him.  If I could just go and bang him and these feelings would go away, maybe I would?  I don’t know, I’ve never done that before ever.  But I feel like parts of my body want more from this guy than just sex… I’ve never felt this kind of passion or tummy-twisting interest in another human being before.

So Reddit, please help.  Am I a terrible human for thinking like this?  How do I stop thinking about this guy?  Should I even try?

TL;DR:  I have a huge crush on someone at work and don’t know how to a) stop it or b) somehow figure out a way for this not to kill my current 14 year “comfortable” relationship.",18Feb2018,4

11,"7 years ago, my biological father died, my mom met my stepdad online, and we moved to a different country so she could marry him (he has a daughter that he only gets to see on he weekend, and he wasn’t going to leave her here). I’ve never like my stepdad, and not just because he’s the reason I had to leave everything I’d ever known behind. He’s a drunk, and verbally abusive. He’s also just very creepy in general. However, my mother’s happiness with him could not go ignored, and so I decided to give him a chance. 

Flash forward a couple years, and they had a son. Now, about a year after this child was born, my stepdad was outside doing yard work or something and had left his phone inside. I had been wary about him because something about him was just off-putting, and I had to trust my gut. His phone password was just his birthday, so it was easy to get into. I went into his texts, and lo and behold, he had been talking to 3 other women besides my mother, saying very explicit things. As a very innocent 13 year old, I was disgusted and put his phone back immediately.

A year later, he had pissed me off quite a bit and I remembered the past incident. He left his phone to go run an errand, and I took advantage of the situation and took pictures of all the messages, including the girls’ numbers in the pictures. 

Now, in 2018, my half brother is about to turn 4, and the stepdad is still on his bullshit. He went grocery shopping tonight and I checked his phone. Surprise surprise, he was messaging even more girls. This time, they were even sending him nudes. I am so furious, and I took pictures of all the messages just in case he has the brains to delete them.

Reddit, I need help. I don’t know what to do. Do I tell my mom, and be the cause for a future divorce, letting my baby brother grow up without a proper dad? I know how horrible that is- mine died when I was only 10. Do I let it slide and hope my stepdad knocks it off? I’m afraid to tell my mother for a multitude of reasons. 1) we are only permanent residents in this country, not citizens. She works at a supermarket part-time, would we be sent back to our home country if they got divorced? 2) I do NOT want her to confront my stepfather. I seriously feel like if he was in any sort of bad mood, he would get violent. 3) I do not want my brother growing up without a dad, but I also don’t want him growing up with such a shitty father figure. 5) I’ve already been accepted to a university in this country, and I know this sounds selfish but I really need my stepdads money to be able to go. 4) probably the most worrisome; what if she still chooses to be with him? She’s chosen to stay by his side even though he’s an abusive drunk, will cheating be the thing that tips the scales or will she just not care?

I really don’t know what to do. I know my mom would get full custody of my brother; my stepdad lost custody of his daughter when him and his first wife divorced, and I have evidence of the infidelity, so I’m not worried about that. I’m worried of violence, of the possibility of him kidnapping my brother (I know that doesn’t happen often but I can’t help but consider it), and of being shipped back to a country I haven’t lived in in 7 years just because we aren’t citizens here. I’m sorry for rambling so much but, What do I do? 

tldr; I have evidence that my scummy stepdad is cheating on my mom- do I tell her, or do I let her find out on her own/ignore the situation?",18Feb2018,1

18,"I live with my boyfriend (Zach)  and our roommate (Brandon). They're both friends. Not like BEST friends, but they've known each other since high school. The house is technically his, but we help pay the mortgage and all the other bills. When I say we help pay all the other bills, I mean we pay for ALL the bills and all he has to worry about is his part of the mortgage. One of the bills I pay is the water. I have never paid more than $35 a month for water. When the bill started climbing and reaching upwards of $100 a month, I told him that something was wrong with the water (a leak in the pipe or something) and that I can't afford a $100 water bill, he did nothing. Even though it's his house he refused to look into it. After several conversations I was finally able to convince him to do something about it. But surprise, surprise!!! Nothing got fixed and water is a steady $70 a month. He always has lights on in the house for no reason at all. All he does is sit in his bedroom and play games all day everyday. He never leaves the room, so tell me why ya got the goddamn living room light on, the 2 lamps in the living room on, and the hallway light on when you haven't left your room in 10 hours? I'll turn them off and he'll turn all of them back on and just go back to his room. But god forbid I leave the room for 2 mins and leave the light on. Every time I have someone over, he fucking hovers. Like.. we'll all be sitting in the front room and he'll come out of his room and just stand there and watch everyone. If a friend were to say, ""wow, this is a nice house."" My natural response would be, ""oh thank you."" But noooooooooo as soon as a comment gets made about the house he has to say, "" this isn't their house. It's mine. They rent from me, so thank you for the compliment."" Like what the fuck. He's dead serious about it too. He doesn't just do it as a joke. Like he gets seriously offended by it lol. If I'm chilling just watching Netflix, he comes out of his room and will do the hovering thing. He'll just stand there in front of the TV. Won't sit, won't say anything. Just stands right in front of it. But recently the problem has been just him coming into my room whenever he feels like it. I understand it's ""his house"" but I'm not living at home with my parents anymore. I'm grown and I pay bills for my room and bathroom to be mine. I get really bad panic attacks finding out someone has been in my room without me knowing. I don't like it when people touch and go through my things. Plus it's not your shit so why fuck with it. My boyfriend told me that he had came in here to fix our toilet ( I didn't know it was broken but okay) and I told him, "" I don't want Brandon in there without me knowing."" His response back was that it is technically his house. I'm sorry, actually I'm not, but it's not okay to just go into people's bedrooms whenever you fucking feel like it. It's not your space, nothing in here is yours, you have no reason what so ever to be in here, so why are you in here. Zach doesn't understand where I'm coming from on this, but I feel like it's not okay for him to just be in here whenever. Recently, I've had belongings come up missing. So my first thoughts have been he's taking my shit ( can't prove it but that's just my theory).

19,"I’m no economist and I’m no financial guru.  But I know we have a REAL problem here in the U.S., well a few actually, and I think I have an idea to help.  Tell me how you think this would work out.  Maybe I’m crazy, but it sure sounds possible.

Steps 1 &amp; 2…Stop the “war on drugs” and decriminalize ALL drugs in the U.S.  ALL OF THEM!  If people want drugs they will get them.  They will also put themselves in questionable situations with questionable individuals to do so.  The war on drugs has been a HUGE failure anyway.  Stats don’t lie.  The U.S.  wastes a TON of money every year trying to stop drug use.  It’s a lost cause.  Make them all legal and regulate them.  Tax them.  Capitalism will make the price go below what dealers can afford to sell them for.  Those dealers will fade away as all their customers buy their stuff legally.  Stop treating offenses as a criminal act and start treating them as a mental health issue.  Think that’s crazy?  Look up what happened in Portugal in 2001 when they decriminalized all drugs.

Step 3…Stop building a fucking wall.  What a waste of money.  A HUGE waste of money and a dumb ass idea.  Just stop.  Ladders and shovels have existed for thousands of years.  That wall will be breached.

Step 4…Take ALL of that war on drugs money and ALL of that wall money and put it into helping people get to the root of their drug use problems.  Build clinics.  Hire councilors.  Give EVERYONE in the U.S. the option to see a therapist once a week FOR FREE.  EVERYONE!  Maybe REQUIRE it for children until they are 18.  I assure you, everyone can benefit from this.  We ALL have problems.  Sometimes talking about them helps us to overcome them.  Let people come and talk to professionals about what makes them want to do drugs.  We can also get an early warning for some of the more troubled people out there.  Maybe there will even be enough money between the wall savings, and the taxes made from the legal sale of drugs, to give all Americans free health insurance.  I don’t know…I’m no expert, but it sure seems possible.

Besides restrictions for buying a gun placed on those deemed “mentally ill”, more gun control or bans on assault rifles just isn’t the answer.   Remember when the U.S. tried to outlaw alcohol?  It would just end up the same.  If someone wants a gun, they can get one pretty easily.  It doesn’t have to be a legal purchase.  If we had more people being mentally evaluated we could spot some of these mentally ill people before they do something crazy. 

Is this idea flawed?  Is there a better way?

I feel.

 I'm not too close to my roommate, who I'll call Abby. We have our own separate rooms, but we share a bathroom down the hall. We don't talk much, but on the occasion we bump into eachother, she's always very sweet. 

Very early on, I noticed she doesn't contribute at ALL to the apartment. My other roommate and I are always having to clean the dishes she leaves in the sink, and take out the communual trash that is filled with (mostly her) garbage. It's frustrating and we've asked her to do her share of cleaning, but to no avail.

I've been the sole person supplying toilet paper for the bathroom for the past six months. I finally got fed up! This past week, when the last square of communal TP ran out, I said screw it, she's on her own until she buys some for herself. I'll just keep the toilet paper in my room. 

To be fair, I never gave her a warning - but considering she flies to NY every month, I figured she wasn't too strapped for cash that she couldn't fork out three dollars for some TP. 

It's been nearly a week since I've been keeping the toilet paper in my room, and she still hasn't caved and bought some for our bathroom. I figured maybe she has her own stash of TP in her room, no biggie, maybe she's wants to keep her own stash private, too.

I came home from work this morning and wanted to freshen up. I wash my face and reach for my hand towel that I keep on my (MY) shower rack. I'm halfway through drying my face before a rancid smell hits my nose and I immediately stop what I'm doing. It didn't take me long to find shit streaks on my washcloth.I can't describe how livid and violated I feel right now. 

I don't want to assume anything -  but perhaps this was her way of getting back at me for keeping the toilet paper in my room? Or maybe she doesn't have the human decency to know that wiping your ass with someone's personal towel is revolting?

I've been shaking and on the verge of tears. I don't know how long she's been wiping her ass on my towel.

Any suggestions? Obviously I'm keeping all of my towels and toiletries in my room from now on.

25,"TLDR: my band teacher thinks i'm good when i'm really not, moves me into the first seat, above my friend who is insanely good, practices multiple times everyday, and wants to pursue music in the future. should I make my teacher switch our seats?

I'm in high school, and I'm part of the school band. I've always played the first part, but sat in the second place in my section, and I'm totally fine with that (even though I'm pretty sure there are people in lower places who are so much better than me). The first player in my section is a good friend, Bob, who I believe is an amazing musician, deserves to be the first, and is in all ways better than me. 

However the music teachers always get it wrong. They completely underestimate Bob, and overestimate me. Since our teacher last year retired, he filled in the new music teacher with all the deets regarding me being GREAT at my instrument. So the teacher starts the year with the perception that I'm some sort of musical genius. Keep in mind that the only times the new teacher has heard me play so far was in band, as my school is divided in two semesters and I had music in the second semester. He hasn't really heard me play alone yet. 

One day the music teacher mentions us getting a new seating arrangement. Then one of my other friends (John)  in the section tells me that the teacher was going to keep Bob and John playing the first parts. At this point i'm like oh no, i'm being moved to the second part. 

So I go and tell Bob that oh no, i'm going to play the second part. He says don't worry, I still believe in you, you're still super good. And I'm upset, but I go on.

The next band rehersal was the first time we would all see the new seating arrangements. I walk in, expecting to be moved to the second part, however, once I get there, they all tell me i've been put in the first seat!!!?!?

I look over to bob, who says ""maybe the teacher changed his mind"" but I feel so bad for him. he practices so much more than I do, he wants to go into music post secondary, is INSANELY GOOD,  and I don't deserve to be first at all. 

I talked to the teacher about switching me and Bob's spots, but the teacher doesn't agree, goes on about how I play stronger and the kind of sound he wants for the band. He said if I really wanted to switch, then I could, but he says that's where I belong. 

I also have playing tests coming up, and I know I don't sound good at all. I don't want him to hear my playing and realize oh shit, she really is bad. Part of me wants to stay as first clarinet, and i don't want the teacher to think I don't respect him. 

Just to let you know, I""m not even being modest. I'm actually trash, and I have no clue what in the world the music teachers see in me. 

Should I go back to my teacher and tell him that I want to switch for sure, or just stay as first and possibly hurt my friend? ",18Feb2018,3

27,"Hey guys, I've never made a post like this before, but I'm kind of in a rough spot. I am currently a sophomore in high school and there is a girl in my German class that I really want to pursue. She is a senior and everyday I just can't wait to walk into the classroom and sit down next to her. We've been talking for a about a month and we've started hanging out outside of the classroom. 

To me, she is showing clear signs of interest and has really been glued to me recently. She told me something a few days ago that has been on my mind like a crushing rock. She graduates in about 4-5 months and she plans to move to San Diego, California to go to school. (we live in Indiana). She plans to go there with her sister.

When she told me this, it was like someone grabbed a sledgehammer and took a full side swing and struck me right in the chest. I don't know whether I should try and develop a relationship for the short time that we have, or I should just let this one go. I've suffered from depression in the past and have managed to battle and contain it until that day.

31,"I have a family member who, bless their heart, is so generous that they buy gifts for me unwarranted and unasked for. The caveat is their gifts are always of a random nature. Sometimes it's food they bought or cooked, and other times it's odd tchotchkes and decorations. There's a high chance it will be something you either don't want, don't need, or have nowhere to put. Other times it's clothing, like a very nice jacket they may have bought at the thrift store for approximately five cents (I only have a billion leather jackets now). This person insists they don't care what I do with the stuff they give me, they couldn't care less.

Recently this person gave to me a gigantic framed poster of James Dean. I don't mind James Dean, I've never watched the movies (shame on me I know) but I respect the man's popularity. I don't want this poster. It's big, it's heavy, and I'm not a James Dean fan, not truly. It's not even that exciting of a poster, it's literally just a photo of him standing there alone with his name on it.

I guess my question is, if I were to just have a random framed James Dean poster on my wall, would that be just way too weird? What kind of impression would that give, perhaps, a date that I invite over to my place on any given night? Or is James Dean cool enough to have a poster of without needing much context? 

I am running out of room in my attic. I'm really just looking for opinions on the necessity of a nicely framed photograph of James Dean and what kind of impression it gives, positive or negative. I already have plenty of photos and wall decorations, but I do have a spot for it.

33,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but I couldn't really think of a better subreddit for it, so I think I'll just go for it. I apologize in advance if it gets a bit too personal (I've had people tell me that I'm too open). 

Simply put, while I have definitive preferences as far as physical appearance, I don't think that I've ever looked at someone and thought that I wanted to copulate with them. I look at people I feel I should be attracted to in that manner (that is, someone that fulfills my idea of physical beauty while being intellectually and emotionally ideal as well) but it feels as though there's a kind of disconnect when I try to imagine that kind of physical intimacy. 

I know that I'm able to stimulate myself in private, and I admit that it feels very good, but it's always with a kind of ephemeral and nonsexual imagery (sorry, I'm having trouble wording this). I suppose that I have difficulty imaging myself actually engaging in that behavior, and whenever I try to envision it actually happening, I immediately lose any truly amorous feelings (in my head, I still maintain a feeling of great warmth for the person, but I really just drop any thoughts of anything related to conjugation). 

I feel strange and somewhat alienated when I watch or read about sexual behavior, but at the same time I have a kind of intellectual curiosity and do feel that if I had a girlfriend, I would want to be physically intimate with her, it's just that I think I would have trouble with the actualization of it. I'm not sure what all this qualifies me as, and it should be considered that I've never really been in this kind of situation to know for sure, but if anybody can provide the proper perspective, it would be much appreciated.",18Feb2018,2
36,"I have been sleeping with a close friend for a few months now. He has been so sweet and kind when we hang out (always at my place and always never telling our other friends we are together). It started off when we got very drunk and had sex after our other friends had left one night a couple months ago. We hang out once or twice a week and watch stupid tv/movies together and cuddle, and then inevitably we have sex together and he leaves. When I have brought up having a more serious relationship he says that he isn't ready to have a relationship (he blames it on an ex who broke his heart), but a couple days ago he told me that he is going on a date with someone this weekend. I think he is just trying to protect my feelings and that he just doesn't want to say that he doesn't want to go any further and that was his way of saying it. Am I being stupid in thinking that he may want more in the future or should I just end it before I get hurt? 

Further clarification- I told him that I have liked him for over a year, he says he also likes me. And he really isn't the fuck boy type.

37,"My family is a traditional, Indian family. My parents (arranged marriage) migrated in 1990. They work pretty small jobs and we live a decent life. I am the middle child, and have 2 brothers. 
I am now 23 years old.

My parents have always been very cowardly, and scared of ""what people will think/say"". They raised us very simply up until college. I commuted for college and had an okay college experience. 
I started drinking a little (very little), but I haven't had any boyfriends. I try very hard to please my parents and be the mature, classy girl they wanted me to be. 

Ever since I was young, my mother HARDLY ever tells me how pretty I am or how proud she is. That show of affection isn't a part of south asian culture. In fact, the minute I started forming a ""body"", around age 11, she'd tell me I was getting ""fat"". And in hindsight, I was stick-skinny. But I started believing I was fat and wasn't a pretty girl. I stopped wearing skirts or shorts, and didn't start again until age 18. It was damaging--I was shopping for Medium/Large sized clothes and I was only an X-Small or Size 2. 

I just never felt enough, because I believed every word that came out of her mouth. She was my role model, and she never taught me self-love. I never thought ""boys"" would like me, I couldn't every glare at myself in the mirror. My hair is 90% of the time in a ponytail and I hardly feel like ""trying"". 

I met a guy recently off a dating app and we got very close. He told me he has had 7 gfs in the last 6 yrs, and slept with them all. I broke down in tears hearing that, because I felt like I never had the opportunity to feel in love. It didn't work out (other reasons), but I felt broken because this was the only guy that I ever felt close/intimate with. 

Mom now feels I'm too simple/plain/traditional. I don't know what I'm supposed to be so she can finally feel like I'm enough. 

I want to help myself heal. I want to be confident enough to be in the dating scene and not feeling so broken if it doesn't work.  Mom loves me, she just can't show how much. She raised me how she felt society likes girls to be.

Yesterday she messaged me ""hey bitch"" and if I was coming to the club and I said no because I was at home. She said ""aw that sucks come out Monday"" and I sent a meme with the caption ""perhaps"". About 3am she messages me, ""you better come out"" followed by a picture of a topless guy and ""faggot, you're an alcoholic"" and ""send nudzzz"". She then apologised and I didn't message back. She then messaged me hours later in the day that it wasn't her but I said I wasn't offended and I actually laughed about it.

40,"I'm 21 years old and I've already had 6 different jobs, one of them was really good but I quit anyway because I have what I like to call work anxiety. Basically I hate working, and I thought at some point that I would get used to it or that I just needed a good job. However, after working at a great place that payed well for a year and a half, I still had trouble with working. The problem is not only how I feel while working, but also when I'm not working. I'll explain...

When I'm unemployed, I feel great. I feel like I have time to do anything, and nothing really feels like a chore. Cooking doesn't feel too time consuming, working out is not in the way, and having fun doesn't feel like sucking away a resource.

When I'm employed, I always feel like I need to unwind. Even if I get a day off, I have to use that time to unwind, and everything feels like a chore. Having fun feels just makes me think about how its going to end soon because I'll have to work the next day. If I'm not at work, I'm thinking about work. I can't seem to be happy at all while employed.

What should I do? I was thinking becoming self reliant.. like growing my own food. Try to survive without holding a job so I don't feel anxious all the time about it.

45,"To start, I'm a first year technical theatre major at a performing arts high school. Very early into the year, I realized it wasn't for me and that I wanted to go back to acting. I realized this in early September, and school auditions were in January. I spent about three months preparing my monologue and basically began to plan my entire life revolving around the idea that I would be accepted in the acting program and could switch majors. Auditions come, and a month of dreaming about my acting career later, yesterday I am informed I didn't get in. For the past day, I've been dissociating bad (next month I'm being tested for derealization depersonalization disorder) and I've had extreme difficulty thinking positive. Now, I have the options to go through another year as a tech student, switch to my neighborhood school, or audition over the summer for a different arts area. Though I could get  roles for every show at a regular high school, the bullying in middle school was so bad I can never be around those people again, so going to my neighborhood school is out. Relating to the summer audition, I'm not sure if I can audition for the same program. If not, I can't think of anything else I could audition for. I have been strongly considering staying in tech, but many people there strongly dislike me, and I don't find it very enjoyable to be there.

47,"I feel like I have nothing interesting going on in my life, ever. Meanwhile I think most of my classmates have more happier &amp; interesting lives. I don't know what to do to be ""interesting"". My friend said that most people at my age (14) aren't really interesting. I guess he was right. I keep wondering if I have real friends sometimes. I don't feel close to anyone at all. All my friends invite each other to do things on the weekends, while I'm sitting at home, playing Rainbow Six Siege. I feel like I'm always at the edge of being backstabbed by someone.

I've considered suicide recently in January but seriously don't want to break my parents' hearts. I know my mom &amp; dad loves me, and they do, and I'm grateful for that. I've been diagnosed with ADHD and it crushed my childhood school life. It only has gotten better in 9th grade, but before that I would have mental breakdowns easily. And that's probably what I'm remembered for, the asshole who cries a lot. A friend of mine always says I look stupid when I cry, and I laugh it off with her, but my brain just feels weak, she was brutally honest with me. I appreciate the honesty, but sometimes it's just too much.

A best friend of mine, also a love interest (How stupid of me, I deeply regret having a crush on her), started ignoring me more and more after our Christmas break. She was the closest friend I've ever had in my life. I felt backstabbed and heartbroken. I did everything I could to just reconnect with her, but so far she only talked to me again for 5 days and returned to the bitterness she had. I started thinking that there was no way out, and considered to commit suicide. I tried hanging myself, but couldn't get myself to do it. I cried in bed after my failed attempt. I didn't want to die, but a part of me constantly says ""Give up, fucking kill yourself.""

I understand that maybe my problem isn't and probably shouldn't be grounds for even considering suicide, but I'm not handling this well by myself.

I know, call the suicide prevention hotline, but there aren't hotlines to call in Macau (Where I live), and contacting my other best friend was the only choice. I don't even think he wants to put up with my shit.

But, I don't know what to do. I really wish to solve my problems with her, but I don't know how.

I've been trying to help her break out of the cycle of collapsing into self-blame, and letting her Hsb and MIL (and family) tell her how everything is her fault, and she'll ruin everyone's lives if she leaves, etc. How she's the crazy one, and she's the one that should be fixing everything. 

I've gotten support from friends and family here in the states to fund a plane ticket, and I've offered daily consolation and words of encouragement (including helping her pick apart the gaslighting pattern a few times to help her see it) but even so she's afraid and keeps cycling back into ""I am the problem"" mode. 

She's made the above post to ask for perspective from reddit, as she thinks I might have a biased view and not be able to see the 'good in him' etc. So take a look if you have time.

She wants to go back and live in the US and I'd like to go with her but the US is a lot more difficult to live in than NZ when it comes to VISA/residence opportunities.

*France (Paris, Lorraine, the trench line and Normandy)
*Germany (Berlin, Munich, some of the Castles, and the Camps)

She made it so obvious she was into me and gave me many chances to make a move, but I was too scared to do anything about it and justified my pussyness by telling myself that she had a boyfriend, whom she expressed to me multiple times she was losing interest in. Long story short, after a few months of this the restaurant closes down. For a week after it closed we texted everyday and we talked on the phone once for about an hour. After that I kinda gave up and tried to get over her since we weren't going to be seeing each other as much and she was in a relationship. She would send me random snapchats once in a while, and I would just reply with ""lmao"" or something like that to show that I'm not that interested. Eventually Thanksgiving rolls around after a month of not hearing from her and she sends me a happy Thanksgiving text, nothing special. Eventually her and her boyfriend get engaged and by that point I stopped caring altogether. Now it's February and I notice in some pics on Snapchat that her engagement ring is gone and her instagram no longer has photos or mentions of her boyfriend anywhere.

Originally, the doctors estimated that my mother had about 2 to 8 years left to live with her other health issues, but this diagnosis means she won't have much longer left. The doctors say the cancer is pretty bad, and it's considered terminal.

I'm not her primary caregiver. Her partner, my stepmother, is the primary caregiver.

I don't remember the proper term for this, but her last will and testament were drawn up last summer, among with other proceeds(?), like what she wanted for her body after death, and other end-of-life matters. 

I've asked my mother what she wants to do, and she doesn't know. I don't know what to do. I feel really weird because I'm in this situation where a loved one has cancer and most likely die from it, and I don't even know how to comfort my stepmother.

What can I do for my mother and stepmother, and is there anything else important that I should be doing/thinking about/discussing with them?",18Feb2018,2
76,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this but hopefully it is.

So I have a couple of friends that I have known for a long time, and previously been really close begin to act really selfishly and...strange? 

Friend #1-Katie
When we graduated high school, it became a lot harder to maintain a friendship with Katie. We used to hang out after school most days and near the end of the year she became less and less available in pretty much every way. I kept trying to put in an effort by making plans (that she always canceled) and checking in on her from time to time. We never ""ended"" the friendship, and we still talk sometimes.

Friend #2-Jess
Jess and I have known each other forever and grown up together for the most part. There has always been a fair amount of back and forth between us (we both initiate conversation and plans whereas with Katie it was always me initiating everything) but was always one of those people who wanted to talk about herself all the time. Which I wouldn't mind if I could talk to her as well but no matter what I would say, if it was about me, I could feel her attention drift away.

Friend #3-Marcy 
Marcy and I never hung out that much because she never hung out with anyone, but she was great to talk to. We had a great back and forth and we both felt like we could be ourselves around each other. She moved across the country and we kept touch with social media and probably talk more now than when she lived in my town haha. The issue is, recently she just won't respond to any personal conversation. By this I mean, if I send her a silly video she will always respond, but if I tell her I need a friend to talk to it's just radio silence. 

The reason I'm asking now, is because I'm kinda at my wits end. I care about all of these people dearly and I don't believe that they are bad people, they just haven't been great friends to me. The last straw was I told all of them that I got a full ride scholarship and none of them said anything. I know they saw it though, because they sent me snapchats after the fact about random stuff.

Am I overreacting? I don't need people to loose their minds because of my scholarship but if any of them told me the same news I know I would have at least congratulated them. What do y'all think?",18Feb2018,2
77,"So I'm in my first year of law school, about midway through the second semester, and I absolutely hate it. I went because I didn't really have a plan after graduation and it seemed like my best bet at the time. This, obviously, was really stupid and I can't take it anymore.

I keep up with all my readings, know the answers when called on in class, and don't mind the heavy workload. I don't like the people, the culture, the subject matter itself, or the thought of 60-80 hour work weeks. I want to have kids within the next ten or so years and I want to be able to spend time with them. I feel like if I got this degree, I would have to chose between it going to waste while I did things with my family and spending a ton of time away from them utilizing the degree. Besides that, I've realized I don't even a little bit want to be a lawyer. It fills me with such a sense of anxiety and dread to think about being in the legal profession. I wake up every day for class anxious and depressed.

I've already applied to another program (Masters in counseling), gotten all that I need done there. I've been applying to jobs that I can do with my undergrad degree (psych). 

Right now, I'm torn between struggling through the rest of the semester just to have those grades never matter again and resigning and working a job in the field I want until my new program would start. I haven't told my dad yet that I'm leaving law school. He's going to be crushed because it was always his dream to go to law school, but life got in the way and he is so excited that I'm in law school. I'm sure he'll support me no matter what, but I'm nervous to tell him.

I don't know what to do, guys. Please give me your thoughts.",18Feb2018,2
78,"Hey all, long time lurker, first time poster....as it often goes.     
AND as it turns out, just like they said they would, everybody dies.  
   
I always knew my dad would die, and I always knew it was going to be semi-early, based on his general health and habits, but DAMN I did not think that it would be happening now.  

It's especially hard because my partner (a chef) was just given an incredible job opportunity on the west coast-- we've been looking at rental homes since December. We've been doing this without my family's knowledge because my mom is already devastated by the fact that my only other sibling already lives on the west coast and she really wants me to stay here. She also thinks my sibling is moving home soon...which is laughable. I talked to him this evening. It's not happening anytime soon.  

We just found out a few days ago that Dad has prostate cancer. That shouldn't be SUCH a big deal, right? It's one of slowest-growing and easiest cancers to treat! Nope. Stage IV, right off the bat.  
Sure, the signs were there. We begged and pleaded with him to go to the doctor because he was peeing every 10 minutes...but he didn't want to go.  
NOW, I suppose, even though my husband and I have been considering this massive, life changing move, I'm not allowed to leave anymore.   

I haven't talked to my mom about this (I'm a 30-year-old woman) for fear of upsetting her. I feel like I would be abandoning her and my dad, but I need to live my life at the same time. What am I supposed to do now?  

For the record, my dad would probably be infuriated that I was even considering changing my life's course on his account. My mom, on the other hand, would probably never forgive me if we were to ""abandon"" her at this time.   
 
Help?

79,"Hi, im not good on typing stuff on english nor typing at all, so i will try to do my best. Im 19 years old and all my life have been raised with an anti-drug mentallity. I always thought that people that do drugs were just stupid and doomed to failure and eventually dead but recently i realised that the underdog was me. You see for the last years people started praising scumbags pseudo artis like Lil Peep, Pump and a lot of other ones that does nothing more than spread toxic and stupid shit that young people learn and become their life style, idealizing addictions and seeing them in a tragic but romantic way. This is drives me crazy because im strongly against drugs and i know very well the reppercussions of a life of addictions. I have an addict brother and is the most pathetic human being that i know apart from me. He is 31 years old and still lives with his parents. He has no girlfriend nor friends, he steal people and his own family to afford his addiction and is famous just for being him (Btw someone knocker at the door demanding my dad to pay one of his debts at the time im writing this) needles to say that he has been beaten a lot of times for justice. He started like everybody, in High School. He tried drugs at first just by curiosity, later he started idealizing them like people now days and become the waste of man that is now. He is like an empty carcass with no soul, he feels no remorse or shame just care to fill his urge to more, is like he is dead in life, not even private rehab could help him. Well the other thing eating my brain is that my oneitis of 5 years also become a drug addict too. Haven't seen someone like her in my life again. She has a beautiful and radiant soul and a warm heart, but is very naive and maleable. She started doing drugs at somepoint in High School. At first it was just soft stuff: alcohol, ciggaretes, weed but later she started doing had and harder shit: lsd, antidepressants abuse (daily) and cocaine. And those are just the ones im aware off. She and all of her friends are proud druggies and im afraid she will end bad. One of her friends just died last year (overdose or suicide or both) and since the her addiction increased, the worst thing is that it dosen't seems that her parents take care of her and im very worried. So i thougth that if i become an addict she will let me enter on her life and i could help her or just become the kind of people she likes to be with. I don't know what else i to do, she is proud of taking drugs in a daily base, all of her friends presume of it and her idols tell her is good and cool so this changed her mind in a very bad way. Don't misunderstood me i just want to pull her out of that shit hole but what can i do if the world is telling her that what she is doing is good? And not just is her, is everyone, all my generation is the same and is driving me crazy so i was thinking on following the natural law of life, to adapt or die, you know ""If you can fight against them, join them"" i know is uber stupid but i don't wanna die alone. Also i just want to be compatible with her. Maybe will be better to just blow my brain up.

I know this big pice of text wall is bad structured and redacted but my gears are grinding right now. Im tired.

87,"THOUGHT
Love and hate are literally opposite emotions, but they have one inherent similarity that can prove dangerous. They are both emotions of passion, and passion often times overrules ration. I've come to a realization that emotions once thought to be love can quickly turn to hate, and vice versa. This is a dangerous thing. With relationships it is important to avoid those passion feelings, because those are the ones that turn the fastest. 
You can have such passionate feelings about someone, and sometimes that passion can be misplaced. Someone that you have good reason to dislike can be a person that you wind up hating. The scary part about that is that it can quickly flip and turn to love, even though you know it shouldn't. What's even scarier is when it happens the other way around.

Avoid feeling passionately about someone, because it can quickly turn for the worst. 

EXPERIENCE
I loved someone. At least I think i did. And i did everything right, too. I don't know if its just something wrong with me, but i became engrossed in my emotions, very passionate about them. I always thought i would care about them for my entire life; every feature, every strength, every flaw. I loved everything about them and i thought i always would. Now i realize that there is a danger in passion, and the tides can quickly turn. The hurt me, and never told me why. I spent two weeks being ignored, and i wasn't scared that they would break up with me, or anything like that. No, i was scared that i did something wrong. That they were mad at me. That i hurt them. Eventually the torturous weeks broke me, and i texted her and asked if everything was ok, and if i did something wrong. 
She said we had to talk.
So we talked.

She broke up with me, and i was devastated. I tried to be positive, but i couldn't stop crying. i was upset for two reasons:
It was over. That was that, and it was over and it would never happen again.
And more importantly: i thought i hurt her

She tortured me for weeks, played with my emotions, and i was upset because i thought I hurt HER. Now, a month later and we haven't spoken a word, even though she wanted to “be really close” and “stay friends and involved in each others lives”. And for some reason i have such strong feelings of hatred for her. Yes she hurt me, but i know her as a person and i loved that person. I think i still feel passionately about her. I know that i do. But where do i put that passion? Because right now i feel wrong to put that into love, as it will leave me wanting something that at this point is unreciprocated. I have such passionate feelings about her, and i don't know where to put them. There are only two passionate emotions that i can comprehend, and those are love and hate. If i keep myself feeling love for her it will hurt, so i just put that passion into hatred. But it really hurts to hate her. She's still the person i loved, but she's moved on and i don't know where to put these emotions. It hurts so much to hate this girl, but im scared and i know that it will hurt even more to love her.

88,"Hello there! 
I'm 23f. My bf of 3 years is 25m.

Okay so, I have a list of goals i would like to fulfill this year. Ranging from learning a new trade, saving a set amount of money to traveling somewhere new. I want to experience new things/things that scare me. I have been depressed and I think that I need to feel accomplished with myself and in my life to get myself out of it.

So, the one in question is 'traveling somewhere new'. I also have a fear of planes and I have only been on a plane twice. Never gone alone. I would like to try it out to help get over the fear. Figured I could knock out a few things all at once. Involving -visiting my friend. 

So. My friend lives in another state and I have been wanting to visit him anyway. Do you think it would be inappropriate to visit him without my boyfriend? I wouldn't be staying with him or anything and he wouldn't be staying with me. Probably take a day and catch up. I thought maybe that would be a good time to use to visit him since I've never been to the state he lives in. So I'll be getting a few things done at once. 

To be clear me and this friend had never been involved romantically or sexually and we have no desire to be. His family and mine had been family friends since we were in elementary school.

I would just wait to visit my friend and go with my boyfriend but he doesn't get a vacation to go anywhere as he works in a family business where it is vital that he be there all year.
Is it inappropriate for me to visit my guy friend without my SO? 
I'm afraid of bringing it up to him because I have a feeling it'll become an argument..even if I weren't visiting anyone and went somewhere else. I think he'll still be mad about me going since he can't be there.
But at the same time, I don't want to feel like I can't do things I want, because of his job.

How should I bring it up to him? Should I even bother visiting my friend?",18Feb2018,3

I have a friend and we sort of dated for awhile and it was always a huge fear of mine that we would break it off and it would be ugly and we wouldn’t be friends but it turns out that that’s not the worst thing that could’ve happened. Nope. 

What happened is that we were incredibly happy for a year (I’ve heard people call that the honeymoon stage I guess) and I fell hard and he..didn’t. He said that it wasn’t the same as it was at the beginning and well, yeah of course not, because that’s how relationships fucking work. I kinda felt fucked over and used but that’s how things go sometimes and I eventually got over it. 

It’s been a year, and I swear I haven't thought about it for months, but I’m gonna see him tomorrow for the first time in a while (I moved for a while) and I realized that I am not ready. At all. Opposite of prepared.

90,"So i have relatively bad scoliosis, and i see a chiropractor who is a close family friend of mind to help try to slow down the effects of it. Even with my mom in the room, he typically massages a lot of places, like the sides of my breasts. I’ve grown accustomed to it because it’s normal. I’m not sure if this is normal practice, but my chiropractor never had massaged me near my vagina before, yet when i got my license and went alone for the first time, he massaged on the side of my vagina. I specifically remember thinking “is this right?” the whole time as he messaged the side lip of my genital area (under my jeans). I’m not sure if this is an overreaction because I’m not sure if there are any muscles there that could effect my back (he told me there was) but i was very uncomfortable and didn’t feel like it was right. I haven’t gone back since, and my mom keeps urging me to go again. This happened in may 2017  i don’t think i can hold her off any longer with out saying anything/ going back.

And right now my gf is at a night-club with a slutty friend who cheats on her boyfriend all the time and she is staying over at her place, but she is too busy to stay over my place on Monday (because she says she wants to stick to her morning running routine even though I said I would cook her breakfast in the morning while she goes out for a run) even though we planned it a while ago, so she cancelled on me. 

And it is a reading week, a week free of school and she can't stay over one day and she has never invited me to meet her parents even once even though I introduced her to mine. 

Basically, my friend has said something that really hurt and I feel like I lost a friend and my gf seems to not value the relationship at all. (Tells me she is crazy in love with me and that she has never felt this way before but her actions are completely different and it always feels like I am the one putting the effort in to see her).

I've only worked a couple shifts so far due to a busy schedule and the stores own changing schedule.

The store opened recently and I worked my first shift with customers recently too, and am due for another shift soon.

I was doing very well, my boss and co-workers liked me and were sad to see me leave. It just became apparent that I had left this run too late. The average work experience of most of the guys who were sub-contractors was about ten years. I'd be approaching close to 50 by that stage and unable to handle the physical aspects of the work. This is without also noting that I absolutely hated the job (as I've hated every job I've had outside of low paid warehousing work).

I have been accepted to return to my old job (retail) in a management role. The pay is quite high (for someone like me), but I don't know for how long I will be able to handle this job before the compulsion to kill myself comes back. I'm honestly at my wit's end. I seem to have quit or been unable to succeed at finding any level of work I find tolerable (just as I quit school or went nowhere with any extra education or training I undertook). I have had a lot of support from my family, my wife and others, but I just can't seem to get to a position of even modest achievement. Although I was content in my low paying warehouse job, I was living in poverty. If my living situation became less advantaged (renting through family) or medical needs arose (they have in the past and left me in debt) I would be screwed. Ordinarily I wouldn't care, as my retirement plan was a noose. But now I have a wife and I feel this crushing obligation to provide at least a minimal standard of living. Not only am I hamstrung by a long life of little achievement, advanced age in the workplace, but also by having a lower than average level intelligence. It's not so low that I can claim any sort of assistance, but it's low enough that I struggle with basic adult living and menial employment.

I asked if he had nudes and if he had ever gotten off to them while we were dating, he said he had them and only once. I told him to go home, and I’ve been crying/feeling numb ever since. 


My boyfriend is not a cheater. I know that for sure, but this sits on thin ice and I don’t know why he did it. He said it happened earlier into our relationship, and that after he did it he felt extremely guilty and delete them. But I don’t know how much I can believe that. 


This may sound shitty/petty, but I told his ex girlfriend (I’m chill with her) that he still had her nudes saved and I wanted to tell her because they’re her property and she should have a right to know. She thanked me for telling her, and said she found it creepy and disrespectful to both of us. 


It is currently the middle of the night and I don’t know what to do. He’s asleep, I’m not, and I can’t decide whether we should split, or work past this. I’m eighteen and a senior in high school, he’s nineteen and a freshman in college. We’ve been dating for almost four months now. I’m feeling kind of hopeless, here.

I knew I wouldn’t have a ton but having one for the whole entire month is kind of upsetting. 

I was offered another position at a job that has continued education courses and is  an actual stand alone salon. It would require me to be an assistant again for a few months but the pay would be greater. 

I had to quit today but suddenly I am having second thoughts. A part of me feels like I should have stayed because business is supposed to pick up in the spring but the other part of me knows this other place will be better for a career. Maybe I am overthinking because this is a sudden change but I don’t know. ",18Feb2018,2
109,"Ok so I bought a vape a while ago even though I'm only 14 (bad I know) My mom and I went on a vacation and my vape was in my desk at home. My tenant is an old cat lady who owns 2 cats. She calls them her babies and has pictures of them on her car. My tenant asked my mom if she could look through my room with written permission. The thing is though, she probably looked through my room and THEN sent the message. That's not the problem though. She finds my vape and tells my mom [this.](https://imgur.com/a/7rq5t) She starts turning my Mom against me and starts scaring her for no reason. My Mom confronts me about what happened and I say that I'm sorry and I won't do it again (and I genuinely won't) She also is extremely cautious about me finding the texts and wants my mom to delete them so I can't find them. She's very open about trying to ""help"" us with our family issues btw so there's little to no reason why she's cautious about hiding it. She also tried installing a program on my PC to spy on me (which failed). And, I talked to my mom about the whole situation and she was on my housemate's side and halfway through the conversation, out of nowhere, I ran downstairs to see if she was there and listening and she was. I have no more trust for my mom anymore and I have no more trust for our housemate anymore. I just want my housemate to leave and our family to be back to the way it was. I legitimately think something is wrong with our housemate mentally. She also works as a teacher's aide but I doubt that means anything. She's also unmarried and single, no children.

Please ask questions for clarification because I think I missed some info.",18Feb2018,1

112,"I’m 19 years old. I’ve averaged 125 pounds for a good majority of my teenage years. I don’t think I’ve ever been insecure of my body(other than things I can’t fix) I really do love my body. I have the right amount of muscle and fat in all the places i like. Recently, I’ve given more thought into that I might have body issues since I’ve kinda given up on my appearance. 

My boyfriend might be a contributing factor to this issue. I’ve found out recently that he is into bigger girls. I thought seeing photos of what these girls look like would give me a clearer mind. They didn’t, obviously. Since then we discussed about how I could change my body to fit this image. I gave him full warning that it will take me a ways to gain 100+ pounds like the girls pictured. 
I stopped caring what I eat. Which is something I do give thought to. Not in the sense of “I need to stay skinny” but I know it’s important for my body to get the proper nutrients. Not to say that I don’t indulge either. I think I might have a problem with overeating or even binge eating. (Since I was a child I’ve been sneaking food)
I’m still making myself eat healthy things because apart of me knows this whole “weight gain” is going no where. 
Honestly, apart of me even thinks that my opinion of “unhealthy” eating is so far beyond what unhealthy eating actually is. I’m just confused. 
I’ve tried looking this up on the internet. The most results I get are “skinny and want to gain weight” “how to gain weight” etc. has anyone else ever felt this way? I really don’t know what I’m expecting as an answer. I just need someone to listen. Sorry if my thoughts are all over the place. ",18Feb2018,2

117,"I have previous work experience, but I’m worried about how my resume will look to this employer.

I’m applying for a retail position at a chain beauty supply store, and I’m really concerned about how to answer any questions regarding my work experience I listed on my resume and on the application.

My first job was a week after high school graduation. I worked at Starbucks from May to December 2015. After an accusation of stealing money from the till, during a week I was not even in the country, I left during my lunch break.

I don’t have any references for that specific job due to the entire store being flipped right after I left and none of my supervisors work there, nor do they have any way for me to contact them.

My second job was at an individually owned and operated formal dress store. I was basically a car salesman for prom dresses and wedding parties. 

I was hired December 2015, but didn’t start until January 2016. I worked one month, and left due to the work-life balance being ridiculous. I was her only employee, out of 7 not including the owner, who worked full time. 

I worked 40 hours a week, was not allowed any days off for anything, whether it was for a funeral, or when I got the flu. Due to us catering to most of the cancer patients from a local children’s hospital, I absolutely was no comfortable going to work with the flu.

I was so run down that even after I quit without notice, I was severely sick for months.

April 2016, I was hired for Spencer’s Gifts. I worked until 2017. Best job I have had yet. None of my previous coworkers are there anymore, even the manager quit. I was there for 11 months and put in my two weeks due to enlisting in the Navy.

I left in May 2017 for Navy boot camp. I subsequently returned August 2017 and required surgery for a severe knee injury sustained during boot camp. 

I’m trying to get a job to save a little money to help with college costs come fall. And I’m unsure of how to approach any question regarding my work history.

I have no volunteer work, and really don’t have anything special to bring to the table.

Currently I live with my parents and the only thing I pay for is gas and my schooling which is ~$3000 per semester. I chose to do something through a payment plan at the college so I pay ~$1000 for 3 months of the semester.

I work at a restaurant as half of the time a host and then serving. I’m barely able to pay the $1000 for the month and had to borrow $350 from my girlfriend because I didn’t realize how little money I had after the holidays which she insisted on lending to me.

She plans on me moving in with her at the college she’s at right now (which is two hours driving) next year and she already signed the lease while I have not. I’m a little uneasy about the whole idea but a few months ago it seemed like a solid decision. That plus some arguing has me a bit uneasy about our relationship overall.

Also, I find it hard to focus on my class work/studying and usually put off things until the last minute. I try disciplining myself but I always fall out of it shortly after.

On top of all that I’ve felt like absolute garbage since I’m somehow always tired during the day but super awake at night resulting in me getting around 5-6 hours of sleep a night. I want to get a gym membership but like I said before, I can barely afford to pay for the tuition payment.

135,"I’m in 8th grade 14m. Last year when I came to middle school I didn’t really know anyone besides some people I used to know, but they changed so much over the years that they are like strangers. After a month or two I started hanging out with this group that seemed cool and they were pc gamers. This was nice because nobody at me previous school played any games at all. After a while I became to think I knew them, but they never really acted like they know me. I’m kinda quiet, but try to include myself in stuff. The thing is that they seem to think I don’t exist. For example, at lunch if a say something, they act like I never said a word. When they gather in a circle to talk about things, I feel like I’m always outside of the the circle, and they all kinda barricade me out. In class when we have free time and people are hanging out if I saw anything they just ignor it. I feel like I physically don’t exist to them. I find myself annoying them for no reason, like randomly unzipping their backpacks and taking stuff out just so they’ll turn and around and yell at me and make me feel like they know I’m there. The worst thing is when they have any kind of gathering outside of school. I see on Snapchat that everyone is there, if it’s at someone’s house, or a movie, or anything, and no one said a word to me. Even people of my same popularity are there, or below it. This has been going on for a while, and it’s starting to take a serious toll on me.

139,"I have a friend who helped me in my life on few occasions, for which i feel grateful. We've known each other from rpg sessions - i'm a game master for over 21 years. When i was single and unemployed i had tons of freetime, and i used to make rpg sessions every week for them (her and her boyfriend), which lasted over 14 hour each. Each one session also required ~20+ hours to create for me (with a full script, chosen music etc). I traveled by bus to them, and then often waited in cold for a night bus to come back home. And she used to tell me i should be grateful, because they sometimes give me snacks or some food.

When later i got a girlfriend and hard job in which i must invest a lot, i stopped having so much freetime. So i can't create so many, so long and prepared rpg sessions like before. Which she gets angry at.

I have few problems too - i sometimes get late (like 15-30 minutes, problems with time management) and i have serious problems with my health, so sometimes i had to delay the rpg session for other day. For all of that she also gets angry all the time and points it out on every meeting with our friends (""oh, he does this and this all the time"").

Lately i made 3 rpg sessions in 11 days. Even more than in old times. One of which i had to delay because i got ill. I gave them any day to choose, when we would play. So yesterday i made the third one - all was fine, until i told them ""we are ending for today"" at 00:00 - she expected somehow that the session would last till 2:00-3:00 am. So she got angry. ""im not satisfied at all, that was a waste of my time"", ""i could party with my friends"", ""how can i like your girlfriend, when you were single, you had more time for us"", ""i feel used"".

I invest so much time for them, creating those rpg sessions for which they are so passionate about... and i feel like she is ungrateful and takes everything for granted. And even though she apparently cares about me, she keeps mocking me (also in front of other friends) and kind of insults my girlfriend. So i'm confused. Is she a friend, a toxic friend, or not a friend at all?",18Feb2018,1
140,"My best friend just got engaged. We've been best friends for 12 years and she and I are as thick as thieves.

For the past couple of years, she's been dating a severely dependent person that's younger than us (we're both 23, this person is 19 I believe). This person (pronoun they, from here on out) is a burden on my friend.

They will be congratulated for putting their dish next to the sink instead of leaving it in their room with material objects. I remember my friend and her mom sat them down to talk about general picking up of the house - they jumped up from the table, screamed in tears, and slammed the door. My friend and her SO came to visit me last year, at the time I was a psychiatric technician and a peer counselor. I took the week off to be a good hostess but I felt like I was working the whole time due to my friend's SO's constant breakdowns over feeling worthless/guilty/pressured/hated, etc. It got to the point where I legitimately considered charging them my hourly rate. Seriously.

My friend's SO has gone through some trauma in life and I believe they have dependent personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. Absolutely no hate on mental illness whatsoever, but they are not getting help for it. They claim to try to schedule therapy, but it doesn't happen. They take advantage of my friend for everything they need, except finances (they're on disability for physical issues). My friend knows this, but has experienced severe bullying and I believe she may also have a borderline diagnosis. I think she believes she will never find anyone better than this person. She's aware this person is a burden on her. She's lamented this in the past. Many times. But always tries to justify the burdening actions in the end.

Today, she messaged me saying they got engaged. My friend has been gently and then not so gently prodding her SO to put a ring on her finger. She was telling me earlier about how her SO has been making big strides in becoming independent - ie; they went into a bank alone to make a withdrawal while my friend sat in the car. That's totally valid in personal growth, but not marriage material. I got pictures of the ring and didn't reply.

I love my friend dearly, I want her to be happy. I'm engaged myself and my fiance and I have gone through hell and back financially and are currently pregnant with our first child - I've been having complications (though the baby is fine) and he's had to do a lot for me. I'm worried that their marriage would be 100% give from my friend and 100% take from her SO. They (the SO) don't understand that the vows made to the other are real, that they would have to be there and be responsible if my friend were to get sick or they'd have some other tragedy befall them (god forbid). How do I bring myself to be happy for my friend? I know being a nag wouldn't help, I don't want to bring her down. I just can't in good conscious be extremely excited for her when I know this is a really bad idea. I don't want to be cold, I'm one of my best friend's only friends. She's slated to be my MOH and she's said in the past I'm her only choice for that position too. I don't want to be a dick. I also am on the autistic spectrum which makes these kinds of interactions that I find illogical hard for me, though I understand that I have to do them anyway. I love my friend, I love her so much.

141,"So maybe four or five months ago we got a new room mate. He went to uni with my partner, I didn't really know anything about him but for the sake of saving ~10k a year in rent agreed to him moving in.


Since then he's been slowly driving my insane and I don't know how to tell him shit needs to change without coming across as a massive bitch. I'm also 90% certain he's a functional alcoholic so I don't even know if he's completely in control of the things he says.


Most of the stuff that bothers me is centred about his obsession with my dog. Every time he hears me leave my room he will come out to see if the dog is with me, he constantly acts like her affection is some kind of competition, I'll have to stop what I'm trying to do so he can pat her before I go back to my room, I have anxiety and forced social contact with someone I don't really like is a big stressor for me. He also will NOT stop with this obsession she has a tumour. Spoiler: she doesn't, it's her rib. I'm also apparently a terrible person because I occasionally give her cheese.


He also has started making comments whenever OH and I order takeout without asking him if he wants anything, most of the time he's not even home when we order in. I don't think it's unreasonable at all to NOT ask your room mate if they want to order takeout when they are not even in the house.


There are some other, mostly smaller things as well which I find annoying but just sort of ignore and deal with for the most part. I feel like he is trying to insert himself into my relationship with my partner and also my dog which he has absolutely no rights or claims to in any way. I don't know if that's actually what he's doing but it's how it feels to me. 


I'm not sure how to communicate this clearly with OH as anything I've brought up now he's said ""I'll say something to him"" and I don't ever hear anything from it. We are getting married soon and I have chronic health issues, I do not want to deal with this until we move back to home state in roughly three years but I don't know how to make him realise just how much of an issue the room mate is.


Any advice on how to create and enforce boundaries with the room mate would be wonderful. I don't want to come across like we're picking on him or anything like that. Also advice on how to get OH to really hear me this time as well, I've already told him we need to have a serious talk, that will probably happen later this week.

151,"About a month ago I was at an event for a club at my college, and met a girl who I clicked with right off the bat. We talked and found out that we had many of the same interests. After the event however I didn't really expect much to come out of it since she was graduating next semester and it was just a first interaction. Come to the second event she sat next to me and we started talking, laughing, overall I felt like there was a good vibe all around. When I was leaving the event she asked me for my phone number and I couldn't have been more happier because I have never clicked with someone so well. After that we were walking in the same direction and we both hadn't eaten so we went to a fast food place. Afterwards we took the same bus to get back to our apartments but she invited me to hers. Her roommates were there so we ended up talking with them whole time and it went really well also considering im not the most talkative person, and they asked if I wanted to stay and watch a movie. But the girl replied saying, ""oh I thought it was girls night out"" and ""he is busy hes got something to do later on tonigiht"" So I got the hint and left. 

Okay now after that poorly written backstory, here is the dilemma. After the events were over, I asked her the following week if she wanted to get dinner, but she couldn't since the next two and a half weeks she had exams coming up  So I understood. I snap chatted her during that time just to shoot the shit and see how her day went. After about 2 weeks I asked her if she was not as busy anymore but she was. I responded with something the likes of, "" Oh ok, just let me know when your free!"". However she didn't respond to any of my texts whenever I asked if she was free, she was avoiding it. I also did not frequently ask her to hangout, I waited till when she told me she might be free. 

Finally this past week she agreed to get dinner but she ""ran""(maybe she did) into a friend that I also knew and he joined us. I was a little pissed since she didn't tell me but I liked the guy so it wasn't too bad. Afterwards back at my apartment she sends me a snapchat saying ""great dinner!'and this is the first time where she sent me a snapchat first. So I'm thinking maybe she really was busy and wasn't trying to hint that she wasn't interested. I responded with,"" Yeah it was so great catching up, we definitely need to hangout more often."" Thinking the situation was going well, she never responded. A couple days later I sent her a text asking if she wanted to go to a concert with me and as expected she declined. I said, ""maybe some other time then"". She still gave the same type of response about work, which is understandable. Thinking that things were over my stupid ass decided to give the typical, ""I wish you best of luck"" but later being the impulsive fuck I am I sent ""Was that the last time Ill be seeing you"". As a result I didn't receive the response that was ideal. She felt like I was coming off too strong, that she rather not talk to me but she knows I didn't mean any harm. While that may have been the case, I was confused on the signals I was getting from her, thus I thought she would be down to hangout somewhat often. 

ALRIGHT so finally after what was a backstory compared to typical high school shit, Im looking for advice on reestablishing a friendly relationship with her. Also I've always struggled with initiating since I'm afraid of shit just like. Also advice on how invested in a person I should be, like when they say they are actually busy should I snap/text every so often to them to keep in contact or does that come off as too pushy.  And when should I wait for them to respond. Also this whole thing is confusing to me because she asked for my number and I also was invited to chill at her apartment, But yet she still doesn't  hangout afterwards, but the hope in me gets the better and thus why I sent asking if we were done being friends. It turned out to be true, sadly due to coming off too strong.   Also I've met girls who don't find a simple check in text convo every couple days too pushy or asking to hangout.  But like I said earlier this girl is worth it and super chill and I want to continue at-least being friends. 

Other Questions:
Also what did I do that was so wrong that made her completely 180 on her perspective of me? 
Is messaging a girl atleast once every two days too pushy?

TLDR: Clicked with a girl at an event, she asks for my number and I chill at her apartment for a little while. Everything seemed fine but presently she doesn't want to talk to me because I was coming off too strong. Advice on how to fix it even when she clearly was interested. ",18Feb2018,1
152,"Hey Reddit,

So I have a piece of coursework in which I need to write an essay. The brief is that I need to write 1500 words on anything I want to do with film. I need to be able to have a discussion within the piece and so it needs to be a point that I can argue for and against on. 

An example could be:

The Hollywood machine is broken

In which I can then say that it is broken and that it isn’t and supply the points with evidence. 

I can’t think of anything good, maybe you guys could? 

Thanks! ",18Feb2018,1
153,"Background story: I was 16 back then, I didn't feel right dating him and didn't know how to break up with someone, so I ghosted him, never picked up his calls nor to explain why it happened. It haunted him for a good 10 years, he used to message me every year here and there, or write about me on facebook. But I'd never responded a word. And once in very recent year, he even sent me an actual letter to ask me to be back in touch with him. 

After 10 years time, I observed all my failed relationships, it all ended with different levels of Ex issue. I can't help but recalling what I did, and think of Karma. 

But he's now married with a kid. I don't feel right to get in touch because of my own experience. I feel selfish if I do so. I don't know if this is an excuse for me to run away from the fault and ignorance I did. Or I should really say my sorry. ",18Feb2018,1
156,"My mum asked me to search my aunt in fb through her fb account in her cellphone. My aunt has a really common name so it got really difficult, I tried narrowing the search by adding some particulars like city and college she graduated from. At last we found her. I also caught a glimpse of a girl in the search results but handed the phone back to my mum. 

I never use fb but today I don't know what happened but I logged into my account and narrowed the search options and there she was. We share the same last name, she's from the same place my family once belonged and we come under the same community.

She's beautiful and through her posts seems really humble. 

It's really creepy to send someone a friend request you don't know and since we share the same last name it would become obvious that I'm aiming to get involved with her. (My distant sisters always get friend requests from strangers sharing the same last name).

EDIT: I don't want to involve my parents and start an espionage.

163,"To start with I'm in my mid 20s and currently working a night shift job.  I have a bachelor's degree which was attained after screwing up at my first school anx walking in on a girl I thought I was in love with screwing my roommate.   Led to me dropping out moving back home giving up a scholarship and depression all the fun stuff.  Anyway went back to school got a degree in graphic design because hey it was easy and I was creative.   Got a good internship had work published in national magazines but they didn't have a spot for me full time.  

After 700 plus applications while working part time consulting gigs with the company I interned at I was working at a service sector job until late year before last while living with my parents.  They unexpectedly slashed my hours to nothing and I ended up basically saying I was going to work even though I had no hours because I was hearing stuff like cut off date even while I had a job and wass terrified I would be kicked out without one.  Importantly I wasn't actually fired my login still worked so I had to come in every week to check to see if maybe I would get some hours next week.

Now fast forward to April of last year I got a night job which I hated but which gave me experience to apply to my current one which sucks less.  I'm going to school for an associates in an engineering field and made dean's list my first semester while working nights.  Outside of having no life whatsoever things would be the best they had been since high school except for one thing.  My dad volunteers to help with taxes and wants to help me out with them if I say no he will know for sure I'm hiding something and kick me out either way.   I was planning to just come clean but my Mom in the past week had a catastrophic level medical event which makes me really worried that her finding out could have large consequences.   I don't know what to do I could easily fake the forms since he just wants to take me through the practice tool but I really  don't want to lie and am worried if my Mom found out it would be even worse in terms of health. 

If I can get through this week by begging that I have school/work they are going on a trip I'm thiinking about calling at the end of the trip and laying it all out will also give more time for mom to recover.  Then if they don't want to see me again they don't have to.  I don't think I can keep lying it's giving me literal physical pain in but to contemplate doing so.  So uh yeah help if you have any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Except I am involved in a weird situation with an ex. this person has completely blown away my expectations in a relationship.  due to distance and life things we put things on 'hold' for a while.     I believe this person loves me but is currently trying desperately to prioritize his career/family/personal time with very little of it.  He swears all the time thats all it is, he just doesnt have time to give me anything i need, plus its long distance, so theres nothing I can do to help that.   When we're talking, when he communicates (which is very rare) I feel that i can trust him.  however theres little things that get to me and fuck with my head.  I have ZERO proof and i will admit to looking at what i can without invading his privacy.   I have asked him so many times and every time his answer stays the same.  But the behavior doesnt add up, and my gut is screaming to me that hes in a whole other relationship, while still doing sexual things with me.  I cant keep asking him, I wont stalk his social media or do anything I'd be ashamed of.  I am not sure how to remain level headed, and stop being so paranoid.  its starting to really ruin me as a person.  With all the cheaters and liars and things you come across on the internet these days,  he ticks about 10 red flags.  but is that my gut or straight up paranoia?  I think this is one of those situations where I desperately need another perspective.  I dont want to be paranoid, i dont want to accuse an innocent person of being a liar.  How can i get over these insecurities and paranoia without his help?


**tldr;** ex is focusing on his career while still being a part of my life everyday,  we are sexual,  but he goes mia often and it makes me extremely paranoid since its long distance and we arent in any of the same friends circles.  how can i stop being so paranoid? what are some ways for me to work on this without his help?  How can I prevent the snowball feeling that turns me into a sad mess?

175,"My group of friends and I are all pushing 40, and most of us are of above-average intelligence. It's not really something I think much of, nor do I like to judge people on. But, I have one friend that is significantly slower than the rest of us, and who has become increasingly difficult to talk to at all. It's probably nothing new, but, I guess as I get older it becomes more glaringly obvious, and I find myself not wanting to deal with him as much. It's mainly that you have to explain everything to him, and, conversations have become very tiring as a result. It's actually kind of sad because I love the kid, but, god bless him! My other friends and I have done our best to help him, explaining how buying a condo for him and his daughter in lieu of renting may be the right move, but, he immediately interjects non-sense into the conversation, demonstrating he doesn't fully grasp the gravity of what we're laying out for him.  The other day he called me, as he wants to swing by next weekend and cook for me. Now, the problem with this is that he's oblivious to how terrible of a cook he is, and doesn't really pickup subtle hints all that well.  Every time he's cooked for me and my friends, it's been a complete disaster: every pot, pan, lid, dish, bowl, etc. is used, and the food is always terrible. He turns a simple recipe into a giant mess, and, does everything completely wrong. I am not a good cook myself, but I recognize my limitations. And,  he considers himself to be a trained chef.  There's just no polite way anymore of letting him know why all of us try to steer him away from the kitchen. I really don't want to hurt his feelings, but it's kind of ridiculous at this point. To make it clear about the type of conversations him and I have, this is an exchange we had verbatim...

Him: I need to know, if we, will have access, to a grill you can get and use. I just need you to be sure, you can get it.

Me: Yes, I have a grill. 

Him: You're telling me you don't have an outdoor grill, man?

Me: No, I just said I have one. Same one you used last year. It's inmy shed, so it's a non-issue. I just don't know if the coals are still okay, as they're old.

Him: Okay. Well, the only process will take me 4-5 hours start to finish.

Me: Um, okay. I don't see why cooking a couple steaks and baked potatoes will take 4-5 hours. That's way more time than this should take...

Him: Who said it would take 4-5 hours, man?

Me: Um, you just did. (I am now getting mildly annoyed)

&lt;a few minutes go by&gt;

Him: I need to just know, man, if there's any certain meats you want me to cook for you, you know, on the grille, because I know you don't really cook much. So, if there's any meat you need cooked, you just let me know (on and on and on and on).

Me: Well, I could pickup a swordfish.

Him: Man, we'll have plenty of vegetables! I was asking about any meats!

Me: Yes, I got it. And, I guess I answered your question.  I like fish on the grille. 

Him:  The thing is, man, I don't, consider that... to be a fish. To me, a fish is like a bluefish or salmon, an ocean fish. 

Me: Well, that is an ocean fish. It's actually tastes a lot like chicken.

Him: To me, it's always been really bitter.

Me: Oh okay. Well, you don't have to grille me any fish.

I know this whole thing sounds weird and this post is probably super boring and lame, but I seriously felt like I dropped 50 IQ points having this conversation. It just constantly goes in circles, and it's clear he has no idea what he's talking about. I seriously can't believe I'm debating whether or not a swordfish comes from the ocean with someone my age. I dunno what to do, but I kind of want to explain to him that his cooking needs some work without being a dick, if that's at all possible. We've all been coddling him for so long, and this approach clearly isn't working. Everyone tries to be subtle, and polite, but we end up babysitting him and explaining things like we're talking a small child. I don't know how to deal with this anymore, and, I find myself wanting less and less to do with him.

I'm currently enrolled in a graduate psychology program to later become a therapist. I have a few possible connections for when I'm done with school and get my hours to become lisenced a year or two after I finish my masters.

My fear is that I didn't think entering school through enough, before I knew what I truly wanted. I still would like to be a therapist I think, but I'm not sure. Especially with how much reading and writing I've been having to do this past year.

My problem is just that when I finished my undergraduate in 2016 I couldn't find an upward moving job, so I ended up getting a retail job I like but want something more. My parents suggested  thinking about grad school and I think I may have just been tired of dealing with being in retail for 8 hours a day 5 days a week. I find it really soul crushing.

Now, I love my classes and my classmates a ton. It's been amazing, but next year I'm going to have to do an internship every weekday I don't have class that isn't paid. Which means all the money I've saved up thus far would be drained out, and I think I would love to just move to a new town, where my friends are in Southern California.

I should also mention my parents are paying the tuition and thats giving me a ton of guilt, we're a pretty well off family and they want me to finish. I don't think they get it, why I could be feeling guilty. They also could be wanting me to just stay in town near where they are. Anyway, I've been doing a ton of homework and am feeling pretty exhausted. On top of having to keep my retail job to keep the lights on, it's a lot.

I simply am really tired after school, and I'm in college so I have to study when I get back home, thing is, I have to get up at 6 am, get ready for colllege, then classes last from 8-4, there is more or less 2 hours of commute, so I get back at 6 pm, on weekdays, after which I am so tired and unmotivated to do anything, let alone study, it's a really expensive college, and an expensive commute too, $5 everyday in the 5 days I have to go, out of which i barely scrape a dollar to buy something to eat. On weekends I totally refuse to study because those are the only days I get my desktop in, and thus i play all day long on weekends, and I am really at a loss at what to do, because even if i do grit my teeth and sit down to study i'll just get distracted and lose focus. Which in turn will leave my course work idle, I barely have a social life, and i don't want to interact with people, all of them at least around me are hostile and only care about themselves. I reallly don't know how I can get out of this situation because i want to get good grades in my final a level british exam, so I can finally get out of this godforsaken home and put a restart button on life, I want to be independent and in control and away from people, self-reliant but here since i am living on my parent's money I have to oblige to all what they wish for and really when they say no to something that's really it. I know it's not a very extreme situation, maybe i am just being selfish, I really want to seek professional help about it but I am sure my parents would say it's just a phase and i am just being a little child and how everyone goes through the same phase, which is really annoying since it's not, but anything I question is shot down because it's bad behaviour to question elders, because of this, I don't feel like eating anything most of the time, everyone around me thinks I am a stupid kid who can't get good enough grades and i don't know honestly it's really frustrating. this is quite a long rant, i don't know I just ...

I haven't landed a single interview yet. I can list alot of my experience, but not certifications to back it up. My dad earns well over 100k a year as a UNIX Systems engineer and says I definitely have the aptitude and knowledge to get my foot in the door, but I haven't been able to make that happen. My dad has suggested a sort of job agency or something? Any help/advice would be appreciated. Hope this is enough useful info.

EDIT: might be open to jobs in Tucson AZ if anybody has tips. I would love to move there. ",18Feb2018,1
202,"So In my group of friends who we all do hang out and go places together there’s this girl I met not too long ago and she likes me a lot and I do like her and it’s really obvious to both of us. But there’s this other girl in our group who iv known for a while longer and she without a doubt is my best friend ,we’re always making dumb jokes and have the same sense of humor and think very similar and are basically talking in some way almost every hour of the day.But everyone is telling me to ask out this other girl (the one who likes me)but I’ve been holding out because I don’t wanna rush things and I kinda have this feeling that I might choose the wrong person because although I do like  her I  feel so close to my best friend and wondering if I’m making the wrong choice . My best friend is someone who I don’t think shows too much emotion and feelings so I couldn’t ever tell if she would wanted to be more than friends. But yesterday my group of friends went out to spend the entire day going places and I made the choice to ask out the girl who liked me  and she said yes. A few moments later our friends knew what I did and announced it out loud so then the whole group knew what happened. Right then and there I could tell instantly that my best friend was acting a little strange ,keeping to her self more and very quiet and wouldn’t make much eye contact with me.And I even felt really weird myself like I made the wrong choice . And In the ride home she kept her head low and when we got off the car  I could see her eyes were really watery and she was quietly sniffling almost like she had been slightly crying. The rest of the evening she was very quiet  and looked kinda sad but I was the only one who noticed and didn’t mention it to anyone. Later that night I asked over text what was wrong and that I could tell something was wrong she said just her mind wonders sometimes too much and that was it .But I soon did something really crazy and told her i liked her ,she responded with ""is this a joke ,you’re literally dating *name*” so I didn’t know what to say so i turned it into a joke to make it look like I wasn’t serious. And now I’m just lost ,do I just tell her I like her ?But I just started dating that other girl and if I say something the girl I’m dating will be hurt,and this will make my friendship with the whole group strange ,and I’m still not even sure my best friend likes me , Help",18Feb2018,1
204,"I’m in college and I can’t stand my roommate anymore. He’s a nice guy but clearly not capable of living on his own. First semester was a nightmare: he’d NEVER do his laundry which essentially made me keep a window open 24/7 which didn’t help cover the scent of a dying animal. This semester he’d leave the room around 8 at night and return around 9 in the morning making serious noise. He sleeps through his phone alarm and snores so loudly, resulting in me not getting any sleep anymore. Also for some weird reason, his beard trimmings are all over the bathroom and he doesn’t clean it up. I try talking to him about this stuff and how important it is to lock the door (you’d think a 19 year old would know this) but he doesn’t listen. I’m at the point where I’m ready to move out.

205,"Hi all,


So recently my grandfather passed away. He had a daughter who lived with her who was mentally ill (schizophrenic/bipolar and alcoholic). She has a criminal history and frankly lived with him all of her life. Well now grandpa is gone and my family is looking toward me because I work in healthcare to deal with her. 


So honestly I am not sure where to go. I live in CT and know we have psych facilities, but for long term housing I have no idea of. What kind of information would I need? Can the state cover it or is it now a burden on our family? I can ask my cousins what she is on (or supposed to be) as well as details on criminal history. Just this hit me by surprise and not sure where to go.

I been running a fever, my congestion is horrible, and I cough brown mucus every morning so far. Every time I leave my apartment I am fine but when I come back I get sick again! I bought an air purifier because I thought it’s allergens but it has not helped yet and today I coughed up brown mucus and a little bit of blood. My apartment does have a ptac style air/heat and it’s disgusting. I have requested maintenance to deep clean it but it won’t be until tomorrow. I turned of the ptac and used a space heater until they can clean it but yet same result! Brown mucus. I’m worried they’re not going to deep clean it and I will become sick again. It sucks because I am paying high quality price for an apartment that’s making me sick. What can I do? I like this apartment and what it has to offer but my health is in jeopardy

As of recently things just haven't gone the way I was told they were and the gist of it is that I don't get along with the family at all. Of course I love my fiance and we obviously get along well and I do get along with my father in law. 

But everyone else is just so rude and don't include me in anything. Half of what's going on is kept hidden or I'm just not taught important things. I honestly feel like a grunt worker when I was told I would be in charge of certain things and that my sister in law would be part time. It's honestly the complete opposite where she is full time and in charge or what I was told would be my main responsibility. 

Even now they've been rude  and yelling in my face and just being genuinely awful people. I brought it up and was told something was going to get done but...It's just too dramatic.

219,"Hey guys,

so I just finished a graduation test from 3 years ago to see how I would have done. To my surprise I scored only 53%. Completely let down by my performance, I checked what I did wrong. While going through my mistakes, I noticed most of them come from misreading, misinterpreting or just generally not giving an answer to they wanted. I re-did all the questions I did wrong and was able to gain another 33 %. Hadn't it been for the stupid mistakes, I would have scored over 86%. The rest of it requires formulas, which I just don't remember and am therefore incapable of solving, but I know what I need to solve those questions.

This is so frustrating cause I know I am good at math, yet I keep making stupid mistakes like this. On a test from 3 years ago, I got 60% and after redoing I scored 93%.

222,"I am a 30 year old female failure at life and I am finally taking steps to be a productive member of society. My end goal is to become a French citizen. I can do this with a job or marriage but marriage seems like a cop out/risky because who knows who I can get to marry me. So for reasonable options:

I have an associates in graphic design which I’m no longer interested in working in/associates degrees are pretty much worthless if you don’t have work experience (I have like a year of experience five years ago and I hated it)

I have about 1 year of a bachelors degree done and it will take me 3.5 years minimum to obtain because I still have to work some(though I can afford to quit working, I don’t want to compromise the jobs I’ve worked up a reputation at/one of my jobs allows me ample time to study so i might as well get paid while doing it) 
and the way scheduling works out I will need more than 3 years. 
I can afford tuition without loans, live in a city with a good school, started taking classes at the tech school to transfer in to the university (cheaper gen eds while I figure out what I want to do) 

I should major in marketing or business, to enhance my graphic design degree with the business side of things, but I am shit at selling anything and I just don’t see myself enjoying microeconomics or calculus. 
I will probably major in French because it’s the only thing I’m good at and my end goal is to have a degree that will get me a job in France. 

However, I am really interested in tattooing esp. because it is a field you can do anywhere in the world. My second job is working part time as counter bitch at a tattoo shop and the artists have noticed me drawing and asked if I’m working there to try to get an apprenticeship. There is one girl ahead of me in line to apprentice but she is 21 and not serious about...well anything really. 
I do draw(paper and iPad) at least an hour/day (usually more), and I’m fantastic at tracing which is tattooer skill #1, I do embroidery which is pretty good training for simplifying designs for the medium. I have taken a lot of art classes so i understand color theory, figure drawing etc. 

I have a memory deficiency caused by ECT that makes book learning sort of difficult for me and admittedly it takes me more studying than the average person to get information to stick, but I am interested in French language so I’m motivated to put in the extra effort in my french class. However I’m afraid that if I take a math class (right now I’m only taking french), I won’t be as motivated to succeed and will fail.

223,"I bought tickets (quite expensive at £80 each, but extremely good seats) for comedy duo Flight of the Conchords, and I knew my ex loved them. So I bought them and kept it a secret until Christmas because I thought I would get the tickets in the mail by then but I didn’t, so ended up saying in his card that I got them for us.

A month later in January he broke up with me, it was a weird one and the words “break” nor “break up” were said by him but I just assumed. General break up stuff was said from him such as “I hope this isn’t goodbye, but I also don’t want to lead you on” etc etc. 

A week later, I got the tickets in the mail. I don’t know the duo as well as he did but I do like the humour and I like going to gigs. However, I am planning a trip around the time of the gig (not set in stone so I can change the dates) and that little bit of money could be really helpful. A part of me really wants to sell these tickets for the money (I’ve been planning to for the last few weeks), but the other half has stopped me. I’m thinking it’s probably me trying to hold on for my ex, or that maybe I want to go because they’re great seats to a band that hasn’t toured for a while!

TL;DR Bought really good tickets for my ex and I when we were together, and I’m weighing up options on what I should do with them but I feel this weird force, which stops me from selling them. We haven’t spoke since the break up. The date of the gig is around the time I’m planning to go travelling. 

Anyway, so far I’ve come up with just two options, and I’d like people’s opinions on them, or even another option I haven’t come up with.
1) sell the tickets, go travelling abroad 
2) go to gig (not sure who with), go abroad a bit later than planned

224,"Hi, im 19 and im attending university and the time i’ve been here has been filled with sadness and nothingness. I was encouraged by my parents and friends to take higher education right after high school and that’s what i ended up doing. I've picked a path which seemed interesting at first, but slowly as time went on my interest faded away and my will to finish my degree disappeared. 

I talk with my parents on a regular basis and from what i've managed to grasp from our conversations, they want me to continue with my education and pushes me to do so. I don’t want to dissapoint my parents. I think my parents have certain expectations of me and as much as i want to fulfill them. I think the right choice for me is to take a step back. So i can figure out what i really want to do in life instead of going on this path which will lead to unhappiness.

I am going to therapy and the gym and my friends and therapist only say good things about me and are glad that things ended with that last girl.

238,"I live in an apartment with a group of other guys, but one of our roommates is fairly...uneducated... in how to take care of himself, his surroundings, or other people's things. He never washes his dishes, just leaves them in the sink. When it gets too full to do anything (which is a whole lot more dishes than you'd think), he just moves them to the dishwasher and never runs that either. We used to clean up after him but we're sick of it and are now seeing how far he'll let it go. 

The man may or may not actually be attending his classes. He has this weird as hell sleep schedule where he plays games and eats food all day until he leans on his bed and takes a power nap before he wakes up and continues the cycle. He does this several times a day. He constantly leaves his food out on the counter, and its almost always the perishable stuff that should be kept in the fridge. I don't know how he hasn't died of food poisoning yet. He never leaves the apartment except for a few choice times a week. Somehow he's got a girlfriend, not sure how.

The crazy thing is that he mutters and talks to himself constantly and only really shuts up when he plays video-games or watches movies, and sometimes not even then. Normally I wouldn't mind too much, I talk to myself too when I'm preparing a presentation or something. But he always says completely nonsensical things, often single words or sentence fragments, repeating them in an endless string. He spent an hour yesterday repeating two words in varying tones of voice. He also slaps his desk a lot for no discernible reason.

We've tried talking to him about his dishes and hygiene, but he doesn't seem to understand for some reason. He doesn't think its a problem. We've tried explaining to him that it rots and causes the kitchen to stink, and that it will bring in critters, but he doesn't change anything. We don't want to be too mad at him because he's a decent guy when he's not creeping you out or destroying your living space, but things have to change.

239,"I would like to start off by saying I was extremely high when this happened. So it could all be an exaggeration.

So like a month ago or so, my two “friends” Anna &amp; Crystal  (I’ve fake friends with both of them and i literally only hung out once outside of school each. And I only talk to them in class.) I barely consider that a friend. ANYWAY so those two “friends” had beef and I screenshotted crystals Instagram post about Anna and showed Anna. Like I’m on ur side Anna. And I screenshotted Anna’s insta post and showed crystal like I’m on ur side crystal. And there was a couple SMALL arguments between them. Both never lasted more than 2 minutes.

Flashback to last night at 1am. Reminder I was high. Anna snapchats me like “hey can u do me a favor? Can I log into ur snapchat? U can change the password when I’m done” and I replied “Naah. I’m too high for this” and then Anna says “oh well I know u snaked me. My best friend (i dont know her best friend bc I barely talk to Anna) told me that crystal told someone else that u worsened shit between me and crystal.” I’ll admit I did that. But I replied “wym? I wouldn’t do that?  Wow. I thought we were friends :/” And then Anna proceeds to tell me that she’s been getting calls (mind you it is 1 am) from crystal threatening to beat her ass and calling her homophobic slurs. This also impacts me because I’m gay and crystal has a lot of gay friends who it’s very weird that crystal would say that.

So I’m still like “I have nothing to do with this.” Then Anna’s basically trying to make me tell her what crystal said about her and I need to call crystal out and then tell her what crystal said about her. I’m pretty much dodging agreeing or disagreeing with it to prevent me from getting in trouble. Anna emailed the school about these threats she’s been receiving from crystal.  Also Anna tell me that Kendall (someone who has a bad reputation and neither crystal or Anna like her.) and I were talking shit about them. But in reality, I’ve talked to Kendall ONCE and only because we have a mutual friend. And then Anna subtweets me on Snapchat.

I guess what I’m asking advice for is what to do when I go back to school on Wednesday. I’m going to confront crystal about her being homophobic and I have first period with her and a big group of other friends. Im worried about losing all my other friends because crystal is a snake ass bitch. And I’m probably going to get ISS or some shit because I know damn well they’re gonna bring my name up when they call both crystal and Anna to the office.

She hasn’t been texting back that fast anymore sometimes not even texting at all and barely been calling. Two days ago she said she would call me right back but then said she’s heading out with her only friend that i met too, but she didn’t call me back and then at 1 in the morning she calls me and i wake up to the phone ringing. So i answer and she’s says hey babe, i’m like hey babe what’s up. And says wyd? And i hear music and bass in the background so i’m like i was sleeping. Then she says ohh i’m soo sorry. Imm like its fine i slept good anyways, then she says i just wanted to call to tell you i’m at this house party that i told you i got invited to but i wanted to say goodnight babe. So i’m like alright have fun goodnight babe. Then yesterday she didn’t text me or call me but she posted on snapchat. So i don’t know what to do because everytime i overthink she’ll end up calling me and we’ll talk for hours and if i ask her she’s always saying imm overthinking and that nothing is changing. But sometimes i start to think it isn’t necessary that we text everyday or call everyday i guess i just let my thoughts get to me. So i just want some tips on long distance relationships even tho last time we were good, talked every single day, but things are different now since we’re adults &amp; not teens anymore. I just don’t want to overwhelm her because she has so many more problems at home with her family and drama that i just try to make her happy and she says i do, its just everytime we don’t talk for a few hours i start overthinking and specailly now that it was the first time its been a whole day.

247,"When I was 5, my parents got a Sheltie puppy from a breeder. He was the cutest thing my 5 year old self had ever seen and I was...overwhelmed. My parents never really taught me how to properly treat an animal so I ended up treating him like a toy. I dressed him up, generally annoyed him, etc. No wonder he doesn’t like me. 

I’m 14 now and he’s still afraid of me. Of course I learned to chill out around him and respect him, I just don’t know how to get his trust back. He runs from me, hides under the table from me, avoids being around me.

I avoid most social interaction due to what I think is some kind of social phobia/anxiety but I have never been officially diagnosed with anything. These problems have gotten as bad that I seem to struggle landing a real job and have been going to various interviews for many years now only to fail just about every one of them.

Multiple times in the past it has been brought up by my mom that I may have autism, asperger, or something similar. She usually brings this up whenever she sees something on TV and she notices similarities with my own personal struggles. I have tried find an answer to this by talking to various therapist but have never received a clear cut answer or diagnosis. The most recent discussion regarding this was with my current therapist who said that it would be difficult to give any real diagnosis as I do meet some of the criteria but it difficult to tell the reason behind it; whether it is because I am simply afraid of interaction and just avoid it due to some other trauma or because I really don't understand or relate to most people because I can't.

So I want to be able to help myself get over this lifelong rut but I fear that a diagnosis, if any, won't solve anything. And, in my experience, this entire field of psychology is so iffy that I may never receive an answer",18Feb2018,2

260,"Hey reddit. I would like to know what do guys you think about how I view people and what can I do about it.

I used to have social media (Twitter) with the sole purpose of interacting with others positively and having online friends. But all of that actually made me hate people.

I loved Nintendo gaming, so I wanted to have friends with that in mind. So I tried for years and the results were terrible.

During the first few days I met a group of people. They seemed ok, but at some point I blocked them because they weren't interesting to me anymore and they started to be annoying with crappy memes. But they noticed, so they literally ""chased"" me for two years straight by creating multiple accounts and sending negative messages to me like ""Your a cringey piece of shit"" or a sarcastic ""We support you!"". 

I got some friends while they were doing that and they seemed to really like me, until months later they started ignoring me because I became boring. Afterwards, the group mentioned above wrote an article about me saying the following:  [dude believes people care about him and that his ""friends"" care about him and his monotonous Mario posts, when the reality is that nobody cares about this stupid dude]

So afterwards I left all social media without telling anyone and guess what? nobody cared. It was true.

Due to this, nowadays I have extreme resentment over people, I hate every single person in the world and I only care about myself and I do stuff that only benefits myself.

265,"So the winter Olympics are going on right now and they're really reminding me again of how much I wish I could figure skate. It's been a dream of mine since I was younger, but my family never had the money nor time for it. Classes around were too expensive, and we lived quite far from any rinks. 

I've been in some dance classes (mainly ballet) since I was 4, but I don't really know if that would provide me with much help when it comes to figure skating. I left my studio after the last competition season. I still have good balance, strength, and flexibility, though.

Realistically, I know that I wouldn't really have a shot at making much out of it even if I started training somehow. It seems like most professionals started at like 5 our younger. Additionally, I'm also already pretty tall at 5'8 and I'll only keep growing. Still, I can't help focus on this silly aspiration of mine, and it's really getting me down. Even the few times I've been skating with friends is just so enjoyable and freeing to me.

266,"So I recently realized that I'm being stalked by a girl, I had my doubts at first but I've since confirmed it after a confrontation with her.  
I had this suspicion she was following me at the time, so I turned 4 corners and she was following me about 20 feet away all the way, and at the last corner I got in her face and asked her why she was following me, she went pale as a sheet and ran away. I kinda wanted to chase her then, but a 6' guy running after a young girl can be easily misunderstood.
I spot her a few times a week in her car since then when I'm around town and at work, but she keeps her distance. I've also seen her a few times stopping near my house.

I'd report this to the police but the thing is: I'm pretty desperate. Sounds crazy but I'm a 31-year old virgin, literally a wizard right now. I've been lifting and exercising for like 3 years now which definitely attracts people, but my ""game"" is **negative**; it's not just zero, it actively shoos women who were initially attracted to me away.  
At this point I'm so blue-balled I might as be a smurf, and I mean if there's a girl who likes me enough to chase my boring ass around all day I might as well try and make it work. She's sorta creepy looking tbh, but it's the cute kind of creepy if I say so.

So any tips on how to approach her without making it look like I'm some thug kidnapping her? I can't get her contact and from the previous encounter (and other times I'd go towards her) she just seems to run away. I've been considering hiring a private investigator to get her number (stalk the stalker, lol) but that's my last option.

TL;DR I’m studying for an A+ cert with no job and possibly no income. Should I secure a job first or keep studying? 


So I’ll be separating from the Marine Corps in 2 weeks and I’m torn on what to spend my time remaining doing. 

A little bit of background. I’m married and moving back to Arizona where my wife is who already has a part time job and going to school. She’s living with her family right now and my family also lives in AZ. 

I’ve been in electronics maintenance for the past 5 years, mostly radio systems, but I just started studying for my A+ with an interest in going to school in the fall for Information Technology. 

Ive been applying to many jobs in various fields and pay grades over the past two months but no luck yet. With my military background, I understand I’ll have a pretty high chance of landing a help desk job after obtaining my A+ cert. But as I start studying I feel this looming stress over finding a job so I can pay the bills for my wife and I. So I’ll look for jobs and I get frustrated cause I won’t end up keeping whatever job I get once I get my cert. Then I end up half assing studying or finding a job cause I’m stressed about the other. 
The plan as of now is for my wife and I to move in with my mom (more space) until I start school in the fall and my GI Bill is active. But we still have credit card debt and car payments and other bills to make and she only makes enough money to pay for her car. 

I’ll be leaving the military on March 7th however I will still be getting paid biweekly (~$2400) until April 14th. So for about 40 days I’ll have a paycheck and I can dedicate all my time to studying. However I’m still nervous I won’t get a job and have income after April 14th. 

So my question is whether I should spend my time looking for a job and then study once one is secured? Or risk it and study to get my cert faster and possibly get a help desk job I can keep for longer and during school? 

Thanks in advance!

I thought it would be kind of weird sharing a room with any of the 2 but her bestfriend insisted I should stay with her since her bed was bigger, well I just went along with it.

To put it short; we hit it off and after a few weeks we started having a lot of sex whenever we had the chance. She was on the pill and we both got tested so we were safe to not use condoms. Sometimes se would let me finish off in her and sometimes out side her. Well she approached me sating that she forgot to take her pills since she needed a refill and she showed me some tests and she is like 3 weeks pregnant.

I originally planned on getting an internship on the west coast at an architecture firm but things fell through and that is no longer an option. However, my friend already agreed to sublet to me for cheap and I could try and find a job at a cafe or restaurant or something. I don't have an assured job there at all, and employment in this city isn't guaranteed. However, I'm in the process of slowly relocating to this city and spending the summer there would help me to find a permanent residence and perhaps a steady job (as opposed to one just for the summer).

I could go back to the east coast and stay with my parents and work at this cafe I used to work at (I know they'd hire me back for the summer). The problem with this is that, while I know I'd have a job, my whole life is on the west coast now and I don't have any friends or support network in that city, and I generally find myself really lonely when I'm home.

Last time John came into work under the influence, he destroyed a time-clock which cost the store $3,000 to repair. John has swung at me twice. John has destroyed company property intentionally with no repercussion. For the last 6 months, John has told management I threatened him, attempted to rape a co worker, flirted with coworker, that I 'touch myself inappropriately', that I don't do any work, etc.

My """"boss"""" has said some pretty horrifying shit about John. In fact, almost every day I clock in, if he's not talking shit about me, he goes on and on about John.

Now I would happily walk away, but my """"boss"""" has said some horrifying shit about me as well. Boss has made it *very clear* that I cannot ever repeat what he's said about John to his face. He's even gone as far as to make us work apart from each other.

I would like to tell John everything. Would this be a bad idea? I've done that thing where you write 'an angry letter' and wait a day to send it, figuratively. Every time I want to hand it to him. I just don't know if I should. Thoughts?",18Feb2018,2

293,"hi Reddit! I need your objective POV. So, I’ve had a crush on this guy from my town for a while though he didn’t really know who I was. A couple weeks ago we ended up matching on tinder. He hit me up, we had a good convo and he asked for my Facebook. I thought everything was going great and I was over the moon. Then I didn’t hear from him for a week basically. I decide to break the radio silence on messenger with a gif about a movie we talked about. We started talking again, he was responsive but not really asking anything so when he sent an emoji I left it there. Still haven’t heard from him. Now I don’t know whether I’m the crazy girl that’s complaining about a guy she left on read not texting her back or the crazy girl who can’t take a hint. I feel like if he cared for me he would have found a way to keep the convo going or texted again another day.

Here we go. I am currently 2nd year in HS,i know what i want to study,where i wanna work and what i want to do.

First of all,i am practicing and learning C++,on my own,not school related,because i LOVE it,i love programming and i want to work as a programmer after college/uni.
Programmers needs plenty of experience and good portfolio,so that is what im trying to achieve.
But,for better positions and easier job offers i need bachelor degree in Computer Science or other,related to programming.
In order to get on that Uni,i need to have good final score at the end of HS,in MATH!
Math was a problem for me always,i never liked it and never practiced it a lot,i did,just enough to pass the year..
Programming changed that. Now,i am interested in math more then ever. And i want to practice everything,from Algebra to Trigonometry. Just so i can apply and be accepted at University for Computer Science.

I have 2 years to prepare for that. 2 Years peoples. So can i make it? 
I like studying and i am a hard worker when it comes to this stuff.
So i want to practice and  ""master"" (not fully,but ill use word master) C++ and OOP (object oriented programming), get good at math,study all other stuff related to HS and get good final score at the end.

Is this possible? If i need to i will spend day/night studying and practicing,but can i do this all? In 2 and a half years? Is it possible?
I  will constantly practice programming,same goes for math and i will need to research and gain more knowledge in other aspects such as Physics,3D math,render,AI etc. (Everything related to programming and game dev industry).

Any advice's? What should i do? What should i avoid doing? Anyone been trough this? Or something like this? What about Uni? Math at Uni? 

Every advice is appreciated!",18Feb2018,2

Now I have a crush(usual teenage things huh) so she is in my league and she is single, but I refuse to make a move because I think I don't have enough time to pay attention and be a good boyfriend. I am all about the future and stuff so she even texted me on valentines day but I was too busy with my studies(when you crush texts you and your too busy with studies duuh -_- :P) so she was like forget I texted you when I replied.

Thats when I first thought of actually starting a relationship, but I just find it way too time consuming even though everyone says Its amazing.

Starts innocent, somebody is using my kitchenware. This is to be expected, annoying when they don't wash it but it's not that bad. This was the first semester.

Now second semester started. Somebody has been stealing food, opening my packages, sometimes finishing them, even eating more than I did, other people say their food disappears too.

Incident from two weeks ago. Every friday a cleaner comes to our flat, she does very general cleaning, floors, bathrooms. That friday morning I walk into the kitchen and see the cleaner, her superior and a repairman, they ask me if I can explain what happened here. What I see: a microwave is in the over, an ironing board is placed on the table and also a small fridge is disconnected from electricity and placed onto a larger fridge, some food went off. Nobody admitted it was them.

Today's incident. I walk into a toilet and I see brown stuff smeared onto the floor. Maybe mud, probably shit. I wrote on the flat fb chat if the person who did it could clean after themselves, another person agrees it's disgusting. I came back to my flat couple of hours later, it's in the same state.

Now, my flat has 12 people including me. I have never caught anyone doing anything. I have an assumption why does this stuff - two typical lads who can only talk about how they blacked out last night and how they woke up naked in a park or sth like that, clearly they are capable of doing shit that happened.

Only one interview worked out but i eventually quit. The other two times i was hired i was practically guaranteed the job for different reasons.

Needless to say i've had work experience, but mostly in food and some customer service, and 2 of my 3 past employers would give me a great reference. I'd like to try retail/not food but i never get an email or call back. How long does should it take to look at an application and email or call?

Before moving i had really good grades, though right now they aren't as good (but it's only been a semester so far), but i don't have many extracurriculars after high school, with work and school keeping me really busy. Maybe it's my school schedule or that they shouldn't hire so many students, but students make a HUGE part of the community i live in now. I'm only unavailable 2 days a week this semester

Whenever i'm down on my luck i always think if i had a different name maybe i'd have a better shot, like maybe my name makes me out as too ethnic for customer service.

Call me cynical, but some of the interview or application questions can be stupid. Like i've been asked ""how have you turned a situation around with your attitude"" or ""why do you want to work here"", and i've gotten caught off guard with ""how would you describe yourself?"" and i quickly have to lie or justify applying.

312,"Hi all, I hope you can help me. My mother said something to me last week that is still bothering me. I would like to know if you would tell your adult child this or not. I'm not sure which sub this would best be in either....

Anyway, I'm 24, married, have an 18 month old, and don't live with my parents but they live about 15 minutes away. My mother occasionally buys my daughter clothes. Sometimes new, sometimes from a second hand store. Sometimes we are together and pick thing out; sometimes she shops alone. 

My mom told me that I hurt her feelings when I don't send her pictures of the new clothes on my daughter. She literally would like a picture of every new outfit on her(and shoes!!!!!!). I do try to send a lot of pictures in general, but occasionally I forget to send pictures of new clothes (I mean I do have a life). She also told me that it hurt her feelings because my daughter outgrew a pair of boots before she got to wear them much. 

I find her comments manipulative considering I try. I try to please them. It wouldn't be so bad, but she uses such an accusatory tone like ""how COULD you?!?!"" I understand disappointment but hurting her feelings? I should also mention that we do have issues with them. They struggle for control, and my dad threatens to get what he wants(worth noting he has never said anything about pictures of new clothes though). Their gifts seem to come with strings...which I feel this is. She also is one to repeatedly ask if you used a gift from her and gets upset if you don't. 

Opinions? I just feel like I have no control over my own life. I hate being manipulated.

316,"Hi! Sorry if this isn’t the correct thread to post on, I’ll be happy to delete this and move to another one. 

So this one is long and has to do with my mentally and emotionally abusive mother, who I believe 100% that she does not love me. 

My mom(38) and I(18) have always had a strained relationship. Her family were refugees from the Vietnam War and had a rough upbringing. In high school, my mom was rebellious and often times got into fights. My grandma would berate my mom by calling her fat and ugly often. I think that my mom projects this against me now. 

My mom had me fairly young, at 20 years old to a boyfriend who cheated on her a lot. She had my brother two years later with the same man. 

My childhood was okay. My father was rarely involved. My mom worked all the time and when she came home, she would be stressed and on edge. Often times she lashed out on my brother and I, but I noticed that she would never insult me the same way she would my brother. She still does this. Whenever she is in a bad mood, she finds me and yells at me for anything and everything. And it’s not typical “oh why is this house dirty” yelling it’s more “YOU’RE NEVER RESPONSIBLE AND YOU’RE CRAZY. WHY DO YOU LIKE TO CAUSE ME STRESS ALL THE TIME?!”

My mom has provided for my brother and I financially, which shows her love in a weird way? I don’t know, I always felt like that was a mantra I had to say to myself all these years to convince myself that she DID love me, despite all the ugly things she has said. 

Regardless, I’ve always had opportunity and food and clothes, but I always felt like it came with something. Like my mom would use it against me in a future argument. “Why are you crying? I bought you x, y and z!!” 

There has always been a clear favoritism towards my brother, who was more outgoing and played sports year round. My mom would often call me a “nerd” and a “loser” and comment on my lack of friends. And no, I do have a normal amount of friends but i just neglect to tell her anything about my personal life because of how critical she is. 

I like to write and act and draw, which my mom has no care for. Whenever I mention writing or acting as a career, she is quick to dismiss it and say there’s no money and I need a back up. It’s reliable advice, but it stings coming from her as she has never really supported what I’ve done. Even when I tried sports to appease her, she would never show up at my games while simultaneously making custom T-shirts for my brother’s football games. It just makes me feel hopeless when I write or act or draw because I feel like it will lead to nowhere. 

My mom is very critical of me. She snips comments at how I dress, how my makeup looks or how gross my teeth look? I have had a long issue with suicide, depression, anxiety and self harm.

Whenever I would bring up my mental health, she would complain that I shouldn’t be unhappy, that she has given me x, y and z, and that I’m just making it up. She likes to call me bipolar and crazy. My mom would then accuse me of being ungrateful and say “If you hate me then just find another family who will put up with you because there’s always something wrong with you. You’re never happy.” Then she would link this to why I have no friends at school. She says “This is probably why you don’t have friends at school because you lash out and act emotional all the time. People don’t like it when you’re sad.” 

Of course these aren’t verbatim what she has said but she has said these things at different times in my life. It’s just like listening to a broken record. Her vindictive attitude towards me has raised some comments from other family members. Her older sister would comfort me and say she wasn’t sure why my mom acted like that and my cousin would argue that any mental health problems I developed came from how my mom has treated me. 

My mom has treated me like we are BOTH teenagers. My mom would openly talk shit about me with her friends and ask me why I don’t dress more girly and call me a nerd. It’s dumb, and I recognize that, but it would be foolish of me to not mention that I’ve grown into this way of thinking as well. 

I find myself thinking critically of others and thinking up mean stuff about the way people act and speak. I feel as though this has stunted my passion for writing, acting and drawing, as I often find myself berating my own appearance and my crafts. It’s become so hard for me to do the things I used to enjoy because I would feel so stupid doing them. I really lack the confidence to do the things I want to do. 

My official advice is how to stop being so immature in my ways of communication. My family has said that I’m a younger version of my mom and she’s the last person I want to bare any resemblance to, so how do I change that? 

I want to be more positive and passionate about what I do.

If you need any more context for certain things, I’ll be happy to provide them. I just didn’t want to make this post super long. 

TLDR; grew up with an extremely critical mom, found myself thinking very negatively towards others and myself. How do I think more positively and grow more confidence in myself?

325,"I'm going to share a little background before I ask for advice:

I'm currently working in a law firm as a Data Analyst and I've been looking to find a new place of employment. My group was taken over by a new manager about 2.5 years ago and since then, we've gone from 5 people on our team down to two people, we have had our main work shipped out to vendors and no longer administer databases in our firm, I don't like or trust our new manager, and I no longer feel like it's worth my time and effort staying in this position. To tell the truth, I feel like I'm going to be let go by the end of the year, just as a colleague of mine was last year because he ""was no longer needed"" in our group.

I've been trying to find a job with another firm/vendor since July of last year, but I'm not in a very great area for that kind of work, and a lot of firms/vendors don't like to hire people to work remotely.

So, yesterday a friend of mine was telling me about job openings at his place of employment. Currently they're looking for people to come in and be security guards for well pads in the local area.

Here is my conundrum... I'm really considering applying to work this security gig and seeing where it takes me. Here's what my concern is:

Say I decide to apply to this security position and they hire me. Lets say I work there for 5-6 years and decide that I'd like to go back to working in IT/IS. Will my future employers see this and say, ""Well I see you've been out of the industry for several years. We're not sure that you're the candidate we're looking for.""

I'm worried that starting down a new path could potentially make all my hard work for the last 7 years a waste of time, if no employer will take my education/experience seriously since I've been working in a completely different field.

TLDR: After 7 years, I'm looking at making a career change, because I'm not happy in at the place I work, however I'm afraid that if I change to a completely new field and someday try to get back into IT/IS, I won't be taken seriously and all the work/training/education I've worked so hard on over the years will have been for nothing.",18Feb2018,2
326,"I am a 19-year-old male. I think the best way to explain the severity of the situation is to start from the beginning. The first of my memories is that of my parents arguing and my older brother and I (now 21) taunting them ""fight, fight!"" as if they were WWE wrestlers. For clarity, the fights were mostly intense altercations with the occasional push or shove, no actual wrestling or punches. We were incredibly young (I think I was 3 and he was 5). This continued throughout my childhood and as the years went on the arguments became more intense, so I'm going to start calling them fights because, essentially, that's what they became. 

As I grew up I began to realize the problem was my father. He would continuously harass my mother day in and out, calling her explicit names that one would never want their mother to be called. He would not stop, no matter how much my mother would ask and beg until my mother told him either what he wanted to hear or show affection. She told me recently she would only do this to calm him down, not because she actually wanted to. Let me get this straight. My mother is no saint, yes sometimes she argued back, but in no way shape or form was she abusive or manipulative like my father. My mother stayed with my father because she grew up in a divorced household and she didn't want that on her kids, she also had barely any support from her family as none of them lived in the state and she had no job.

As the years went on, my mother and father had 3 more kids. Any birthday or holiday he would be sure to ruin with arguments. The constant yelling and swearing made me very anxious and I'm certain is the cause of my anxiety. The fights were usually over finances or my mother's apparent ""cheating"" by working and having to associate with males. Anyway, I'm going to fast forward to the present. 

The fights have become much worse. My mother's father stayed with us back in November/December. Throughout that time, the fights were basically every day, all day, and really extreme. My grandfather would mind his own business until Christmas Eve when my father started at night. He kept harassing my mother, calling her a cheat (he thought she was having sex with a security guard at work who works at the same store as his wife) and not allowing her to sleep. My younger sisters (8 and 10) were in the same room and asked him to stop so they could sleep so Santa could come. My father ended up telling them there is no Santa. This got me upset and I told him off and he got really mad and went at me. He wasn't able to do anything because my grandfather stepped in and told him something along on
the lines of ""you don't deserve my daughter, your son shouldn't have to tell you how it is, you need to grow up"". My grandfather left Christmas day and my father continued. I felt overwhelmed by everything so I didn't go with my family to my aunt and uncle's house for Christmas. I needed time away from everyone.

The fights continued and my father stopped going to work. A couple of weeks ago my mother found the strength to let him know that she was going to file for divorce. My two sisters and younger brother were at school. He took this horribly and threatened my older brother, mother, and I that if she divorced him he was either going to kill himself or kill both him and my mother. ""Someone is going to die by the end of the night"" was his exact words. This is when my brother called the cops. When the cops came they gave my mother the choice to either have him arrested for all of the harassment or for him to get help at a psychiatric hospital and she chose the latter. He spent a week at the hospital and it was one of the most peaceful weeks of all of our lives. When he got out he was diagnosed with depression and was prescribed medication which he has yet to touch. We believe this was a misdiagnosis because we later learned he lied about almost the whole thing and told them this has only been going on for 6 months. Just as he got back we were informed that we were getting evicted and had to move in with my aunt and uncle (dad's side). 

Fights continued and my older brother moved out and my mom moved in with her sister. My father is obviously very upset. He hasn't been going to work and he keeps saying he can't sleep or do anything because she is gone. He keeps manipulating my siblings and putting their sadness on my mom's shoulders to try to get her to come back. He also talks to me throughout the day to express his sadness and try to seek an explanation as to why she left, which is fine every once in a while, but he keeps waking up in the middle of the night to go over the same questions and put me down by saying I shouldn't stick up for my mother because everyone is sad so, therefore, what she is doing is wrong. I keep explaining to him that she is leaving for the best of everyone, even him. Fights like this shouldn't keep occurring. He needs to seek help and spend time with his family to get his mind off things. I also told him to leave me alone from now on because the conversations have been stressing me out and I have work to do. With all this said, he still continues.

Today I reached my breaking point. It has been a couple of nights since my mother left and she really wanted to see my sisters and they have been asking to see her. After 2 hours of sleep, I woke up in the middle of the afternoon (yes, afternoon) to a text from my mom. My dad would only let them leave if she came to talk to him and she didn't want to. His own brother was trying to talk some reason into him and he wouldn't listen. So I went and grabbed him and moved him out of the way and he tried to attack me and my aunt and uncle had to hold him down to stop him from harming me. Initially, I felt incredibly bad for making the choice that I did because I'm not the type of person to take physical action. I believe that most situations can be handled with reasoning, but then it hit me, ""this man obviously has no sense of reasoning"". Nothing else was working so I felt I had no choice. Maybe I should not have done what I did but maybe I should not have been pushed to the point where I felt that I had no other options. My sisters were crying because of the situation and I felt I had to do something. He was literally using my sisters as a means to force my mom into not going through with the divorce. If I am correct, this type of ideology directly parallels with that of a criminal during a hostage situation. I'm not exaggerating things, it has really been that bad. I should add that this is not the first time he has done this and I feel it won't be the last.

I'm stuck not knowing what to think. Is this normal? Am I wrong? Is my mother wrong for wanting a divorce? To everyone except him, a divorce feels like the only solution in the long run. I tried to be there for him, but throughout my whole life, I have felt uncomfortable talking to him and afraid to be around him. There are a bunch of other crazy things that he has done but I feel that this post is long as it is. I don't feel safe with him and I don't feel that my siblings are safe. I don't know what to do. I know he is going to try to harass me over the situation and I just don't want to deal with it. I don't want to deal with any of this anymore. I don't know what to do. My mom is trying to find an apartment for us but that will obviously take some time. I'm just so lost. Is there any advice on how I can better handle this situation? Thanks.

EDIT: I forgot to add that my dad is very jealous and controlling and made her let him drive her to work every day. He would always make her late for work by arguing but she's luckily been able to keep her job by explaining her situation. He also would force her to get off her phone and yell at her if she didn't. On top of this, he would always put her down whenever she looked good and would ask, ""who are you trying to impress today?"". ",18Feb2018,1
327,"I spent 20 years in a creative field rife with age discrimination. Eventually I was laid off at the age of 45 and wasn't able to fight my way back to full-time employment in that field, through the mass of kids half my age with no families on their insurance, willing to work twice as many hours for half the pay.

I've found myself a regular job outside said industry. However, I still do freelance work, and need to update my presence as far as website &amp; business cards. I need a way to get across that though I (and my 'company') might be ""old"", I'm still a reliable source for this creative thing - in the same spirit where you only put your last 10 years of employment on your resume, and not your year of graduation. I could list hundreds of projects I've worked on, but obviously that's not what you want on a business card.

What are some magic words I can use? What's a tag line on a business card that implies I've done a ton of freelance work for a ton of satisfied customers, without implying I'm too old to do ""hip"" work? Why yes I am being purposely vague about the industry.",18Feb2018,3

330,"Okay so I had a weeks holidays from school and tomorrow school starts again. My body clock is 100% off since I lay in everyday til almost 12 and went to sleep at 12 ish too. This happened at winter break too and low and behold I couldn't sleep that day either. I tried for 3 hours, getting more anxious by the minute I tried sleep music, breathing techniques and drinking milk but none worked. I was completely relaxed and ready to sleep but just couldn't.

This time my room is too hot but I live with family and everyone's asleep as it's 11:48. Can't open a window since I'm downstairs and someone could come in, opening my door doesn't help either as my dad snores so it would be loud.

I tried to sleep at 9 but only rested, didn't fully sleep and woke up about 10 mins ago. It's very stuffy and can't do anything about it.

The last time I said I would make sure not to make this happen again but it did. Not sleeping is one of the most annoying things ever.
I don't have insomnia btw it's just happened twice.

Should I just stay awake until I fall asleep watching yt or something or what. Please give me advice I don't want to be too tired for school

331,"Support only, I already feel terrible about myself

TLDR: Very long rant about something that’s probably not a big deal to most people. 
When I was 17 I hooked up with a 22 year old guy from a dating app, during a time which I was mentally unwell. He didn’t look like his pictures, and was very unattractive, but I didn’t leave and we ended up getting slightly sexual. It’s really getting to me now.

Last summer, I hooked up with a guy from a dating app - at the time, and even a few months after, it didn’t bother me much, but now, for some reason it’s constantly in my mind and preventing me from feeling normal.

Going to be honest here, my mental health last year wasn’t great. I wasn’t exactly suicidal but I did have symptoms of depression. Due to this I decided to do whatever, as I thought I was going to die by the end of the year anyway. 

I met this guy from an app, and one of the first things he asked me was whether I was a virgin. I said yes, and even though that seemed too straightforward, for the attention deprived me it was fine. I had never done anything with a guy by that time. He, after a few messages, asked if he could take it. And this sounds so pathetic but I hesitated and said maybe. So dumb of me to do, but, as I mentioned above, I honestly thought I was going to die by the end of the year by suicide or something so I was like whatever.

Fast forward a few days, we set up a place to meet. He looked drastically different: even shorter than me (personally I prefer guys who are taller than me, i.e. most guys) very dark skin (he’s East Asian, his photos did not show that so I was surprised) and all in all not attractive. Looking back now I know why he decided to hookup with a 17 year old - he probably couldn’t get anyone his age.

Even though I did not find him attractive at all and he did not look like his photos I continued and went to his house. I regretted it the second I saw him, but I didn’t want to annoy, or even anger him by leaving. Plus, I was super introverted and didn’t know how to interact with people in general. I didn’t know how to - I was too ‘whatever’ to at least research ways to get out of bad dates. (I could’ve got a friend to bail me out - not that I had any, pretend to be sick, or even just left).

Before we did anything, he told me to “promise not to tell anyone”, I asked why and he said he prefers it private. I mentioned our age difference and he said the legal age was 16, so it was fine. He took my first kiss. We only did things with our clothes on because I refused to let him take mine off. I’m glad I refused but I still feel disgusting he touched me.

I was away for the summer. During that time, he messaged me a few times, asking to meet with him so he could actually sleep with me. He also said he didn’t want a relationship - i knew that, but he kept mentioning it. Seriously, I’d rather be alone forever than be with him in that way. He was just too confident, thinking I wanted him. I could’ve ignored his messages or even blocked him. But I was too much of a people pleaser to do that. I didn’t even know ignoring people’s messages was a thing. So I messaged him back and, being dumb again, said maybe even though I knew full well that wasn’t going to happen. I got his hopes up.

When I was back home, he messaged me again. I replied and said no sorry and made some excuses. And apologised even though I had nothing to apologise for. He said no pressure, but then pressured me, asking me whether I was sure I didn’t even have 20 minutes spare. I messaged him no. Then he blocked me, which I found really messed up because I wasn’t going to message him anyway, and plus, I should’ve been the one to block him, not the other way round.

I feel guilty because I let him touch me even though it was just a small hookup. It’s not even about him being my first or whatever, it’s just - I wish I didn’t let someone I found unattractive have me. Unattractive inside, for blocking me once I refused which showed who he was, and out. I feel disgusting with myself and my body. 

This is really effecting me. I overthink now, especially when I’m in the city where we met. If I see someone who remotely looks like him I panic. I feel like I won’t ever be in a relationship because of my ways. 

Since then, I’ve had actual hookups with other guys, and don’t regret them. So I know I’m fine with one night stands in general. Just this one bothers me. With other guys, I somewhat know them well. 

With him, I don’t even know his full name. The fact that a 22 year old was sexually attracted to a 17 year old disgusts me. I’m 18 now and I can never even imagine being with someone who’s 16. I’m angry at myself for just giving my body to him when he asked within the few first messages he sent me. He got angry and blocked me - kind of repulsive. And just generally not kind.

I know this was all consensual and it was my fault for not leaving when I could’ve, or even should’ve. And I could’ve just ignored his messages, or even blocked him - but instead he did that! 

I don’t know what to do, whether to find others to forget this horrible experience or just let time heal everything.

333,"Hi, 

I am bipolar and am doing my very best to get along with my family, but I feel like they are often insensitive towards me and that I am usually blamed or accused for being wrong or dysfunctional or doing something wrong: Whenever someone loses something, they assume I took it, when my dad is going through something, he makes fun of stuff that really hurts my feelings (my manic episodes, my desire to be humiliated by men, even once my gender). I often feel like he wanted a son and I can't please him unless I act like a son would act and I feel like I'll never fully gain his approval (those are only my feelings). He never takes responsibility for anything. He always projects: When he does something annoying, and I call him on it, he thinks I'm having a bad day. When mom and dad are home and I am, they are always at me about working out my issues and always want to help me through my stuff but then I feel like I've never done enough no matter how hard I try and it's very disheartening. I want to live on my own, but I don't have enough money to. I'm going to college and I want to save up for maybe a nice tiny house or something. It seems like they think this is all my head, and I just wanted some clarity from an objective perspective. I know they do a lot for me and I appreciate it, but my mom has often made comments about my butt not being big enough or me being too thin, or said I should work out my pecs more. I don't know if it's just me or if it's them as well? They do not respect any boundary I set at all but I am reprimanded for not respecting theirs. I had sex with this guy because I just wanted an escape and they said that was bad (He was a dick, but I feel like I can't do anything right). They pay for my tuition, they cook, and they clean a lot, and work. I work and go to school and I do my best but I only have a 3.39 and I feel like that's not good enough either. I feel like I'm never going to be good enough for them.  They don't get my sense of humor, they watch tv 8 hours a day on days off, and then they say I have a problem with screen time. I do, but they do too. When I said I wasn't the only person with problems, they got really upset with me. Is this just me? Is is them too? Can I do anything differently? Me and mom fight all of the time.",18Feb2018,2
