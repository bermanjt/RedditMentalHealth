2,"Okay I may sound really weird and not normal but does anybody suffer with panic attacks? Panic attacks where you don't know what's causing them? Mine are awful, when I have one I always feel like I can't breathe and I'm not taking in enough air and I feel like I'm gonna die. Is that even normal? Because I've gone to a doctor twice about it but they both told me it's psychological but I don't know how to overcome them or stop them. Every episode is different they can either be little ones that last no more than 10 mins or they can be awful ones that can last over an hour. They always happen randomly too with no warning, if they're really bad I get light headed from my fast and deep breathing because I feel like I'm not getting enough oxygen. 

I have some triggers too like watching a horror movie or anything to do with death. Sometimes I wake up in the night in the dark and that triggers it.

Does anybody else experience this? Because it makes me feel so un-normal and I hate It! I've had these since I was 6 and I am now 17 years of age, I'm just getting sick and tired of them and I want them to stop. ",03Jan2018,1

The tag doesn't say NOT to machine wash it, (or ""hand wash only,"") but it doesn't say it would be okay to either. All is says is ""Polyester fibers, plastic stiffener &amp; polyethylene pellets."" Are these materials risky to machine wash?

Would it be okay to machine wash, or should I use my hands? Any special soaps or materials I should use if so? ",03Jan2018,5
4,"I apologize in advance for the childish rant ahead, but I really need some reasoning thrown at me. 

I live in a 3 bedroom apartment (I have my own room) with 3 other girls and I live with the most digusting housemate (shares master bedroom). I'm not one to care for others' habits, but it's beginning to affect my former peaceful living situation. We have no way of kicking her out since she has to agree to remove her name off the lease and she, of course, doesn't want to go. The other two girls that I shared the lease have already made plans to move out but I wanna solve this another way instead of moving out and possibly paying more for rent elsewhere. 

About her:
She does not believe in washing any dishes promptly and has exhausted every single dish that does not belong to her to be left dirty around the sink. She also trashes the living room that we share by inviting over her ""friends"" and leaving ashes, drinks and trash everywhere. She's been fired from every job she has, so she doesn't ever leave the apartment. She uses a bathroom that another housemate and I share when we aren't home and eats our food.

5,"I have betrayed one of the people closest to me. My business partner, roomate and best friend. Last year I slept with my best friends girlfriend, whom he is very much in love with. Twice. I can dissect the why four hours and hours but I am here for the question ""what do I do? 
The dilemma...

1. He suffers from depression greatly and has voiced suicide to me often...
- She and I are close to certain he would kill himself if he found out...I'm not saying this to excuse not telling him, just simply stating the fact.
- I haven't spoke to her in almost 9 months and have no plans to.
- They broke up 6 months ago...she was caught cheating with someone else.
- I have gone to counseling for this for two months now
- We own a successful company that requires both of our skillsets.
- She is not in the picture for either of us
- I loathe myself. Can't eat, can't sleep, I am so crippled by shame for a year now I have lost all identity and joy in life.

8,"Hey all I'm a North American expat working in Shanghai at an International School as a teacher. 

It is flu season and I took a day off work yesterday. Today I decided to take another off. Standard protocol is to message the director and our fellow teachers to let them know.

Usually for one day off no doctor's note is required. We are given 3 paid sick days and 2 unpaid sick days per term, totalling 5 excusable sick days per semester.

This will be my 4/5 day off for the term.
Since I am sick with the common flu, I asked her if I need a doctor's note when I submit my sick leave form.

My boss said ""It would be a good idea"" which doesn't sound like ""Yes you need one"" but also doesn't seem to mean ""No you don't need one""

I am very doubtful other teachers submit doctor's notes when they are sick for 2 days so I don't think it is mandatory, but also don't want to get in trouble. I have a very good working relationship with my director, but her leadership style is very beat-around-the-bush-and-imply-everything.

I am genuinely sick and would prefer not to go through the hassle of reaching a hospital and making an appointment (sending insurance forms is a real headache), but I also don't want to cause a rift with my boss.

If it's relevant, I plan to leave the school next year to continue my education and my director has been very supportive of this with a positive reference letter.

TL;DR
I asked my boss if I NEED a doctor's note to excuse my sick leave and she said ""It would be a good a idea,"" implying that a note is not mandatory. Should I still jump through the hoops to get one?",03Jan2018,6
9,"I'll try to keep this short, while giving as much info as possible. I believe this is a good forum for this. I value all insight.

3 children under 10, my wife (30) and myself (35) in our household. I no longer work, I am on a fixed pension from the VA.

9 months ago, my wife began a new position as an executive director of an assisted living facility, that is part of a large corporation. She began at 60k/year. She received very little training, and inherited a mess of a facility. Staffing, compliance, etc, issues. 

At this point, I'd say it's about 75/25 she will still be in the position a year from now. Either from being fired as a scapegoat or because the facility gets sold off. Our 5 year plan was to move to the coast, staying with the same company. 

In frustration, she applied for a position at a local hospital that is a part of a much larger corporation, and she is now one of the final candidates. The pay ranges from 55k to 75k, without much indication on what will cause variance at this point. No salary has been talked about yet. 

This position also has the opportunity to move west at a later date. It seems to have a better training program. And she would work about 15 hours less per week, no weekends, and no evenings. 

The only risk I can identify is that this position has more responsibility and is slightly outside her experience. She will need to learn fast. I believe she can handle it, but it's never a guarantee. 

With her current position, if she were to greatly turn around the facility, she could rise and would be looking to cap out around 80k per year, before needing to either move on or go corporate.

The new position, if she does well, would have a lot more upward move available. 

Finally, she has not been with an employer for more than 2 years since graduating high school. I am concerned if this doesn't work out, that's two more positions she's held short term. 

It looks simple to me that she should finished the interview process, and accept the position if it pays at least as much as she is earning now. Is there a part of this decision that I am missing? A question we should be asking?

Thank you all for any insight. We are finally at a point where we are looking to advance our financially stability, and want to ensure we make the best decisions possible.

I currently live in an apartment that doesn’t allow dogs but was planning on registering the dog as an emotional support dog for my anxiety. I will obviously warn my landlord of my plan before doing so, to have his blessing. I have a good relationship with my landlord and feel that’s most respectful. 

Here’s my dilemma. I’ve always wanted a pit bull but feel I might be better off with another dog. I don’t plan on spending a ton of money on the dog besides an adoption fee. I’m a firm believer in adopt don’t shop. But I also love French bull dogs which are hard to come by cheaply. I’m also nervous I don’t have time to train a puppy and have considered an older dog. I recently graduated grad school and start another job. I can work from home whenever but don’t necessarily want to abuse that. I also have a roommate who is more than willing to let the dog out while I’m not at work (she’s a student and is home more).

17,"Hi reddit, I have a lot of issues but i'd like this to be the year i finally do something with my life. To start off, I dropped out of highschool in my sophmore year because of depression and anxiety. I got my GED shortly after that, telling myself i would get a job soon but i really didn't pursue it. So i spent the next few years just wasting time playing video games and consuming media. Pressure from my mom was high but i really feel detached from the world, like.. I don't really care what happens, kinda hoping she'd kick me out so i would be forced to move forward(I lived with my mom and my sister(29). I was really depressed during this time and had suicidal thoughts really often. 

About 2 years ago my sister gets pregnant, my sister is not fit to be a mother at all, chooses to have it anyway. Once she has it the first year goes good, second year not so much. As my sister begins doing more hardcore drugs and bringing strangers into the house, abusing her child and talking loads of shit to my mother. So she gets kicked out, has no where to go though so i've been taking care of my niece everyday  since summer time. 

So.. i feel kinda trapped. I have no skills, suck at being social, no confidence because man-tits and fucked teeth, have to take care of a child for majority of the day(I don't think her mothers going to get things straight any time soon either.), No license, no education, Depression, and lack of discipline.

Hi everyone! I'm completely new to reddit, so I hope I'm posting in the right place and following all the rules.

I'm in a bit of a dilemma with my boyfriend. Keep in mind that I will only say something that may seem offensive for context, not to be offensive. That would be lame.

My boyfriend - white, socioeconomically privileged, 29yo male - is hanging out with two other men - one is about his age, black, not as socioeconomically privileged, and the other man is his black friend's sociology professor (no other info on him). The main purpose of this hangout is to talk about social and economic issues and basically anything politics/justice related.

As a female person of color with immigrant parents and limited opportunity, it bothers me that he is stimulated by having ""intellectual"" conversations about race and politics, as a white man. He doesn't create much space for others to talk and doesn't have to live through it in his daily life. Growing up, I didn't have the same opportunity to get into politics, read for fun, or explore intellectual conversations because my parents couldn't provide that for me and even if I tried on my own, I was always shut down by the system and by men.

Does anyone relate to this? How do I explain to him why this is problematic?",03Jan2018,0

During that time I haven't been paying my bills the last few months (insurance and phone through my dad) but my dad has been keeping a running tab and is letting me pay it off when I can. I just started making payments back. Since moving home I've been looking for a full-time job in my field while working part time and I got accepted to grad school (I start next week). My mom is also going for a master's and wants me to take her biology class for her.

So I told her no saying that I don't have time to do it. I've been applying to 5-8 jobs a week and classes start next week. She offered to take $1000 of what I owe my dad. She hasn't talked to him about it and it seems reckless. $1000 won't break the bank for my dad but it's not exactly chump change either.

So I'm trying to figure out whether I should pursue being a network administrator or jumping into the programming field.
Ever since I was five, I've been tinkering, repairing, building computers and networks in my free time. My first idea was to open my own computer repair shop but then I thought no it will be impossible. Many years have passed since that idea and now I want to get serious with my life and study hard to pursue a career that I'm passionate about. Therein lies the problem -- choosing a career I'm passionate about. I'm very confident that pursuing a networking degree would be fulfilling to me as I currently and have in the past enjoyed working on computers/networks in general. However, from what I understand it requires a person attend college for 4+ years and then gain experience through internships. Also, the idea of having to be work dependent in the form of physically being there is a major negative to me. Yes, I realize most careers require that a person work at a particular location but I dream of being able to work anywhere in the world. Here's where programming comes in to save the day =) ! 


From what I've collected, programming allows a person to work independently so say if you want to travel and work go right ahead good sir :D Great. So here I am thinking of investing all my time into programming but wait where to start?? Holy smokes are there a gazillion different paths ??!! Yup! Woah, duuude. It's like I just entered the matrix and swallowed the blue pill. Ok so let me get back on track. Great. 

So recently I had lunch with some great web developers and I asked them as many questions as I could within an hour but to be honest I'm still confused and unsure about programming. I've tried some basic tutorials for html/css/javascript/ruby/php/python and it was quite fun however will I really love this type of work.... I don't know. I think its worth a shot. Is it possible to become a developer without college? Without spending years studying? I'm looking for the most cost effective route. What about being a web developer versus software development versus etc... If pursuing the web developer field what are good resources to use? What sites should I use to study with?

35,"Hi everyone;

I find myself stuck in a pretty personal decision, but I would like to get some more insight from someone more experienced than me.
I’m currently attending the fourth of my five years in high school, studying Economy and Finance; I’m seventeen years old.
Next year I’ll be faced with the decision of continuing my studies or starting to work.
While I would have a job ready for me at 18, at my dad’s working place, I’m pretty determined to continue to study.


 I have three courses that interest me: 

1)	Economy

2)	Aerospace Engineering

3)	Computer Engineering

While pretty different between each other, they all interest me in a way or another:
Economy because I’ve been attending an economy-related high school, which of course has already given me the bases that I would need.

Aerospace engineering is kind of the special choice, space and flight in general has always intrigued me, I love looking at airplanes and rockets which lead me to at least consider it.

Computer engineering because I’ve always been a computer guy, I’ve started using the computer at around 7 years old, I’ve built my own computer at thirteen years old and I’m in general able to orientate myself in an informatic environment in general.

I’ve also started with some basic coding at school (HTML, Visual Basic, PHP etc).
While coding and programming has gained my interest, I like to be more practical. (Hardware &gt; Software).




Now about my situation:
I’ll probably reach 18 years old with around 5k saved up; I live in Italy and while I would love attending a foreign school, that would probably get me into debt.

While my family’s financial situation is not bad, I can’t rely on them to pay for all of my education; I’m open in taking part time jobs, to pay for my education (I’ve got some experience in restaurants in general, and electronic devices).

I can, for the most part, communicate in English, due to my everyday addiction to the internet.
My grades are pretty average, they hover around 7/10, reaching above average in subjects I prefer (English, Computer technology and Political Economy), while lacking in study-heavy subjects (Right and law or Math). 


1)	So, what are my possibilities, should I pursue the course that excites me the most, or the one that gives me most possibility in the future ?
2)	Is there any way I can study abroad without getting myself into an unpayable debt ?
I’m determined to finish any course I take (I’ve never touched a cigarette, and I’m pretty convinced in refusing any romantic relationships until at least halfway through university), and I’m also favourable at getting a student loan, but I would prefer not getting myself into a &gt;50k hole.
3)	Has anyone attended these courses in particular, can you give me some insight I should know before attending them ?

Her oldest son's dad said he would pay for half of the $750 to send her to a rehab down south but my dad can't pay the other half because going through court &amp; such with the kids has financially drained him. 

My biggest question is how do people afford rehab? Does anyone have any other suggestions? We live in Northwest Alabama.

-23 y.o guy with a year left in a bachelors in psych.
-Taken 2.5 gap years.
-Switched majors from philosophy+journalism to english to psychology.
-Have had tens of career ideas since my late teens.

I'd consider myself a 'late bloomer'. I've sunk a lot of time into depression, videogames, and marijuana. I don't have depression nor these compulsive behaviors anymore, but they have all contributed to stunting my personal growth and distorted my perceptions about myself and what interests me.

As I grow older, my newfound and potent excitement for things I want to pursue and my eagerness to live a fulfilling life is met with severe frustration about: both how long I am taking, and a feeling that it is already too late for certain social and personal experiences, and too late for certain career pursuits.

I am doing very well for myself in terms of healthy living, but feeling like I don't have myself at all figured out yet leaves a sting that follows the positive emotions I feel when I am introspective.

Some examples being that I find myself really discovering that my passion is in writing. I left my artistic side out of touch for a long time and it took me 23 years to recognize that expressing myself and my emotions through words is my greatest strength and the activity which leaves me feeling the happiest and most fulfilled. I'd like to make a living out of writing or at least try to. The excitement of this is immediately stifled by shame about having taken so long to discover this, and realizing I am 1 year away from a bachelors in a subject I don't particularly enjoy and isn't directly connected to this at all. It all feels like time lost, and too late to reach the potential I deserved.

77,"I'm a 31 year old guy and I basically completely wasted my youth as an anxious, depressed wreck. I won't go into the details but for a good few years in my twenties I was more or less a shut-in. I halfway got my shit together, got a decent job, started putting effort into my appearance, and just finished a second degree that is opening doors for what could be a real career. I still don't really have much of a social life and I feel like I have the mindset of an adolescent who is still waiting for his life to start and not a man in his 30s who should have more life experience and some idea of what he wants.

Basically, I feel like I never really got to be young and it's eating me up inside. It's not so much that I feel like I missed out on drinking, partying, whatever. That never held too much appeal to me and I'm still not too old for some of that if that's what I really want. I'm more hung up on the missed growth opportunities. Being able to connect with peers and have amazing experiences with them in a way that just doesn't seem to be possible when you get to an age where your peers are starting to pair up, have kids, and retreat into that lifestyle. Being able to fuck up and make mistakes at an age where people expect that from you and you're young enough that there's plenty of time to recover.

For example, I'm fascinated by the idea of ""going off to college"" and feel like I was cheated of some sort of experience that would have provided me with memories and personal growth - not even the stereotypical ""fun"" stuff, just the access to social/cultural opportunities you have as a student living on or near a college campus. There's also studying abroad, which is something I always wanted to do yet never had the balls to do. I have two fucking degrees (one I got from a mediocre commuter school and another online from a brick &amp; mortar state flagship in another state) and whenever I see young people talking about their college experiences I get incredibly envious. 

I know that nobody makes it to 30, 40, etc without regrets from their youth and that I'm pretty lucky in a lot of ways. I just can't shake this feeling that I squandered my youth to a greater extent than the vast majority of people and I have this annoying habit of feeling sorry for myself over it. I just wish I had done something, anything, but sit around staring at a computer screen for the past decade. I've never done anything in life that really challenged me or forced me to get out of my comfort zone. I never did anything my parents disapproved of. The few times I started making plans to do something I wanted to do that would have been good for me my parents lost their damn minds and I didn't have the balls to defy them even though I was a grown man.

So now I'm trying to figure out how to live my life. I feel like the responsible, mature thing to do is focus on developing a real career. Use my free time and money to travel, develop hobbies, and try to have some fun while enjoying the benefits of being a single young-ish professional. I could eventually buy a house, fill it with things I love, save up some money and become truly financially secure.

At the same time, I know that if I do that it's going to be an uphill battle pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I'll have to fight the urge to avoid and procrastinate like I've done for the past few years. I'm also not really in love with my chosen career path and there's not all that much I really want, materially speaking. My current standard of living is good enough for me, I already pretty much have the nicest car I ever care to own, etc. My fear is that I'm going to be in the same position but with more money, just getting older and more and more resentful of having missed the boat on truly living my life. Right now, my life is pretty empty and I have a lot of existential angst over it. I don't really see that changing too much by getting a better job and awkwardly going to some meetups or whatever.

I keep thinking there's some sort of different, better path out there, at least short term. Something that will really force me out of my comfort zone with no way to avoid it, something that will really challenge me to grow as a person. Some sort of short term job or something that will hopefully leave me with more confidence and let me sleep at night knowing that I really pushed myself and had an experience. Maybe this is just naive, but I really feel like I'll be a lot happier going forward if I blow up my life and do something relatively crazy while I still have the chance. I just don't know what that would look like at this point. 

So, what do I do? Do I do the ""responsible"" thing and try to get a ""normal"" career-type job in my target field and just work on improving myself in my free time? Should I do something crazy like go teach English overseas or something for a year or two? Is there some sort of middle ground that I'm missing? If anyone has any advice or suggestions or has been in the same boat I'd really love to hear.",03Jan2018,5

80,"Hi, r/advice. I'm a grade 12 student in Canada who is sort of torn between my two options: go to university, or take a year off. I know what I would like to do and have a few programs in mind (mostly fine arts degrees that focus on media production). I know that I would enjoy what I'm studying if I got into a program. On the other hand, my learning disability and mental health issues might cause me to be super overwhelmed with moving out of town and all the changes that come with that. 


My ideal gap year would be probably spent living with my parents, working, and focusing on my hobbies like photography and playing the drums.  My parents are encouraging me to take a year off and would be more than happy to have me stay another year as long as I help out financially. 


The disadvantage of this is that my sibling is very manipulative; other family members have advised me to get away from her asap so my mental health can improve. 


I'd also like to add that I am fortunate enough to be in a position where tuition is (mostly) taken care of. Financially, there isn't much stopping me from just going to school right away.

So, I created fan art for this musician I like. I sent it to him (@hisname) over twitter about a month ago. He did not respond. Two weeks later, I retweeted it and tagged him again (the @ symbol again). Still no response. I emailed him last week, yet again no response. He seems to be only semi-active with his social media (doesn't seem to post a lot). I just think he keeps missing it, maybe because he probably gets a lot of messages already, just as a lot of musicians do, and could skip over a lot of them. I don't think he's the kind of person to intentionally ignore things like fan art, he seems really nice. Thought I should also mention that someone else said it looks just like the picture I drew it from, so they said maybe he saw my picture small and did not notice it as a drawing (I hardly believe that, though. lol, it's not a perfect drawing). They also said up close it looks more like a drawing. Anyway, what are some other ways to try to get him to see it (if he has not already), despite him being seemingly not being really active on social media? Instagram? Snapchat?

85,"Hello, everyone!

I currently live in the Seattle area working for a wealth management firm. I moved here 4 years ago from New England after graduating from college. 

I actually think the best year of my life was 2014 - it was a new area to explore, a chance to make new friends, an opportunity to define myself as a young professional. I did very well at work, made amazing friends, met an amazing girl (we would  go on to date for close to 2 years), and laughed, drank, and danced my way through most weekends. Going into that environment not knowing anyone or anything about the area, I was very pleased with the result.  

Fast forward to today - I have excelled in the same workplace, now in a more desirable role making 2x compared to when I started. I am now single after having dated a couple other girls after the aforementioned amazing girl. Several friends from my close friend group have moved to new places for one reason or another, and the remaining group doesn't meet up as often anymore (although we are still very close and have fun when we do).

I am finding myself alone more often. I've become accustomed to the area - driving on the same roads, doing the same hikes, etc. I'm growing tired of the gloomy, dark winter weather. And while my job is amazing, I would like a more fun workplace (admittedly mine is a bit stuffy). 

One of my desires in life is to travel the world and at least live in one non-US country for a year. I don't know if I need to make that drastic of a change, but should I perhaps try another US city for a fresh start? What other suggestions do you have?

I doubt I will receive many replies, but for those who have read, I hope I provided enough context. Let me know if I can provide anything further for your response. I appreciate you taking the time!",03Jan2018,3

I know everyone does to some extent, but when I'm alone I tend to over think and get it leads to anger, depression, irritation, just a lot of horrible emotions and I become a grump. When I'm with friends, especially certain friends, or humorously but honestly attractive girls too, I become a completely different person. I'm more energized and relaxed and I'm having fun. I definitely adapt to my social setting but if I'm alone by myself then it's a big problem. My question is how can I over come this? How can I be that fun energetic person who doesn't worry all the time when I'm by myself? ",03Jan2018,4
88,"We have been dating for a year and a half roughly, and from the beginning this has been a relationship that was incredibly intense for both of us.

Some context -- she is a victim of childhood sexual abuse and forced prostitution, and a IV heroin/opiate user and addict for the past 6 years of her life. I was unaware of the drug/sexual abuse when we started dating but have since become an integral part of her recovery and her family. I saved her life when she overdosed on my couch back in June, and have been around her countless times when she was using in order to make sure she is safe. 

I have worked closely with her family to try to stop her usage of heroin and other harmful abusive substances i.e. meth, cocaine. We have been largely successful -- during the bad times of our relationship she was using heroin multiple times per day and stealing when she ran out -- now she is down to once a month or less, and is in addiction therapy five days a week.

She is also, by consequence of being a child prostitute and drug addict, a serial liar, and has lied to me about things such as when she is using, whether she is cheating on me or not, whether she was having safe sex when we were experimenting with polyamory, and more. This has led to me being unable to trust her with almost anything, and doubting whatever she says. She has since, as far as I can tell, cut down on the compulsive lying, and I believe she is sincerely working on getting better. Again, though, I cannot tell when she is being truthful or not. 
 
The problem is that I think that I have some kind of blockage from being around her in so many different terrifying situations, and from taking care of her at my own expense (I almost failed my first semester of college because I was calling hospitals, her family, and her constantly: this was during a period when she was psychotic and actively suicidal/homicidal). My sexual desire towards her has diminished immensely, where it is actually now hard to convince myself that I want to have sex with her. I am scared of telling her this because I fear she may hurt herself or otherwise freak out and buy more heroin to cope. This aversion to sex also comes about, I think, because she is hypersexual when she is high, and I have come to associate any desire to have sex with that fake ""everything-is-great-but-I-don't-know-what's-going-on"" heroin high. 

Witnessing her overdose, which at the time I thought had not affected me too much, has become a staple in my dreams almost every night, and I wake up crying or shaking pretty frequently. Though I fear for her less than I used to, I still am constantly worrying and suspicious of her. I can tell nearly 100% of the time when she is high around me, and me being upset when she is makes her even more upset and manipulative.

I do not feel like I have any real life -- she gets upset when I do not contact her or do not pay enough attention to her. She does not seem to inquire much about me or my life, and consistently forgets things that I tell her about what is happening in my life.

 She also, most likely as a result of abuse, has a very childish view of most things, and is very ""all or nothing"" about anything in our relationship. This, along with her manipulative behavior, have forced me in the past to not discuss things that are troubling me.

Finally, I am slightly worried that there is a potential for her to hurt me if I try to break up with her -- she's threatened to stab me in the past and brandished a knife at me when I tried to throw away her drugs in the past.

I know that this seems to be a no-brainer: oh obviously you should break up with her, this is textbook abusive. But I fear that she will lapse back into daily use if I do, or attempt suicide. I do care for her -- and believe in her potential for recovery, and don't want to ruin all the progress we have made. She has already attempted suicide 8 times, and only from my intervention the past 3 times has she failed. 

I do not have the time nor the space here to describe everything that has happened in this past year and a half, but it is more than I could say. 

This is a complicated situation, and I do not know what to do. I just know that it can't last from my end that much longer -- I feel more lost and depressed than before, unsupported, and in the position of being the sole reason that this person I care for is not dead yet. I have tried my absolute hardest to be a good and caring partner, and give her the support she needs, while also being made to feel like I am not ever doing enough and that I cannot live up to the expectations. 

Sorry for the essay.

tl;dr. dating a drug user who I have saved the life of many many times, don't feel like I can do this much longer. I have lots of patience, but it is not infinite. We are probably enabling each other.",03Jan2018,2
89,"There is this girl ive been stressing over for a month. Im crazy about her and she basically rejected me. The thing is though she never exactly told me that. I got her number and the day after I texted her but she never responded so I wait another day and I text her asking if this was her but this time she replied back and said "" No, I think you have the wrong number"". I know for a fact it was the right number because snapchat proved it. Well like I said im crazy about her ive never cared so much before about someone. I'm thinking about calling her and just basically telling her I think shes really cool and I think it would be fun to hangout sometime but if she wasnt interested she could just tell me and id be fine with it. I know most likely this isnt going to change her mind but it will feel nice to get it off my chest at least.

90,"I am 20 years old and am looking to move out of my parents' house because of the toxic lifestyle. My parents have had a failing marriage for quite some time and fight frequently. Every daily arguement comes with a threat of divorce, fingers pointed (sometimes at me) and a lot of negative perpetual feelings. I've struggled with depression, anxiety, insomnia, and infrequent psychosis that gets worse with all the negativity. On top of that, my parents are very strict  and get jealous when I visit friends to even play video games for an hour and require that I am home by 9:00PM.


I have a stable job paying $15/hr, a paid off car, $3k in savings, and two friends I have known for 5 years with an open room in their apartment that I could hop into for $280/month in rent, plus utilities. I've been talking with them for about a year about moving out. I'm at my last straw after a stressful holiday season and have made arrangements to move out this weekend.


Upon letting them know my plan, my father flew off the handle and told me that he would physically hold me down to stop me if necessary. I don't come from a physically abusive home, but there have been occasions where I have been physically dragged and carried places if I didn't want to go to, but my father decided I was going anyway. Like many kids, I've been spanked, but never beaten, but my father is a very angry man so I'm afraid me moving out may actually incite him to be violent, or at least make it very, very difficult. The friends I'm moving out with agreed to help me, but I really don't want to put them in a bad situation with my parents. 


What can I do to make sure they don't try to physically stop me? Do you think that a police officer would be willing to stand post just to discourage them from doing anything rash? Would that even be a good idea? Really any advice would be extremely appreciated.",03Jan2018,2

A few years back he cut a wire on my dads car, that almost killed my father when he tried to fix it by electrocuting him. He took a hammer and smashed the back of my mothers car, and he constantly raises his voice (if you don’t know, Persians can get very loud) and calls other people, telling them that our parents are yelling and hurting him. It’s gone too far and I’m constantly terrified of and for him. I think I do love him, but I can’t live with him anymore. My parents never really do anything to him, but maybe something they’ve said could’ve set him off?

I’m almost certain I have ADHD. My therapist said so. Online quizzes run by an ADD site say so. The little quirks you get with it say so. 
I posed it to my mother as it is really affecting my schoolwork and is really detrimental.
She promptly looked up all the side effects, no matter how rare. Then she’s like you’re going to get seizures and hallucinate spiders.
She’s like you don’t want to be on speed forever! I’m apparently going to get addicted, too. Also, I’m lazy because she hasn’t seen me try. Why can’t I just write stuff down on a post-it or notebook? Maybe because I can’t focus on the note and I’ll doodle something instead? No, apparently I’m lazy. I sent her a link about the difference between laziness and ADD. She says that that IS laziness. She’s debating about even taking me to a doctor at all because apparently they’re all prescription-happy money grabbers who want to give me a prescription even if I don’t need it. And I also apparently looked up all the symptoms on webmd and am using them to falsify and corroborate my story, so I can get on it. She’s leaning towards not taking me and just having me self medicate with coffee. When I brought up that if she doesn’t take me, not only will my grades continue to suffer, but when I turn 18 I’ll just get diagnosed and get the help I need to actually succeed in college if I can even graduate high school, she had no response.
So she switched tactics. Now she’s says I’m not going to be able to get a job beciase who wants to hire someone on Speed? 
I’m distraught and upset and going to continue failing. I hate my life.
She is insistent that my electronics are the cause of it, and all she needs to do is take them away. Even though I need it for school, and studies have shown that people with ADD find other ways to get distracted. It just puts my focus on my phone instead of the pattern of my shirt. “But attention spans are decreasing because of technology” yes and that’s different from ADD?!

100,"Hey Reddit, 
I apologize for the long post but I’m really in need of advice!

I’m a female, I’m 18 years old, just finished HS, I’ve been with my boyfriend for 10 months and the Thursday before Christmas my 22 year old boyfriend cheated on me. Mind you, a month into dating I caught him texting another female but we fixed that issue real quick. 

I was hanging out with my small group of friends on Thursday.  On Friday, I had work (3pm-12am I work at a bakery) after work my boyfriend asked me to come over because he was sick and wanted me there, so I came and got the key from him at his job and then I went to his place. He works at Costco and since Christmas was in about 2 days he had to work an overnight shift because they needed to bake extra pies and such. 

It’s been pretty chilly here so when I got to his place I was undoing the blanket because it was all in a bunch! 
Well, as I was unraveling it I found an ear cuff. A gold, feminine, flowery ear cuff. I was actually on the phone with him when I discovered it. Quick disclaimer, my boyfriend is a big hot head, he gets mad pretty easily and oh, he’s allowed to ask me all the questions in the world but if I ask him more than a couple questions he gets pretty uptight with me. 
He has a small group of friends, he’s a big gamer and so are his buddies, he has no female friends but he knows a lot of people. He’s THAT type of person. I have a small group of friends as well, my twin sister, our gay best friend and then my own best friend...That’s my group of friends. I don’t have any other guy friends, I’ve tried multiple times and it never goes well so I stopped trying. It’s very hard for me to find someone attractive, before this I️ had been single for 4 years. I’m a long-term person when it comes to relationships. Btw, my boyfriend knows my phone passcode, his fingerprints are in my phone so he can go in it whenever he likes. I’m very very open about my phone with him because I have nothing to hide. I have no social media. 

I ended up confronting him about it a couple minutes after it actually sank in that I just found this in his bed. 

He ended up denying denying denying, “I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. It might be your sisters.” (My sister is never over his place, so that’s when I figured something wasn’t right when he was saying random things). At one point I said, “Well we can agree it didn’t grow feet and get here on its own correct?” &amp; He agreed. 

I ended up staying the night. The couple times I tried to bring it up the next morning, he got heated really quick. 
I went to work the next day and I told my coworkers the story because I felt like they’d be able to give me fair answers, while my own best friends would’ve just been livid.

My coworkers were pointing out all these things, “Well it wasn’t just laying on his bed it was IN the sheet...He couldn’t give you a straight answer and when you first brought it up he immediately got defensive in a way you’ve never seen from him before”, let me be clear when it comes to my boyfriend I have NO backbone. 

So one of my coworkers suggested this, he said, “How about you ask him for the girls number so you can have the closure you need, and if it isn’t a problem and he has nothing to hide he’ll give you her number without issues. If he says ANYTHING ELSE besides ‘Yes, her number is...’ THEN you have a huge problem. Huge red flag. Immediate big red flag.” I said “Well, okay, sounds good to me because I’ve heard what he has to say but I want to hear her say it for my own sanity”.  

That same night, I️ brought it up again after I had gotten off work and I was on the phone with him on my way home from work, I said to him, “For my own closure and peace of mind can I please have her number?” and he flat out said “Nope, I’m not giving you her number. I’m not going to let you text her, she barely knows you. You’re a stranger to her. Nope I’m not doing it.” and I’m like “I’m sure she would understand, she’s a female. She already knows what’s going on”.  Then I said “Well why won’t you?” And he said “I’m just not”. 

While he was still at work on Friday night I told him, “Okay so you’re saying it’s Steph’s because she came over to cop some green, and she must’ve sat on your bed for a minute or two right? So text her this photo to make sure it’s hers please”, and he had told me “Yeah I️ texted her and she said it’s hers” and I said “Okay well, for my own closure can I please see a screenshot of it?” And he said “I deleted the conversation I don’t keep any of my conversations because they take up space” I knew he was lying to me because a couple days before I looked over his shoulder and he had a whole inbox full of conversations. So I said “Okay well send it to her again and show me then”, when he got home he showed me it was the photo I had told him to send to her, and under it it said “Is this yours?” And that someone said “Yes”. 

Well on my way home from work when I asked him for this female’s number and he wouldn’t give it to me, I realized THEN that the whole time I told him to text to make sure it was hers, it wasn’t Steph’s because if it was he would have been able to shoot me the phone number easily.

Christmas night rolls around, I come over, his parents are in town, we exchange gifts and then he wants to go out to his car to talk. 
To sum it up, he was telling me “In the last couple of days I’ve realized just how much you mean to me, you’re the love of my life.” He spoke about new adventures and new money opportunities as if we were going to pursue them together and beforehand, any type of opportunity like that he would talk about it like “you do you I do me”, when I first got there he was being very affectionate which I’m not used to him being AT ALL. 

After awhile I basically said, “Well I have something to say...” and spilled how I really felt ever since Friday night. He finally admitted to cheating on me and it was with someone I’ve never even heard of. He poured his heart out to me, we cried together and shit got deeper than ever.

I really feel like he’s being honest with me and that he isn’t going to do it again. I feel like instead of breaking us apart it has made us stronger and is going to make us stronger because it shows him that I’m really here no matter what.  
Although, the trust really did break after he admitted to cheating. I trusted him 100% before, especially after I caught him talking to some girl a month into dating. Is it normal that I don’t fully trust him anymore? 

The reason I’m writing this now is because he’s going back to Georgia for a couple days to see his parents, and I’m just worried, I don’t have anyone else to turn to. 

I need outside opinions, because I️’m unsure if I’m being a bit blind to the reality of this whole situation. Any questions I’d be happy to ask. 

PS We both have high libidos and our sex has always been priceless so there’s a part of me that really feels like he just made a mistake and it showed him how much he really does love me. ",03Jan2018,2

I suffer from severe PTSD, where at some point I almost committed suicide. I'm trying to HATE this DOUCHE, but the PTSD fucks with my sanity. Every time I think I'm ready to move on, I break down crying, hurt, and betrayed with this initial, pure feeling towards him. I'm constantly triggered by the music he listened to, (think Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack). I'm trying to reconcile these naive, hormonal, teenage feelings with the rageful, insanity gripping pain of betrayal. I cut all my ties to my past, to the point I cut too many, but it predominately helped. I had reserved one happy untainted, pure feeling (of him) that kept my sanity in place and I fucked it all up. I'm mad for ever believing something better could have come from him, like an apology. Image destroyed -&gt; sanity destroyed. I don't even know where to begin.

Hello!  So, for a while now, my native Japanese friend have been planning a trip so I can visit him in Japan this summer for a week or so.  I have been very excited to go and have been enjoying learning the language and culture since August.  My native friend has also offered me extremely cheap tickets to Tokyo (~$5/600) compared to normal prices and I figured that this year is really the best time to go.  My mom has not been so excited.  I asked her tonight if we can buy the tickets because the longer we wait the more expensive they are, and she basically said ""I don't want you going alone to a country where you don't speak the language or understand the culture/way of speaking"".  She had previously known that I was learning Japanese and I told her that at the rate I'm learning I'll be able to read most signs and talk fluently in normal conversation within 2 or 3 months; which may seem like exaggeration but is likely for how much I am studying.  She then changed to ""I don't want you to go to a foreign country with no parental supervision"" to which i said my native friend's parents will be there the whole time.  She then said, ""I don't know if I can trust them,"" which to me just seems like she's been backed into a corner on why she doesn't want me to go because I could easily set up email w/ the non-perfect, however functioning, google translate.  I didn't say this to her, I'm going to continue tomorrow because I don't want to wear her down on this.  This trip is very important to me because it will show my parents that I can be responsible by myself and I have matured to the point where I do not need to be hand-held through every step out of the door of my house.

TL; DR: Want to go to Japan with native friend, mother doesn't want me to go because of various resolvable quams.

What do you have to say about this?  How can I convince her?

I procrastinate and get distracted by the internet, browsing and obsessing over things that dont really matter (ideal body, narcissistic behaviours, guys, etc). I ended up only spending about 2 hours today on the work i wanted to do which i was happy about except i went back to relaxing. I have wasted so much time procrastinating this whole break and it just frustrates me that i do this ever break. I am supposed to start studying for exams, finish my scholarship applications, and my supplemental application for an important program i have. 

I used to be so good with plans. I would plan out stuff to do and the breaks to have but its just i feel like im running out oftime so im trying to cram everything into the day with as many breaks as possible but i cant seem to follow thru. 

I hate how im becoming this way. Im on a diet too but i keep overeating. I see that im not eating enough protein so  im fixing that but i hate that i lost so much weight before (128--&gt;110lbs mostly water weight). I am so stressed and i keep picking at my body. My belly isnt small enough and i miss the body that i ruined because i was scared of losing too much weight and losing my figure. 

Im so stressed because im not getting things done and i really hate my body. I also hate that i planned to read so many books but end up not reading at all. I also plan to sleep early but sleep exactly at 2am each night from things like this - staying up for some stupid reason. 

I find though that i dont have many friends. I dont very much like my close friend for good reason 
So when im alone im often unproductive which is how it often is this winter break but when my bro or parents come home i am productive.

115,"In late November, my skin became really sensitive to the cold for some unknown reason. This is the first time it's gotten this bad. My regular layer of lotion wasn't enough to brave the wind chill and left my skin red, flaking dry, and feeling itchy and inelastic for a long time. I did what I could by moisturizing more, which meant using aloe vera gel before lotion (which stung during the worst times) and putting Vaseline petroleum jelly under my eyes (which made my skin feel the most normal). I even went to an acupuncturist and took Oriental medicine during the time my skin was 80% recovered.     
The affected areas, my face, neck, and left ear were pretty much normal by mid-December, so I became more lenient on moisturizing some days. But my face reverted is feeling inelastic and dry nowadays. My neck and ear are totally fine though. Is there some kind of lotion, medical-grade or not, that can help with my cold sensitivity problem? I also don't like how it's making my face look red, so I'd be happy to listen to recommendations on how I can cover it with makeup.

124,"Hey guys,

So I was t-boned by another car at a 4 way stop almost a month ago now.  I only have liability insurance, so they can't do anything for me, so I have a claim with the other driver's insurance.  They aren't going to make a final decision on liability until they get the police report.  The officer that responded to the scene of the accident told me that the report would be ready within 10 days.  I requested it a couple of days later (I didn't know I had to put in a request for it at first), and it has now been 4 weeks since the accident, almost 3 times longer than I was told.

I've now started calling in to check on it ever other day.  The receptionist is no help, she doesn't have any answers for me.  I have been very patient and respectful, but I don't know what to do from here.  I am getting extremely annoyed and angry with the situation, but I am afraid that I will piss them off if I file any sort of complaint, which may not turn out in my favor.  

It was a pretty cut and dry situation, and the other driver was clearly at fault.  The only reason I can think of (besides laziness) that would possibly make it take longer is because the officer, at the scene of the accident, told me that they were probably going to have the very elderly driver have his license status reevaluated.  

Do you guys have any tips for what I can do to push this along?  My car is all messed up and it has been REALLY stressing me out over the past month, and I need this to be resolved.  

Thanks!",03Jan2018,2

I've tried to help him just by talking about it, or getting him to get out more, but nothing has worked. its gotten to the point where he has dropped out of school, and is sitting at home, alone, doing nothing all day. 
I need advice of what to do, because I'm kind of freaking out. He was such a nice guy and very smart as well, and it tears me apart seeing him in the state that he is. What kinds of things can I do to make his situation a little better? Are there any books out there that could possibly help him with his depression and give him some direction in life?

I immediately apologized (a lot) to my friends there, who were horrified and swore not to say it again. A few months later and it's still been tearing at me as I try to sleep, and I wish I could take it back for anything. What do I do?",03Jan2018,2
128,"Nobody seems to have an issue where their SO antagonizes their pet so I want advice on this one.

&amp;nbsp;

Been dating this girl for 10 months. One day she says she wants to go to the pet shelter. I've been doing this for a few weeks to visit cats because I want to have a cat but I know she doesn't like the litter and she hated my old cat that I had to re-home. But I did too so it wasn't so bad but it was still sad and I didn't like doing it.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway we go to the shelter and she finds this kitten and she wants to adopt it. I'm like wtf okay if you're getting a cat then I can get a frickin cat. So we both adopt kittens. She has to get rid of hers on the second day of owning it because of her landlord. I keep mine. Now the cat is several months old and my girlfriend comes in and smothers him and picks him up and pets him even though he doesn't like it. She keeps this up until he starts scratching and biting, albeit playfully. She engages in this behavior with him and keeps pushing him. I've trained him to not treat me like a playmate, but she is acting as one. He gets more and more aggressive over time. So the problem is that when she leaves, he continues to play, but with me. Then the next few days its like my training progress is erased because he will swat at me or try to bite me. He is gentle about it but I want to be strict about not letting him engage in that behavior.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm mad because he doesn't even instigate it! She goes up to him and bothers him! The cat doesn't like being touched there if he is meowing or pawing at you, so why do you continue? She pushes the limit of seriously hurting him and inflicting minor pain on him. She likes when he cries out of discomfort or pain. If she is under the covers, she'll grab his paw until he cries. She'll put her shoe on his head and gently hold his skull to the floor. And what's sad to me is she doesn't do this with her friend's cat. But that cat will just sit in her lap whenever she puts the cat in her lap. Mine is not affectionate on-demand.

&amp;nbsp;

I sort of understand her aggression towards an animal in general because I felt that way towards a spoiled brat of a dog my ex had. But I tried very hard to have restraint and compromised by only giving it attention when it was calm and sat on my lap. We got along okay.

&amp;nbsp;

She wanted to get her own cat, she gets along with her friend's cat, but she won't accept either of the two cats that I've had. This isn't a situation where the cat cries too much, or rips up carpet, or sheds on her clothes, or has bathroom problems. He did chew her glasses one time and it bothered her so she got replacements so that was shitty for her I know. But he doesn't have general behavioral problems. He chews on plastic sometimes. He's a kitten. I tell her he will grow out of it but she is worried she won't want to live with me in the future because I have a cat.

&amp;nbsp;

I guess if I got rid of him I would just be pissed that I had two cats she could not accept but she was willing to adopt her own and she gets along with another cat. It's not a general cat problem it's something else. If she just ignored him he wouldn't try to ""play"" with her but she engages him so he does it. He knows I won't do it but he knows she will.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR I love cats. GF doesn't dislike cats, just MY cats and won't live with me in the future if I keep one that she doesn't like.**",03Jan2018,3
129,"A few months ago a friend of mine starting acting really distant and not hanging around as much or talking to me as much as we used to everyday. This made me a bit confused, so one night I said to him I feel like I am being a huge inconvenience when hanging round him and he sort of brushed it off as a joke.  This made me feel a bit hurt. Anyway the next day (we worked together) he offered me coffee and I made the comment ""I'm jelly, I used to get coffee first"".  

Anyway i had to go to a meeting and when i came back and reread the messages, i realized how awful it sounded and profusely apologised as I felt awful. As a result the friendship basically ended over that and I regret it massively and sort of hate myself abit for hurting his feelings. Now that statement and behaviour was out of character for me or at least I'd never noticed it before. I'm just concerned now whether I am a manipulative person or not and its bothering me immensely.

130,"I know this has been done a million times but I just can’t figure out what I should do. I’m 30 and have been with my bf for 10 years with no major problems, I love him and would say I’m pretty happy most of the time, he is a really nice guy and we get along really really well. But I feel something for his friend that I have never felt for anyone else and every once in a while I get quite depressed about it. I have read a lot online about similar situations and have tried the whole ‘just don’t hang out with him, forget about it and move on thing’ but it doesn’t seem to work. It might work for a month or 2 but then out of nowhere the feelings will come back stronger than ever, even if I haven’t been hanging out with him at all. Nothing has ever happened between me and his friend and I know that he is not the kind of guy to betray his friend and I would never ever cheat on my boyfriend, and there were a couple of times I broke up with him because I felt so so terrible for feeling like this and thought it was so horrible for me to stay with him when I feel that way about his friend. But almost straight after breaking up with him it would feel like the biggest mistake ever and we wouldn’t properly go through with it, things would then 
go okay for a few months and then it would all happen over again. So I know breaking up with him doesn’t work, avoiding the friend doesn’t work, I’m seriously contemplating telling the friend how I feel, purely so that I can actually hear him say that there is no chance of anything happening between us so that then I can move on and stop fantasising about him constantly. But then there is a tiny tiny part of me that would hope he would say he feels the same way and that we could work something out. And this makes me feel like the worst person in the world. I am at the stage where I feel like my boyfriend and I should be getting married, having kids etc but for some reason I don’t know if I can see this happening with him, I just can’t visualise it, but i can easily see it happening with his friend. When I read back through this post it kind of seems like the logical thing to do would be to break up with my boyfriend, but I do actually love him and would not want to be with anyone else, I am not interested in anyone else apart from his friend, it’s such a hard feeling to describe. Sorry this has been so long I just need to get it off my chest. I am so confused and this has been going on for about 3 years now so I think I have given it a good enough chance to go away on its own and I don’t think it’s gonna happen.

132,"My mental state has been extremely unhealthy for the past few years. I've gone to a mental hospital, switched schools and gone to therapy. It felt like things were getting better but after winter break I can't stand going back to school. It's not the homework or waking up that I don't like. It's the people and pressure that I constantly feel at school. At one point two years ago, I missed about 2 months of school for this reason and I don't want that to happen again yet school is torture for me. I'm fine with homework (although I have a problem with getting stuff done) and doing stuff but the teachers, friends and everyone in the building make me exhausted and stressed as hell every night. On top of that I have varsity swim practice after school which makes getting homework done extremely hard. I have the time to do it but instead I spend that time trying to numb my brain cause it's so overwhelmed by the end of every day. And then I get to the point where I'm missing a lot of work which stresses me even more and then I stop going to school. This happens at least twice a tri and i know how bad it will probably affect me in the future yet I can't get myself to do anything about it. I'm currently staying up attempting to get stuff done at 1 am but I don't. I just do shit on my phone and avoid it. Then I'll go to sleep at 3 and wake up at 6, feeling like death. Then 7 hours of school and 3 hours of swimming later, I'm up at 1 attempting to get stuff done. Now I know there's an obvious answer which is therapy.

133,"So me and my girlfriend have been together for 5 months and we’ve gotten sexual. I’ve done a lot of things for her and she’s done a little for me here and there. The problem is that she doesn’t want to do anything for me because she’s had a bad experience in the past. Although she doesn’t want to do anything she’s all for having sex with me. We had our first time and it wasn’t the greatest. She said it hurt and eventually made me stop. She asked me to eat her out and I did so but it seemed like she didn’t want to do anything for me. She did but it was reluctantly and she seemed upset. When we talked about it I expressed how it kind of sucks for me that she gets things from me but I get to be left hanging all the time. I admit this probably wasn’t the best way to say it but I guess I’m a dumbass so I couldn’t think of anything better. She responded by saying I shouldn’t expect anything and that she can’t believe I had the audacity to ask for something after she “let me have sex with her” and that she “didn’t get anything out of it”. It just bothers me because I do things for her because I love her but I’m supposed to deal with it when she makes me stop and finish her off but not me. Am I in the wrong?

134,"My dad has discussed the idea of running a business with me. My gut is telling me that this is a terrible idea, but I just can't say ""no"", and I'll explain why.

I'm a methodical, cautious, by-the-book person who will agonize over laws, regs, paperwork, etiquette, etc. IOW, I'm an insufferable perfectionist. My dad, on the other hand, just cares about getting stuff done, and NOW. His personality can pretty much be described as Type-A on steroids, and he can get pretty ornery if he feels something has been taking longer than he feels is necessary.

We are also similar in many ways, a few of which relevant to this situation are our stubbornness and pride. Neither of us easily concede defeat or admit to being mistaken, and we've had bitter arguments due to neither side having the willingness to back down.

It seems like I've answered my own question - getting into business with him would be a terrible idea that's best avoided. If only it were that simple to just say ""no"", but this doesn't take into account our family dynamic.

My dad has said he's doing this all for me, to help me build up a business I can later run on my own that can provide me with a steady monthly income. Truth be told, I don't have a steady income at this point, and I'm not yet living on my own. If this business is successful and we amass a good number of loyal clients, we can earn a pretty decent income each month. 

Also, if I say no to his proposal, the relationship between me and both my parents will likely be strained permanently, because in their view it'll be another slap in their face as I will have refused yet another offer of theirs to help me get on my feet. (There's an example of my stubbornness and pride getting in the way.) Doing so in the past has rarely had positive results, so I'm willing to give this idea a shot. I already feel like I owe them a great deal, so I feel I owe this to them.

Our personalities being what they are, however, I'm afraid that disagreements will arise frequently over how to run the business, and that tensions will reach a breaking point in this household after which the business could fail and our relationship could suffer irreparable damage. My dad once declined to join his friends in their attempt to start a business in the US once they'd left China, and it turned out to be a wise decision, as all but one of them soon pursued other career paths once they realized the business idea wasn't going to work out. He knows from this experience that running a business with friends is likely to end in failure, but perhaps he feels differently about my situation since I'm family.

I'd greatly appreciate any advice you could give me, especially if it comes from personal experience.",03Jan2018,2
136,"I was a boring Christian nerd in high school. Then I was just boring in college. The Valedictorian of my class was not a nice person to me.

My mom keeps saying that she's so happy because of all the money and freedom she gets, she doesn't work but gets money..

My parents have all in control, they are cheap too, they spend money on cheapest food and never gave me much money, when i was younger, sometimes 20, after 2-3 months 5 to 20$, sometimes i didn't even get money, imagine that when you don't have a job and you live in a society where everyone has money...

Now i have a lot problems, i lost my license and i have to pay 980$..

142,"I'm a 19 yr. old college freshmen, majoring in statistics. I honestly don't know why I picked this major. I do like math (it was my best subject), but it doesn't particularly interest me, as does really nothing else. This is where I find my problem is. It's not just with college majors, it's everything. Nothing really gives me a drive/motivation for it, or makes me say ""I want to be really good at this and practice a bunch towards reaching that goal"". 

Take for instance when I was in band in high school. There were some kids who loved it a bunch and practiced all the time, but I never really felt the want to, even though I really enjoyed band. I play guitar now, but I don't have a drive to practice often. Same with skateboarding, working out, playing games, etc. These are things I'm relatively ""good"" at, but none of them give me a rush of excitement to get better.

I'm just not really sure what I want out of life right now. I know that I'm young and have a lot of time, but I figured I would have some things figured out by now at least. I do have plans for this upcoming semester to get a job and go to the gym more, which will hopefully do something for me.

143,"I love my job. I also really need it. 

All that said, about 10 months ago I almost quit, because I had to work next to this coworker.  We’ll call him Jeff. 

Anyway, I told my boss (let’s call him Will) that I simply couldn’t work beside Jeff anymore, because Jeff only plays on his cell phone or facebook (not even Reddit! 😝)... but that is not the worst part. The main reason I almost quit my job then is because Jeff eats all day. ALL. DAY.

It is almost comically, falsely loud, obnoxious crunching, slurping, chewing, smacking, and then to top it off, he makes moaning noises indicating that the food is apparently good. 

Anyway, Will is not a very bossy boss, and so he just separated us, because even after telling Jeff there is no eating at desks... Jeff still eats at the desk. Literally for 8 hours straight (Jeff is very overweight, in case anyone was wondering... no judgement, I only mention it because it’s not like he’s training for intense weightlifting or has intense hypoglycemia). 

Today I found out, due to a space issue at our office (we are moving, but not until the end of the year), I will be back beside Jeff. About 1 foot away. He sat next to my desk today and literally bashed my chair several times with his chair because we were so close.  I had to leave work early because I was losing my damn mind. 

I have an appointment to speak with my boss tomorrow, but how do I approach this? Will obviously knows I do not want to, nor do I feel I can work productively next to Jeff.  So what do I say? 

tl;dr: My coworker eats obnoxiously loud for literally 8 hours at work. I almost quit once because of this and my boss knows. Boss previously switched things up so I could have a suitable work environment, but space issues now force us together again. How do I approach my boss? ",03Jan2018,6
146,"I rent a room and use of shared space from a friend for a pretty high price for the area (I have put up with it because I'm living with people I trust and am friends with). 

I had a problem with heat before due to sunlight that my roommate basically told me to deal with myself. I did, but now a new problem has arisin. 

Now that it's winter the roommate leaves the heater on constantly. I mean litterally non-stop. It is set to keep the place at 68 degrees, but the temperature gauge is downstairs, and with the heat rising and my room being a sealed one (I have a cat that needs to stay in my room so the door cannot be left open and I also can't sleep with the door open) the heater is constantly pumping heat into my room. This makes it unbearable. I don't have a screen on the window and cannot afford one, and am worried about the cat getting though the screen. 

This combined with the fact that his dog has woken me up most mornings the last few weeks. I think I could deal with it, but the heat makes it difficult to sleep as it is so once I wake up the heat prevents me from getting back to sleep. 

I've been waiting on my rent check for last month to clear before talking to him, but now the it has I feel I need to. Problem is it's an old house so there's only the one temp gauge downstairs, and he loves his dog so I know muzzle or shock collar are out of the question. I'm just worried if I go to him without a suggestion than he's just gonna shrug his shoulders and tell me to deal with it, but at this point I'm losing sleep and I work hard hours as it is and am soon going to be working a full time, high stress job where I need full concentration.

So...any advice Reddit? I'd take anything on any of the issues at this point.

Now I love this chick like my sister, which is why I'm feeling conflicted. But something about our friendship has been off for a few months, especially when she got a boyfriend. She has said shitty things to me before. But I feel like my breaking point with her is when she, her boyfriend and my other male friend outed me from the closet as a lesbian because of her. I understand the situation was accidental, but now that 3 months have passed, it's been weird. Her bf asked her if I was a lesbian because my guy friend had feelings for me and they're great friends (her bf and my male friend). My best friend didn't say anything. She didn't deny it, nothing. So then her bf told my male friend, then he started forcefully questioning me about it, like he was owed an explanation for not liking him. But anyway, they kept this from me for months. I had no idea this was going on behind my back and found out suddenly. When I found out, no one even cared that I was upset because the moment already passed and they were over it because it happened way before they told me. I feel so ganged up on by all 3 of them. We did talk about the situation but I still can't get over it. 

Another thing happened between me and her is when I was feeling depressed about my looks (still do) and she told me that I was only average looking, nothing special. She even compared me to one of my friends. It made me feel like shit. 

I just want to move on from my high school friends. I don't know what to do. I want to dump her but at the same time I dont, mostly because I don't want to be alone and because i don't know if this is the right decision. I just feel so betrayed and upset. 

Another thing is that me and her haven't spoken in a month. She claims that she's busy but she's with her boyfriend going to the beach and shit. A text would be nice you know? I don't expect much. At all. What should I do? I'm lost.

151,"I have 2 jobs, one is a part-time warehouse job that I think has been particularly rough on my body. I've noticed that my wrist has been sore on and off for the past couple weeks. I notice it especially when I use the package scanner at work. At one point, when I was counting change in the register at my other job, I lost the ability to grip with my right hand for a minute out of nowhere and then it came back. From what I've read, it sounds like these are symptoms that lead up to carpal tunnel. To be fair, there's definitely repetitive hand movements at my other job, so maybe it's not all the fault of this one. Though, the other one, there's a bigger mixture of movements and more downtime, so I suspect this warehouse job is a bit more at fault.

Also, yesterday, when I was stacking boxes in a truck, I stretched up a little to put a box at the top of a stack and noticed a weird feeling in the groin/lower abdomen area. Wasn't really painful, just kinda tingly. I noticed when I got home that I had a slight, slight bump in the groin area, it was gone after I woke up. I definitely felt some slight pain in the area when I was lifting boxes the next day at work. It seems as if I'm putting myself at risk for a hernia, if I don't already have one.

What do you guys think? Should I quit? See a doctor and try to get excused for a week or two? I don't really need the money, my expenses are really low and I kinda just do it to fill my days before I figure out what I want to go back to school for. This job is definitely not worth any permanent damage or going through surgery for.",03Jan2018,4
152,"First of all - My life=stinking mess. I have no idea if this is the place to post such a thing but be warned it is a long and boring story. Ill try to keep it short and simple but I really do need an advice from someone who has been trough something similar.

So I moved to the US 3 years ago. First year all great. I was getting used to my work which is a ton of stress but its good money. Now I know ""work what you love"" but I have grown really fond of my work and I enjoy it to the bone, just not the people I work with. 2017 though totally different story. I worked for 11 months straight in a isolated area. Hard work did NOT pay off at the end. I ended up with 12k which is less than nothing for 11 months but hey. I was promised more money by the end of the year yet no one came trough. And it seems I won't get my money soon. I knew that was coming so I started working in the big city. Vegas. Its new to me and have not got used to this kind of work. But as all things you have to start from somewhere. It was going nice, then slow. I found a girlfriend spent my Christmas in LA. Everything perfect. Except she told me on the 1st of this year she cheated on me. Like we are dating for ONE MONTH for crying out loud. I'm used to those kind of relationships so I ended it pretty fast. I already sold some stuff just to keep me somewhat OK. I have a vehicle that I use for work. Im doing delivery here in the city. That is the only thing I have left here. ( I have no family in this country whatsoever.) This evening while I was doing delivery I man approached me and held a gun to my head for money. I gave him my last 20$. I explained what happened to my boss, and he told me to take several days off which I cannot afford. Im selling my car now, ebay,craigs,carmax even facebook. I already own money to my rent. The only choice I see and don't like is to go back to my previous job (the one I didn't get payed for) but at a different employer. I see no alternative to it.
I am doing my best. I really do. I work hard and fast. Im always kind to people but my life has been a total shit show for the past 2 years. Cliche, and i HATE it but I am starting to wonder why is this happening to Me. I am 23 years of age fyi. I know I am young and have a lot more shit to take trough my life but I don't know how much longer can I take all of this.
Long and boring as I promised. But I am searching for that 1 person that knows what I am blabbering about. Advice will be much appreciated. Have a great evening.",03Jan2018,2
153,"My boyfriend (the only person I've considered the love of my life) recently started renting out a room from a family with two little children. He(boyfriend) spends a lot of time with the little girl and its gotten to the point where she is completely obsessed with him. I expressed my concern to him that young girls are extremely impressionable and I was insecure that he was willing to devote so much time to her and willingly get her completely attached. I asked him to keep his distance and not to let her get attached because he is a 25 year old male and she is a young girl. He says that its not in his nature to be anything but nice and hes telling the truth. He's one of the kindest people I've ever met, but it makes me unconfortable to know he wants her to get completely attached(she already is to him more than to her father). He says he finds nothing wrong with her and him being attached with one another and expressed to her parents that he(my bf) will always be there for that little girl for the rest of her life. This was after a month of meeting them.

Its not my business to control my partners life, but once being a little girl myself I know how i felt when older non-family males payed attention to me. If anyone had acted the way my bf treats that little girl i would have completely fallen for them amongst other feelings. In that regards i'm completely uncomfortable with my bf and that little girls relationship..he even says that he feels a connection with her..

Recently he came to me and said that sometimes when they're playing she touches herself sexually (hes already told her parents).The little girl has also expressed to him that she loves him. He discourages her when she does that and tries changing the activity, but refuses to stop playing with her. At this point she is more attached to him that anyone else and i belive its all my bfs doing because hes opened himself up to her that way.

I do not think anything is wrong with the little girl and she is exploring herself at this age, but I believe my boyfriend should stop allowing them to become so close. We've been fighting over it for months and i gave him an ultimatum(never a good idea) to which he did not choose us.

I need someone to speak some sense into me because there is nothing thats driven me crazier than this situation. I wish someone would tell me that its all in my head and that its harmless but i truly do not view it that way. I know my bf would never do anything to the girl but I fear that the relationship between them will become really unhealthy. I feel it already is because no little girl should be this attached to a 25 year old man and its the adults responsibilty to make sure that it does not happen. I belive my boyfriend has good intentions, but does not always take reponsible actions...and i think the responsible thing to do is be kind to her and still break off ties gently. He will never do it he tells me because he doesn't agree with me and is willing to risk our relationship over it.

Thank you for reading my rant. I want to stay with my boyfriend as i do believe he is the love of my life, but our relationship will not continue if he continues to willingly become so attached to her.",03Jan2018,1

164,"I'm 25 years old. My mother passed away from brain cancer 6 years ago. I spent my whole teenage years taking care of my siblings and her. When she passed, I started to ''follow my dreams'' and studied art, which I was (and still am) very passionate about. I spent the last 6 years in instability and somewhat lonely. People close to me were thinking I was weird from dealing my grief, but turns out I ended up a few time in the psych for a reason. I was living with a severy mood disorder and constant hallucinations. I dropped out of art school last year because I got too sick and couldn't finish my bachelor after years of struggling. Got diagnosed with bipolar disorder rapid cycling and schizophrenia. I also realized I was a transgender man (I'm now transitioning and that is the one thing that seems to go smoothly at the moment), but I now see my chance of being employed again as very slim.  I'm now on disability welfare in Canada (have been for 4 months now). 

At first, I taught it would give me sometimes to get back on my feet and get stable again after a long time of trying to keep up. Do some stuff for myself and learn to enjoy things again. Take a few months/years. Start doing art again, maybe make a website for portfolio or something. The money is not much but I grew up poor and resourceful enough to live off of not much.

With my condition, maintaining a job is something that has been very difficult and would stress me out so much even though I used to be somewhat successful for my age and very career driven. I lost everything when my symptoms started showing up. I recently got my driver's license revoke because of my diagnosis. I also can't get out of the province I'm in. I'm slowly seeing my right fleeing away. 

On an happier note, I recently fell in love with The One™. We've been dating for half a year. I feel like the luckiest person in the world around them and we've been talking seriously about the future. They are immigrating from Europe and their visa is coming to an end in a few months. We spoke about getting married to be together and stay here, maybe start a family someday. It's pretty much the only option we have if we don't want to be separated by a whole ocean in a few months. I love them and would be utterly happy to get married and spend the rest of my life with such a wonderful spouse.

The trick is, if I get married to them, I would lose my welfare and they would have to be financially responsible of me. We barely make it as it is with their minimum-wage contractual/freelance salary and my welfare. I know that living off their salary would destroy everything between us from the stress and I would have no dignity for myself. I don't know what to do. It's either spending my life alone away from my lover as a poor sad dude, or find a way of earning cash that is sustainable and won't aggravate my symptoms from the stress or simply soul crush me into oblivion.

Here's a list of stuff I've looked into :
-Getting a subvention to work from home and start a business as a freelance (I used to do graphic design, and I would like to learn web design but idk how to make that happen right now).
-Going to a reinsertion program and learn to fix computers. (an interest but scared I'm not bright enough).
-Start a small shop for crafty stuff (always was a dream, but no idea how to get the fund to start a business in my situation tbh). 

I'm just at that point where I feel like I'll never be a ''complete'' person. I've spend most of my life in a waiting room anxiously recaping my life to explain what's wrong with me to some authority figure. I want to get over this and put the energy I know I have in me to build something for me and for us. My experience in life made me able to prove to myself that I know I'm a fighter and will find a way to not lose them, but damn I'm... exhausted from the constant instability.

165,"Hello Readers!

Im a male 23, 24 next month (My age is important) and im currenly in a very happy long term relationship (over 2 years).
In the past 6 months i was diagnosed with moderate depression, which i am currently taking pills for, however before i took pills and long before i was diagnosed ive been fidgity, unsettled and anxious however the tablets amplify these feelings.

Now ive tried a number of things to help and not much helps, when I game or paint ( which i do often) it isnt that bad but i still cant control it!

Now to the actual Question at hand!
Ive smoked a few cigs over the 6 months not that many i could count them on both hands, and that seemed to have helped me settle even a few hours after sometimes a whole day!
I used to be a smoker for a about 2 years from the ages of 17 (Police Sirens are coming) till maybe 19 i cant remeber, hence why i tried Cigs again.
However i have this one friend who used to smoke around the same time as me and for longer, he has now gotten into Vaping (i say now more like 2 years ago) and ive done research and asked him and both have come up saying its way way healthier tastes good and builds a habit ( the hand to mouth i guess) which can feel comforting. 
So i have tried it a few times with nicotine and without and they feel much better the action and the tastes seem to help me so much it even takes my hunger for junk food away too! and i would to continue and see how to goes even if its for a few months!

There is a drawback though......My Girlfriend cannot stand smoking of anykind she thinks its foul, unattractive and unhealthy ( shes right its not healthy) 
She hates vaping too just as much even with friends of ours and research showing her thats its not close to being as bad a Cigs and has helped anxious people and people with similar habits to me!

Im desperate to do it to see if it helps. Ive told her just a few months and if it doesnt help ill stop if it does ill reduce the amount i do it. 
Ive promised her i wont do it around her and i would get fruity ones for the smell.
But shes far too stubborn and so opinionated that i cant get a word in.
I know any form of smoking is bad btw but honestly nothing has helped near as much as this!

Is there anyway i can convince her? Should i do it secretly? (im at work a lot) 
Should i just start and suffer the consequences?

P.s she wants a cat ( we arnt aloud pets in the flat yet i still have Chameleon from my old house) and i cant say yes due to the no pet rule. I was thinking of offering her a compromise.
We adopt a cat and I can vape? 
Or is that too much to ask?

Any advice would be appreciated this has been on my mind for several months now! 
Thank you so much guys! (Sorry for the Extra long text!)

I've even looked for courses I could take in the spring at my previous school. When my parents first told me that if I didn't enjoy being here we could always go back to Finland, but when I told them a few months ago and brought the going back subject up they tried to steer the conversation away from it. My mum is an executive for a large company and has offices in England and in Finland, so she spends half of her time back home anyways, and my dad runs a business located in Helsinki from here.

173,"Hey Reddit,

So, I'm 27, and my social life has taken a real hit in the three years since I decided I'd like to work freelance and have the freedom to travel whenever I want and work at hours that suit me.

However, I've become increasingly isolated due to this decision, because without the actual impetus and I guess ""forced"" socializing of office work, I find myself, as a natural introvert and quite a shy guy, not taking any steps to build a social life. 

It's like nobody really knows me, and I only have one friend, who I just drink with and that's it. This has led to overwhelming feelings of isolation and a sense that it's too late for me to change and build a good social life.

I'm wondering if perhaps it would be better to get back into office work. I worked in an office for a year after graduation. I enjoyed the social aspect at times, but the work itself was dull and tedious, the daily commute was annoying, and I always felt a sense of dread about meetings, given my social anxiety.

So, would it be better for me to get back into office work? Or is there a wider problem here that requires fixing regardless of the type of work arrangement I have? ",03Jan2018,11
175,"


People have offered me stuff. I have spent hours asking important questions.  I have promised things.  I have offered services.  I have seeked improvement for my own life, legal advice, etc, it's all still relevant, they were asked less than 8 months ago.  I have demonstrated curiosity, and am still genuinely curious about them. Some were tech support questions too.  Also, if I respond to ones several months ago, there's a much much higher chance I won't get a reply.

Most important ones are reddit ones.

A legal situation, mattress situation, work issues, and a friend dying set me back.  I just let it pile up.  Chances are, 700/2000 of the reddit messages are things ive read just by skimming through  posts of mine that blew up that have a lot of comments.  The posts I've submitted took a lot of time and effort at times.  If I ignore all that, I throw hundreds of hours of effort away.  If I ignore them, I'll feel cheated by society for taking up so much time to not allow me to get to them. (my court situation was ultimate bs, etc etc).  Never before have I gotten behind like this.

I'm thinking of giving myself 12 hours max (dedicating a free day) or, perhaps broken up in 2 days, to **skim** through all the messages, and pull out the most important ones, and only respond to, at most, 1.5% of them. I think it'll take me 6 hours alone with my computer *just to open the tabs alone*, idk.  So what would you do?  What should I do?

I have spent 4-5 hours going thru 50 messages before -_-

**This is not the only thing I am behind on.**  I am behind on life, my car needs repairs, I have to get community service done, I'm doing various govt applications, and life seriously just gets in the way almost daily. I also put off all goals/hobbies etc off during by busiest time which lasted 11 months(!)
 
Part of me feels I did the hard part already - typing it all up, organising.  Now the fun/easy/beneficial part comes along - the readback.  I invested 100 hours, i've got 12 left to go.  But even with 12 hours I may only get to 35% of the messages, barely skimming them, and get far behind on life.

Any questions? Ask.













To anyone looking at my reddit history to see the type of questions I've asked:

I've actually asked more useless ones as of recent.  Further back, they are more important, but not all.

I also have 500 youutbe notifications, but I will probbaly skim through those for only 2 hours, cherry picking the best ones.

179,"I've almost reached a year in my current entry-level editorial role.

The company publishes finance magazines, and in my current capacity I mainly just edit other people's contributions and write introduction and bylines for the reports.

It's not very stimulating and very repetitious. I want to be a writer, not an editor. I took this job after a long stint of unemployment; I previously wrote educational content for a world-leading publisher for their Chinese market (Unfortunately I had to leave this role after just 9 months for personal reasons), and now I just edit stuff.

I was given the chance to write a piece for one of the magazines recently, about captive insurance companies in Hawaii.

I did so but found it very hard -- maybe it's just me, but I never expected to wind up in financial writing, and even after this time I don't think I understand it especially well.

Herein lies the issue that I'd like some advice about.

In the end I did okay and the article was published. It felt good; however, I'm reticent to offer to do more of this work because I don't see myself working in this line of writing work -- I'd much rather be doing something creative; in my free time I enjoy writing fiction and film reviews, so that's more the direction I'd somehow like to go in next. I don't really know what that creative thing is, but I don't see my future in writing about finance.

Am I being lazy by not striving to do more in this current role?

I feel somewhat guilty for not putting myself forward for more writing work. But I can't stand doing this kind of writing and to be honest I have just been coasting in the role until I hit one year.

I suppose what I'm saying is that I don't feel any need to do more and pressure myself more for the same crappy pay. I'm almost at a year and know that, to be happy, I need to land a role which is a better fit for me.

I've seen new reporters come into the company since I've worked here, and they seem to take to it very well and enjoy the industry and so on.

I've tried to and I simply don't.

And trying to do writing that I may not be to do properly fills me with anxiety, and besides, I'm intending to begin looking for a new role very soon.

Finally, I don't want to get too far into doing something I don't enjoy because I don't want it to impact the chances to get into a funner/more suitable line of writing-related work in future.

Am I being unambitious, or thinking wrongly about my situation? I'm honestly just being realistic and don't want to invest more in something I don't feel I'm a good fit for and have really begun to dislike.

So my mom lost her job a few months ago and at 72 she already had spent her retirement earlier in life due to a medical situation. I let her move into my 4 bedroom house into the finished basement. The girlfriend was not happy about this and it’s meant to only be temporary. 

Three days in and a big argument happened last night w lots of name calling on my moms part at my gf. I stood up for her but my mom refuses to apologize. 

My mom suffers from being in abusive relationships all her life, has some mental issues. My girlfriend did attack her first verbally and has also called her names. 

Not sure how to deescalate the situation - obviously my mom needs to find a new place asap but I’m struggling to see the point of a relationship with my gf long term (we’ve been together 2 years) if she is ok w my mom being homeless (told me so). 

Right now I’m hoping everyone cools off and so far they’re trying to ignore each other. 

Help!

181,"So i’ll just start from the beginning, my dad is divorced and that’s fine and all but he’s a very lonely person and relies on me and my brother to cope with that, so pretty much he likes hanging out with us and all which is normal for a parent but it sucks sometimes because when we don’t want to hang out/do something for him he gets mad and throws a fit about it. He tells me sometimes that i never wanna hang out with him anymore and all he does is provide for us and that we never do anything to reciprocate and kind of guilt trips me to doing stuff with him. So that’s kind of a backstory of how he acts. So you might be saying well why did you tell me that, it’s because recently my dad told me that when i get older and move out  and get a job  he’s gonna quit his job and move in with me, he called me his “retirement plan” so i don’t think that’s quite out of the ordinary (but i don’t really know it might be really weird) but the thing is he wants to move in like right after i move out like he really thinks i’m ganna live with him forever. He even said “yeah even if you get a crappy fast food job i’ll get a job and we’ll get a tiny apartment or something.” Please do tell me if i’m being selfish but i think he’s not being logical, like any teenager when i move out i wanna live on my own and live whatever life i live out and kind of be “set free” if you will. But he wants me to just live with him forever. And he seems to not let that idea go. We recently talked about kids and i said “oh i don’t like kids that much but i wouldn’t mind if i were like a grand parent or something so i only get the good times with the kid not the horrible annoying times.” And he pretty much said that i could get that and he would just move in and kind of be like a nanny. I understand if i was super rich and had like some tiny house in the backyard like some people do but no. He just wants to move in right away and i’ll just be stuck with him forever. I talked to my mom about it and she also thinks it’s ridiculous and we both agreed that it’s not about retirement, it’s about that he’s just lonely and doesn’t want his kids to move out and leave him.  So sorry if this post is a mess but could you guys give me advice on how to respectfully tell him that i don’t want that situation? Thanks.",03Jan2018,5

He has been unable to pay rent due in part to bad choices he's made plus some unfortunate circumstances. He knows this. He lives at home with his parents so his office has been a source of freedom to get his work done in a focused place. He has one other person who sub-rents from him, if he's evicted they will be too.

He has deep anxiety and has sought treatment for it with minimal success. We had a good talk last night about him reaching out when he needs extra support (I also promised to check in on a deeper level when I pick up on signs and just in general). He reached out this morning with the above information. I'm not in a position to help financially (he wouldn't take it even if I was) but I'm there for him emotionally. 

Usually I'm good at offering support and providing him with the extra advice or information he needs. I'm currently at a loss. I want to help his emotional state as best as I can but I'm not sure how to do that aside from telling him it will be okay. Which is a bit overplayed.

211,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub. Please point me in the right direction if that''s the case. 

I'm f28, independent, live a few states away. My mom is 58.

 Basic back story-- My mom got divorced from my step dad, who screwed her over financially and emotionally, over 10 years ago and hasn't dated since. She has been very lonely and due to her own anxieties has spent the last decade not putting any effort into meeting new people.
 Finally, this past October she gave in and tried online dating. She went on a couple of mediocre dates but her 3rd date was with a guy she liked pretty well. 

I haven't met him (early 60's) personally, but he seems nice and my mom seems to like him. However, he is being REALLY insistent on marriage. 

My mom is a push over. Truly, she doesn't know how to say NO to people, so while she hadn't directly told him ""no"" she has told him repeatedly that she'd rather wait. Well, on new year's he officially asked her and she agreed. Now he wants to get married by ASAP (March). 

He seems to adore her and she likes him a lot, too. However, up until this point she has expressed a lot of doubts to me (in the typical ""getting to know someone, and maybe we're not the perfect fit"" kind of way), yet she still agreed. 

Best case scenario-- he's a good guy that loves my mom and is in a rush to marry because he loves her. 

Mild case scenario-- my mom is a catch (lack of spine/confidence aside, she truly is. She is beautiful, educated, kind, intelligent, full package), so he wants to make sure to not let her get away. 

Worst case scenario-- he's controlling and a con artist.

I feel that even at best case scenario, nobody should be rushing into marriage if they're not certain. My mom has told him repeatedly that she would rather wait but he has insisted. His excuse is that because he was a chappel (not actively), it''s the ""right thing to do"" .... my mom is also religious but not quite to that extent. I told her she should prioritize her own happiness, not someone else's religious beliefs. 

I'm not even recommending that she stop seeing this guy, but there is no reason that they should be rushing and the fact that he has ignored her preference to take things slow and has been so persistent makes me afraid for her. It doesn't seem normal to me. 

I'd like help in how to advice my mom to slow down without pushing her away (sometimes i lean too hard in the tough love category). 
She says she's tiered of being alone for over a decade, but is ignoring the part that the second she actually put effort into dating she was finding interested candidates left and right. Honestly, she's just lazy (probably anxiety, actually) about meeting new people. 

I just don't know what to do. I want her to feel supported by me, but I can't just pretend that I think she's doing the right thing.

Few years ago my parents bought a big house with the thought that we all would live there together. Call my parents delusional or naive, they did not expect both of my brothers  to move out when they turned 18. It really bothers them to this moment, I can feel it, they are devastated but they won't talk about it. Mom and dad are around 48-51. 

When I was done with high school at the age of 19 (I am from Europe) I wanted to move to a different city, but I didn't. Reason?
My parents. Me moving out would completely destroy them. I know it would, because of the situation in the house. They were really happy that  I still stayed with them and were extremely nice to me only to keep me by their side.  They were always kind of bitchy when we were younger. (this is why my brothers moved so early because they wanted finally peace) 
So from age 19 to 21 I was working in a shitty job instead of pursuing college. I did make my own cash, mom and dad did not want me to pay a rent, or anything. They said I don't need to pay for anything, they are just happy to have me around. 
It did not really bother me to have such lifestyle, because I am not really an ambitious person.:( 
This whole situation made me very lazy, even though I had a job. 
I did not mature in any way but they did not realize, and maybe did not care...  
My parents are not physically or mentally sick, I am not a nanny. 

When I was 21 I decided to go live by myself even though it really hurt my parents. I did go to college but I eventually dropped out. So I lived of my savings doing pretty much nothing, except for working out. When I was 22 I pursued college again in a different city and dropped out again.. fuck my life. I don't know why I am even trying, I don't think I am smart and ambitious enough. Anyways, I am in a situation where I have no idea what to do. 

I came back to live with my parents 2 weeks ago and I've been working here. The worst part is they don't really give a damn that I failed in college, on the contrary they are happy because now I am back with them. Fuck, I can't live like this anymore.

She has borrowed about $17000 from my grandmother, $2000 from me, and $2000 from my sister. She now wants another $2000.

231,"So, A person I care about asked me something and I didn't get much details but here is how it went: 
He has 10 days to do something that isn't in his power and it might take more than 10 days. So he might risk the thing he wants to do.
There is another option, he can do the thing he wants but the procedure he won't like but the results will be positive 100%.

-HE HAS TO DO THIS.
-It needs to be done in 10 days (now 9)
-It will change his life

Here is what I told him; 
He should go with the 100% method even though it is bad and he won't like it, there is bad and worse so if he doesn't do this thing thats worse than the bad procedure he doesn't like.
It's like choosing between killing all humans or your brother. You have to kill your brother (you wont like it) but it's better than killing everyone.

He has to make a decision between fast and risky or bad and sure. Which one should he make?",03Jan2018,2

“I value my privacy, you make me uncomfortable.”

238,"Hello,

I want to let this out of me once and for all, I would appreciate some honest advices on how I should proceed.

I am a 25M. My mom and dad never had a good and stable relationship. I would like to mention that my dad has always been an alcoholic and he was not coming home at night, but staying at all kinds of places and showing up here and there, drunk. Those visits would often happen at around 10/11pm, i.e. when the time regular people would go to bed. Since he was always drunk, these were inevitably going to start a fight, where my mom and him would argue and etc.

Since very little kid I can say I have been very close with mom. Since dad was always drunk, she would take me to sleep with her - sleeping in the same bed. As a young child I never thought twice about that, but growing up and looking back I realize this was more of a manipulative move, where she used me as a way to protect herself from my dad. I mean, what mother would do that - be ready to make her child well aware of her failed marriage and even use the kid as a way to avoid getting in fights. She never missed an opportunity to explain what a moron my father is and how tough it is for her to raise me and my older brother, while he never helped financially or in any other way.

I would like to mention that this is all true - she really did raise both of us and is the one who cared for us, with the great help of her parents - my grandparents, who I can say I would always remember as the true parents. But it is just lately that I have come to realize how much she has also manipulated me and I begin to question a lot of things.

It's been like 10 years now that we managed to finally push my dad away - he no longers attempts to contact us in any way. They are still married and while he is now living with someone, my mom is still single. 

In fact, she lost her job like 6 years ago and for this period she was employed only for about a year. We live in a small town and she basically has no working options around. She is not going for months, always stays home, watching TV and browsing thw net, while chain smoking. She has not visited a hair dresser or bought clothes in years. She does not seem depressed, i.e. she is even joking and stuff. It looks like she is completely happy with her state - completely neglecting her appearance and relying solely on me to support her, both emotionally abd financially. At this point, she is so alone, that I am literally the only person she is in contact with - for months.

I know that a lot of you would tell me to just talk with her, but ppl who have in this position know how this is one of the hardest things to discuss with a parent. I love my mom and will never leave her knowing she is in tough situation, but thw problem is that besides working on my job, the rest of my time is focused on spending time with her, doing groceries and etc. Besides this, I feel awful seeing how my mother has turned her life into one huge nothing - she literally does absolutely bothing besides smoking and browsing the web.

I need advice, Reddit, and I need it badly. Please, give me idea on how I can yalk this with my mom. My older brother has been licing away and he just bought a house with his girlfriend, so he will not help me in any way. It is another story, but he is quite selfish as well. So it's ne who is left trying to help mom get back to reallity and live her life again.

Please, give me some idea how I can brought this up and ezplain her that this is not normal. I can suggest her that in order to find a job, we can move to a bigger city, where I will pay the bills until she gets on her feet - as long as this may take. I need to find a way to explain her that while I do not mind helping her and support her, I need to live my life too and stop worrying about her. She is 54 yo, I am 25.

I am really looking forward to serious advice and seek help from people that have had similar experiences with their parents.

241,"I almost certainly have ADD. My therapist, a family friend whose child has it, and others agree with that, along with the fact that the symptoms all line up. I posed this to my mom, as it's been really negatively affecting my schoolwork and social life. All I asked was to see a doctor to get diagnosed and a prescription. Most people would agree, because they want to help their children. However, my mom just thinks I'm lazy, not just as a result of the ADD. I don't think she thinks the disorder is real. She claims it's just regular attention difficulties caused by me being on electronics for a large portion of my day. She thinks she can correct it by taking away all my devices, even though I need them for school, and changing my diet to exclude all sugar and gluten and replace it with vitamins. She is *extremely* anti-medicine, to the border of being anti-vaccine. For context of what she's like, I never watched TV until I was in 8th grade, all my food is organic and non-GMO, and I never get flu shots or the H1N1 or HPV vaccine. I got others, but not those. She is convinced going on meds to control the disorder will destroy my life, despite the fact that probably the opposite is true. I don't think I'll graduate high school with as low of a GPA as I currently have if it goes on untreated. Now *that* would be destructive. But she thinks that I am just lazy. A lazy person wouldn't allow themselves to be failing as I am. I don't know what to do.

243,"Throw away account for reasons.

My wife used to love to write fanfiction. She was pretty good at it...and then she hit a huge writing block and quit for a few years. 

She wants to get back to it but struggles with it and I can tell its frustrating her. I asked her what I could do to do help and she said she needs an outsider, not me. The reason being she says I'll probably just say it's all good when it's not. (Ok, true) 

She used to have some ""writing buddies"" online but has been out of touch with them for a long time. (She's been doing this since AIM was a new and awesome thing, ok)

I offered to be her ""writing buddy"" but she said its more complicated than that. She needs to bounce ideas off someone and have someone beta read for her. (I'm not really good with this, I admit)

Anyway, short of tracking down old writing buddies, are there any subs I could rec her? (She's a Redditor, too...but doesn't read this sub)

How about a professional writing buddy? I mean, I'm willing to pay something if it will help her. Heck, even if some writers have some ideas to throw at her to get over the ""block.""

244,"So to get straight to the point, I have struggled a lot since puberty with, well, everything in life in general. Socially / emotionally kind of fucked, dont really want to explain the details here. 
Anyway, I have almost no (close) friends, have not ever had a relationship, that kind of good stuff.
The only good thing I guess rn is that I nearly have a bachelors degree. The downside is that it took me a really long time to get it, AND it is not the bachelor I started out in. I started out in a Engineering degree, almost but not quite Electrical Engineering (lets say 85% EE), and I got bogged down after about 1-1.5 years. The first year I did not do all that badly (though the important major subjects I failed, but I still got an average amount of credits). The second year I did worse but still not bad enough to convincingly say I should quit. The third year I failed extremely hard and basically gave up. After that I switched to a different major which you could say is Engineering ""lite"". I also switched because in the last semester I took 4 classes, of which 3 were extremely tough, got extremely stressed overwhelmed, and thus failed them all. 
I am happy that at least I almost got a degree now. But I can't really say Im passionate about what I do now. So I do not really want to do a masters degree in this field.
Could not really say that about the first major I did either. But I still find it hard to decide if that was because I am fucked as a person, or because I did not put in enough effort, or because I truly dislike the material/subject. Now I dont know what to do. Starting all over again is not an option. I can finish the first degree but I doubt I want to do the masters degree that fits with that degree. Very stressed about all this shit.

Background on my interests: been a computer nerd since very young age. Loved it. Love hardware and software. Knew very early on how to build a computer and all that stuff. At the same time learned about how to install an OS, repartition, all that stuff and really liked it. I just developed from there. Dabbled in overclocking and other stuff involving ""tweaking"". Love all of that too. Never really did any programming though. Only started doing that in college. I kind of like it but dont love it. 
I am passionate about certain music. Puberty / adolescence were awful for me. Had terrible self esteeem issues (still to a certain degree) and it fucked my life up. Shitty consequences like Social Anxiety and probably some depression too. When I most needed I did not get the help I needed. Also, those who could have helped me did not or did not understand it.
So, I got into music like Nine Inch Nails, and it has become an integral part of myself. Trent Reznor is the first person to truly make me feel less alone and genuinely seems to be someone I have important things in common with. I love that feeling. Later I found the works of MJK. I like a lot of that too. Celldweller is another good one. I like to really dig deep into the music and especially also the artists behind the music, and what makes them tick. On the other hand, I find it hard to relate on a deep level with most other human beings in my life. These people make me feel somewhat more sane, without them I would feel even more alone.
There is probably more I could write about this but I think it gets the point across.

I also like a bit of photography (tend to go through phases with that) and I like some films / series a lot. 

I like cars a lot too. I am lucky enough to own a decent one. 

Finally I like doing some sports and just general exercise. I quite like running too especially when you get runners high (sometimes I get all these big vision of ambition success which then fade quickly after).

251,"I am in a happy relationship that is great in terms of chemistry. We are in love and have been for 4 years. We are both 26. There is no problem right now. But I forsee it in the future and want to resolve it now.

My dilemma is that I am not getting a good gut feeling about the future. My gf wants some sort of assurance of commitment. When I think of getting married and having kids I feel hesitation. I see this as a red flag and want to speak to a professional. But before I do go talk to someone, I wanted to get some feedback anonymously so that I can come into that conversation better prepared.

1) I don't know if I want kids. I have very demanding hobbies that require me to practice intensely every day. I can't imagine this would make a great husband or father material especially considering my job is also demanding in terms of time. I don't see myself slowing down and being the kind of person who can just come home, do chores and put the kids to bed. Rinse and repeat. At least in my current state this sounds like the end of all that matters to me outside of the relationship. 

I realize this is not that big of an issue. Ultimately if I am happy I can't see this one really being a kicker. But right now the major issue is not wanting to make my life about anyone besides me and her. As selfish as that sounds. I don't know if that will change as I grow older.

2) I'm not sure I'm attracted her in the right way that is fair to her. I absolutely love her. I find her hilarious, entertaining, highly intelligent and thoughtful. Responsible and above all, a best friend. I came into the relationship knowing all of this with the caveat that I was physically attracted to her but not as much as I was attracted by the chemistry between us. And that is perfectly OK for me. Yes, she is pretty but I think she isn't really my ""type"" in the physical sense. This is fine because the time with her is so amazing that I forget about that and find myself having a great time whenever I'm with her. I'm happy. But I also feel there is something missing. But looking at all relationships, I do think this happens to all of them eventually. So in a sense, nobody has this after 4 years anyways? I ask because I don't know the answer.

3) She has depression. This is something that comes up a lot and I never know when it will strike. I am totally OK with this. But when I think about taking the relationship to the next level (I.E. living together, kids) I worry that I will be biting off more than I can chew. I am not depressive nor do I have anything that will bring more balance to the situation. I often feel that I do have to absorb a lot of negativity on some days. And I am a mentally strong enough person that this hasn't been an issue. What she has is relatively minor. So days and weeks can often go by without episodes. But it is worth noting.

To conclude, I am quite happy. Right now, where I am in my life, she is exactly what I want. Nothing more, nothing less. I love her. But the looming reality is that I have to be thinking about the future. I don't know what to do. And I don't know how to make a decision about something that I am so obviously biased about. Any advice here would be greatly appreciated.

Now, SSDI isn't included on FAFSA and doesn't affect financial aid unless it's high enough to be taxed, which mine was definitely not. I even checked with FAFSA before about including it and they said not to. 

But I was looking through my documents from last year and noticed on my financial aid verification (this was my first time having it done) they wanted W2s and 1099s. Again, the money detailed in my SSA 1099 wasn't counted as income for FAFSA or tax reasons, so I must have not have thought about it before because when I looked at what I submitted last year, it wasn't included.

260,"Prepare for a somewhat lenghty wall of text.

So my first real girlfriend and I broke up a month ago today, after a two and a half years of being together. During those two years, she would lie, I would get upset when I found out, and despite my attempts to persuade her otherwise, she kept lying to try and put a bandaid on it. This left me with severe trust issues and amplified my paranoia. However, we were good friends, and rather stupidly so, agreed to stay best friends after the breakup. Both of the two days directly after we broke up, she was hanging out with my one of my best friends, one on one, alone. They were friends before we started dating, and they drifted apart, then started being friends again. This made the process much more difficult as it was now glued into my mind there was something going on between them.  

They hang out all the time, she often lies about when she does, and in general, she treats him far better as just friends than she treated me in the relationship. Most rules she had with me in our relationship dont apply with him. I don't want her back, the past month has opened my eyes to how awful of a partner she is, but I just want to stay friends with her and for her to be honest with me. I can't even cut her out of my life either, because she is in my friend group, and our schedules are very similar at our college. But the problem is, due to those trust issues mentioned earlier, I cant stop being jealous about it. No matter how much I try to stop being jealous and fill my mind with other things to think about, it keeps coming back like a pervasive thought I cant get rid of. And since I tend to be upfront about my problems, I tell them about this and it just makes things worse. But I cant get over it, no matter how much I have tried to out of sheer willpower the past month.  I just want this to be over, and for me to be able to stop freaking out over what everyone tells me is nothing.

Well, back in November, my parents came down to spend a night &amp; they noticed there was a terrible draft coming from our living room windows. We put in a request to have it checked and fixed. We could all tell, our windows, were not installed and sealed properly (There are several little holes letting in cold air and it's been zero at night lately or in the negatives). The sides of the frame are falling apart in all our windows -- including our bedroom. 

The maintenance man sealed off some small parts but that literally did nothing. We keep asking to have it fixed properly (which we have a paper trail of) but everytime, we get told things like ""it's fine"" or ""they're metal frame windows"". My parents have metal frame windows in their 150 year old house and never once had any of the issues we are having. 

Well, two days ago, I noticed it was colder than usual in our home and I noticed  ice inside of the window. Not just a little but a lot. All six of our windows on the bottom are covered in ice. Our electric bill has gone up trying to stay warm with or space heaters, only to have our electric bill more than double.

I have a friend who is about fifteen years older than I am. I am in my mid-twenties, she is in her late thirties. We met when I was living abroad. I’ve since moved back home and she stayed there, so our only means of communication are through technology. We text, email and skype, but since we met two and a half years ago we’ve traveled together and I’ve stayed at her place and her in mine etc We have amazing conversations and she gives me incredible advice on life seeing as she’s older and I basically love her like a sister. 
She has confessed to me that she doesn’t have pretty much any friends and is awful at keeping touch even with family. She makes it seem like her social life was basically her boyfriend before I came along (who is a wonderful man with whom I get along famously.) She is also of a different generation and hates technology. 

Here’s my problem: I have serious abandonment issues from being ghosted by a another longtime close friend while suffering from anxiety and OCD. I am in treatment now and in therapy but it’s still traumatic to me. 
The friend I’m talking about in this post is NOT big on texting or communicating. She takes 24-60 hours to answer any of my texts and, while she is receptive to my conversations, she NEVER takes the initiative to start a conversation with me, only I do.  

My question is: Am I being an idiot for thinking she wants to be my friend but is simply not prone to texting/being social? I’m afraid of kidding myself into staying in a “friendship” that only exists in my head. 
And regardless of this whole thing, does anyone have any advice for dealing with abandonment issues? 

Thanks a million, you guys! Looking forward to your responses 💜",03Jan2018,0

We have never been evicted from any place before as we are good tenants and respectable neighbors. I should mention that since moving here, we have had several issues with neighbors in the forms of parking and noise wise as well; the other tenants are just rude to say the least. But no matter, we are not quick to complain. 

Just this morning I received a 10-day notice for non-compliance VIA EMAIL, stating that several other tenants report marijuana smells coming from our unit. WE DO NOT SMOKE. The property management has not been out to verify or inspect anything. They literally took our neighbors words of accusation as the truth and have now fined us $500 due with February's rent. We are going on a trip next month and this is NOT ideal nor do I find it fair that they are willing to charge us without so much as even coming to see for themselves if any of this is true.

12 years later we still have separate accounts. Over the years the gap between what he makes and what I make has grown wider. This is just because of our fields. I make almost twice as much as he does. 

He mentions all the time that his money all goes to bills and then I pay the rest if there is anything left. The fact is I pay the mortgage, his car, my student loans and the church out of my first check. He goes through the mail and gives me bills to pay and I pay them. 

I put $700 towards saving every month and the savings account is only in my name for no reason other than I opened it. I pay the big bills like our son’s private school tuition. 

In the past I have referred to myself as the breadwinner which is extremely offensive to my husband I know now. He keeps bringing that up and how he doesn’t want me to hold money over his head. 

I suggested a joint account for bills where we both put 80% in but he said no. He wants to continue to use all his money for bills to contribute equally.

Hi guys,

I am currently struggling with a major life decision at 30 and am not sure what to do. I have lived in Manhattan for the past 9 years working in finance. I recently received a job offer in Pittsburgh where my parents live, to work in a strategy role for a large retailer. I had applied to a few roles there as I wanted to have options to be closer to my aging parents who live alone. Being home would make them infinitely happier and I can also help out with our family business. The offer pays less obviously than what I am making in NYC, but is very generous for Pittsburgh. The job would also be substantially less stressful and way better hours. I am scared to leave New York however, as all my friends are here, its highly accessible for my dog, I own my apartment, and I truly love the city. I am also a little hesitant to leave finance for retail. On the other hand, I feel like I would definitely regret not taking the opportunity to be closer to my parents while I still have the chance. Pittsburgh has grown a lot as a city and definitely has a younger population now, but I worry if I will be able to recreate a social network at 30, especially being single. I know that I will be able to save a whole lot more there, so financially it is probably a good decision. When I try and rationalize it, I think what I irrationally want is to be there during the week and back in New York on the weekends- While it's only a one hour flight, I know that is unreasonable and I should probably go into it with the intent of being all in on living there. I don't plan on ever selling my home in NYC as I always want a property in the city, but I worry I will end up coming back more often than I should.

Any advice? Thank you in advance all.",03Jan2018,2

298,"I’m going to do my best to keep this as short as possible, but things have sort of turned into a mess. 

For about 10 years I’ve been dealing with depression, anxiety, PTSD and an eating disorder. I was abused by my alcoholic father and sexually assaulted by two guys while I was in high school.

I graduated from school September 2016 with two jobs. Since then I have been working about 60-70 hours a week. In January 2017, my co-worker (Ann) at hospital B decided she didn’t want to work nights any more. My boss (Liz) at hospital B forced my roommate at the time and myself into working nights to cover Ann’s shifts. She stated we wouldn’t have hours if we didn’t take the nights. This wasn’t a problem for us, but shortly after my roommate moved out of state leaving me to cover her night shifts as well. I still didn’t mind, and actually preferred nights as I’m more of a night person. However, this left me working nights at hospital B, only getting a half day off a week, then working days at hospital A. Because my body adjusts to being up all night I find myself wide awake at 3am when I need to be up to start getting ready at 5am for hospital A which is an hour drive without traffic from where I live. 

Sometime in April one of the guys that sexually assaulted me in high school tried contacting me. I was working at hospital B and couldn’t remember how to use the machines I had been using everyday for the past 2.5 years. All I could do was stand there staring at them for several minutes trying to figure it out. Liz noticed something was wrong with, as I wasn’t talking. She tried to get me to tell her what was going on, but I couldn’t say. The following day I broke down and told her what had happened. Since then she has become more of a mother figure to me than simply my boss. 

Being contacted by this guy was a huge trigger for my eating disorder, which I thought I had overcome. I went from eating normally to only eating 9 almonds and a kale smoothie everyday. Liz took notice and convinced me to go talk to a therapist. She even came with me to the first three sessions to help me feel comfortable. 

As a quick side note, when Liz gets stressed she snaps at everyone around to the point where those of us working for her feel afraid to approach her or even look at her at times. In July a co-worker of mine had enough and went to the head of our department and HR to file a complaint bout this. This co-worker left on a mental health leave, has since quit and is suing the hospital.

In October, the lack of sleep really started taking its toll on me. I told Liz how difficult it was becoming for me and she told me she would figure something out. November rolls around, nothing changed. I spoke with a co-worker (Ashley) about it and she told me to talk to Liz, that she agreed it would be best for me to get off the night shift. 

My depression started spiraling out of control again with the holidays approaching. This was my first holiday season since my grandmother passed away and my first holiday single after breaking up with my BF of 5 years. 

End of November I decided to talk to Liz. When I brought it up she rolled her eyes and snapped at me saying that there was nothing she could do that I had to continue to work nights. The way she reacted immediately hurt my feelings to the point where I had to turn away to keep myself from crying, all I could say to her was “okay, don’t worry about it”. As soon as she left I broke down crying. I felt as though I was being pushed aside, that my struggle was nothing, that all she cared about was having the shifts covered so she didn’t have to put any effort into finding a new solution. Over the past year I’ve picked up so many extra shifts to cover for her, so she wouldn’t have to work extra days. I’ve even left hospital A (8 hours shift), driven over an hour to hospital B to work a 12 hour night shift to help her out. 

The next time I saw her was in the beginning of December. I could barely look at her without tearing up, so I remained quiet and didn’t say anything. She and I ended up getting into an argument and I tried telling her that the way she acted hurt my feelings, but I felt as though she didn’t want to hear anything, so I dropped it. After that I put up a wall and avoided her to avoid feeling anything. This caused huge issues for me. She is now extremely pissed off at me for my “blatant disrespect”. I tried explaining that it wasn’t meant as disrespect, but my way of coping, to which she responded, “wow, you can’t even see when you’re being disrespectful”. She told me that she regrets ever getting involved with me, that she will never look at me the same, and even her worst enemy wouldn’t treat her so horribly.

I’m super hurt by all this. She knows everything I’ve been struggling with and she’s acting as if I murdered her dog. All I did was put up all wall to keep myself from crying when she was around. I feel like she’s being over dramatic and only thinking about herself.

How do I fix this situation?
What am I not seeing?

302,"So my friend is a cashier at Michaels and she hates when people call the store. She hates when people ask for hours, because she says people can just google them, and the machine says it in the message. she hates when people call to check if something is in stock, because there is no computer system and she has to manually check for the items. She also hates when people ask for product recommendations, because many of them are too highly specific .

From this I get that I need to do my best to check online for all the information I need, reviews, hours, research about products, youtube tutorials, and to come into the store and check for an item myself. The takeaway I get from this is to avoid calling a store at all costs. I feel like some of these rules are a bit harsh, as sometimes google/website hours are wrong and I commute pretty far for no reason when it's closed, but I understand the other two.

A lot of these issues come from simply not knowing how the stores work. Some stores do have well organized computer systems to look up stock (like bookstores, but I usually access them online from home) while other stores don't have any kind of system at all. I want to be able to anticipate which questions are fair and which ones are not, so that I'm not that annoying customer that ruins people's day and makes their jobs harder.

Another big thing I've totally stopped doing as a consumer (and I wish I had the common sense to do this my whole life) is not to show up near closing - makes everyone have to stay later than their shift which is of course unpleasant.

There's someone who I've known for years and part of me has always had feelings for them but I couldn't be with them because of an age gap (it's not a huge one) and then they went into the navy. A few years back they made a promise to wait for me for when I turn 18 so we could be together which I honestly thought they'd forget about and just move on because there would be years of distance between us but they didn't forget. We've been talking everyday for about two months now and they came back on leave so I've seen them a few times and plan on seeing them again before they go back. 
To get to the point though, I'm very nervous about asking my dad for permission even though it'd be mostly long distance so there's nothing really for him to worry about. I know my dad isn't a huge fan of them because of a past situation that I'm not sure I'm comfortable with sharing publicly and he told my mom he wasn't that happy about us talking again. He let me go to their house multiple times now though so I'm not sure how strong the dislike is. 
I'm kinda intimidated by my dad, he's not always the nicest person and when he's in a bad mood you can really feel it and he will act a certain way towards you. I don't want to somehow upset him or anger him by asking but I also don't want to do it secretly. I feel like I shouldn't need to ask because I am 18 so it's more my choice but I feel like I need to get permission from my parents out of respect.

321,"I live in a house that I’ve been in for 3 years right out of college. My last three roommates worked at the same company and on the same project team. They were relocated overseas on short notice at the same time so I was tasked with finding 3 new roommates in 1 month this past June.

I found three girls who are my age and have the same professional life, schedule, etc. I was ecstatic at first as they are all sweet and fun for the most part. 

Now here’s the background. Our house is 210 years old in a historic city district. Our rent is PHENOMENAL (like $500 less per person vs. a similar type, size, age, location for the area)  mostly because we have a “hands-off” landlord who is too lazy to check the market prices. The house is adorable but has old house issues which to date have really only been a rat sighting (we live in a restaurant district on the 2nd most rat inundated city in the US) and a recent heat issue (I’ll get to that). Our contract explicitly states that all house repairs are our responsibility aside from major equipment replacement and structural/safety issues. 

My roommates barrage him with phone calls and emails about shower caulking, small holes in screens, lost keys, etc. All things that are not his problem. I’d side with them if the contract wasn’t so clear and if he wasn’t such an incompetent threatening Ass. I learned 2 years ago after reaching out to him that he’s old, dumb, and (after some deep web searching), has a history of being vindictive. He is exactly the type of person to just get annoyed and give us 60 days to leave and he’s starting to hint at that. (Btw there are yelp reviews online that way preceded their moving in saying the same thing). Upon moving in, I told each and every person I interviewed that if you leave him alone, he leaves you alone, and you could go forever without an interaction. I never had a problem with my adorable and so-affordable-it’s-a-steal house in the two years I lived there before them.

So our heat distribution is off. 3rd floor is very hot, 2nd is ice (I’m on the 2nd btw) I’m an engineer and work in construction so I asked coworkers. The overwhelming answer was to check the filter or dampers. I told my roommates it was an easy enough fix but they are so fond of stomping their feet and complaining that they did so anyway and called my landlord and whined (it’s oh so bitchy as well) despite “heater filter replacement” being listed as one of our contract responsibilities. 

I try very much to be on their side while trying to tactfully remind them of these things but it seems like it’s making them dislike me. They coincidentally all come from serious money and this is their first post college housing, a lot of hints suggest that they haven’t had to do much in their own...ever. They go out drinking constantly and host parties at least once every couple weeks (which is not a problem with me, just a different wavelength). I love that stuff maybe once a week, but this is way more often.


On top of that, they just asked (7 months into living here) if I could pay more because I use the one-car driveway. My roommate advertisement was clear that the parking was not available and I intentionally chose roommates without cars. Now that one of them has a longer commute to a new job they want to change things. I do understand that there’s no official agreement or contract but I picked them above other people for that exact reason.

I know this is post is so long, already but because I work 3 hours longer a day, have a boyfriend, and travel sometimes, I’m left out of a lot of conversations about this stuff and (I fear) conversations about me. They drink wine and watch tv every night together for hours, I join when I can and we honestly get along fine and can laugh and go out together sometimes, but I’m quickly becoming the outsider and don’t want that to be the case.

323,"I (24F) have been dealing with back pain since I was 16. After I graduated from University (degree in kinesiology), I woke up one morning and my pain had suddenly become much worse. Since that day almost 3 years ago, I have been on the fentanyl patch for pain. I have been through countless procedures including spinal injections, nerve blocks, discography and different therapies but nothing has made my pain go away. I have been living with my Dad who has been supporting me financially. After two years of putting off graduate school due to my health, I finally decided to try school this year. I am not doing well but I am so scared to tell my dad that I want to quit. I don't know what I'm going to do with my life and I just want to be able to support myself. Should I stick it out with the probability of failing out or quit while I'm ahead and maybe defer until I am able to get off my medication which makes me so exhausted and out of it pretty much all the time? Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks xo ",03Jan2018,2

 I get the whole day without my dad so I can just do whatever the hell I want.

       Well no, my sister told me she was feeling pain and was picking at her mouth a bit and a
 teeny tiny bit of what looks like a tooth came off but its so tiny I cant even tell. I didn't
 want her getting an abcess (Theyre so miserable, I had one a year ago) so I checked
 it out, in the pain spot I can see a new tooth growing in, that must be the pain, its barely
 pierced through the gums, but shouldering with it is a tiny yellow spot, looks like the worlds
 smallest infection and I dont know what it is. Im hoping its just a canker sore because if 
my dad thinks its anything else, my beautiful plans for a day off school and to myself on 
a thursday is ruined!, and I guess my sister would have a problem, I would look it up but 
I dont really know what to be looking for, the closest thing I got was canker sore and mouth
 cancer... Pretty sure its not the latter. Any suggestions?

329,"Let me cut to the chase.
I took my friend out to get her head shaved. The reason why is that she wanted to get her head shaved for years now. She has a brain condition and when she gets surgery, the doctor will shave a part off her hair anyways. Also, a relative of hers recently passed from cancer and she wanted to commemorate her. She was tired of her hair.

When we came back home from the shave, her mother screamed at both of us. I’m not mad at her mother at all. She did not want her daughter to shave her head because she figured it was self destructive. Her mother yelled at me for “encouraging” her daughter and that I should have never took her hand to get her head shaved. She also said she felt like a bad mother because her daughter continuously rebelled against her. I felt like shit and felt incredibly guilty afterwards because she was grieving too.  

However, we do not do drugs, we do not drink. Part of me feels as if her mother overreacted but I also feel now as if I am an enabler and I didn’t “support” her. I’ve asked her many times if she really wanted to shave her hair and she did not budge. She also knew her mother would be angry. She is my dear friend and I always want to be there for her. But I also get why her mother would be so upset with her and me. My friend does love her mother. And I know her mother does love her too and is just concerned. I just feel so shit right now. 

I want the honest truth. ",03Jan2018,1

332,"So I've been living with my roommate since August. Ive known him for about 7 year though. We haven't really had problems until now. Alittle backstory , I work during the day 8am-6pm. My roommate Alex works the night shift at a local hospital so 7pm to 730am. So he sleeps during the day when he is working that night. We live in a townhouse which means  2 bedrooms upstairs and living room, kitchen, extra bathroom  all downstairs 

So this recently happened, it New Years Day at 1:30pm. One of my friends comes over, who is a loud and special individual.  He is coming over to pick me up to hangout, I let him in cause I still needed to change. I tell him that my roommate is upstairs sleeping then  I go upstairs and I hear that my friend starts playing my piano. I quickly change and go downstairs to turn the volume down cause I wanted to watch him play just alittle bit before we left. 

Next thing you know, Alex my roommate comes downstairs, stops  half way on the stairs, gives me a  nasty look and says ""Think about it"" runs back upstairs and slams his door. As he is going upstairs I tell ""Sorry dude"".  His tone was so negative it kind of fucked up my day. My friend and I leave. Later when I get back ,I  see my roommate  is the kitchen and I say what's up,  he completely ignores me and doesn't say a word so I just go upstairs. 

Should he be that upset that I accidentally woke him up at 1:30pm in the afternoon  on new years day? Was I in the Wrong? I think it's very hypecritcal of him to be upset, cause when he has his days off he is banging his GF at night when I'm sleeping.

334,"hello and thank you for reading my first post.

im new here so please forgive me if i make any rookie mistakes! ive been checking reddit for over 5 years and never felt the need to post - just browsing seemed to do. but i have been having some really tough feelings and i need an outlet. i know it sounds selfish, but i need advice and i feel like i have no one to turn to (obviously im upset now, its not always near as bad).

ive had a fight with a friend over a guy, the issue not being the guy per se, but the fact that she went for him when i introduced him as someone i liked. im not perfect. im sure ive done something similar before, maybe unknowingly or even knowingly at what would be the least of my proudest behaviours. i just wished she would have talked to me instead of being so casual about it. its made me feel really hurt.

we had a huge fight over text which is a BIG MISTAKE obviously. 
i said really ugly things, so did she of course.

i spoke to another friend who ive had for over 15 years about it and she told be she wished she could be supportive but i was in the wrong. this is complicated since we have had issues like this in the past which have been swept under the rug since due to life just taking its course and things going unsaid.

i feel really disconnected. i just needed my first friend to say she was sorry it happened, and that she wished she had done things better. i wish my second friend would have given me unconditional support at a time when i needed her. 

i feel really disconnected, hurt, embarrased and alone.

this has felt good to write. any thoughts will be welcome.

thank you!

Some backstory, I was supposed to open the store but i was feeling really sick most of the week and it just got really bad so I decided to call in sick, however the next day I was feeling a lot better and since I had plans that evening (tagged along on a photoshoot) I decided to keep them. My boss somehow saw pictures from that night and passive aggressively started texting one of my coworkers who I was out with. The texts went something along the lines of ""So Rose was too sick to come to work this morning but was well enough to go out?"". I'm not the type of person to call in sick because I have other plans and she knows that. A lot of her pettiness seems to stem from the fact that we didnt invite her out with us (my workplace is pretty casual and I'm on the management team as well but my boss really cant separate personal from professional). Shes been bitching about this to the District Manager and the the store managers of other branches as well. I'm supposed to meet with her tomorrow to discuss the issue but I dont know how to handle it without saying something that would set her off even more. I understand how the entire situation appears but I genuinely dont think I did anything wrong. I called in sick because I actually was sick and kept plans that I already had because I felt better. I would really appreciate any advice

338,"Hi, this is my first post on reddit and I really need some advice about my friend. We were talking about our plans for next semester of college when he told me that he won't be going to school next semester because he met a couple who is mentoring him. He says this couple retired in their twenties because they were able to ""build their wealth"" and ""create cash flow."" He met them about two months ago, has met with them around 20 times or so and says he considers them very good friends. He heard about them from a friend and claims that they are very selective about who they choose to mentor because you have to prove to them you have the right mindset. He says it isn't an employer that pays you money and that he can't explain it to me because I wouldn't understand it and it's like ""teaching calculus to someone who only knows basic addition."" When I tried to ask him more about it he only repeated what he said above and mentioned that he could drop my name in with them during one of his meetings and he couldn't guarantee anything because of their selectiveness. The last thing we talked about was when I told him I didn't want to see him end up in the middle of a pyramid scheme and he said he wasn't selling anything or anything like that. The only investment was the money you already have and you keep building money on top of that or something. It was hard to get anything out of him and I want him to understand my concerns or explain to him why he is not going to be able to ""build his wealth"" and retire in less than ten years. He has asked me not to reach out to them due to the fact he has worked hard to build his relationship and credibility with them and he would hate to lose that. All in all: Who are these people and what should I do/tell him? I hope I can find some answers, thank you!",03Jan2018,1
340,"I am currently an Information Systems major with a focus on Cybersecurity and a double minor in Communications and Computer Languages and Systems (Both of which were former major because figuring out what you want to do is a struggle).  I started in 2012 and after jumping between majors and starting a job in a relevant field (thankfully) I've finally slated to graduate in fall of 2018.  

My school recently started doing something called course forgiveness, and basically what that means is that if you received a less then favorable grade in a class, but the class is not required or related in any way to your major or minor (minors in my case) they can effectively nix the grade from your overall GPA.  I believe the course itself stays on your transcript, but instead of that C,D, or F or whatever you got it's listed as forgiven or exempt or something like that.  If I implemented this, it would boost my current Overall GPA from a 3.265 to at least a 3.4 (which is good for Cum Laude at my University).  However, in order to take advantage of this I would need to update my course catalog for my major.

The required courses for my major are under a catalog from a previous year and the current one is only different by one class.  Normally this would probably seem like a no-brainer, just take the extra class, get my blemishes forgiven and secure Cum Laude assuming I get A's and B's in my last 2 semesters or have a cushion for my GPA if things go less than favorably.  However, that extra class is a Spring only class and I've already signed up for a reasonably full course load in the Spring beforehand.  I preemptively added it to my schedule in case I decide to go that route bringing my schedule up to 18 credit hours with a planned 9-10 credit hours semester in the fall for my last semester.  

So my options are:

1.  Moving the last class for one of my minors to the fall to make room for that last major class this spring. 

2. keeping all of the classes and just trying to make this a gauntlet semester so I can have less school in the fall to focus on job hunting.  Also from what I've heard, one of the electives I'm taking is apparently a throwaway.  So if it's as easy as I've heard that virtually lowers my actual workload to 15 credit hours.  

3. Just saying screw it to the course forgiveness and Cum Laude and staying on my current plan and graduating with probably a 3.3 assuming everything goes reasonably well (A's and B's primarily).

My main worries are the fact that I'm going to be working 30 hours a week this semester, I will have some ability to do schoolwork at work but of course work comes first.  I guess I'm just not confident in my ability to handle all that.  Also, even though the fall catalog has been very consistent every year, if there are any changes whatsoever with the course I would be dropping in terms of scheduling, time slots, etc. that would throw a wrench in everything and effectively delay my another semester.  Although I suppose any major changes like that to any of my last courses would screw me anyway.  I guess given how long it's taking me to graduate, any changes this far in are scary to me because I really can't afford to delay things an extra semester.  I'm probably just being incredibly paranoid and I'm somewhat already leaning towards options 1 or 2, but I just wanted some extra opinions.  Also not really a legit concern since it can only help me but I don't know how important Cum Laude is to employers in my field (I know that's something that varies from company to company). 

Hopefully I typed that mostly coherently and I would really appreciate any advice.  Thanks a bunch!

341,"In school a while ago, I gossiped a lot about this one girl( I won't name) and was really rude and judgmental towards her. I was disgusted by the way she acted and mocked her dreams of becoming a singer. I even exaggerated what she did and made her seem like a horrible person---when she wasn't.  Now, I feel really guilty because I realized that I liked to do a lot of the things she liked too. Even worse, I realized that I probably deserved that criticism more than she did. Recently, one of my friends met her at a gathering and when she heard my friend mention my name, she said: ""Don't even remind me of her.""

343,"About a year ago my husband was injured at work and is now permanently disabled. He cannot drive and cannot take care of our children because he has abrupt changes in mood and is unpredictable. 

I am somewhat intelligent but I have no formal training or education. I have ADHD, anxiety, and aspergers. Our children are 11, 9, 7, and 2. The older children have been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, and sensory issues. The older 3 go to an out of district school and I have to drive them to school at 7:45 and pick them up at 3:00. There isn't anyone they can carpool with. Local school is not an option.

If I can get a very good job we could move to the neighborhood their school is in and they could walk to school. They would just have to stay away from their father.  Assuming 3x rent I would need to make around $3900 a month or $2800 if my Husband's workman's comp payments never end. I can send the 2 year old to an in home daycare for $150-$200 a week. I think we would lose our medicaid and our prescriptions would be around $750-$1000 each month.

I do not think a customer service job is a very good idea. I have poor social skills. Takings care of my family drains me emotionally and I will have much less time to do what takes me all day right now. I'm a terrible writer.  Our minivan is too old for a delivery job.  I have already failed at ebay and retail arbitrage. I have poor dexterity.  I have only held a few jobs in my life. I was married young and had kids young. I'm great at knowing small details about stuff.  I always look disheveled. I'm good at raising a big family on almost no money. 

My anxiety has alienated me from being social. We have no friends and have to limit contact with our extended family because of their mental illnesses. 

Honestly I'm not in a great place mentally but everything is getting desperate. I'm usually a great problem solver. 

So how do I find a job that lets me work limited hours until I can afford to move?
