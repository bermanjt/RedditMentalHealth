1,"When I'm trying to sleep (about the last five days), my brain won't shut up saying there will be something watching me, or that I'll be vulnerable with my eyes closed or while asleep. Half of my mind knows there is nothing around me and nothing can harm me, but the ""survival/danger"" half of my mind always overpowers it. It's causing me to get about three hours of sleep a night, which is when I near enough pass out. 

I don't know why this has started, but is there anything I can do to shut down my brain so I can actually get some decent hours? Especially since I've got an important interview tomorrow quite early. TIA",19Nov2018,2

4,"Hey everyone, I'm fairly new to this website.  I hear and see a lot of reddit posts going on and noticed it's a pretty popular website where there's plenty of people who have gone through similar situations and for the majority, the audience seems like a pretty nice group, so I hope to get some clearance in the situation and some honest advice from you guys all while done with respect.  But let me give you a quick backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My ex-girlfriend (28) is a music therapist and teacher.  Incredibly beautiful, smart, hardworking, talented, faithful, the entire package.  Although this has been the best relationship we have had in our lives, her past has been rough as far as relationships go.  She, coming from a Filipino background, has grown up with some strictness in the family.  Her parents are very old-school and have been strict with her, even have made her feel guilty for not doing Nursing as a career path.  Growing up, she has been bullied and what-not.  Her relationship before me, she described to me as manipulative/controlling/not healthy.  She had told me that it was a very difficult time for her.  She had lost herself, she had lost her identity, she still gets upset about it from time to time.  I tried to be as understanding as possible about the situation and try to sympathize it, all while at the same time, try to pick her up when she feels by trying to show her that her ex-boyfriend is in the past and it's important to focus on the now.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I am (27M) a Physical Therapist Assistant.  I work with people who have had surgery/hurt themselves at work to help regain their function.  That's something both my ex and I shared, is that we were both musicians and in the therapy field.  We both obviously care about people and their well being.  (And we're both Cancer!)  I've never really had much experience with serious relationships.  This was my longest relationship of a year, so this relationship being my 4th one, I am learning how to deal with women still.  I admit, I have work to do and growing up to do.  Everyone does, I'm not trying to say I'm perfect, but I'm certainly far from the worst.  I am a hard working, caring, fair individual.  I try to be as honest as possible when I can be.

&amp;#x200B;

Now about the relationship itself:

I can come off as pretty needy at times.  I am someone who is able to give someone their space but you'd have to tell me, I love talking to someone nonstop and I can be overwhelming, I'm sure.  And you'd have to reassure me that nothing is wrong with me and our relationship.  It's a pretty annoying personality trait of mine that I know can be a major turn off.  I'm someone who needs constant reassurance.  I don't know if it's because I've been screwed over before or maybe my childhood, I don't know, but I'm seeing a therapist for it.  I'm hoping it all goes well, because it's something that I hate having to deal with and I'm sure any partner would hate to deal with.  With my ex girlfriend, I noticed that she likes things to be a certain way, and is pretty strong-willed (stubborn) about it.  She can also play the victim very well for many things.   
 This was not something I have seen before or made a lot of sense in my head up until when we broke up when I took a step back and analyzed the relationship.  For example, we were planning a trip to Disneyland and I was very much wanting to take an Uber around because I didn't want to drive around in LA traffic, I didn't want to worry about drinking and driving, I didn't want to worry about parking, and I just didn't want to deal with driving period because I'm on vacation.  Her and I agreed to a 50/50 split for the bigger costs because we both make very good money.  She wanted to rent a car because it was cheaper and she was ""on a budget"" (despite her having $70,000 saved in her bank account).  We would have saved some money renting the car but doing Uber would've been ideal.  There were pros and cons to both situations, which I understood, so I offered to pay for the transportation out there because I wanted to take an Uber, she didn't have to pitch in 50/50 for that, but she insisted to pay because she didn't want me to have her under her thumb for paying for things (which in her previous relationships, she had boyfriends who tried to control her just because they paid for this and that.)  We ended up arguing for a good amount of time about it, I Just gave in and decided ""Fine, let's just rent the car out."" after she felt like she had to yell her brains out about it.  I offered to pay for transportation, which she denied, because I wanted to take the Uber, which she denied as well.  So I was basically forced to rent the car just to save $100 or else she would have not gone on the trip, which she has used as ammo against me whenever she gets mad during an argument.  She would say ""You know what?  I'm not going on the trip anymore, you can go on your own.""  and there I go, apologizing.  Trying to mend things.

&amp;#x200B;

The first few months were fantastic, as a lot of relationships I'm sure.  As every relationship matures, it begins to have arguing in it.  We begin to notice our differences.  I'm not someone to give up on someone or capitalize on our differences in a negative way.  We are allowed to be different people.  And despite us having our differences, our similarities that are very important to us are there, such as: family orientation, music, therapy, helping others, etc.  My ex-girlfriend is someone who can be overly sensitive with things or take things the wrong way.  To my fault, I tend to say things like ""oh I was just kidding"" or ""don't be so sensitive"", which is the message I have conveyed in the past.  I apologize afterwards once I see that it really did upset her.  Sometimes she doesn't really show to be bothered by it in the moment until it comes up after in an argument.  I'm definitely working on it now, since it makes more sense as to her feeling like I'm undermining her feelings.  Although sometimes she can be pretty sensitive to the silliest of things, I try to understand as much as I can and change in that aspect.  However, recently, things have gotten out of control.  2 months ago, She was over at my house, we were laying down on my bed and asked ""Hey, can we look at your pictures on your phone?"" And I'm thinking ""Okay, she's obviously looking for dirt or something to argue about.  But she won't find anything.""  We're scrolling through my entire album on my iPhone, laughing at the random things I take pictures of and things I save.  Going far back into things from before, she found pictures of old friends I used to talk to on my phone.    A few were selfies of other girls, and there was 1 nude in there of a girl I met over Tinder.  These were all rooted deep into the early stages of my 1,500 pictures that I had from the past 1-2 years.  These pictures of the girls were from before I met my girlfriend, and I had forgotten they were on my phone.  My phone mainly consists of memes, pictures of my (ex) girlfriend, or pictures of my family.  Anyway, I deleted the pictures right then and there.  She thought it was weird and it started an argument.  Her main thing was ""How do you not see what you did wrong?  Who in the right mind would keep selfies of their friends?  Are these girls your fuck buddies/thirst traps/ex hook ups?""  I kept reassuring her that I had no current contact with them and they were from the past from when I was single.  She kept insisting that it was weird and not normal and how dare I disrespect our relationship that way.  She was also upset at my initial reaction to when she found the pictures while laying on the bed.  I had said ""Oh yeah, those are my old friends.  I used to talk to them.  I'll just delete them now"".  Hence, why she feels like I see nothing wrong with what I did, when obviously she did. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few days after that, she comes over and I am playing piano while she is singing.  I have my back turned to her while she is singing and she randomly stops.  While she has stopped singing, I am practicing my part which I can't seem to get.  3 minutes into the song, I stop and I take a break from that part I can't get down.  When I get up and turn around, I see her laying on my bed with a blanket over her.  I take the blanket off, and she's going through my phone.  She quickly locks the phone and throws it to her side.  I caught her red-handed.  I get incredibly upset because she is going through my phone without my permission.  It's not like I have anything to hide, but the idea/principle of it is what bothers me.  It shows me that she does not trust me.  I got upset and did begin to raise my voice (which does not happen often, but when it does, she does not live it down, despite her yelling at me WAY more than I ever have in my life.  In a demeaning manner, too.) asking her ""What do you think you're doing going through my phone?!""  And she's like ""Oh, I'm just looking through your pictures of the Disney trip we went to."" when I KNOW I saw the green text message bubbles when I uncovered her from under the sheets.  I opened my phone back up and what do you know, my text messages are the first thing to come up.  I asked her ""Why the hell did you do that? What are you looking for? Don't you trust me?"" She kept insisting she was not going through my messages although I LITERALLY saw her with them open.  Finally, I get her to come forward with what she was doing and she begins to yell even louder than me ""It's because I don't trust you, okay!?"" and puts the blame on the pictures I had on my phone.  She also insists that I have a romantic relationship with all of my friends that are girls and that my boss is my ""work wife"", which is non-sense.  She keeps saying that I am holding on to these pictures so I can use them for pleasure and as a ""spank bank"", which is also non-sense because they were just random selfies.  I ask her ""Why would I keep pictures as masturbating material if 1) there's porn for that and 2) I have a girlfriend whom I love a lot and am faithful to?""  The 1 nude was someone I didn't even consider being in a relationship nor did I keep any contact with her after a few weeks.  She broke up with me right then and there.  I told her she can leave, and that was it until a week after when she finally cooled down that we got back together.  But during that week that we were ""broken up,"" she was sending me pictures and text messages saying ""Oh, where should I throw away your gifts that you gave me?"" and sending me pictures of when we took that trip to Disneyland saying ""This is my favorite picture of us, look at us smiling..."" obviously trying to guilt trip me and trying to get me to change my mind or hurt me in some manner.  She knows what gets to me, emotionally.  I am an emotional person, but I have improved on making decisions based not on my current emotional state, but on what needs to be done.  Regardless, when your'e in love, sometimes you're blinded by the right decisions.  We make up and everything is swell until a few weeks after that....

&amp;#x200B;

The next/last episode where we broke up happened last month, a month after our first break up.  I went over to her house on a Tuesday morning before work for some coffee.  We were sitting on the couch, on our phones, just talking and hanging out drinking our coffee.  We were talking about how my cousin and his girlfriend were going through some things and my cousins girlfriend cheated on him.  We were talking about how toxic she was and how sad the whole situation was.  Right after we finished our conversation about her, my cousins girlfriend went live on Instagram.  I said ""oh look, speak of the devil, his girlfriend just went live on Instagram."" and my (ex) girlfriend says ""Ohhh, let's watch it!"" so I turn it on.  Her and I are watching the live stream and noticed that she was in a McDonalds sweater and it looked like she was in an office with someone else, so we assumed she was at work.  We were laughing, so I decided to comment ""lemme get some food!"".  I'm a big fan of McDonalds (But I'm not fat, yet...).  Then, my cousin's girlfriend replies ""Then come get some"", and that's when my (ex) girlfriend loses her shit.  I mean, she goes full out ballistic.  I'm confused as to why she's yelling and freaking out, I don't know what happened.  As she gets up from the couch and starts yelling ""WHAT THE FUCK, WHAT THE FUCK!!!!"" I'm replying in a panicked manner, ""What? What happened!?"" She yells ""How dare you message her?! How dare you say that!?""  And I am very confused, because I literally was just asking for food, as a joke.  I was only being silly because I saw someone with McDonalds uniform.  I always do the same to people whenever I see a restaurant uniform on.  No intention of actually going to get it or anything.  No flirting, absolutely nothing.  I made the comment in front of my girlfriend, so why would I do something shady like that?  Later that day, we discussed what happened and she was very upset because (this is where she is manipulating and changing what happened), I was ""flirting with her, catcalling her"" and ""could not take my eyes off of her in the live stream for a whole 3 minutes as she sat there and watched in horror trying to snap me out of this 'in love' daze that I was in.""  This is where I begin to notice that she manipulates a lot of situations and warps what actually happened in order for her to appear like she has been justified in her actions and her reactions.  Which she has every right to react the way she wants, but to bring me down and exaggerate the scenario is not okay with me.  Again, she breaks up with me saying that how dare I disrespect her and our relationship.  

&amp;#x200B;

She has accused me of gaslighting.  A LOT.  She has accused me of being manipulative.  Accused me of being impulsive and inconsiderate.  Throughout all this, she has played the victim a lot and it seems like I have always been wrong, no matter what I try to do right.  I would try to explain myself, but then be accused of ""mansplaining"" and being a misogynistic pig.  I am someone that when their partner gets hurt, I try to be there for them and change when I need to.  I was made felt like 90% of everything was my fault, that I was the stubborn one, that I was the one that needed to change and not her.  She made me a list of things that I needed to work on, but when I told her she needed to work on some things, she got VERY defensive.  And yet, it was always ME ME ME.  Basically walking on eggshells, recently.  No matter how much I changed or tried to do things right, it was not enough.  Eventually, she had enough and left me.  And it seems like she still isn't finished shooting shots at me.  During every argument, she would try to hurt me somehow.  More recently, my friend found her on a dating site not too long ago (which I feel like after a serious relationship of a year and talking about marriage/future/engagement, it seems too soon for that.).  She had on her profile that she was an ""emotional abuse survivor"" and to message her if ""they are interested and don't have nudes of ex girlfriends/thirst traps/ex hook ups"".  She KNEW that my friend was on that site and that I would possibly be dating again, (But I'm not, I'm trying my best to regain my confidence and sense of self.)

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm a very caring person.  Not just me as a person, but in my field, too.  I take care of others when they need help.  I am someone who is trustworthy and fair to many people, also very family oriented, silly, talented, smart.  I want there to be equality.  Yes, I crack jokes and sometimes my humor can be offensive, but life is a crazy thing, and being serious all the time kills it.   That doesn't mean that someone won't be offended by something so I have to take a step back in becoming more cautious around others.  But after all this, I felt like I have lost sense of who I was.  My confidence was struck and damaged pretty hard towards the end of the relationship.  You can't save anyone, you can only support.  Unfortunately, she felt like there was nothing wrong with her.  But I guess my thing was...was I actually manipulated or is this me just being paranoid?  She kept mentioning gaslighting, but was she doing the gaslighting or was I?????  This whole situation is VERY confusing and heartbreaking.  This was someone I saw a future with, but my sense of reality is a bit staggered....This whole thing is super childish. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My girlfriend accuses me of doing many things wrong and overreacts to the smallest of things.  Despite me doing things right, I get no credit for it.  And when she tries to show me credit, she quickly shuts that down with a LOT more negativity.  She has been hurt in the past and I feel like that baggage was brought with her to this current relationship.  She is now accusing me of gaslighting and being manipulative/impulsive/inconsiderate and having NO foresight in my decisions.  What should I do? ",19Nov2018,0
5,"I know this is a weird question to ask on the internet, but bear with me for a moment.
I don't have any hobbies outside of the internet, not for lack of searching. But I don't really ""use"" them. I don't have a social life so I don't post anything on Facebook, I am not pretty or artsy so my Instagram is just photos of cats and the sky, I am not interesting so I don't post anything on Twitter, etc. I just scroll down the screen all day waiting for something to happen. When I've tried to spend more than one hour without my phone I died of boredom and just stared at the ceiling or out of the window. I would like to stop that.

6,"I'm 28f and every time someone tries to start a conversation with me or attention is on me I become flustered and can feel myself going red. I've seen my reflection and I'm beet red!

8,"I've been seeing M for the last 3 months and we've completely fallen in love with each other. She's everything to me and we have so much fun together. We've been meeting each other's friends and family lately which is exciting and nerve-wracking for me all the same.

While people see me as an ""easy to talk to"" kind of person, I'm actually freaking out internally when interacting in a conversation with someone I don't know well. Anyone who pays attention enough would see I always sweat like a pig when I'm nervous. Just bullets raining down from my head. This only adds to the anxiety everywhere surrounding my life.

I've only known M for 3 months so there was definitely a barrier I had to push through personally to make a connection with her. There were times that I was sweating so bad but she didn't care and it made me feel so safe.

As things progressed in our relationship, things the in bedroom began to spice up however, my anxiety has completely invaded the bedroom. Through a mix of a shitty lifestyle (not much exercise, eat like crap, porn addiction) and my anxiety, I cannot keep an erection when we initiate sex at all.

We could do oral for days but the moment I got on top of her there was about 20 seconds left until I couldn't hold it anymore. I feel so much pressure because I'm ending a dry spell of 2 and a half years and she's a virgin so I feel like I have to make it special for her but everytime I fail, it gets worse.

Things climaxed last night (but I didn't...) when I initiated sex with her and to begin I didn't use a condom. She expressed how she didn't want that before but sometimes would let me try without it. I was so stuck in my own head about trying to get this dick to work that I left her out of the picture and I think I'm missing the whole point of sex at this point. It was just 20 seconds but it doesn't matter. I went against her wishes.

M told me after last night that she felt invaded I didn't use the condom, and I think she has every right to be. It's her body body and her choice. Why can't I provide her with that respect? I stayed the night but she didn't want me really touching her while we slept. I just felt DISGUSTING. I couldn't believe what I had done to her and put everything at risk here. I barely got any sleep and even now I'm so shaken up. I don't know how to mentally move on from this.

In the morning we cuddled and she stayed firm on her point while expressing she just needs some time. I left so she could get ready for work and in a rare move, I went to my parents and pretty much collapsed into tears the moment I walked in the door. Overall it's just been an incredibly emotional 24 hours.

—

Anyways, I need advice Reddit. How do I fix this? I'm seeking professional counseling for my anxiety at some point this week. But fuck, I don't know how to make things right with M. She doesn't want to break up but that trust is completely shattered and I don't know how I'm supposed to rebuild that trust and not feel like a POS when trying to have sex with her in the future. 

I told her she didn't need to text me at all today unless she wanted to. But she hasn't and it's 6:30 pm. I know I need to give her space. What the hell do I say or do when she texts me?",19Nov2018,1
12,"I had a girlfriend when I was 18, I now have 22. I had huge alcohol problems. Several times we had tried to have sex, during the preliminaries everything went well, but once the moment of penetration arrived, it was impossible for me to have an erection ... It's been 4 years since has arrived and since then I have totally lost confidence ... I think every day about this situation of shame. And for the moment I would be unable to find a girl to remedy this problem ... It has become a real obsession that drives me crazy. Being a virgin at 22 is one of my biggest complexes",19Nov2018,1
13,"This might be kind of long. (I’m also on mobile so I apologize for the formatting)

I recently (3-ish months ago) quit a job I had worked at for a little over two years. The job didn’t have the greatest pay— but it was stable &amp; I greatly enjoyed the atmosphere. I had a lot of paid holidays (it was a local gov job), the bosses were flexible with sick times, the lunches were obscenely long. The job was easy, I was highly valued in the office and the people became like family to me (my supervisor there was one of the nicest people I have ever met— she used to gift us cash at Christmas, take us out to eat etc.). 

The only problem was the pay &amp; mobility. Namely, there was none. So all the extra work that came along with my being highly valued didn’t come with any extra cash. 

So I started applying for jobs. And I eventually got a new one doing a similar thing, in a higher level of government. I was promised higher pay, raises, the whole shebang. 

Three months later— and my personal/family life falling apart (death etc.), and I’ve come to resent this job &amp; hate going to work. The people are very cliquey, their newcomer “drown them in work” policy is highly stressful (I end up having to work through my lunch &amp; a half an hour after work some days to catch up). I no longer have a personal life. I’ve been having to take anti-anxiety medicine to sleep &amp; Ritalin to focus/combat the hunger from working through lunch.  Due to mandatory deductions/retirement payments, I’m not really making any more money currently, despite working more hours. 

The other day, it all became too much &amp; I had a mental breakdown at my desk after everyone had left. 

I recently learned that there is a possibility of getting my old job back. My stability &amp; friends &amp; a job that I can do with my eyes closed. But the possibility of being stuck in the same situation of no real mobility still remains. Or, I stay in my current job, be miserable, and see if they actually follow through on this raise promise at my six month review. 

So I guess I’m asking: what should I do?  What would you do?  I need some opinions from people who are outside of my life situation. ",19Nov2018,1
14,"A little context: 

The stranger was asking my cousin for her sister’s address. We’ll call her sister Mary. Mary is staying in a home owned by my mother. Mary is a horrible alcoholic, to the point where she will probably die soon if she doesn’t decide to get help.  

Mary and her sister are both in their thirties and are pretty attractive women. 

Mary was in a far away state a few months ago, and a stranger with no profile picture or information messaged her sister saying that he was from that state and had Mary’s wallet and wanted to send it to her in the mail. 

Mary is constantly blackout drunk and we have no idea what sort of people she could have come across. She is currently living in a house owned by my mom, and that is the address Mary’s sister gave the stranger.

The profile was deleted after receiving the address.

At first I wasn’t too concerned, but the thing I can’t get out of my head is that the profile was empty and deleted after receiving the address. Am I overreacting? Should I do something? Any thoughts are welcome...",19Nov2018,1

I'm afraid to tell anyone in real life about this situation and I don't know why. I've been hating myself so much lately and I don't know what to do. It's even affecting my TV shows because a smart character will show up and those nasty thoughts will come up again.

21,"I'm in highschool right now (16m), and I smoke a good amount of weed. I hold myself to only weekends with the exception of Fridays when I'll occasionally do it during school, and on the weekend I'll usually be high from 4pm-12pm each day - regardless of if I'm alone or hanging out with people. Obviously this is probably not that good for my brain development. Here's the thing though - it's been a very good motivator for me. On Sundays, when I'm given a fuck ton of homework and a bunch of chores, I know that I won't be motivated to do it while high so I get it all done as fast as I can that way I can allow myself to smoke.

For example, today I did 4ish hours of homework, had a lesson for my instrument, went to the gym for an hour and a half and took my dog on an ~hourish walk all before 5pm so I could get high. Before I started smoking often, I would skip the gym on Sundays and leave most of my homework to get done at the start of class while the teacher's collecting the assignments. Less directly, I feel more motivated throughout the week to get my work done because I know I can look forward to smoking weed on the weekends. My grades are actually higher this year than they've ever been - I nearly have a 4.0 GPA despite the fact that I'm smoking 3-4x as much as I used to.

Anyways, basically I'm asking if my weed usage is justified? To me it feels like it is, but I'm also a retarded 16 year old and I know that I don't know shit. Should I stop or slow down smoking, or do the benefits (better grades, more motivation, overall more happiness and less depression) outweigh the negatives (worse brain development)?",19Nov2018,1

26,"Just a disclaimer, I've only been having problematic commitment  issues (best way I can describe it) with the past couple of months. If I look back thws couple of years ( around 2016) I guess you can say is where it began.

Recently, I just got out of my first relationship with this girl. I can tell for certain that I was absolutely crazy about her and once I guess you can say when we were 'official' I was super happy. This happiness lasted two weeks... Crazy about her when I went to bed and absolutely uninterested in her the next morning sort of thing. Broke up with her within two weeks of dating. I've been beating myself over it because I don't understand why or how I can do a complete 180 for a person.

I have similar patters in employment as well. The most amount of time I've worked at is 6 months. I've had 6 jobs (on my sixth) within 2 years.

Now the most recent issues I've been having with commitment is the time spent consecutively on certain activities. Before I could have watched hours of TV in a single sitting( nothing to be proud of), now I can't even do 10, 10 minutes of undivided attention. I love playing the piano, I can't live without it, before I would usually play an hour, but now I'm around 15. I have no willpower to stick to anything.

Right now I'm slowly breaking down, I have no roots to keep myself grounded. I'm jumping form one thing to another, can't enjoy the things I enjoy because I physically can't.

Hell I don't even know if any of this makes any sense. It's so hard to put it into words but I'm trying my best. Does anyone else have the same issues, I doubt I'm alone, it's impossible.

TLDR: Can't stay committed to anything even if I want to. How does one stay committed. ",19Nov2018,1

29,"I'm currently 15 and I've always wanted to become a surgeon. Since drawing has been a lifetime hobby of mine, I figured the precision I'd presumably manage to acquire through drawing would benefit me. 

But recently, I've noticed writing and drawing neatly to be more challenging than usual. My lines are weak and wobbly because my hands are trembling a lot of the time, especially with a pencil in hand. I also find it difficult to simply take a clear photo with my phone with one hand since, again, my hands are shaky. 

This has been happening for several months now and I'm finally starting to get concerned. 

My mother believes it is due to overuse of my hand from school and writing a lot or drawing too much, but I usually sketch only a few times a week and my classes don't typically prompt me to write too much.

How could I become a surgeon if I can't keep my hand still?

36, I don't know why I am doing this but I guess I just need some peace of mind. Me and my boyfriend of almost two years had a condom failure last Sunday. I had been on the combination pill birth control for literally a entire month because the day it happened I was starting a new pack. I did the Sunday start after my period just for reference which the doctor recommended. I had pretty much religiously took them at the same time everyday except for like two or three days where I took them a few hours later but still in the evening when I normally take them. My phone had died and I have a reminder on my phone so that's why I forgot at the moment. I was so scared when we found out it had broke after he had came inside of me. The condom caught some of the sperm because you could see it but I know some of it went inside of me. Even though I had been taking birth control we went down to the store to purchase plan b. I would just rather be safe than sorry. I know sometimes people recommend taking the pill for one to two months before it is completely effective so that it is why I made the decision to take the plan b. I took it about five or six hours after the incident but then read that its not effective with a bmi over like 25 and as of right now since I haven't weighed myself in a while I think my bmi is at 28. Also the day we did it was the day after my period had ended. I don't know if that adds to my luck any but just figured I'd mention it. It's been a whole week now but I'm having some breast pain and I'm not sure if its due to pregnancy or maybe just the birth control since I'm still a little new to it or the fact that I took the plan b while on birth control. I was just wondering what my chances might be to get pregnant. I have been freaking out since the day it happened and would like a little peace of mind!

41,"  

Back in August, as we were pulling into our driveway, our neighbors of roughly 2.5 years stopped by to inform us that they were expecting a baby and were having a baby shower the coming weekend where they would be using fireworks to reveal the sex of the baby. Roughly a month later, we dropped off a card with a Target gift card inside just saying congratulations when we saw them come home one afternoon. My issue is that I am disappointed and annoyed and feel regretful that we even did this for them because they have not said thank you or dropped off a thank you card or anything. What am I missing here? I can’t imagine not providing a card or making a point to say you didn’t have to do that, thank you. And this is actually the second time, I have done something like this where the recipient did not say a word of thanks. For additional color, we are quiet and stay to ourselves just like others around us. We speak and wave a hand when we see neighbors outside. We aren’t outside a lot except when we are leaving or arriving from work or working around the house, in case this helps with any advice.

I think I should just be able to brush this off as a couple of rude people but honestly, it bothers me and I don’t want it to bother me. Also, with respect to advice and feedback, I want feedback on what is now. Not maybe they will say thanks later. The other individual never did and after several months, I feel confident they won’t either. I am not interested in asking them about it unless they initiate a conversation with us. Only then will I open that door but I will not go out of my way to initiate an inquiry about the card and gift card we gave them. They made it a point to tell us they were having a baby? So, what is this annoying, nagging irritation with these people’s behavior and how do I brush it off for good?

Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 5 years. He always says he knew from the moment he saw me he would marry [me. My](https://me.My) only problem with the relationship is he has lied before, and I have forgiven him. I am one of the most understanding people and I know he still has work to do to heal from his past, plus I have depression and shitty mental health so I know everyone is going through something. 

I was visiting him at his college for about a week, and on one of the last days I saw a text from a girl saying she found his ID in her waller. (He told me he lost it a few days back) I didnt think anything of it but asked him about it anyway. He denied it, he deleted the text, and he deleted her contact information (yes I snooped). I asked him why he lied, and he told me he doesn't know, he didnt mean to, and that he was at an event with the specific sorority (which the girl who texted him is in) and thats why she found his ID. Now, this makes sense and is fine but he told me he went to the bar the night after this all happened, but how did he get in without his only form of ID?

My heart is going to explode out of my chest. I dont know if this is me just making things up in my head or if he's just being manipulative. how do I talk to someone like this and get the truth?

49,"So I’m in college and I’m 19, I bought alcohol through a guy I know who is 21 so I can drink with my friends and at parties since most of the parties I go to have little alcohol to spare or just don’t have open bars. 

My neighbor (who I’m good friends with) and I bought alcohol from the same person and we live literally next door to each other, the person we bought from dropped off all the alcohol in my neighbors room. I wasn’t home at the time and asked my neighbor if it was cool if I leave the alcohol with her since I usually drink with her anyway and she said that was completely okay. 

Fast forward three days, I haven’t talked to her much and I haven’t really been home at the same time as her or in her room, its a Saturday morning and she had been drinking with friends in her room the night before while I had been at a concert. I ask if I can have my alcohol and she briefly looks for it before telling me that she doesn’t know where it is anymore. She almost immediately tells me that it is my fault since I left it in there and didn’t take care of it. I pointed out that she said that it was okay and I’ve done the same thing for her in the past for much longer periods of time with no problem. She proceeded to say that if I leave something in someone else’s room then whatever happens to it is my fault.

Basically what I’m asking advice on is: am I wrong for thinking that my friend should have taken better care of my stuff?

52,"# About me

I have serious problems with the constant pursuit of sensuality and sexuality our society and how much we praise looks (specially girls) and sexual accomplishments (specially guys). I used to fall into it; I had strict beauty patterns and considered a person to be successful if they were beautiful and had a beautiful partner. I've also had a very traumatic childhood and adolescence and my comfort around people has suffered from it, making me panic when someone showed interest in me, panic when I had opportunities to have sex, therefore staying a virgin for until I was older.

TL;DR: I have childhood and teenage problems that makes me have big problems with sexuality and looks, but used to be shallow.

# Our history

When I met my girlfriend she was far from my standards; both physically and personality-wise. I liked her a lot, but didn't allow myself to consider her romantically, as she did. Eventually we ended up being together and we discovered a lot of similarities in wants and personality traits that made me feel so loved. She also was very sexually inactive, because of insecurities with her body and looks and we bonded with our lack of sexual experiences. However she compensated for that in a very different manner: she openly talked a lot about sex with everyone, always curious what people like and was open to what kind of porn she liked. She also used to be complementary of people that are beautiful and at the time I kind of admired all that, even causing me great discomfort.

TL;DR: We had big differences, specially views about beauty and sexuality but it worked out great for us in the beginning. We even got sexually adventurous.

# Us and sex and my current worldview

She has a medical problem that makes it very difficult for us to have normal, penetration sex and I really don't mind, I can make her climax in many different ways and she can too. She guess felt loved with my attitude because I constantly ask her if she's happy, if she's into what we are doing, if she has fantasies about anything else and she once said that she even stopped having wet dreams with anything that isn't me and her having sex. As we matured a bit more, we stopped caring so much about it. I remember agreeing with her that sex stopped being performatic and became the pinnacle of our caring and mutual love. She agreed to that which made me feel amazing but I think I changed more than just how I used to view sex. I also became increasingly weary of sensuality and beauty as a measure of success; having people ask me why I chose her (because she's not as good looking as I am) made me disgusted! I ended up hating everything from porn to people that try hard to be good looking. I have shut myself from all that validation because if I didn't have that going for me I might as well pick a different form of success to feel good about myself.

TL;DR: We care a lot for each other and are great sexually with one another, but different than her, I grown to be very much against beauty, sensuality, sexiness and sex.

# The bomb

But recently I was blabbing about how HBO uses bodies to get numbers and I hate that. She started defending it and we ended up talking about everything: how we stopped talking about our sexual fantasies, and what we like (I didn't notice that we stopped), that she still watch porn, that she misses asking people about sex out of curiosity, that she still admire people that are sexy and ""bold enough"" to show it, that she can see people naked (can happen in some parties and with art) and admire their body, that if she had a body that she felt more comfortable, she would want to show a bit more with her clothing, but none of that means anything sexual. Doesn't mean she's sexually attracted to these people.

I was horrified with how much we didn't know about each other! I ended up sharing with her all this and all she took from it is that she's ugly and I had to shut myself to beauty in order to be with her. She's saying that I'm subconsciously calling her a slut, that I have become uptight and extreme. I'm far from being retrograde in any other topic and my opinions are not motivated by religion, so I'm feeling judged in a way that's just reductive.

It has been a week or so of this and things are only getting worse; she's studying cinema and she'll be watching and analysing Eyes Wide Shut which she is keen on rewatching and that made me very uncomfortable, she discovered that (get this) one of her classmates is one of the two people I went to bed with before her! And she's feeling that she has way more reason to feel jealous than me. The more we talk, the more we feel worlds appart. We are currently talking about ending the relationship which none of us wanted, since we are very good to each other in other areas of our lives.

TL;DR: She hasn't changed as much as I did when it comes to these things and the difference in world views feels very important and big. We have been very good to each other but we are talking about ending the relationship.

Thank you so much for reading, specially if you bared with me with the longer versions. Hopefully I didn't offend anyone and I'd love to hear from anyone that had a similar problem or just feel like you know what I'm going through.",19Nov2018,1
53,"My fiance( SO) works at a small chain restaurant as a cook. Lately his boss (BM for Boss Man) has been doing many, many things that irritate the hell out of me to the point I'm ready to confront the boss myself because it's putting such a strain on our relationship .

1.) BM changes SO's schedule with no notice. 

He'll randomly change the schedule the day before his scheduled day off without notifying him in person, changing it so he has to work the next day.  The only notice he has is an automatic email saying the schedule has changed.

2.) BM forces SO to stay late, sometimes upwards to 6 hours late.

SO will go into work at 10am, be scheduled off at 8pm. Instead he'll find out at 7:50pm he has to stay until 2am.

3.) BM schedules SO for shifts as a dishwasher without asking, and schedules part of the shift as a dishwasher so SO doesn't get cook pay.

Even though SO is a cook and dishwasher pay is $2 less an hour, he'll randomly schedule him or just plain assign him day of to be on dishwasher duty.

4.) BM will not inform SO if time off has been approved until the day before that week starts, when the schedule comes out.

Meaning if we plan to travel out of the country in 6 months, we could have everything paid for and then be told two days before that he has to stay and work.

And, every single one of those ended in getting hurt/fucked over by them. Now I'm actually in a relationship but I just don't feel the way like I did about past girls. I do genuinely care about her and all that but it's like I can't even put it into words. The feelings just aren't the same.

The main obstacle I'm trying to battle is whether this is simply not the girl for me or if the issues are in my own head. I was talking to a close friend and she said that I've surrounded myself with a wall of protection because of those past girls and I'm afraid to fall for someone again. I never thought of it that way before but I guess that might make sense. Kinda playing into that, I have never had much confidence. I often find it hard to believe people genuinely want to be around me. Like I have never really thought about myself as a desirable person and I always just sorta see myself as a bystander to everyone. Looks wise, my girlfriend is sooooo far outta my league, I still question what she sees in me. Like, she'll tell me how sexy she thinks I am when we have sex and stuff and I can't even form a response most of the time because it's like I don't believe her (sorry for explicitness). 

I know I didn't describe much here. All I can really say is what I said before. The feelings just aren't the same but I can't figure out why, if it's simple compatibility or if I've got issues I need to fix first. If anyone has experienced similar things, I'd love to hear about your experiences.

**Backstory;**

Basically, I stayed at my dad’s house for half of my summer break (end of July until early September kind of) because my step-mom was in hospital for pregnancy complications (nothing major  but she stayed there for a month or so) and they needed help taking care of their kids (ages 1, 3 and 7). I stayed at my dad’s place since he got a new job at that time. I acted like the kids full time parent for a month or more. I also took them to see their more as well as taking whatever clothes etc she needed to hospital for her. The 1 year old was taken to my dad's sisters house because it was too much for me. My aunt lives in the outskirts of the city but she was house sitting and was able to help out which was a relief.

My dad left for work early and would come back late after he'd have dinner at his sister’s house without asking if we ate or anything. I've had to do the grocery shopping a few times because he was busy and said he'd pay me back. I was very stressed and tired and didn't feel like I had the support but I didn't want to abandon my siblings when it wasn't their fault.

**These issue occurred:**

\-My dad complained numerous time that I packed clothes that didn't fit the 1 year old and he has nothing to wear. He brought this up a lot. So I got the bag that I packed for the baby, went through the clothes one by one and read the sizes out loud for him to hear. They all fit and were not small at all. He then didn't acknowledge his mistake or apologise. He just said those clothes are too cold for this weather trying to blame me. But the weather here changes really quickly. And turns out my aunt didn't wash the clothes and just said they didn't fit (??).

\-My dad would complain that a kid would get cold or something and expect me to do something about it when he sees I'm busy(give them an extra top, clothes the window or whatever). Doesn't fix it himself. Frustrated me beyond belief because he didn't do anything at home. 

\-He also never did the grocery shopping and the minute my step-mom returned home, he bought everything there is to eat. I was very disappointed and upset by this because I thought he didn't care whether we starved or not. It was stressful taking kids with me to shop as well. 

\-I stayed with them for 3 week (around that) after my step-mom returned home. She had an emergency C-section and so needed help. However, she would change the 3 year olds clothes, cook dinner etc and not ask for the help which was frustrating because then I'd feel like they'd say I didn't want to help. She wouldn't let me take over when I asked either. 

\-The 1 year old returned home because she missed him but because she couldn't take care of him, I had to. They didn’t consult me on this and I was upset. Because on top of everything I had to do, I had to take care of the baby too. 

\-The new-born was premature and tiny so she had to stay in hospital until she gained weight up to a certain point. However, she was healthy and didn't need anything but milk. The hospital requested clothes to be brought up because she needed more changing than we thought possible. My step-mom had asked me to take her to the shop so she can get those clothes. I was out with my sister and my younger siblings then but agreed. We drove all the way to my dad’s house but then my step-mom didn't get ready for a while. I asked her why and she said that we didn't seem like we wanted to go out so to forget it. I was upset, yet again, because I drove all the way there and couldn't take a 5 minute break without her feeling offended. She said that my dad will just buy those clothes. I left and was going to take my younger siblings with me but she said no. I thought it was a little weird because she couldn't take care of them so why refuse me taking them out?. So I just left without them. After I returned that night the kids were all gone. My dad came home and saw that she couldn't physically take care of them so he took them to his sister for the night. 

The next morning I felt very sick. I was dizzy and out of it a little. I went down(around 10am) for water or something. My step-mom asked if I could buy my new born sister some clothes and take milk to the hospital for her. I said that I will in a bit. I went up and just fell back asleep until 1pm. I woke up feeling a little better but found a message from my dad saying (more or less) ""Can you answer your phone. I need you to take clothes to the new baby. She has no clothes and no milk and no one cares. You just drive off enjoying your time. If it's too much for you to drop milk and clothes just give me back my car (he bought me a car that he always threatens me with) and I'll get someone else to help me. The nurse is waiting for the clothes for two days"". 

I was so upset reading that message that I just cried for about 10 minutes. I packed my stuff, dried my tears and went down. I told my step-mom what my dad said and that I will be going back home. I told her that I will still be able to help and for her to text me. I even offered to take care of my siblings at my mom’s house so that I'd also be able to do my thing (my dad hates my mom and doesn't want his kids near her though). I then went to the hospital to drop off the new-born’s milk and then bought her some clothes etc. 

A few days later I texted my stepmom saying if she needed anything to just text me. I took my step mom to an appointment that day and agreed to help with pick up and drop off my siblings to creche and school until she can drive again. However, I couldn't drop the 7 year old back home since it clashed with the hours at my new job. My dad criticised me for getting a new job because he wanted me to 'work' for them as a minder and that they'd pay me. But I thought it was weird. When would I be 'working' and when would it be me doing it to help?. So I declined. But I didn't decline to help.

**Present;** 

I think my step-mom blocked my number. I asked my dad what is going on recently(I had wanted to visit them and asked if they'd be home) and he said she doesn't want anyone(me?) there because they didn't have help after he pregnancy. This was after I left and when they didn't text or call me for help. I had gone to my dad’s house 3 times recently but no-one opened even though they were clearly home (lights on and movements). Now I understand why they didn't open. Because I wasn't welcome there anymore. 

I had lived wit my dad and step-mom for a year last year. They helped me through school and payed for things. But I'd always have to remind myself that I'm his daughter and he's supposed to take care of me. Since he wasn't there much to begin with. I thought maybe they felt that I was obliged to help since they took me in and payed for a lot (extra classes, school supplies, clothes etc).

What should I do with all this?. I'm very confused since I love my younger siblings and would love to see them. I haven't met my new-born sister except for the day I took her clothes to the hospital. But I'm clearly not welcome now. Mind you, I have other siblings and we live with our mom but I was the only one to actually help my dad and his wife out during all this. But I'm the one that's not welcome. 

Really need someone advice from a mature adult. I'm 20 and don't want to make stupid mistakes by handling this the wrong way. 

If you read this far, thank you so much! I really appreciate it. ",19Nov2018,1

Hello reddit,

I am 21 and have been currently living with my family and been going to college for about a year. I currently live overseas with one of my parents being former military and am under their status. I am currently struggling in college and am sure I do not want to be enrolled any longer. My issue is on my best options to pursue, I am not interested in joining the military, and haven't lived in USA for much time. Living where I currently am is a struggle due to me not knowing enough of the language to possibly support a career. I have really no close family or friends.

Is their any other options I have available that I am unaware of?",19Nov2018,1

So she took the cash for the rent then two days later she took the money from the bank as well out through Zelle app. The money in the bank was mine because I had lend mother in law the cash so she can pay her rent. Then when she went to the bank she would withdraw and give me my 800 back. But my sister in law kept my 800 plus her rent money. Now we found out a few days ago my in-laws might get evicted.

63,"Hey!

Imma freshman in college rn and there’s this girl who’s really caught my eye

However, my friend who knows her personally refuses to help me and I don’t have her in any of my classes

I only see her for like 5-10mins every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday because we eat lunch at the same place at the same time, but of course in that time span it’s mostly small talk.

And to make it worse she’s normally w/ her friends so it’s not the best chance to make a move. I’ve only got about three weeks left to get her info

Should I just go for it next time I see her or do I give up? I’m kinda dry option wise. And if it’s go for it, what should I say? Should I just be direct or do make up a reason for me to get her info?

Thanks!

64,"Hi okay this is going to be kind of a mess because I’m so stressed. 

I have worked at my job for five years. I won’t name the company, but it’s a cosmetic store and I am a certified artist for the company. Since April, we have had 6 artists but in reality we should have 25. Unfortunately, last weekend one of our artists passed away suddenly. While the company has been great about taking care of us and making sure we’re all doing okay, we are now even more understaffed. 

I am also a student and am taking 18 hours this semester, and I graduate in May. I’m supposed to be part time, but since April I’ve worked 50 hours a week. We are getting busier now since it’s almost Black Friday and Holidays are approaching quickly. Things are also getting busier with school as finals are approaching. 

I have tried many times to talk to management about this issue, but we recently got a new store director (head manager) and she told me today that hiring new people is not a priority or her. 

I am beyond stressed and I’m at my limit. I don’t know what to do. I have developed a stress rash on my neck and chest, and my left eye has been twitching for the last two weeks. I go to work for a ten hour shift, get off of work and stay up doing homework and writing papers until 5 am, and then get about 2 hours of sleep, and then go to class all day and repeat that every single day. I am absolutely exhausted but I LOVE my job and I LOVE the company I work for. I am not in a position to quit and find a new job, nor do I want to. Every other artist feels the exact way that I do. The guilt of leaving everyone hanging and in an even worse situation would eat me up. 

What should I do? I don’t know who I need to talk to, and it very much feels like I have no control of this situation. I

Do you know how much work I do?"". She's tried opening up to her mom multiple times, but each times she's said that. And when she brought it up with her dad, he just ignored it.

69,"Hey everyone, so you’ve read the title so I’m gonna jump right in. So there’s this guy, let’s call him Scott, who a friend and I are kind of interested in. We both knew each other were a bit interested in Scott calling him hot and what not. A few weeks back me, Scott, and a large group of friends were chilling in a residence that isn’t where I live or where he lives. I started to get tired &amp; said I was heading to mine which is right next door. He got off the bed and said he’d walk me back which I found really sweet because his dorm is on the opposite side of the campus in the other direction.  We got to the doors &amp; I hugged him &amp; said thanks &amp; that was all. As the days went on I didn’t fully engage him just out of fear of losing her as a friend over a guy &amp; although we both had him on social media, she was the one with a Snapchat streak with him. 

So flash forward to two nights ago. I was talking with him at times, she was talking to him at times.. nothing serious. The first thing I noticed was when I went into his friends room to grab something from my coat he bolted in &amp; refused to leave when his friend followed me in. When his friend called him out saying “why are you in here acting like this is your room” he started to ramble saying “well I just wanted to go with her what’s wrong with that, I get it’s not my room” Towards the middle of the night Scott says to me “can I tell you something? you know you’re my favorite, sh” &amp; puts his finger to his mouth. I was really caught off guard because this was the first time I was made aware he actually had something for me. A bit after this I saw Scott talking with a friend of his lowly with both of them looking from my friend to me then back and forth. I walked by and noticed that hushed so I just said  “you two look like you’re up to something”. 


Well jump to the next morning when I’m at the dining hall with a different friend (friend who is interested him not present). I’m eating with one of Scott’s frat brothers so they all sit around us. Me and Scott are talking casually and he keeps mentioning for me to join him &amp; his brothers at this event on campus saying  it’ll be fun &amp; really trying to get me to go. Finally I give in and go. My friend (his frat brother) needs to go get a coat from his room &amp; asked me to join him. Scott then runs up behind me &amp; my friend &amp; the rest of his brothers are shouting for him to come with them. Scott keeps saying “no no, She really needs my help. I got to help her get ready. No seriously it’s all good I’ll catch you guys”. Once I let Scott know I wasn’t getting ready I was just walking a friend up to grab a coat he leaves. During this event he keeps saying things like “wow you’re so small” “you’re so thin” “you probably weigh like what 100 pounds” “I should just pick you up &amp; we’ll win” and also staying by me the whole time. After the event I was going back to my dorm &amp; he asked if I was coming to the party that night &amp; when I told him yes he said something along the lines of “amazing”.  About an hour later he snaps me how tired he is after doing the service &amp; I respond. I was really excited by this but after he left me on open. 

Now to last nights party. There he kept asking me to play drinking games with him and also kept holding a hand over my ass when he would put his arms around me (lol). I think at this point my friend who likes him too noticed &amp; pulled me aside &amp; said “it’s all good if you want to get with Scott tonight, he’s interested in you I can tell I won’t be mad”.  I told her great thank you and that was all. I pulled him aside again &amp; asked if I was still his favorite &amp; he goes “oh yeah absolutely”. Also, I happened to make a comment to get the ball rolling to him about how my roommate was out of town &amp; he says “good to know, good to know” in a flirty matter. Later on mostly everyone left (including the friend who had a mutual liking to him). It was just me, him, my other friend, the guy she’s with and another. Around 3:30 my friend and I walked back together by ourselves which kind of got me upset bc I was hoping he would walk me back again.

Now today; after he snapped me first yesterday I was hoping to start a streak and was the first to snap him today. I’m gonna keep this part short but basically he opened it and hasn’t responded all day. I was with my friend who gave me the green light &amp; has a streak with him &amp; asked has he been snapping her today. She said yes. Oh yeah &amp; also as I was with her, he sent her a snap saying his roommates gone &amp; he has the room to himself. She knew what he was insinuating but replied making a joke of it &amp; he left her on read.

I’m totally lost and confused when it comes to this guy as it seems he’s toying with me and my friend. 

How do I go about this?

70,"I'm currently working part-time in retail. I applied to medical school and ended up getting 9 interviews. I needed time off for these interviews, so I requested ~18 days off over the span of 3 months. This comes out to be about 6 days per month, which I know sounds like a lot but as part time it's actually less than I'd usually get off. Now the thing is my work rejected these days off, so I went ahead and got coworkers to cover these days and let my manager know. She was fine with it, but yesterday the general manager got at me for it and told me the people I'm switching with aren't showing up (everyone I've switched with told me they showed up) and that this is an attendance issue on my part. The only choice they've left me with is either show up to work when scheduled and miss out on the interviews or quit and go to the interviews.

My wife and I have been friends since middle school, and dating since high school. She played sports throughout school and therefore was in shape. Since then she stays at home, and watches our daughter while I work, therefore physical activity is almost nonexistent. I genuinely don’t care that my wife’s figure had changed. I’m not big on looks, and love her for who she is personality-wise. She doesn’t let me really take any photos of her, and hasn’t since she gave birth.

I’m becoming extremely frustrated, because I’m a black and white kind of guy. You don’t like something, change it, don’t wanna change it, then learn to like it. I just want to know the right approach, as I feel like her current mindset is beginning to put a strain on our marriage.",19Nov2018,1
76,"So a little backstory, I'm a third year college student with a strange major that doesn't offer many opportunities post graduation other than going to get my masters. I was always scared with the question ""what do you want to do with your life,"" and I still am. I know I shouldn't be asking Reddit which direction my life should go but I just cant help to hear input from strangers.

All my life growing up I was dead set on going into the military right after high-school, but that all changed when I discovered marijuana my junior year. Since then I just never cared to think to hard about the subject and tried to push it to the back of my mind. But now that I'll be graduating in a little over a year, and still don't have a clue on what I want to do, I'm a little worried. When I came to college I was undecided, and after taking a philosophy course second semester Freshman year I became very fond of knowledge and questions that have been unanswered. Not wanting to major in basic philosophy I decided to pick a major that involved philosophy but wasn't limited to it. The major I ended up declaring is called Philosophies, Politics, Economics and Law (PPEL for short). When I declared this major I talked to my parents off and on for a few days and in the end I decided I wanted to go to law school. Or so I thought. Now that I'm almost completed with college I'm torn between three paths that are: 
A.) Go to law school 
B.) Move to a legal state and work in the marijuana industry
C.) Work for an NGO and help people in developing countries around the world 

I feel like I just told my parents I wanted to be a lawyer to stop them from worrying I wasn't going to end up doing anything with my life. I know I could do it, but I just don't know if I'd enjoy doing it. I don't to go through more school just to end up hating what I put majority of my time and effort into becoming, but I feel that if I don't take this path I'd just be letting my parents down. But I still think being a lawyer would be awesome and if I did go down this path I told myself that my end goal was to become a judge or enter into the political sphere. I just don't know if this option will truly bring me happiness in life and that's my main reason for second guessing what I want right now. 

As I said before I really like to smoke weed and honestly without it I might not be here today. I was really suicidal in highschool and when it was introduced to me it became my little paradise away from home and my troubles, because of that I feel as though I owe my life to it. But, living in an illegal state I don't have any opportunities to get involved with the industry so I wouldn't even know where to begin with that. If I could surround myself with the thing that makes me happy and in turn provide the source of my happiness to other people I would love to do that! I just don't know how. 

Now this third option of me working for an NGO is kind of a new one. I had always wanted to go on a mission trip, but by the time I was old enough to actually go on one money was tight in my family and we just couldn't afford it. Because of this I sort of just said ""oh well"" and forgot about it, until now. Recently in a class we were learning about developing countries and whats being done to help them and as I was reading the text and sitting in lecture all I could think about is 'why are we talking about this and but doing anything to help'. Something inside of me is tired of sitting around all day thinking of my own problems and pushing me to go and help other people. But with all of this, I would have no clue what organization I would want to be apart of. I would hate to be a part of the organization and just sit behind a desk and take calls, I want to get my hands dirty and go to the source of the problem and do whatever I can to help. 

I know it is up to me in the end so I guess I just need some advice on how to decide what I want to do. I know I have the potential to succeed in all three of these options but I just don't know which one is best suited for me. And I fear if I go down one path I'll find out I should have gone down a different one once its too late. So I'm basically asking for advice on what your personal opinions are, how I should go about ""soul searching"" to figure out what I want to do, and if the person reading this has gone down any of the three paths I've laid out, what was it like and what should I expect?

77,"Okay so these people moved in about 2 weeks ago and ever since then they slam the doors so hard that we feel the vibration from our apartment. Then to top it off they constantly fight outside by the window, screaming and cursing with no care, like today I was scrolling through Netflix and I hear a fight outside so I sit back to where I can still see the free show going on outside and the next thing I see is a guy on the roof of a car while the chick is driving off.

79,"So some background. The nature of my job means that I rotate through several different positions during 2 years. This means it’s all over the country as well. I’m due to move in a couple months for my next one. Now this phase is due to end soon, next July. Thing is I can’t say for sure I’m going to stay in my next position, for various reasons (such as me liking it, them having space, etc.). In fact, I have no idea where I’m going to be next July.

Initially, this didn’t bother me much. My first position was a long one, so I didn’t realize it at the time. Now though, with my second position about to end soon, I’m realizing some drawbacks. While it’s undoubtedly very cool to move around and see the country, it’s made other aspects of life difficult, like friendships and most of all relationships. Dating is tough as it is, and without any guaranteed sense of permanency, it’s even tougher. It’s been a goal of mine for a while, and this is making it more difficult. 

Really what’s bothering me is the uncertainty next. There’s a lot that could happen and I don’t really know for sure what the outcome will be, I’m not really sure how to deal with this. 

Thanks in advance all. ",19Nov2018,1
80,"I'm a gay woman and have been with my wife for 4 years next week, married 2 of those years. I have been with men before, and have an 11 year old daughter from an old relationship. I have been struggling a lot with depression that stems from many different things, but mostly our struggle with trying to have a baby. We found out earlier this year that she is infertile and we are slowly going through the whole process of doing what is needed. The whole thing has really taken a toll on me, mentally. It's been a roller coaster for me and it's also been a couple months since we've had sex. The depression eats away at my sex drive so that really puts a damper on things. 
So it's been several months now that I've been having serious desires to have sex with a man and I don't know how to tell her about it. I know I need to but I'm so scared she's going to lose her trust in me. I have not acted on any of it but the desire is not going away and I don't know what I could even offer as a real solution. I love her so much but I'm terrified this could break her.

82,"So, it seems I'm in a somewhat unique situation compared to all the other times this has been asked. Most people asking are either in high school (where you can talk to other people in your school, meet others at other schools, etc), college (where there are girls and guys everywhere you look), and post-college (where you can go to bars or other meetups and find people that way). None of those really work for me though, because I'm on a gap year.

I've graduated high school, and am 18. This means I can't go to any bars (which is where a lot of meetups seem to be). I also can't meet girls through school, since I'm obviously not in school. I can't meet them through my friends, since most of my friends have left town for college and the couple that are still around are guys. Plus I wouldn't really feel comfortable asking the people still in high school to set me up (I tried with a few, but it didn't work out or they didn't want to, and the other friends there I wouldn't really want to ask). And it seems most public meetups and stuff generally skew higher in terms of age -- while I'd be cool going out with a 25-year-old, I doubt she'd be cool going out with me.

One thing I thought is that there's a university right near me (Stanford), meaning there would be girls around my age. It seems weird socially though hanging around there (which I've done a few times, because one of my friends is there) not being a student, and it's hard to meet up with people since their life and schedule revolves around school. Like I can't get lunch with someone if they're in class, and there's a disconnect between the social scene there and mine.

What do you guys think I should do?",19Nov2018,1
83,"So, I’m in high school and I was at a party last night. It was going great, I was getting along great with all my friends, many of whom are female, and we were all having a great time. Well, to keep things short, we ended up all watching a movie, while one of my friends cuddled with me in the corner. Pretty normal, I’m a touchy person and we’re all physically comfortable with each other. Well, as everyone was falling asleep, she started to get all up on me a little, stroking my chest, and gently sticking her hand down my pants under the blanket we shared. Things kept progressing, and I eventually fingered her to climax while she stroked me. It was just sexy fun. We cuddled more after and we weren’t too awkward about it really. I just don’t know what to do now. Dating her would be messy for reasons I can’t get into here, but it was fun. Ideally I’d talk to her and we’d agree it was just fun and we were being stupid, but we are good friends and I don’t wanna mess up. I also really don’t want this to get out because it’s very unlike me. Should I even say anything? Got any advice?",19Nov2018,1
84,"Basically, this guy I met at school liked me. Let’s call him Dave. He used to always ask me and my friends ( that he befriended to get closer to me ) for my number. I kept refusing and telling him that I don’t really give out my number to people I just met. Anyways I always knew he liked me because he would tell everyone, but expect me to not know 😂. For my birthday he bought me presents but I couldn’t accept them because I didn’t feel like I deserved them and he gave them to his best friend who’s birthday was the same day as mine. Dave kept bugging me nonstop for my contact info or to talk in private and I just got fed up with it one day. I just “exploded” and started yelling and crying. I just told Dave that it isn’t a good time and that I’m not interested in what he wants. I decided to distance myself from the situation and the scene I just made in front of a bunch of people that probably publicly embarrassed him. When I left I literally heard people behind my back talk about why I don’t just go for it. They expected me to like this guy just because he was giving me presents, being nice to me, and having a crush on me. One of my friends ended up giving him my old email address and I would get messages confessing his love towards me and I just kept ignoring them. The next year I didn’t have to see him anymore so I didn’t really have interaction with him since then. 

Today I was looking at my old email address’s messages and I started tearing up as I saw he sent an email to me three years ago asking me how I was doing. I didn’t realize how blind I have been and how mean I was cutting him off. I never really let him tell me he liked me directly and I kept running away. 

Now what I want advice on is if I should reply to this three year old email and apologize for being stupid...

87,"So I recently discovered I'm in love with my best friend. We're both girls. She's been my best friend for 10 years. i don't really care that she's a girl. Ive only ever had crushes/dated guys. but she's actually the only person I've ever felt anything strong for. i just felt weird about it cause its my best friend and we have all the same friends and I KNOW she doesn't reciprocate these feelings. So these emotions being one-sided make it really embarrassing and awkward so i haven't told anyone about how I've been feeling. and it put a rift between us for a couple of months because i was avoiding her. And i finally wrote her a letter telling her that i have feelings for her( i didn't say i was in love with her i thought that would be too intense). She sent me a text immediately afterwards saying no matter what I'm always gonna be her best friend. So this week i was just trying to text her like we normally would and she's been kind of ignoring me. I hung out with her today and brought it up and she said she was just processing. So hanging out today was fun, it felt normal. But now that I've admitted my feelings it kinda makes them even more real to me and i'm feeling really depressed that i can't act on them. like not even in a sexual way but just in an affectionate way. Im afraid to even hug her. i don't want to make her uncomfortable. i don't even know if she is uncomfortable. she really hasn't told me anything about what she thinks of this whole thing. She said i would get a response letter but its been a week and i haven't gotten anything. I just feel really insecure about everything. And i don't want to bring anything up and ask her because i don't want to keep bothering her. she doesn't really like confrontation. I don't know what to do.

We had decided to continue on the friendship and one day she decided that I wasn't texting her as friendly as usual (periods, no eclamantion point) I admit that's true, but I just wasn't feeling talkative. She accused me of trying to start shit, my character was attacked, and I was treated as someone constantly trying to run her over. It disturbed me the most when she told me I ""wasnt"" allowed to talk to her that way. I told her I apologized for upsetting her but I didn't appreciate getting this message when she knew I was going to an event that was important to me. (That was my last message) She responded the next morning saying she was justified because of something I did and apologized for mulitple times. 

I deleted the message from my phone since I knew there wasn't anything productive from responding. She would tell me how it was all my fault or she wasn't going to walk on eggshells around me. I never heard from her nor did I contact her after that. It has been two months now. This person was my closet friend. I didn't intend to pretty much kill the friendship.

I've read going to the movies is not a very good idea. But I don't have any ideas on what to do since it's winter time and it's going to be Black Friday. If I score a date, what should I wear to it?

96,"(23/M/USA)

I haven't really felt any emotions in over a year and I'm not sure what to do about it. I am neutral about pretty much everything that happens in my life.

Sometimes, this can be helpful. For example, if I have a lot of deadlines approaching at work, I just sit down and work on them. I don't really feel stressed about it.

However, it has been extremely detrimental to my relationships. It is difficult for me to hold conversations with people because I feel extremely apathetic towards them and most of the things they say. I have gotten very good at faking it though, so I have plenty of friends and people don't hate me or anything.

It gets even worse in romantic relationships because I can feel attraction, and a desire to share experiences with someone and make them happy, much of the time it feels insincere. It's extremely frustrating, and I'm having a hard time putting this into words. It's like knowing deep down that I do love this person, but my emotions and feelings are so muted, it's like everything it's like they're swimming out on the beach and I'm buried in the sand at the bottom of the ocean. I'm present but very distant and just numb.

The obvious issue here is that I am depressed. And I am. I'm just not sure what to do about it, or rather, what a medical professional could do about it, so I'm hesitant to pay to go see one.

I have been to therapy before, and that helped immensely with dealing with the other side of my depression; the self-loathing, anxiety, self-defeating and negative thought patterns, and stuff like that. It helped me identify problematic things that I was doing to myself.

The issue I am having now though isn't a trigger, or a thought pattern, or something that I feel that can be helped with therapy. I just have no emotions. There's nothing happening on a daily or weekly basis to make me feel like this. There is nothing going wrong in my life. I'm financially stable, have loving friends and family, I have tons of hobbies, I have pets, etc. I honestly can't name a single thing about my life that I would change, except that I can't feel anything.

I worked at a camp because I like camp I worked with the kids at the gym because I need gas money and insurance money cuz I got a car and it would be an easy job to get also it’s not taking up my whole weekend and I happen to be good with kids.

102,"hey all, I am trying to decide which of my potential living situations for my next lease are most sensible, and will provide a little background for my three options and weigh the pros/cons - if folks are willing to help me consider the best situations that would be much appreciated :) 

a) I currently live with two friends my age (23), one of whom is a good friend from college and the other is her boyfriend. They are getting married soon, a couple months after our next lease will need to be signed, and they are trying to decide whether they want to get their own place, or to find another place with me and/or someone else. I completely understand them wanting to get their own place if they did, as its what I would want in their situation, but they are considering having a roommate or two still during their first year of marriage

b) another friend of mine (25), is currently in a temporary living situation, and plans to do month to month and possibly start a lease with me when my current one is up, in a new place we find. He's also single and living just as two single dudes sounds like a nice change of pace, particularly moving to another part of Brooklyn that has more people our age. He has an 18 month old toddler who lives with his ex-wife, who he's able to see only a couple days a week at this point but hopefully he'll get a few days with him soon

c) my parents recently separated, and my dad is looking to possibly move to the city and bounced the idea of living together for a year while he figures his shit out. We have a great relationship, and at this point in our lives (65 and 23 respectively) are very buddy-buddy for a father-son relationship, but I am a little concerned that living in a two-bedroom apartment with my dad might be a little strange to bring women home to - not for him but for them. For any ladies on here, particularly those in their twenties, would that be weird for you? Obviously if I get into a more serious relationship I would want to live either with another person my age or possibly a girlfriend in that scenario, but not putting the cart before the horse, I am curious of what women think about going to a guy's place when you're in your twenties to learn his roommate is his dad

I feel ostracized from everyone my age and hate how a good high school experience from my POV is dependent on being popular or good looking (they’re synonymous in my eyes). I’m basically banking on the thought that it’ll get better in the future, and that everyone who thought they were the shit, or was a druggie, or didn’t focus on school is going to realize they peaked in high school. Does this actually happen? And what are things I can do to make high school suck less in general?",19Nov2018,1
106,"To have a better chance of going to a college of my choosing, I’ve resigned myself to take a bunch of AP classes and take a lot more extracurricular classes than last year. I don’t know what I want to do in the future so I’m kinda just trying everything I can. While for many years, I was able to put that at the back of my mind and just grind out all the work I had to do, I feel that life is just getting boring and stressful. I’m not intrinsically motivated to do anything which causes me to procrastinate and lose sleep. I used to play video games to alleviate some stress from my school day but even that is becoming frustrating and not a stress reliever. I don’t want to quit my classes and activities because I don’t want to feel like I’ve screwed up my future but I’m also finding it increasingly difficult to live each day like I’m struggling to survive. My purpose in life is really vague and I don’t know what to do with myself. Does anyone have suggestions? I just feel that I can’t get anything done the way I am right now.",19Nov2018,1

108,"Hello everyone, so as the tittle suggests I just moved into a new apartment. My issue is that I’m starting from ground zero. No pots, no spoons, no nothing. Looking on the bright side of things this is fine. I get to start brand new, it just may take me a while. The real issue is that I don’t want to. After moving I’ve realized no body, not even my parents are interested in coming over to visit. So, in my mind I just have this hole in a wall that happens to have WiFi. There isn’t any point in decorating, or cooking. I work and study to much anyway. I’ve heard the advice “ you just need to do it for yourself “ ya ok I get that. I know I’m being cynical but I feel really alone in this new place and it’s getting to me. I don’t know what to do.

109,"This is a throw away account, just for my paranoia.

&amp;#x200B;

So today my Amazon account had some weird transactions on it (some guy had bought a couple of Playstation gift cards and some books). I was able to lock him out of that and my email after like two hours. I called Amazon to ask that to be looked into because the main payment method was my old cancelled card and my mom's (I'm a minor).  But later I found out that he had just added gift cards to my account and had spent them. After getting him locked out and stuff he returned one of the books, which was worth about 80$, so that gift card money is still sitting in my account. 

&amp;#x200B;

About an hour ago Amazon emails me, I'll put a sinip it here without the order number in of course:

 "" Our account specialist will investigate for this concern and you will be refunded for this unknown charges.

I'll definitely look into this for you. We realize that this experience may influence your decision to visit our stores again but we still hope you'll give us another chance to prove the quality of our service to you. Rest assured we will do everything we can to help make your next experience more rewarding.  
Again, I would like to apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced and express our gratitude for the patience you've displayed.

Please be assured that we are always here to take care for any concerns of our valuable customers like you, and I hope that I have helped you somehow. ""

&amp;#x200B;

So they said 'refund' but the guy didn't buy anything with my money, he just spent like 300$ in his own gift cards.

I'm thinking Amazon doesn't know that the guy used gift cards, I assume that they will find it out when they do the investigation. But if they don't, what am I to do? My mom told me to report it to them and not spend it, otherwise they'll take it from my bank account ( but I took off all my payment methods from my account after I found the guy buying stuff). So what should I do if they don't realize what really happened? I could really use the money to set up a room for a charity event I'm apart of, but I don't want Amazon coming for me. Like I'm a Prime member so idk if that changes the situation. Any Advice would be super welcomed!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Guy used gift cards on my Amazon account, I don't think Amazon realizes that and might give me the 300$ in refunds, and my mom wants me to report that it isn't mine or Amazon will hunt down my bank account if I spend any of it.

She has always told me that I do nothing at home and that I am not worth anything to my family and this household. And just recently she just told me to go kill myself because maybe her and my dads life would be easier. She and I has never been really good to each other since she always told me that I always hang out with men all the time and have sex with them (Which I do not do) She came to that conclusion because when we had a fight one time I didn’t come home and stayed with a friend. She assumed that I went out drinking and hang out with guys.

So anyway recently, I have been contemplating on killing myself because of certain circumstances mostly involving my mom, thats why I haven’t been going to school for around 6 days already. I needed time to think and reflect, My mom then found out about me not coming to class and has been calling me nonstop so I answered her call and she is very angry, she called my teachers and guidance counselors to talk about where I am and who Im with but they had no idea since Im staying with a friend. So when I answered her calls she kept o telling me how much I was a slut and good for nothing, and that I always sleep with boys.

115,"TL;DR: we're friends, and I want to hint that I like him so we don't have a falling out if he doesn't like me back and need ways to hint at it

This guy and I (F) are both in college, and we are good friends. We get food together a few times a week, and we are at this same weekly social event. The issue is that I want to be more than friends, but everything I would ask him to do on a date is something we already do. 

For instance, we've been to shows together, though with other people involved, and as I said we get food together a lot. Sometimes it's alone; mostly it's with one or two of our mutual friends. I know he's very busy during the week, and I am also very busy, so it's also an issue of when we would actually do this. When I've asked him to do things alone in the past (go to the movies, watch the newest episode of a tv show) , he has said maybe and then nothing has come of it. 

One of my friends suggested I should be more physical, like touching his arm or something, and I've tried to do that a little, but in general I am very uncomfortable with touching people. When we sit next to each other, our legs touch, but it's unclear if this means something or if, more likely, he just needs space because he's a dude. 

Overall, I am unsure whether he would be into us dating. He dated once in high school, but it wasn't serious, and I have never dated. Like I said, we're both busy. We have several inside jokes together, and very often one of us will respond to something someone else has said and then the other person will go, ""I was about to say that"" (or something like that). I've talked to one of our mutual friends about this, who I would say is probably his best friend, and he made a really good point that the guy I like is just a very happy person in general so he's not on the lookout for people being interested in him. 

I don't want to just come out and say it because if he doesn't like me back that way, it could be very awkward. For one, I do like him as a friend as well, and I'd be very sad to lose his friendship. Secondly, we run in a very similar friend group. Thirdly, we both go to the same weekly event that I mentioned above, and we kind of run it, and I don't want that to become awkward and the group to suffer. 

What are some ways I can feel out what he's thinking or maybe give him an inkling that I like him and see if that seed takes root?",19Nov2018,1

128,"So I've been with who we'll call 'strawberry' for 7 years now. We got together when we were really young and we have kids now but from the start of our relationship it was a shitshow. First year in our relationship we broke up a couple times and both did some stupid shit with other people whom we didn't care about, we almost been in this limbo of constant on/off arguing, hating each other and can't stand being without eachother. So guess that where my paranoia stems from because I have never really forgotten about what she did and with who and I suppose due to my own lack of self confidence, I tried to get back at her and I haven't forgiven myself or her. Even though we're still so deep in our relationship and it's been years I can't forget this shit.
But back to today, strawberry started going back to school in September (again we were really young we we got together and had kids when we turned 20). Recently she's started acting different with me for the last couple months. And in passing she keeps mentioning the same guy 'seaweed' let's call him. I normally wouldn't think much of it and until about a couple day ago I didn't. 
I've think I'm going crazy connecting 1000 dots that may not connect or at least hoping that I'm am crazy and completely wrong.
So the story with seaweed is hes only guy she can speak to apparently in her class because she doesn't get on with anyone else. She started smoking since she started school and seaweed even 'gifted' her a couple packets of tobacco. About a month ago she springs into conversation that he happened to grab her arse in class one day(baring in mind seaweed is 30yo dude) and told me not to get mad as she reported it to the school already. At the time seemed like she didn't mean to tell me the story but did anyway. She transferred class recently because she wanted to do something else but yeah coupls days ago she brings him up again and says in random conversation about college that he's slept with half the class. (Me wondering why she's bringing him up again) 
Strawberrys always been a secretive person but recently shes been even more so. Won't let me near her phone keeps it under her pillow and on airplane mode at night. Accusing me loads of cheating and saying constantly that I'm going to leave her, which is making me feel like shit constantly atm. 
Today was curious about seaweed so go to his Facebook page only to notice that strawberry and seaweed are no longer friends but see public post from seaweed directly tagging strawberry not long before she transferred. 
She's going on a holiday tomorrow as a bday present from her family and I don't want to ruin it for her because she does work hard and if I wrong how much of a cunt am I if I bring it up now? 
So end up to my conclusion where I am sad and lonely and confused not really sure what to do or what to think at almost 5 in the morning. I've come to r/advice for help.
Tldr: think I'm going crazy overthinking shit unnecessarily or could be right not sure.

I don't think I have a lot of empathy. After moving away from my parents and in with my partner, I keep my social interactions to an absolute minimum. I hate talking to my family on the phone, and sometimes I find it hard just to text (and I never initiate conversations). I have no friends since moving. Just my partner and maybe an online friend or two whom I struggle to keep in contact with. I want to be more social, but in a more selfish way I just want to live alone and not have to work on relationships.

Christmas is coming up and with it, my fear of gifts. I tell everyone not to get me anything. I have this weird, twisted mindset where I never want anyone to get me things or do me favors. I don't know why, but I don't like feeling like I owe people. Or maybe I feel like I don't deserve the love. I honestly don't know. The worst part is I don't want them to give me gifts because I know deep down, I don't want to give them gifts in return.

Every year I become paralyzed with the thought of buying them things. First of all, they're not easy to shop for. They don't have things they really love that I can get each year (or I'm not empathetic enough to realize what they would like). Second, I'm broke and living paycheck to paycheck. We just spent all of our savings on emergency after emergency the past 3 months. I honestly don't want to spend a dime on anyone besides myself right now. Third, they're hundreds of miles away, so it's not like I can take them out to dinner or spend more time with them. All I can do is send things in the mail.

Anyway, I don't know what I'm really looking for by posting here, but maybe some of you have been in a similar situation and can offer some advice.

138,"Hi, first time posting so go easy on me.

My(25F) mother and sisters asked my husband(32M) and I to host/cook Thanksgiving dinner. They are now extremely upset about the recipe we chose for the turkey.

A little background: typically we have Thanksgiving at my grandmother's, my moms, or my sisters house. Usually it consists of about 15 people. Usually the turkey is prepared the way my grandmother has done it. Plain. Butter, salt &amp; pepper on top. Stuffing inside. The recipe we chose(with their tastes in mind) is very basic, fresh herbs etc and just adds some flavor. Nothing crazy.

So I casually told my mother about the recipe we chose. She instantly said no one would like it and went on about traditions etc. I had not even considered the fact that we would be expected to preapare the turkey a certain way. I didnt think it was a big deal. My sisters agree with my mother that it should be prepared the same as always. (3 of 15ish people, no one else cares)

My husband feels insulted, as do I. They asked us to cook and now complain about the recipe?!? Without even tasting it? I find it incredibly rude. They say we are being selfish and only cooking what we like. Not true we specifically chose that recipe for them. It is not what we would cook for oursleves. I tried to tell them that they dont care. So, I told them we will not be told how to cook in our own house, for ungrateful people. They can cook their plain, unseasoned turkey themselves!

In my life, she’s the most trash and worthless human being I’ve ever come across personally. I haven’t had a conversation with her for years and if we do “talk”, there’s curse words thrown all over the place. The damage she’s done to my family will never fade, no matter what she does. In the beginning, she was a minor who ran away in the middle of the night around 2 am constantly and my family always called the police on her because they thought she went missing. All she did was hang out with the wrong people and do drugs. As a child, I would wake up a few times a week with police at our door at 3am because they would find her and bring her back home or inform us she’s going to juvenile hall. Every year goes by and she constantly gets worse. She started doing meth before she hit 18 and she’s well over 20 today still doing it. She comes home banging on the door, kicking and screaming to let her in. She lost all respect for everyone and she has absolutely no shame. She yells and swears at my parents or ignores them when they argue with her. She does meth inside the house when everyone is sleeping. She’s been in and out of juvenile hall when she was younger and in jail many times for doing drugs or breaking other people’s properties. She never went to rehab and my parents can’t force her to go to one because she’s over 18. My dad and mom talked to countless district attorneys and judges to see whether they can force her to go to one and all of them said no, only if she exhibits some kind of harm to the community or signs herself in. The only thing my parents could do is to get a restraining order against her which was mentioned by EVERY single police officer, attorney and judge. However, they never will do it. I constantly argue to them about getting one, especially my mom since she’s the only one in the house who wants her to stay, to get one and we can finally sleep at night with no banging and screaming. I feel so bad for our neighbors and those who live near us. We live in a pretty great neighborhood with amazing people who encourage us to kick her out, but my mom won’t listen. My mom thinks my sister will magically be fixed one day. I always ask her what she plans to do to help my sister out and she doesn’t respond with one. She feels as if she kicks my sister out, it’s my her fault that my sister dies due to drugs. I told my mom that if she dies under this roof, it’s your responsibility since you provided her with everything she needed. I constantly tell my mom that she enables my sister’s addiction by giving her a roof, food and water. Why would my sister stop when she has all the basic necessities? She’s never worked a day in her life either. You can tell today, her cognitive ability has dropped dramatically due to meth. She constantly plays with light switches, breaks windows, bangs and shuts doors extremely loudly. I honestly believe there is no recovering from what she’s done. If you take an MRI of her brain, I doubt there’s anything left of it. 

I’ve developed sleep insomnia and I can tell all the stress with school and home is getting to me. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.

145,"I realized that I developed a “pity party” mindset because I didn’t learn appropriate ways to seek affection and support. The fact that my mom has BPD and probably Munchausens syndrome (I believed I was mentally disabled 2005-2018) and I have BPD, several eating disorders, and a delusional disorder (believed I was a prophet and had special powers) complicates things further.

I want to get out of this toxic mentality but I feel that if I adopt the view of “life is good overall though there are some negative experiences” it means that I have an easy/sheltered life, haven’t experienced “real” adversity, and am not deserving of support or compassion.",19Nov2018,1

148,"I finished up a seasonal job in the end of October. It was at an amusement park in my area which has 2 sister parks close by. All three parks are declining to various degrees and there is a lot of issues with them. High prices and a lot of stuff closed. I see the changes myself as I went to the park yearly besides working there for 4 months and it saddens me to see it the way it is becoming.

I am looking into getting a job in my field, I graduated in May and have been furthering my education since with classes online and a certification. But in interviews they use this experience at this job as an ice breaker of sorts but I know to see how I feel about this place. It is very famous for my area and 98% of people worked there or its sisters or have been there as kids. But they ask me very pointed questions such as why there are high prices, no upkeep, and everything closed. I honestly do not know the answer to these questions in for a fact. My park my last month of employment never made $500 profit in my department, due to weather and prices. No one showed up due to rain and I was often sent home along with many others.

I do not hold an anger towards working at this amusement park, I am one of the few who do not. I treated it as a job, and it worked out well for me. For as many problems there were there were a lot, there were positives. I got free lunches, and giftcard, and for most of my employment there was making almost $9 an hour (I had a 3 mile commute so it was straight in my pocket money).

If they company called me up and offered me a job in my field I would go back next season. I left without burning any bridges so I know I will be offered employment there again next year, but I am not looking to work there next season.

How should I handle very pointed questions about my former employer? I feel this is a trap question for me as I honestly do not know the answer at all. I have some idea of what is going on but nothing concrete and its more than 1 issue.

I have an interview with a company who I know ahas a company picnic with one of the sisters parks. So I know I will get some question about this job and I want to know how to handle it correctly.",19Nov2018,1
149," I'm 15 and a sophomore in high school. See, I've actually been very academically talented throughout my years in school and because of that I've essentially skipped a grade and am now taking some college courses alongside 11th grade advances classes. That's all great, except this year hasn't been going so well. I get to school, try my hardest to stay awake the first two classes, then I sleep in my art class, blah blah blah, you get the gist. The most fun I have during school is my free period where I go to my band room and hang out, and during music theory which is also in the band room. I feel so comfortable and free in there, whereas every other class is a mess of anxiety. Not social, but just the fear of knowing I have so much classwork and I can't keep up. In my English we're reading The Scarlet Letter, the test over the whole book is Tuesday, I haven't read a single page yet. I struggle reading it as I just lose focus and can't seem to grasp any concept of it and find myself rereading the same sentences many times trying to understand it. I'm also failing art despite actually being kinda artistic. I just don't do the work. And that's pretty much how it is. All D's and C's except for music theory, in which *I have an A+*. When I get home from school I just like to play guitar and sing, work on my solo album I'm making, work on things for my band... I can just never get the motivation for school work. I'll start doing some and a second later I'm just instantly out of it, and all I wanna do is music. I've thought about dropping out before. I know my parents would never approve, but hell... I don't wanna sound cocky but I'm 15, about to release a solo album that I recorded MYSELF, and my band just released an album in which we sold every one of our CD's in the matter of 3 days... I feel like I have a huge future set for myself, and I KNOW school isn't gonna get me there. But the pressure that society has set upon me to finish school, go to college, get a degree and settle down with a high paying job is just- overwhelming. I feel like if I fail school, I'll have nothing to fall back on if I ever needed to... but there's nothing else I wanna do but play music. School just stresses me out so much sometimes I feel physically ill and have to take a nap or lay down... I guess my question is, to anyone who has maybe taken a similar route, or anyone that may be at all experienced with this kind of thing; would dropping out of school be a good decision? Or should I waste my time and try to find a way to complete my classes even though academics holds nothing for me in my future?

TL;DR

All I wanna do is play music, I have a lot going for me in that aspect, but I really struggle to focus in school and to complete my assigned work, it gives me a lot of anxiety. Would dropping out of school be a good decision?",19Nov2018,1

Caffeine, cut it out?

A bit of background. I stopped drinking sodas at the age of 14, at the age of 21 I started drinking coffee and I have 1 or 2 cups a day just because I felt depressed and my performance in school was bad and when I had my first cheap espresso out of a school vending machine I got instantly hooked and wired, I felt the rush, i felt so good and focused like I finally felt alove and unlocked my potential ( okay im a bit excarebating here ) but it came soon with downsides. I had full energy, but I started to sleep less and less and got hooked to energy drinks too, finally I went like 2 days in a row not sleeping and dosing off in class or in the hall and my anxiety got really bad. Despite this my mind still felt incredible, I achieved a lot and I got really creative, ideas flowed together and I became really talkative, but then I started to crash more often and my memory got worse and anxiety were bad and my mood were up and down. I managed to cut down to 1 or 2 cup of coffee a day and I still felt that nice kick and motivation but the anxiety stayed. Now I haven't drank coffee for 2 days, i started to take vitamin D, vitamin K, Magnesium Glycinate and Zinc. I sleep a lot and I feel kinda sad and depressed and foggy but I assume it is because of the withdrawal. Anyway I wonder if I should quit coffee since I never really liked the taste and only relied on it as a mental cruch and I also listened to a well known dietitian who said coffee is unnecesary, better to drink more water, excercise, eat healthy and generally while coffee has positive effects the negatives still outweight them and it is not worth adding another problem to our lifes. This really convinced me also reading about reduced brain blood flow which isn't good for the brain that I should in fact quit but then I remember before coffee i felt sad and generally lazy and im affraid go back to thst state despite how my mentality has changed since then. So my question is, should I quit or no?",19Nov2018,1
152,"so in the past i was an antagonistic, selfish cruel person and i took the piss out of everyone and was just a cunt in general. i took a hiatus from school for a month and did counselling and anger management etc. 

i have changed since then and i want people to realise that because most of my school hates me and i’ve been in a lot of fights as a result. 

i have tried to change in the past but then reverted back to my cruel self which means people don’t trust me to change.

I can not go in an elevator alone for basically the same reason.

T is 15 years old and doesnt have parents that care for his education, theyre verbally abusive and it was in everyones best interest if T lived with his Cousin. His cousin is 22 and is not the legal guardian. The important part here is that Ts mother told T she was pulling him out of school. She didnt actually, so theres a chance hes still enrolled in that school but its been a week now. Plus theyre have been some people that have jumped T twice. Hes afraid that next time it wont be so pretty. So we are thinking of enrolling him in a different school if possible, same school is an option. Is it possible for Ts cousin to enroll him into school without being a legal guardian or if custody is the only way. We all want T back in school, Im afraid I dont know what to do.

160,"After this semester I will be just 40 credits away from graduating college (with an Economics degree if it's relevant)

I've come a long way and am a little proud of myself for making it this far but overall... I feel like college has been the worst  decision of my life. 

I don't feel like I have learned much overall and really I don't feel like I've grown much as a person in these past two years. However I do feel college has been detrimental for my mental health all in all and at the lowest points would tie it for the most miserable I have ever felt in my life. 

At the same time though I feel a very high desire to get out of this city and to some place new and far away like on the west coast or in the south maybe. Being in this city as well I feel has not done well for me. 

If I continue on with college I am projected to graduate in the fall of next year, and as close as it is it feels very far away with how badly I've been holding up mentally.

I don't want to throw away everything I worked for but I'm not sure college was ever a right fit for me or if I should have even gone in the first place. What should I do? Drop out? Take a semester off? Power through it and just get my degree? Any suggestions?

162,"I posted the same thing on r/confession but here I'm looking for more direct advice, there is was just to tell people because I  wanted to tell people 

I'm very lonely and feel like shit most of the time when I'm around my friend. There are these three girls, that all call my attention but at different levels.

The first girl is someone I've liked for a long time, but the feelings come and go. We hang out and get a long great, but I've told her before that I liked her and things didn't go very well. Some months later I told her I was over her. Now fast forward a few more months and the feelings have returned and I don't want to tell her again because I know she wouldn't return the feelings and I don't want to get hurt.

The second is someone I just recently started aquireing feelings for, but still it's weird. Because I can't see myself with her, and she doesn't seem like the dating type. She is extremely sweet and kind, but I almost never talk to her, I've never hung out with her, and don't really know her at all. But I was describing her to my friend and I found myself flowing with positive affirmations and complements. I described her as if she were perfect with ease, not needing to think, yet I've never held out a conversation for more than a couple sentences with her. I would find it strange just texting her one day and trying to hold a conversation because it would be out of the blue and random, also she is extremely shy and has social anxiety.

The third girl, I believe has been flirting with me, and this is where the loneliness factor comes in. I don't really like her, yet if she were to ask me out I wouldn't say no. I most likely have no chance with the other girls, so if she decides to ask me out I would say yes just so I can have a relationship. Yes that makes me a shitty person but being around so many couples daily makes me want to be with someone. I want to be in a relationship and have someone I can show affection to and that's what I'll get with this girl.

Now for the asking of advice, what should I do or how should I get through this. Should I tell the first girl how I feel. Should I try talking to the second girl. Should I tell the the third girl what on my mind? Thanks in advance",19Nov2018,1
164,"So, in middle school. 12 right now, my name is Alexander, and was diagnosed for as-purgers (assburgers ha ha). Now let me talk about my situation. In a middle school, and have little to no friends. I know it might sound cliche, but it only has about 30 kids. It's practically a hole in the wall school.  And nobody shares my interests. It's not really preppy, and really accepting. All the teachers, (except for the music and P.E. teacher) are female, and even my principle is lesbian. So I don't care too much. But there was one instance that made me have a whole new outlook on that school. I'm wanting to talk to one of my ""friends"", so i'm crying, and he pulls me aside. I talk to him about how nobody cares about me, and that I want more friends. But, what he does is say that this school is for success, and that I should feel free to move to another school, in the most unsympathetic voice you could imagine. And had just a so-what attitude. So now let's talk about my home situation. I'm at my grandparents house right now. But, lets talk about my home home. My house is small, and my room is a mess. rent is 1200 a month, and my mom and dad were unemployed for 9 months due to the baby sister I just had. And I'm gonna tell you that story, but if you want to skip it, *read past the bold text.* **My dad was in the room where my mom was giving birth, and he was going to cut the umbilical cord, when my mom went to take a breath of air at that time, she couldn't. She mouthed to the nurse next to her ""I can't breath."" Then she immediately turned blue. They called code blue, rushed my dad out, and started doing chest compression. And the reason she couldn't breath was a blood clot went to her lung, which actually was extremely lucky. It could've gone to her heart or brain, which is why she is here today. They had her in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and they had so many wires and shit hooked up to her forearms, and it was the saddest thing you can imagine. But, she got out fine. She recovered, can walk, drive, make coffee, etc. But she's on blood thinners, which means she can't breastfeed. And formula is fucking expensive Anyway, back to my situation.** My room is a mess, if you walked in there, you would think I was a fucking gremlin looking for a bag of fritos I left somewhere with a pair of Adidas sweatpants with nut sweat on my hands. It's expensive as hell, that house and school. But were almost back on track. Also, my grades are not the best. I've always wanted to do YouTube, or collaborate, or do reviews, stand-up comedy, entertainment is what. So, my advice I ask for is this: I need help with getting my life in order. I view myself as irresponsible. I want the motivation to do good in school, and do homework on time, and do projects, and I'm pretty sure my only chance at getting everything back together has been sodomized at this point. I also want advice on how to better friendships. I'm a social recluse, really. I just go on 4Chan, Tumblr, YouTube, and that's it. I want to know what I can do with my life. My life seems very repetitive and organized. I always see in the movies the group of really close friends on their bikes going to their house to play on their WiiU or some shit like that. I want an actual friendship with at least one person. Because I can tell what my ""friends"" at school are so unbelievably fake the way they act is totally how they don't act outside of school, I just need help. And hints?",19Nov2018,1

167,"Background: Im a teenager who has no income, i rely on money that my parents give me from time to time. 

When i buy a toy (board game, nerf gun, etc) i find that i often question/feel regretful for buying them. 

Here's the thing, i have absolutely no problem buying food even if the amount i spend on the food is equal to or more than the amount i spend on the game. 

For example, i just purchased skyrim themed monopoly and im already questioning whether it was a good idea, saying stuff like its basically the same as normal monopoly (which i already have). 

Here's the thing though, the skyrim monopoly was on sale and it was like $20. When i buy food i normally spend less than that but at times i can spend the same amount or more. 

I don't feel regretful for buying the food, even though it only offers a limited amount of joy as i normally eat everything within a day while i can play the monopoly until i grow too old to like it or lose it. I also gain weight from the food i eat, and i don't even regret that. 

Tl;Dr I get regretful when i buy toys but not when i buy food, even when i spend the same amount on both of them. Furthermore the toy purchase is almost always the healthier and smarter choice. ",19Nov2018,1
168,"Some back story:
My husband and I moved to another state for him to take a government job that offered very good benefits, hours, flexibility, and a great salary. 
However, they only covered 2k worth of moving costs and from the date he got hired, we had to be there in 2 weeks. We managed to do it, but it was VERY expensive. We didn’t have time to give a proper notice for breaking our lease for our last place we lived in so we had to pay for October and November rent in full. We also had to keep our electricity on, as per our lease stated, because we still were considered tenants. 
For our new house, we didn’t have much options because of how little time we had so we pay 1600/mo in rent (the cheapest we could find which such little notice), as well as paying quarterly for trash pickup. On top of that we also pay for water, electricity, and internet/cable, car payments, insurance(renters and car), as well as gas and groceries. 

However, at my husbands job apparently someone didn’t make sure all the I’s weren’t dotted nor all the T’s crossed. There’s not much my husband can do but wait, but he is likely to lose his job because of this. However, even though the chances are high, we won’t know for sure until after thanksgiving (great timing huh?).

We don’t have enough savings to have housing come the day rent is due because we spent so much money to move 500 miles away to another state. 

What can we do?
I’ve already talked to our family and friends (those that will help without holding their help over our heads) as well as reached out to a couple of resources that can help prevent veterans from becoming homeless. I have also contacted a program that can review our eligibility and help us with relocation expenses and help us find a cheaper place within our area. 

Are there anymore resources we can look into? What other steps can we take? 
Obviously we can sell items, which I am planning to do, but what else can be done? ",19Nov2018,1

Please help me get my motivation running again. I've started exercising about once per week in the last few months and cut down the amount of sugar in my diet, but still not much more motivation for homework. I don't think pep talks are really going to do anything anymore. I need a clear plan to get myself back on track. Thanks.",19Nov2018,1
174,So I am friends with this girl and we have done some stuff in the past. It never went too far but there is sexual history between us. We are really good friends now and I’m sort of into her friend now. Not sure if she’s into me but are there ways to tell that she is into me when we talk. I know it’s sort of a stretch but this girl is amazing and I need to know. Help!!!!,19Nov2018,1

176,"How do I get rid of this urge to have everything under control, when in reality there's nothing I can do to change the outcome of my situations?

Me m17 and a girl f17 are very close. We chat almost daily and meet in school, and in a voluntary mentoring program. We met once privately and had a great time, we hugged at the end. I like her very much. I have a strong feeling she likes me back (I've had a lot of girls not like me back, they all acted the same. But this girl, acts completely different.).

Now I asked her on a date on Friday evening. She agreed, and so I proposed Saturday. She went to a community meet of a YouTuber so she didn't have time, and I asked her ""Sunday? Rather yes or no?"" she said ""Rather no, I come home late etc."", I asked her to propose a day, she said she'll be spontaneous. (Ofcourse the actual conversation was with emojis etc.) We still chatted throughout today, just as normal.

Now I probably don't realize it (or do by posting this) but I think I have a deep fear of rejection. Eventhough im confident she likes me back, I have this fear of rejection. I know people are busy, but it either seems like everyone and their mother forgets to reply to such serious stuff like this (Wether id would be proposing a day for a date or anything else that requires a reply later than a day or two) in my age, or no one likes me. I know it's only been one day but I can't shake the feeling that she isn't gonna propose a day if I don't remind her (which I don't want since it'll come off needy af). But I legit don't think that's because of lacking interest (She stated multiple times she finds me cute, wants to get to know me more and especially agreed on the date after specifically asking whether it'll be a date or a friendly meeting)

I need some advice or maybe even some cheerful words. Thanks to anyone who read this.",19Nov2018,1

Male

16

&amp;#x200B;

I am a track and field/cross country runner and as a freshman,  a kid in my grade named James with invited me to join Track. I got pretty good. I am now the fastest kid at my school((not school record just fastest with people here currently)) in the 5k, the 1600 and 3200. I'm okay compared to other kids in the state/region. My best friend James who had a passion for running was the one who invited me to do it, and he moved to a Boston private school to run at the end of Freshman summer. He was always faster than me and this season he ran a 15:58 for the 5k. After he left along with all the upper classmen I was the guy chasing them the closest. James and I spent the summer running together back here and he stayed at my house over the summer. It was fun. After the summer I ended up going to the state meet for the first time. I'm a junior. Now it's the middle of winter and my coach is giving me 45-55 mile weeks of running and I just simply like going to the gym more. I just blew off an entire week and only did 2 of my workouts. Early in the week I told him that school was just too overwhealming and I had a lot of homework and I couldn't run. last week I skipped one workout without telling him. It doesn't help that one of the most inspiring people I look up to is a youtuber named David Laid. I'm using his program to lift. I've since put on 11 pounds of muscle and I'm really enjoying it. My running Prs aren't even that great, as of now they're 4:45 for the 1600, 17:11 for the 5k, and 10:22 for the 3200. I'm pretty good for my area and I could probably get better. Running just got a little stale, I hit plateaus and only ran a 2:11 for the 800 as a sophmore after running 2:12 freshman year. I'm letting my coach down. He meets with me once a week to give me training and I just am loosing motivation to run in the rain and dark and I'm just enjoying the gym WAY more. I like how I look better too. Everyone thinks of me as a runner and I don't want to quit, it would let the entire team down because in track you need a strong overall team to win meets, that includes some good distance runners :/ I just don't know what to do. School is overwhelming as hell right now too and the gym gets rid of my stress. Running just adds. What should I tell my coach? He's put so much of his own time into me, he even showed up at the track for one of my track workout last week. I'm thinking of talking to him about this but if someone can get my head straight here it would save the trouble... I had all these thoughts of running for a college but everything in my tiny little runner world is crubling to an end like a chapter in a collected short story book. Just look at my username. What am I doing. Otherwise I'm happy and focused but this thing is really messing with me.",19Nov2018,1

179,"This happened a while ago.  I only found out she wasn’t 18 because she screenshotted a snap from her friend and posted it on her story, congratulating her for turning 17.  After losing touch, I saw her almost year later, months before her 18th birthday.

I just feel like this will haunt me some day.  I was 20 years old at the time and she was 16. She looked like she went to college. I don’t know how else to justify my action. She was a life guard when we met and I made it clear I attended college since that was one of the things we talked about.  

I mentioned something similar to a few of my friends, they laughed but they  also classified it as some pedophile crime. If I wanted to be a criminal I’d rob a fucking bank.

I also didn’t know they made life guards under 18 years old. 

Im basically looking for any advice. This has been gnawing at me for almost 2 years now and meeting her again felt like a bad sign from the universe

184,"So my neighbour opposite me is a woman who I’ve thought keeps herself to herself. Probably in her 60’s, has always seemed a bit on the kooky side. It’s 6am and thank god I’m awake, because she starts quietly knocking using my letterbox, and tried to open my door several times. Being pretty scared, I open it up to her and she says “well let me in then”. I said to her “no it’s 6am, what do you want?”. She replied saying “a holy cigarette”, multiple times and walked back to her flat. I quickly shut the door and locked it. 

Yesterday she buzzed my flat and said “you don’t love me anymore do you” and when I said “sorry??” She just said “let me back in”, so I buzzed her in. 

She doesn’t seem all the way there, and I’ve lived here for 2 years and never had an issue with her before, apart from the odd occasion she’s knocked on my door and rambled about something to me. I keep myself to myself so I’ve never said anything to her apart from saying hello in the hallway. 

I’m asking for advice on who I could possibly contact about this, I’m left pretty shaken up after she’s tried to break and enter into my home at 6am, I don’t want to feel scared in the place I live in over a woman who’s probably mentally ill, but I don’t know what to do. ",19Nov2018,1

191,"1. I know the things that I need to do that are going to benefit me and my life, yet I just don’t do them. I know that I need to workout, eat healthy, read more, stop using social media so much, not waste so much time. I know this. I understand if. I just don’t do them. My brain literally stops me from physically doing the things I need to do. My brain gets tense, my arms get heavy and I suddenly get sleepy or drained of energy. 

2. I just ended things with a guy who I like. We had agreed to keeping things casual but his idea of casual was TOO casual for what I want. It sucks. He told me he liked me and that he is just not good at communicating his feelings but that’s bullshit. If you want something you go for it. How can he sit there and say he likes me, know that I like him, yet choose to accept the fact I was walking away?

3. I seriously do think that I’m going to end up alone. I think there is a curse for the women in my family. I’m scare that I’ll end up like my mom in the sense that she was never able to find a romantic partner who truly loved her. I feel like I’m going through the same path as her. I can’t ever find a guy to want to be with me in an actual relationship.

194,"I’m a woman in my late 20’s, working at a job now for close to 10 years. Met this guy at work 5 years ago at work and we’ve become good friends. He’s mid 30’s. Last night, we became something else. We had sex. He is married for around 3 years now, no kids. He says he’s been going through a real hard time right now with life and with his wife’s mental health—they are “separated.” The thing is though, they still live together and are trying to make it work. It’s actually quite confusing. But he has recently opened up to me about a lot of things. Then last night he had a mental breakdown at the bar and stormed off, phone dead. Finally found him and he was ok but we went back to my place to sober up and during that time, he came on to me. And in my drunken stupor, I went with it because it felt good and so we had sex. And afterwards I felt okay, telling myself that they are separated and he’s not happy and he just needed release as did I. And we were just two humans helping each other out. I felt like it wouldn’t be a big deal. But the more i’ve thought about it today, the more I feel guilty and like it was a huge mistake. Because things will be different now. At work, and our friendship dynamic will not be the same. All for sex? Does it really have to be like that? And I don’t want to be the reason someone is hurting (his wife) if she found out. I don’t know if I am able to continue to work together with him under these circumstances. Part of me wants to do it again because of how great it felt and out of curiosity but another part of me feels like it would cause more problems at work if it didn’t end well. If he comes on to me again, should I let it happen again or should I draw the line? Should I search for another job? Should I tell anyone? Who? How should I handle the situation to ensure harmony?

195,"I am currently 26 year old male living in nondescript Midwest small town. I have been working since shortly after My 14th birthday and have had 34 jobs, I’m known as the guy who can’t hold a job. Many of them I walked out of after a couple weeks due to either completely hating it or not making enough money. That being said, I have managed to hold a few down that I made decent pay at enough to get some experience in warehouse and factories where I can get jobs that pay decently these days.

I was unemployed for the past month and a half due to a factory job shipping out to Mexico. I tried carpentry for a week, it was horse shit and I was making $12 an hour when it was 30 degrees out, I got injured on the first day of my 2nd week and didn’t have health insurance so I quit. Aside from that I’ve been picking up shifts delivering pizzas for cash here and their.

I recently got hired at this huge warehouse. I’m making $17.20, 10 hour shifts 4 days a week but 13 hours during holiday and busy periods. Union benefits up the ass. Double pay if I work 7 days straight on the 7th day, triple pay on holidays. The schedule is kinda ass and I start working in a freezer for at least the first 90 days but I’m just gonna put up with it and grind til I make it, if I stick around here long enough I’ll get sought after positions due to union seniority and desirable schedules. Unlimited overtime too, I can come in as much as I want. And after 90 days there’s a $5.50 incentive for making over rate. 

My monthly bills on minimum payment are about $1200 a month. I have $4300 in credit card debt and $1000 is owed on my car. My car also needs repairs that will cost another $500-700 within the next few months. I also owe about $18,000 for dropping out of college. While this might make me sound like a bum I assure you I have a pretty decent grip on this. I plan on staying at this job until all of my immediate debts are paid off and my school loan is almost fully paid off or paid off all the way. I also would like to buy a 2nd car after my car is paid off and repaired and my credit card debt is significantly lower.

In the spring I am moving to the city. It will be a little longer of a commute to work but not by much. The cost of living will be significantly cheaper, I have no roommate currently and plan on getting one. I could save $450-600 a month by moving to the city and getting a roommate, and I already have a good one picked out. 

While I’m paying off all this stuff, saving up for a new car, etc. I plan on also starting to save for a down payment on a house. I’d like to buy an upper/lower in the city within the next 5 years and rent out the bottom half and live on top. 

Eventually the long term goal would be to have a decent amount of the mortgage for that house paid off, and to buy another house closer to home and rent out both floors of the first house. I’ve been thinking about this for a few years and I know which neighborhood I’d be looking for houses in, the cost of houses around their and have thought this all out quite a bit. 

The thing is I truly have no idea what I want to do with my life. I plan on staying at my current job for at least 2-4 years, but what happens after that? I’d like to start a business. I’d like to find a way for my money to make its own money some day. But it seems like every time i try to delve into a career path or school or something, I’m terrible at it or not making enough money.

I’ve dropped out of school twice. The first time was because I was majoring in something stupid and quit while I was ahead (music) the 2nd time I was too old (24) and just couldn’t keep up with the lifestyle of trying to pay all my shit and go to school full time, and by the time I graduated I wouldn’t have been making any more than I would have at a factory or warehouse anyways.

I truly have no idea what I want to do but I don’t want to be doing this factory warehouse bs for the rest of my life. I know I can grind and can get all of this stuff paid and have a down payment for a house in 5 years tops, but where do I go from their? This question presses me daily. ",19Nov2018,1
196,"so the other day i was sitting in a cafe and a guy came up to me to give me his number after seeing me in the window. we ended up texting (he told me he was involved in film but i just assumed he was an art-student type) and i asked him on a date. i only realized half way through the date tonight that he was a quite famous filmmaker i was familiar with, but didn’t recognize by his face—needless to say it stressed me out. i had been pretty clueless and definitely not as cool as i would have liked. my friends (after freaking out when i told them) suggested i just think about him as a normal guy but im still pretty anxious about the whole ordeal even though he said he wanted to see me again. i dont want to screw things up with this guy and need some advice on how to go about this. i really don’t want him to feel awkward and then not want to see me again...

197,"I apologize ahead of time. I'm not sure how long this is going to be, but just need to vent a bit. Or get some thoughts off my chest. I've been binge watching YouTube videos for 4-5 hours now and scouring web pages just to try to find some type of purpose in life. I don't what I feel right now. Bored? The fact that I don't really have an answer or am lacking purpose right now does make me sad however. Loneliness definitely could be a subject in this too. I just have lost the drive I had that was pushing me through my work weeks at my job for example. Like I would wake up in the mornings actually ecstatic to go to work and the days would just fly by. Would come home with a lot of energy to go play video games or any other activity. I would get in my car and just enjoy driving it with the biggest smile on my face and then just some time in July it all stopped I guess? I started dreading getting up in the mornings. Minutes would feel like hours and then I would get in my car to go home bored and finally get here just to do nothing. 

Perhaps it's burnout? That's the conclusion I've really come to but I've asked myself that even if I changed all of these things then what's to just prevent it from happening again? This is something I've struggled with in my life a lot is I just hate getting comfortable. Not in like relationships or anything like that, but in aspects of life. I've lived in several cities, gone through more jobs than I could even remember if you asked me and yet I always after a while just start hating myself. Over the years I've lost a lot in my life and I've taken to splurging my money to I guess fill that void that's in my life, and to give me happiness, but the feeling is always fleeting. Now I'm just at the point where when I talk to my parents on the phone or for instance even right now as I look at my other monitor onto social media and see my friends complaining about having to go back to work tomorrow that it really does scare me. I just don't want to be trapped somewhere where I hate my life or I don't feel purpose like I do right now. Then again I don't know how I'm supposed to solve that issue either? Fortunately I'm in a position where the only person I have to rely on or worry about in my life is really myself due to lack of a significant other or kids, etc. Even with that on my side though I can't help but ask myself where I'm supposed to go.

I'd definitely say I probably do hate where I work nowadays. Or.. hate isn't the proper term, but I feel burnt out and bored. When I first started where I am currently back in September last year I was enthusiastic about where I worked. It was a field I wanted to work in and it showed. I was praised by my manager by how well of a job I did even going so far as to say I had the highest production out of everybody in the building. It was a great feeling. Now a year later I'm a shadow of my former self. Matter of fact even I got emailed by that same manager just this last week for the first time ever since I started working here telling me that my production was really bad and asking me what was up. Since July over half of the team I'm on has quit and these were all people I loved working with and now I really can only say I have one person who I actually enjoy talking to that I work with and even she told me two weeks ago that she was looking for a different job, and just this Friday texted me even showing me a job she was applying for. 

So if she leaves that's everybody. This all comes together with that my job has definitely changed a lot since July with everybody leaving and new systems we've rolled out they literally combined 3-4 jobs into one and have pushed it upon us. Starting in September we started doing so much overtime. I was working 13 hour shifts and turning right around to come back in early in the morning. I never thought I'd be so depressed to be at work before the sun rose in the morning and then leaving work as it had already set. What a god awful feeling that was having no work-life balance. Sure the money is nice but what does it even matter if I'm not happy? Knowing all of this it's definitely made me weigh my options of wanting to find somewhere else to work. However this brings me back to square one of that what even is the point? This was a field I wanted to work in and I make decent money and a decent lifestyle but I'm still not happy. 

This isn't meant to come off as snobby or bragging I promise but with that whole splurging my money thing I was talking about well it got to the point where all of my goals or things I wanted I now have and I realized that these things were really just filling a void in my life temporarily but have come to realize that it is still there. Materialistic items just don't bring me happiness and it sucks. It really sucks that my goal for 2019 was just to go to South Korea for the first time in my life by next Summer, but with every day me growing just more and more spiteful of my job I don't know if I can do it, and sure lets say I do go work somewhere else and still make this a reality well then what after that? I go take this ultimate trip to Korea that I wanted, and then come to realize it was just like those materialistic possessions where it provided me a temporary happiness and then I just end up sad again?

Hell if anything it would just make me more depressed I imagine. As of late too I guess it goes with that loneliness portion, but I've really felt like I just genuinely annoy people or like people hate me. My attempts to reach out to people have really fallen on deaf ears as of late. Or like anytime I just try to talk with a group of people it feels like I just kill conversations like people don't want to be around me. Even something like this is a LOT of effort for me but I just genuinely do not know what do do. Just feeling so alone like this has really made it hard for me to hold conversation with people now or want to put in effort. I just feel like all my enthusiasm has been killed.

All of this in combination with each other has really left me at a point where I quite literally, not figuratively, have nothing left to lose. Repercussions just don't really frighten me I guess. I suppose you could say I'm more prone to risks now where I wasn't before because I just genuinely do not care? I hope nobody takes this as a ""I'm going to go overdose on hard drugs to try to feel something"" because it's nothing like that. It's more so for example me saying that if I lost my job or something at this point I just would not care, or I would go move somewhere in the world at a moment's notice with 0 game plan and would not care what happened to me. Really along those lines. Just something that genuinely would make me happy again or give me purpose.

Anybody that reads this far I really appreciate you listening to me complain about my life and having 0 purpose and I really am not expecting an answer to this, but if anybody can relate to this and tell me what they did or what someone recommends I wouldn't mind either. I just do not know where to go from here.",19Nov2018,1

202,"Ok, so a little back story. I've known this girl for about 3-4 years we've been serving together at a restaurant. I've been friends with her and almost sort of an older brother figure? (Asian thing). Anyways, we hang out a lot and she always asks for relationship advice and what she should do in certain situations etc.
Anywho, this whole fiasco started when we went to a Halloween party. We had a great time, got drunk and she ended up my place. We had fun that night... The morning after and the afternoon as well. She explained it's a one time thing but really enjoys being friends with me. So that's that. But, here's me attached and needy. I ask if we can talk about it some more the next week. She comes over, we smoke a little weed and I explain to her that I get attached really easily. She looks a little surprised but says maybe we should not hang out as much. But she proceeds to sleep over cuz it was so late... And obviously.. Things happen again.

I'm convinced it's not me, but at the same time it's probably me. She told me she compartmentalizes sex and romance. So to her it was just a shag. But to me it was something a little more, or so I thought. She told me she still heavily has feelings for her ex, because they still work together and still hang out all the time. It's basically like they didn't break up (even tho it's been about 6 months) and I just feel like I home wrecked. He's obviously friends with me too so it's hard because she lied to him and I basically need to keep that lie a float and convince him we didn't do anything. It's hard cuz we still hang out but agreed not to do anything. But, I'm convinced it may happen again and I'll just keep digging myself into a hole of emotions and feel sad and lonely about this whole situation. It sucks because it makes me feel used and not wanted. What should I do? Cut her out? Honestly, it's been a week or two now since, and it's seemed like it's boiled over a bit.

I have been with my gf for over a year, when I first started dating her, she was slightly chubby, which I didn't mind at the time. What made me a little wary was that she always kept saying she needs to fix this (this being how slightly chubby she was). I liked that motivation from her (although I kept telling her that I care for her despite her body shape). However, she has been gaining weight ever since. She still keeps saying, ""This is temporary, I'm gonna fix it soon"". It's been over a year and this phrase was being brought up every week, and I wasn't even the one bringing it up. This made me keeping my feelings to myself in a supposedly, honest, relationship.   


I have always been a very motivated and athletic person, my parents are both obese and type-2 diabetic, which might have planted a motivation in me ever since I was young not to end up like that (but I also do love sports). Anyway, for the past 6 months or so, I'd feel slightly awful when I go out with friends and find thinner girls attractive. I do genuinely love my girlfriend and I still cannot imagine breaking up with her, but I do feel that all my genuine feels are kept inside a box.  


I'm not sure what do or how to motivate her, or if that is in itself a lost cause...  
**I remember having a conversation with her on a girl that has been cheated on (we're watching some reality TV), and she was saying how if I cheated on her she'll be in the gym every single day and will have a complete turnaround. This boils my blood, because I keep asking myself, ""does one really need to be hurt in order to have the motivation?""**

210,"Hello. I'm not asking for medical advice and just want to point that out. Lately I've been stressing about every little thing that crosses my mind and everything that could be an effect of any action I make, even if it's a small action like choosing to let a car drive passed before I use a cross walk.

I'm like: ""would if I make this person late by not letting them go first and would if that results in something negative?"" So I wait.

Then I'm also like this when speaking to people. Such as: ""if I take up their time does that dissuade another person's conversation which could potentially lead them off-track of getting something more beneficial from that discussion?""

Even by making this I worry I'm wasting people's time by them not reading someone else's post and worry those few minutes will result in an entire different life experience.

This causes me heavy stress and this is all packed upon the fact that I don't vent to others about my problems. I repress them and it hurts my emotions. Sadness is getting hard for me to feel and I haven't been able to cry when I really want to cry.

I'm usually the one who helps out my friends with problems like this, but I don't know how I can help myself. I've tried passing time and motivation approaches and I even tried to condition myself to not think that way, but that just made me stress on it more.

211,"I’m a teenager. So, I know it’s kind of a normal thing to be emotional. But, I think this goes much deeper than just hormones. 

I feel like I am constantly looking back to the past and the people in it, because I was happy then. It’s not like I want to forget or I want to move on. I mean, I do. But my problem is that I’m not very happy with my life, or I don’t feel like it when I’m this down.

But, I don’t know anybody that I truly like and I don’t have much opportunity to meet others, besides work which doesn’t really work the best. So, I feel like I’m constantly thinking back to the people I cared about when I was still in a really immature stage. I was blessed with a sibling that really showed me how to be a better person, but those people that I loved before never really grew up. But I did care about them. And they really are all I know. But I’ve changed a lot in this past year or so, and I truly don’t like them anymore. I’m still holding onto the people I loved when I was a different person.

I hate booking travel. It stresses me out, because it's usually irreversible without piles of fines.

229,"I'd like to start this off by saying I'm lost and this is a long post which you should read all of.

I came from a private school where the classes held around 30 or under students. I've lived in that type of world since second grade and until my last year of middle school. Because I had the same classmates for around 7 years, we all knew each other well and I remember being well liked.

Now that I entered a public high school, things aren't really the same. 

I've never really interacted with people outside of school because my parents think it's odd. I went to a public school because my parents (more specifically, my mom) wanted me to get to know people. And boy, did things here in America end up more differently than it did in Asia where my parents grew up.

Let me also add that I came into the public high school with a friend. Let's call her Casey. She's a hardcore religious girl which is not what I am even though we came from a religious school. 
When I got into my classes on the first day, I realized how many people knew each other, how people had a history together from elementary and middle school days and I felt left out. Sooner or later, I began to make friends in the classes but it felt off (?not sure how to explain it). Maybe it's because compared to other people I just don't know them as well. Maybe it's because other people hang out with them out of class more and I don't because my parents only trust me hanging out with people from my old school who I almost have all disconnected with.

Ok, so let's talk about Casey...
When I heard Casey was going to the same high school I was going to, I tried to become closer with her. Problem is, her values don't represent mine and I realized this when we got to high school together. She got into fights about politics and religion while I didn't because I am really open minded with topics like those. In short, she started becoming annoying to me. Meanwhile, I made some friends which hung out with Casey and me during lunch.
And homecoming came, my friends fell into two categories: 1) weren't going because they thought dances suck and 2) going with a date. But Casey didn't fall into one of the groups, she was going with other friends. You might think it might be wrong for me to sound jealous, but when I asked if I could go with them she told me I couldn't because they were the 'og squad' or whatever. Talk about a toxic friend, really. 
Ok, maybe I've been a bit rude or blunt around her about her fights and how she was probably delusional but she needed a reality check.

Being the panicked freshman I was, I asked a guy out from one of my classes (a risky move indeed), which he agreed to go with me to. But things don't stop there, I text him and he left me on read and wasn't responding to anything. And at this point, I was panicking because I told my friends (including Casey, who was extremely skeptical about the guy) that I had a date to homecoming. So I call up some of my friends which I could trust and they told me I should just get over him quickly. I call my older friend about it and she told me I should just go with her and her friends. Which I happily agreed to because of a freshman with upperclassmen? Sounds rad.
I bumped into Casey and her friends and she called me pretty and I told her I was with upperclassmen and left.
It was a good night overall.

It's been a month since then. Casey told me that she was going to sit with some friends which I responded with a very blunt 'sure' because, honestly, I didn't really care at that moment. I haven't really talked to or seen Casey since. I think we're both avoiding each other.

Back to my present friends, I'm not even sure if I like them. Sure, if I hated them I would steer past them (maybe like what Casey did?), but maybe I feel like they don't like me either. One of my friend's boyfriend is starting to get really annoying and she's starting to hang out more with him. One of my other friends went to look for Casey, which I went because I didn't actually know where we were going. She hugged Casey and once Casey looked at me she smiled and waved, which I did too, shyly. Casey was friends with some of the more popular people, they were pretty and athletic, she was pretty and athletic, she fit right in. Maybe if I didn't miss the tryouts for volleyball I could have done that. Maybe I wouldn't have been accepted anyway.

One of my friends, who I love dearly, came over to transfer in the middle of the semester, but she only lasted 2 days before going back to the private school. I cried for days because once she told me she was transferring to my school, I thought of getting through high school together and graduating. She didn't like Casey, and lucky for her, she didn't see her.

One of my guy friends from class (who I am close-ish with), who I have had a crush on for a while, probably only sees me as a friend and he told me he had a gf).

I feel like some people don't take me seriously because they don't know me, but it's lowkey their fault for not talking to me(?).

My parents let me have some freedom, but not all that I want, not to sound brattish in any way.

I've been feeling depressed for a while and I don't know what to do about it. My parents always ask me if I'm doing good at school. Which I am, I'm focusing on my grades, but also I give into peer pressure. Maybe I'm not truly happy like I say I am. I don't want to transfer back to private school as it does not grant many opportunities as a big public school does. And if I were to go back, what will people say about me then? That I couldn't handle it at a public school and had to come back to feel safe? I don't want to take that chance. As I'm writing this tears are stinging my eyes.

Anyway, that was a long post. I want advice on how to get through everything. I'm probably missing some points, but this is enough. It's only been about 3 months in my freshman year and I feel like my heart's breaking up and I can't handle it. And maybe I'm being a bit dramatic, but I need it. I heard high school is hard, but I feel like I'm only making it hard on myself.

Well yesterday my boyfriend came to me telling me my cousin is depressed....I've reached out to my cousin these past couple months and have been left on read while he messages my boyfriend back which okay its fine but it kind of makes me feel like garbage that i spent a hour conversation with my boyfriend about my cousin when....I'm over here feeling like shitty about my life and having someone openly ignore me.... I just feel like my feelings are never cared about and I feel incredibly selfish. Idk if I'm asking for advice in this post or just openly ranting because i want someone to notice. If anyone has any tips of reconnecting with people or how to feel like no one cares about you please feel free to inform me",19Nov2018,1
236,"Long time heavy drinker, 10+ year history of high stress/dangerous environments, generalized PTSD symptoms. Used to drink to sleep. That became ineffective; both because I couldn't drink enough and I have a bad withdrawal proclivity. I got sober for a year (completely, not even a sip of beer or a mate's drink).  I started working in Mexico last year and found what felt like a solution: drink to sleep, take Valium or Lorazepam in the morning or before going to sleep to avoid both hangovers and anxiety attacks. In the last 12 hours, I've had 2 Ativan and a Valium, + half a liter of rum and 3 pints of beer and I feel like I've just had a double espresso. Earlier in the day, I ran 10k and did 200 push-ups. Now it's 3 am, and I feel like I need clinical anesthesia to put me down. I know I have a substance abuse problem and that I'm not dealing with it in the right way yet. I want to. I'm just curious how it's possible for a person to function under these circumstances when I see people pass out after half a dozen drinks in a few hours. Anyway, I'm not inviting anyone to tell me I'm doing it wrong as for as sobriety is concerned; I'm quite aware of that. Nor do I want to encourage anyone to make any bad decisions. I guess what I'm seeking is fact based, relevantly literate insight into how I can do calculus under conditions that would render most people unable to keep an eye open and answer basic identity questions.",19Nov2018,1

I know my parents won’t approve but I really really want to. I think my dad will be the most upset but I feel either way I’m gonna definitely go. I just don’t want to leave and them hate me.

238,"   So I'm a young man, coming into my prime. I jog every other day and do 45 minutes of weight training on said days. I'm not big on working out just staying mildly fit is all I'm after. 

  I've tried relationships, with females my age,  females older then I and even in a case or two older then what the law would provide.  But it was never sexual I just really wanted to love on somebody,  and I suppose maybe that's where I lack. 

  I'm single again..  After a failed relationship attempt with a young women I've been friends with a for a while.  It wasn't nasty and we're still decent friends.  Or what I'd consider friends.  But I've come to a realization.  No one genuinely wants to spend time with me, I've considered plenty of people my friends..  Only to watch on social media they go out every other night to the movies or have a friend over eating chips and playing video games. I don't have that with anyone..  I've tried to have that bond. Tried to make it with others..  But every time I try to hang out with anyone..  There is always an excuse..  Only to see a hour later another post of them eating a burger and watching a movie with multiple friends..  Isn't like I don't have the money to do things..  Yeah I come from a family who's on social security but I work a part time and make a little less then minimum. 

  Then I look at my bed..  And just fucking hate it..  I lay on the ground with a blanket..  Cause I feel so alone when ever I'm in it and it all sinks in..  I've tried to be social.. A lot... It never works out..  

Maybe it has to do with the fact every time I made a friend in primary school they'd move the next year or stop hanging out with me and there was times they'd end up picking on me cause I had lisp (No longer do did hours and hours of speech therapy) 

As middle school came around I was playing football and passing all my classes, but then I got a little more mature and I realized what was going on,  or I thought I did.  I wasn't happy, I realized everything was always the same every knew who I was..  But no one ever talked to me..  I was a starting defensive nose guard and one of the best in my league..  My team had a thing for only losing like 2-3 times a season, if that.  I was proud of that..  Then I realized all of my team-mates talked behind my back..  Then I realized all of my team moms hated me too. So I half way through 7Th grade I turned my pads and helmet in. I had more free time but just used it to sleep.. I'd try to meet people at school for the coming years only to realize most were partying and drinking the ones that weren't seemed so fake and the few that were like me..  Didn't want anything to do with me. So I eventually got closer to a few people and I got attached to them..  Only to come to the realizations I have now.. They haven't talked face to face to me in months..  They only text me..  Never to see how I am..  I just want to know If I can hang out..  Only to get an excuse or a lie. 

   My home life isn't the best my family constantly fights but I don't care about that anymore..  I feel so damn alone all the time.


   All I have is gaming at this point I get to be someones I'm not..  The Charismatic Rogue,  The Funny Orc who weilds a giant hammer to battle.  The witcher, a slayer of monsters,  a Elite soldier, a simple farmer in a valley, or part of one of the best Anti Terrorists Task Forces to ever exist.   But even in games like Rainbow 6 Siege I don't have friends,  or people I grind with and laugh with.    

  I'm always the one solo, and I don't get why.  Even in the places I go to escape I'm still lonely and scared.. 

 Sorry if this seems like a rant. 

   What am I doing wrong?  Why can't have a relationship?  Or just friends..  Or something more then being alone constantly,  if you say talk to my family.  I get where your coming from..  But it's hard when they constantly scream and bicker at each other. ",19Nov2018,1

I understand that she doesn’t have to like me or talk to me. But I’ve tried on different occasions to have a conversation with her and it’s the same thing. She just keeps giving me really short replies. I’d really like to get this girl to like me and maybe take her on a date or something, so i guess my question is, does it sound like a dead-end?

244,"Recently, a friend of mine, had made a deal with me after assuring me three times that he would pull through with it, then decided to cut out of the deal after lieing to me for a week. I was supposedly paying $300 for his old laptop and he never brought it to college for a whole week, continously giving me excuses. In the end, he decided to give it to another person for free. Now, this may not seem like much of a big deal but when this sort of thing has happened constantly over the past three years, its getting tiresome and I continously fall for his stupid manipulation. 

He's really the only guy I know who plays the same games as me and shares the same interests, and we've been playing together for three years. We've had multiple major arguments in the past that led to one of us temporarily blocking the other and not talking for a week long period. He constantly lies to me and backstabs me when I think everything is great. He makes a lot of things unenjoyable for me, so much so, that I started hanging out with much better people (who don't play the games I play). 

However, I really do enjoy the times I spend with him where we are just friends having fun, and some of our discussions are really great. We've planned future study groups but with his recent betrayal, I just don't know if I can continue on with this crap. 

Should I let it slide, forgive him and just continue? Or just get rid of him and move on, but also not have anyone else to hang out with? It seems obvious to let him go but again, theres a part of me that still wants to be friends. But every other time I've felt the same, he always ends up going behind me. It's hard to explain.

249,"I made a reddit account to ask this question, so I hope i'm doing this right, sorry if it's too long... I'm a girl in my early 20's, my parents kindly asked me to move out of my apartment and in with them so I could save money and go back to college. Life in their house has always been unpleasant which is why I moved out in the first place, but I need to get a degree so I took the offer and have been here for a year. Things have only gotten worse, here's what typically goes on:

Threatening to throw me out on the streets if I don't worship their religion, if I don't do their laundry or run errands for them, etc. they like the phrase ""if you don't like it you're free to move out"", knowing I have no place to go.

When confronted about these behaviors they like to use phrases such as ""I'm sorry you feel that way but it isn't my problem"", ""you're obviously delusional"", ""you amuse me, like a clown"". Almost all of these responses are typically followed by laughter.

They often accuse myself and my siblings of having complexes or mental problems, using phrases such as ""are you crying now? you love playing the victim"", ""you must have a victim complex"", ""you really must be delusional"", ""you must be bipolar or something"". 

They struggle with boundaries. They open our mail, have called my therapist on her personal number for free advice and information which they justified with ""I have my own problems, you don't own a therapist, I can talk to whoever I want"" which is why I've had to stop seeing her. They monitor our internet usage and track the websites we visit and invested in a router that restricts websites they haven't personally approved.

They openly comment on aspects of my physical appearance. My mother tends to be passive aggressive and gossips often. My dad is more confrontational, makes lists of what you might owe him, asking questions like ""whose house are you in?"" ""who owns this house?"" and we're expected to respectfully answer ""you do"" and to apologize or thank him.

As far as the religion stuff goes, my mother recently tried to exorcise demons from my 12 year old brother's body when he threw a tantrum. It was weird for everybody, we don't discuss it... needless to say, they're very upset over the fact that myself and a few other of my siblings have proclaimed ourselves atheists. Our mother forcefully preaches to us on a regular basis, trying to bring us back. She often uses the phrase ""if you love me you'll \[insert whatever she wants us to do\]""

They're not physically abusive, never have been, although she has gotten angry and screamed at me and a couple other siblings (on separate occasions) to hit her, grabbing our arms and smacking them against her shoulders, daring us to get physical. When we back down she seems both smug and disappointed. I don't know what to make of it.

So my question is, are my parents emotionally manipulative or abusive? I mean should I be seriously concerned, or are they just bizarre assholes who never should have procreated? Either way, what can I do to combat negative interactions like these until I can afford to move out again?

250,"Like it's always this same shit

I can't take it anymore ... 
Yes I know I might be able to if I try, although it feels like I can't take it anymore, like I dont want to; fuck what even does ""want"" mean!? 
I don't know who I am. 
I fucking don't care. I just want to be happy!!!! 

I know maybe there are others in dire circumstances that seem/are worse than mine yet that doesn't make me feel better. 
I'm still unhappy. How can I be grateful about my circumstances when they make me feel so fucking unhappy!? 
I want friends to support me yet I don't have the courage to talk to others sometimes and definitely not to say what Im feeling most of the time. Unless I do... But it feels like I cant.; Like I just want to be happy already.

Everything hurts sometimes; and maybe I'm exaggerating bc there are these thoughts that hurt so much it feels like it's everything bc I've forgotten about everything good; I don't want to hurt though, I just want to be happy already... 

The thoughts that hurt:: 
The time: it's 4:44am right now and each second time passes and I fall more and more be-fucking-hind in my schoolwork and in everything. 

The death: I don't want to live and I don't want to try to die maybe bc Ive tried already a lotz 

The momento Mori: it's like I have OCD and Im just keep saying fucking momento Mori and telling myself to imagine ppl close to me and around me dying but Ill fucking deal with it when I get there now I just want to be fucking happy!!! 

The stress and pressure from school: oh my God all the fucking HW and fucking useless HW that takes me a million years to start and then do badly and then not do; doing this dumb he makes me feel like I fucking lost myself; how can I still be happy doing this fucking dumb hw thats hurting me bc it's so dumb and I don't want to fucking do it and I'm taking so long to fucking do it and I don't know how to fucking do it and time will be up soon 

Social stuff: fuck there's this guy that blocked me on FB but I guess maybe I'll just still say hi and try to talk when possible maybe about it??? And I smell probably. I'm too depressed all the time to get up to eat to do HW to brush my teeth to shower-- only wen Ive mustered up enough willpower and love of life can I even get up ..  i fucking am falling out of all my friend groups and I don't even say what Im thinking to them. .. I wish I could handle this social stuff and still be me but ...

My fucking lack of courage: I can't even say what I think I want to say because I start doubting what I want and the consequences ... D


This idk stuff:I start feeling like I don't know this and I don't know myself and then I forget entirely about what I do know and just feel like I don't know this and that and idk anything even wha Im thinking about when in reality I do know at least something and saying idk is like giving up; but I got to that idk state bc I have so little memory short term sort of that I give up so easily on what I know and care about. I want to remember all that I know and say that I know that I don't know and fucking ... Wait I don't fucking aghahsh!!!!  I know I don't know if this is the fucking right choice. Maybe Ill say idk sometimes Idk idk!!! 
But I do know know all that I do know. 
Fuck. This isn't even important 

My fucking OCD dumb thoughts: I m doing my stuff crying or something then I get this stupid abstract thought about fucking basic physics or like basic math or like basic geometry specifically or like stupid impractical insignificant intangible ab-fucling-stract philosophy and then get stuck on it for hours and nothing else and make no progress because I get loner like and block out everything. I wish I could change but Ive been so fucking traumatized by this like PTSD traumatized by this fucking thing. I wish I could FUCKING STOP THESE THOUGHTS! And then focus on what matters? But then Like something bigger comes along before Ive even addressed this issue: 

Fucking English class: Im failing Ill have to stay back a year now I might have to be homeschooled they won't abandon me tjough-- my school that is. I won't fucking let them they can't. But I don't want to stay back a year. 

Yet I can't fucking do all this dumb hw I need to catch up on; I mean I can but I don't want to!!! It hurts so fucking much-- the problem is how can I do it and maintain by happiness and sanity??? I hate it so fucking much and because of that Ill fucking not get into college and bc of this fucking depression overthinking Ill be homeless and die and then lose everything and feel bad.. no I 2ont hurt myself anymore and in the future I trust myself not to too.. I guess Ill leave it up to you. ?? Idk how to do HW though!! How can I fucking maintain my fucking sanity. 

I compare myself to others while not letting anybody in. If I compared myself to others and let them in and collaborated with them that's be just jolly but I fucking am lonely. I don't. If I were to myself and didn't compare Id probably move more slowly but I wouldn't hate myself because of comparing .. maybe bc of other reasons ... Aagahhahhah... 

It's not this one tangible thing or the other...it's the underlying fucking depression????? I dk 

Wait and I also do know all I do know.




And stress and wanting love and 
That's good Ill wait for the chances ... And 

Gah gah gah ...

254,"How do I get rid of this urge to have everything under control, when in reality there's nothing I can do to change the outcome of my situations?

Me m17 and a girl f17 are very close. We chat almost daily and meet in school, and in a voluntary mentoring program. We met once privately and had a great time, we hugged at the end. I like her very much. I have a strong feeling she likes me back (I've had a lot of girls not like me back, they all acted the same. But this girl, acts completely different.).

Now I asked her on a date on Friday evening. She agreed, and so I proposed Saturday. She went to a community meet of a YouTuber so she didn't have time, and I asked her ""Sunday? Rather yes or no?"" she said ""Rather no, I come home late etc."" So I asked her to propose another day, she said she'll be spontaneous. (Ofcourse the actual conversation was with emojis etc.) We still chatted throughout today, just as normal.

Now I probably don't realize it (or do by posting this) but I think I have a deep fear of rejection. Eventhough im confident she likes me back, I have this fear of rejection. I know people are busy, but it either seems like everyone and their mother forgets to reply to such serious stuff like this (Wether id would be proposing a day for a date or anything else that requires a reply later than a day or two) in my age, or no one likes me. I know it's only been one day but I can't shake the feeling that she isn't gonna propose a day if I don't remind her (which I don't want since it'll come off needy af). But I legit don't think that's because of lacking interest (She stated multiple times she finds me cute, wants to get to know me more and especially agreed on the date after specifically asking whether it'll be a date or a friendly meeting)

It just hurts when you're giving 100% and your opposite doesn't realize it. She probably just doesn't know better yet, but still.

256,"First off hello and thanks for reading my post. I am a Canadian 26-year-old male and currently living with my parents (and have only ever lived with my parents). I just finished college again (apart from working for many years before that) and am now deciding on what I should do next for a living situation, because I guess I have two (or maybe three) options for what I could do. Before I list them, I'll say a couple more things to describe myself a bit.

 I plan on getting a job soon where I'll be making about a $45k - $55k salary to start. I haven't had a girlfriend in years and have been holding off on finding a relationship because I just think that it'd be awkward that I still live with my parents but will probably start dating once I move out and establish myself in a job. My work and interests are along the lines of making me really sort of introverted but I have no problem getting along with people but preferably I think I would like to live with no roommates (except for a potential girlfriend of course). I am very organized, tidy, don't really like dogs that much but like cats, don't smoke or drink or do drugs (but have in the past), but at the same time am generally easy going and very chill and nice to be around.

My options are sort of interesting, one gives me potentially slightly less freedom but allows me to save more money... I just need to hear some other people's thoughts on this. I have an incredibly hard time making decisions like this and sensing what I even really want.

1. So, my parent's own a second small house (which used to be my uncle's who passed away) where my sister and her boyfriend currently live). It's an old house and is also in the same neighbourhood/a 3-minute walk from my parents' house. My sis and her bf are, unfortunately, and kind of hat to say it, slobs, but they are generally speaking kind. Me being who I am, this is going to stress me out. They also have two yappy dogs which one of them still pees and sometimes poos everywhere and yeah, it's disgusting. My option here is that I could rent out a nice big room upstairs for CHEAP. Only $300 (!! My parents don't want to make a profit off their kids I guess) but that doesn't include bills and stuff like that. We would also be sharing a bathroom and kitchen... So yeah this is incredibly cheap, but possibly less freedom because I'd be renting from my parents (who could and would show up at any time and do stuff outside or in the basement, etc) and living with my sister and her bf and dogs.
2. Rent a 1 bedroom apartment downtown/somewhere close to where I would work... Would probably set me back anywhere from $1200-$1900 (but not super sure) a month with probably stuff not included... SUPER freedom in here but so much more money?
3. Rent a 2 bedroom (or something like that) with a roommate/friend (99% sure this would have to be someone I know). Not sure if this would cost about as much as above, but yeah. It could be cheaper, but... less freedom/privacy/independence and whatnot.

Please let me know what you think, I need your help. It's late and I sort of just need to talk about this with someone and get their input to help me make a decision.

I have a huge issue..freaking out big time.
I dont know where to post for best response..


So about 12 months ago after family violence, police intervention court orders ect.was obviously separated from my husband

The gas and power accounts were in his name and still are I think.
So everything stayed connected. I called the company early on but couldn't get any info as account wasnt in my name.
Everything stayed connected and I assumed was being paid for from my ex account and that this was an auto thing he must know about. Assumed because 2 of our adult kids are with me it was being paid. 
Today I came home to a $3500 gas bill...due in 2 weeks. I called them and the best they could offer was payment plan till due date and then I would have to call again and renegotiate 

I'm actually physically sick thinking the electricity bill cant be far behind and it will likely be 3x as much 

I dont know how or why it has not been disconnected.
I dont know why it was allowed to go unpaid to the tune of 3 and a half grand
I'm fucked
I dont have that money
And the electricity....what am I going to do?? 
I cant get assistance cause I work full time
Ombudsman??? 
Anything?? 
Literally looking at living without either for 6 months ...I'm just so so fucked 
Any ideas? What a the best thing to do?
Should I speak to a manager at power company??

The company guy I spoke to said he couldn't see the electricity bill?? Because I dont actually have an account number..but I thought was a combined thing. 

The bill today was just addressed to the occupant 
But I have given all my details now 

In the last six months I have sold my car, horse and equipment, float and jewelry just to pay the rent each month..going from double income to one has been really hard. Point is though I have nothing to sell..no assists what so ever.

262,"I will need to be vague on details to protect my identity and my own and my loved one's safety, but I hope I can find some advice

&amp;#x200B;

I just got free of a really bad situation. To put it simply I have ""worked"" for years as a slave to a violent narcissist. I couldn't quit because of threats to myself and someone I cared about and their knack of hiding what kind of person they are. The closest thing I have found online to what I experienced was domestic violence only instead of a romantic relationship it was my boss. During the whole time they have painted me as the bad guy and done their best to convince people I am stupid, crazy, not right and they have done there best to convince me everything did was my fault and that I deserved it.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I have finally gotten away, but even now I am looking over my shoulder waiting for the other shoe to drop until I can get completely away.  Only that is not an option thanks to the fact that in the almost a decade I have worked for them I have been paid maybe ten to fifteen thousand dollars if that for 80+ hour work weeks and back breaking labor which has left me in desperate straights when certain financial obligations haven't been met. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I am maybe free to get a job that actually pays me for the work I've done, but thanks to not being able to meet those obligations I am facing jail now that I might have found a little freedom. I would love for them to face the consequences they are so proud of escaping for their whole life, but I don't think that is an option for at least a couple reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

One is that I need to insure my and my loved ones safety, they could be on me a lot quicker than the law could be here to help and they have had a lifetime of escaping consequences for their actions so I don't trust this time would be any different. In the time I have worked for them they have done so much unethical and illegal shit it's not like there isn't anything there, but they've gotten away with a lot more blatant things that they love to brag about. To use their own words ""Since I was a little kid I have been really good at knowing what I can get away with and I am all about what I can get away with"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love for the world to see them for what they are. I have never seen a better example of the saying ""To see the true measure of a person watch how they treat the help""

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time though they have a family that other than being their enablers and turning a blind eye to what's going on are innocent in the matter. While I wouldn't piss on a fire to put them out I don't want to see them suffer. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now here I am overwhelmed, lost, scared, sleepless and looking for advice on how I can get my life straightened out. It's like I can't catch a break at this point and it's looking like I am going to have to spend time in jail and try to start fresh when I get out. I know that it's my fault that I owe this money, but not having it has been out of my control for years.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I am and I think I finally have a chance to earn money and make it right, but it's too late.

&amp;#x200B;

Just hoping I can find some advice and maybe a little light at the end of tunnel and that it's not a train.

Male friend said; **Maria likes those hairy feel between her legs. Was she that girl with which..** silence. (Maria is not the girl i am concerned about but this friend tends to swap people and dont remember names correctly). I asked him what does he mean. He says its just a joke.

So rewind to a couple years back, me and her little sister were pregnant around the same time. My son and her son are a few months apart. I truly believe that she doesn’t treat them the same. Sometimes it’s like she wants to replace my son(her grandson) with her nephew(her sisters son. For example, even though this would be considered “petty”, she posts pictures of her and her nephew together but won’t  post any pictures with my son. Now she’s calling her nephew “grandson”.

I also believe that because she can’t control her son likes she does everyone else in her life, she resents him in a way. She is very negative and manipulative. 

It’s weird I know but this is how I feel. I  don’t like her. 

Is it jealously? Envy? Or maybe she’s just narcissistic? How should I deal with someone like her considering she my sons grandma?

She does not have a high position and is not in the department that investigates what my company does, plus we don't discuss work when we're together, but it still threw me for a loop when I realized how impactful the FDA's oversight was to this company, and how they made sure to do everything according to the book to avoid getting in trouble. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't tell my job about my GF working for the FDA during the interviews or after being hired (they never asked) mostly because the FDA was never brought up until orientation.  There was nothing in the employee handbook that mentioned anything about a SO working for the FDA.  In fact I didn't even think about it until orientation when they mentioned the FDA and I suddenly realized it may be an issue. Also, I don't talk about my personal life at work, especially when I'm so new to job, so at this point no one knows that I even have a girlfriend.

I have been doing internship at a company for 3 months now. My assignment is to develop a certain software tool, and so far they like it, and even have offered me a part time job, which I accepted. Now, they pay me 250 eur per month for my internship, travel costs not included( Which are 150 per month ).

The CEO said he likes the way I work and wants me to become an employee here after I graduate this year. I will soon be done with my internship, and will have to do graduation project for half a year. I would like to do it in the same company, but I am wondering how I should approach the payment question. I understand why they pay 250 for internship, since you could get a really crappy intern, but since they have said themselves that they like how I work, I want to ask them for about 800-1000, which I feel would be adequate. This is in The Netherlands, where minimum wage is around 1.4k per month. I feel that it would be disrespectful of them to pay me 300-500, and right after I graduate start paying me 2.5k, which would be average for entry level software developer. However, this is still an internship. So I am not sure.

I have to discuss this with them soon, but I really do not know what to say if they offer me 400-500, and I want 1000.

She claims to not know who I am, and I dont really doubt it since I'm a pretty quiet person in my grade who only has a select few friends.

Anyways, that being out of the way, I met this girl through a mutual friend about a month ago and I didnt expect what happened to happen, but Friday night we had a few drinks and one thing led to another, she asked for my consent because she wanted to know I was okay with it happening and we did the thing. I didnt think it was that big of a deal really, it was goofy and fun and we couldn't stop laughing the whole time. She even kept asking me after the fact if I was okay and all, because to be fair, it was kind of overwhelming. 

Come the next day, the person that is the reason we met knows about what happened and has been shaming us for two days straight to the point where I cant even talk to the girl I has sex with to reassure her that it wasn't a big deal to me and that generally it was just fun. 

Is it justified for someone to be mad at us for having sex when we are both adults who wanted it to happen and consented to it? I just dont understand why it matters to someone who wasn't involved in the situation because it honestly just feels annoying and petty to me.

I have wondered for a long time why the parents of these children still bring them to my mom's house.  She has three small dogs that are not house broken.  She has two cats.  The house smells like animal urine and there is dog food and cat litter always spilled on the floor in a couple of places. 

But, the real issue that has me very concerned is my mom's drinking.  I don't live in the same state as my mother but our whole family is aware of her alcoholism.  She drinks excessively on a daily basis.  I recently spent some time visiting my family and realized my mother does not limit her drinking to the hours when she isn't babysitting.  I picked her up at 10:00 one morning so we could spend some time together before she had to pick the kids up at school.  She was already very drunk and reeked of booze.  I felt terrible when I dropped her back off at her house, knowing she would soon be driving to two different schools to pick the kids up and bring them back to her house.  She absolutely should not be driving at all, let alone with children in the car.  

I did not confront my mother about being drunk that morning.  She insists to me that she does not drink at all, ever, and would refuse to admit she'd had even the tiniest bit to drink.  On top of the alcoholism, and probably what led to it in the first place, I believe my mother has an personality disorder.  At the very least, she is a pathological liar.  

The state she lives in does not require a babysitter or home daycare to be licensed if there are fewer than six children being cared for.  She isn't violating any regulations on that front.  I don't know the names of the children's parents so have no way to look them up or contact them.

298,"I am currently an engineer in the UK with a salary of £36000.

In my current job, I have a cap on my Salary so that my ""Salary Progression"" cannot exceed £37,500 (which I am due to reach October 2019). Alongside my £36,000 Wage, I earn an additional £4000 in Non-Compulsory Overtime, a total of £40,000 a year, and next year £41,500.

I have just been given two offers.
a) I have a promotion into a Technical Management Role in another part of the company. My salary will still be £36,000 but my new Salary Cap will be £54,000 (and I will earn a 2.5% Increase based on the Max Cap per year, an increase of £2700). This has no Overtime Opportunities, but in the long term my salary will grow significantly.
b) Remain in my role for an additional two years, with an in-bulk payout of £9000 (post-tax), with further Overtime Opportunities.

In the short term, remaining is logical as I will have a lot higher income, however after two years are over, my salary is still capped at £37,500, where I could have exceeded that in two years by taking the promotion.

Should I take the promotion or remain in the team? ",19Nov2018,1
299,"I am currently in my graduate studies, finishing a master in finance degree. After this, me and my gf were thinking about moving to the US. 

She has a degree in economics and plans to work in taxation, while I have little work experience (2 months as a strategy analyst in an international industrial firm), undergrad in economics and a MSc in Finance (assuming a GPA of 3.5-3.7).

I could work in either FICC+equity research or asset management. To get ahead of the questions, I can't stand IB. Assuming I have a work permit by the time we move in, assuming $40k in savings and that we'll have to arrive before we land any job, my question is the following:

Would it be better to go to NY or Chicago? And are there any other options that I'm not seeing outside of these two?

My concern with Chicago is the high murder rates, but I could sustain us both for about a year before running out of cash assuming full unemployment. My concern with NY is that it will burn cash too fast to find employment.

301,"I am hoping to get some advice for how to deal with my husband's stepbrother being discovered homeless a few hours away after 16 years gone. 

When my husband's stepbrother turned 18, he left home with no warning.  Wondering why he left and if he's alive is something that is often on my husband's mind.  He wonders if there was something he could have done to help , and how he missed that there was something going on.  They are only a few months apart in age, and shared a bedroom til he left.  He thought they were very close.

A couple years after he left, their father (husband's father, brother's step-father) found him after seeing him in the background of a picture in a newspaper.  Turns out his brother had joined a cult that believed the path to God was to leave everything behind and live without money.  No contact with family was allowed.  He was found getting food from a dumpster and said that he was happy and that living that way was his choice.  He refused to speak to his mother on the phone and asked not to be found again.

Today their father sent my husband an article from a college campus newspaper written about his brother.  It included a picture of him.  It seems for the last couple months he has been giving away Bibles to college students and holding signs about morality, like ""is there really any right or wrong""?  The article includes his name, it seems their father occasionally Googles him.

My husband was quiet for awhile until finally saying ""That jackass"" and finishing getting ready for work. I can't imagine not seeing my brother for 16 years.  Not knowing he's alive but knowing that, if he is, he doesn't want contact with me or any family members.  I don't know what to say.

Do we respect his wishes not to be contacted again?  Do we invite him to come home?  Do we take a moment to be thankful that he's alive and move on with our days?",19Nov2018,1

I recently heard a girl friend of mine who has been with psychologal problems has started smoking, at age 28.

At  first instance I'd say to start smoking at that age is pretty strange  and if she has started smoking, who knows if she is also taking other  things.

Yes, I now I'm being alarmist,  but she has been in psychological treatment and I'm a worried about her,  and will talk to her about it.

But  before that I'd like to see a ""quantity of starting smokers by age  group"" statistic (or something similar to that) in order to be more  informed about the issue. And see if I'm being paranoid or not.

So I am homeschooled right now, (I’m switching to public school when I get to 7th grade) and it appears that I’m almost 3 years behind. I’m supposed to be about to enter 9th grade, but I’m in 6th grade. I have a friend that’s 14 and about to enter 9th grade as well, here I am stuck in 6th grade.

Many factors have played into this: my mom (teacher) has been sick with severe stuff for years, I guess low immune system, so when she was sick she was unable to teach me, and in that time my sister was at work and my dad was at work so I was left uneducated. We moved to three places within a 4 year period so a lot of time was taken off for moving. We also did very poor planning in terms of this.

There is also a law in the state that I am in that allows your kid to start school at 7 years old, instead of 6 years old, so I started 1st grade at 7, hence the reason for one year behind right now.

So here I am ashamed and embarrassed each time someone says “what grade are you in” and I have to lie and say 8th grade. My mom refuses to believe I am behind, taking off days of school and taking her time as if nothing mattered.  I mean I won’t complain about free vacation days if 1. It wasn’t effecting my school and 2. If they weren’t month long.

I don’t believe my school says I’m behind, but she gets all the emails and shit so she could be not telling me. Idk their seems to be miscommunication.

He didn’t seem into me. Make us official a week before I left on vacation. We had only known each other for three weeks. He got really distant after I left. He didn’t ask to call me or Skype me once. He ignored my sexts for hours. He didn’t seem excited when I came home (I did come home early). I got him a stupid lei from Hawaii but I thought he would wear it to work for casual Friday. His favorite color is pink so I got a pink lei. He never said thanks. I would get him food. He hardly said thanks for that.


He pulled away after making us a couple actually. I would tell him about my day in Hawaii and ask about his and he would just tell me about his and send an emoji. I think he wanted to lock me down instead of actually being interested in me. 


Another time he like dissed my friends as a joke and he just met them. It was a huge turn off.
He also drank kind of a lot. Like two shots and two beers every time we went out.


I had to tell him to text me very day. I was like dude I like you. I wanna know about your day. Wtf you don’t seem to care about mine.


The last straw was the fact we only had a day off together recently. He had played a new video game all week. Grabbed to me how he stayed up till two am every night that week. Well I had spent the higher the day before (he passed out early) and we woke up and got food. He asked me what I was doing and I said I would workout (he has been saying he needs to workout and I have offered to allow him to come with me to the gym... I didn’t wanna push it too hard to make him think I think he is fat or lazy or whatever) and he said cook he would play his game. He invited me over later. We got drunk with his friends. After the bar he got more beer and drank. Then at home I asked to play his game he said ok. I needed help so I asked him to help. And he forgot to give the controller back. Later on I tried to make out with him and he seemed uncomfortable. I then said I am going to sleep (he had played his game for like three hours now) and he was like aw no are you mad I played my game. I said no I’m tired. It is 4 am. And I went to sleep.


Left him after that. I had just told him the week before to please lay attention to me. This incident showed me he didn’t prioritize me and I’m not begging for someone to care about me. He also never seemed sad I had to go to work and leave. Like he didn’t wanna hangout longer. He also didn’t cuddle after sex. 


He also had a time where I said his dick was huge and then he said my ex used to say that too. I DONT FUCKING CARE MAN. just say thanks.
He also hardly complimented me or my body and I work hard for my body. He never said my boobs looked nice and everyone here does.
He didn’t appreciate me. He is a lazy thirty year old man who is unhealthy and anxious about his health her does nothing about it. And he has no dreams or aspirations. Just PISSES me off that even dudes who I would be settling for don’t want me.

319,"I am on a collegiate martial arts team. My coach is a PhD graduate, 33 years old, married, and now pursuing her MD out of state. She basically flies back to our university once every two weeks to coach us. 

Recently my teammates and I have noticed some significant mood changes in a junior on the team. She’s become very rude and moody and recently screen shorted a group chat conversation and sent it to our coach. Back in August, my coach invited black belts only to drinking with her. But she also invited his girl and it was very odd. 

We had a tournament yesterday and that girl and my coach were attached at the hip. She refused to record my friend’s match because our coach was fighting at the same time and she wanted to watch her. Our coach went around introducing her to other coaches, officials, it was really weird. This girl is a low rank and by no means exceedingly talented. Very average. 

We always get a team dinner after tournaments at a restaurant. We sort of tend to sit by rank, which I think is dumb but it’s my coaches policy. Black belts and coaches always sit at a specific table. Yesterday my instructor had that girl sit with them. It was extremely weird.

Now, this could be just a strong, healthy. relationship between a coach and student. However, my coach is clearly gay even though she’s married to a man. She flirts with girls all the time and has even flirted with other students while drunk (including me). I feel like there is more going on here. The girl (student) recently cut her hair very short and shows up to practice regularly with lots of hickeys. 

I feel like I don’t want to be on this team anymore. I used to really admire my coach but now I just don’t know. This situation is extremely worrying and in my opinion, exploitative. I’m not sure what to do. Technically there is nothing wrong here, they are two consenting adults, but it just feels wrong. Thoughts?

320,"I've worked in special ed for ten years. I'm a 1 to 1 aid for kids with autism, other developmental delays and extreme behavior. I'm a large male 6'2 and 245lbs, which is rare in my field, doing this for ten years I've only worked with a handful of men rarely were any of them my size or stature. Because of my size and willingness to work with anyone I often get extremely difficult students and very violent individuals to work with. I've worked in preschool, elementary, and high school (often times we keep children in special ed til their 20/21). For the past 5 years I've worked in a high school setting with large children and often times I'm used as support to help when this kids become violent and lose all rational. I'm very good at calming kids down by talking, getting down on their level and trying to help them through whatever they're going through to the best of my ability. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't but I try and make sure the  student and staff I work with are safe at all times. This becomes a challenge as I work with all women, ages vary from early 20s to late 60s, and often times they are more vulnerable to injury by some of harder students. For an example the girl I work with isnt heavy, around 5'2. The student we work with is 6'5 and 245 lbs and can become extremely violent for no reason that I can see other than his mental illness is getting the best of him, it's heart breaking to watch a student trying to regulate his mind and his body and just can't and lashes out at the staff trying to help him. His behaviors have been off the charts lately, exhibiting very primal behavior, such as violence, stripping, releasing bodily fluids. I'm usually the one catching the brunt of these behaviors. Every week I get punched, kicked, bit, scratched etc I try to avoid these injuries but for the students safety it's hard for that to happen as the student can just as easily injure himself or other students/staff and I'd rather get it than the ladies I work with. 10 minutes ago I got my hand bit super hard, it broke the skin through a Kevlar glove... 5 minutes ago the student became rational and calmed down.

321,"I want to start by saying that I love my boyfriend very much and I really want to believe that everything is okay. I will also admit that I have anxiety that can sometimes be overwhelming. Anyways, recently, my boyfriend started dressing up way differently for work. The first time he did it, it was because he had a special meeting with a high-end client so it was supposed to be a one day thing but then he started dressing that way everyday and acting distant. He says its because he is busy and the reason why he was wearing the nicer clothes was because he thought it was interesting how people paid more attention to him. The weird thing is, though, is that he is an introvert and he even admitted that he does not like the extra attention so why is he still dressing this way for the 3rd week in a row now? When I bring it up to tell him that it makes me nervous because he's been changing/more distant he tells me its because of my anxiety and that I'm making things up in my head. But I'm starting to feel like I can't be in this relationship anymore unless it starts feeling like he actually wants to be in it. I don't know what to do, is this me making things up? Or is it him acting weird? For context, we've been together for 2 years and we've lived together the whole time, he has never done anything to make me not trust him and he is always home on time so I don't think he's cheating or anything...I just think he's lying about why he's dressing up. But most of all, I feel like its always me chasing him lately whereas I used to feel like we chased each other's attention. I'm sad because I feel like we've been fighting more lately...every time I try to bring something up he gets really frustrated with me because he feels like its all me making stuff up just to argue.

324," 

Hi all. Throwaway, because as we say where I’m from: “J’assume pas”. And sorry, this is a long one, but I’m really struggling internally.

First of all, for this kind of topic, and to provide as many details as possible, I should first start by describing myself. 28 year old male (black, light skinned), from Europe, average height, not too skinny/fat, kind of a normal build. I’m not bad looking at all, I’ve been told/complimented several times that I’m cute/handsome/funny/whatever, and I do sometimes get looks from women, although I don’t notice much. I’m well groomed, I dress well, so my physical appearance probably isn’t the problem. I don’t have depression/social anxiety/other\_mental\_illness, although I am very introverted.

Here’s the deal: I’ve never been in a relationship, I’ve never had sex, and I feel like if I continue like this, I’m probably going to spend the rest of my days without ever experiencing what it’s like to love and be loved by someone else.

From middle school onward, I can remember quite a few girls that liked me. Some were obvious, some much less, but with hindsight, I can see there’s been a pattern in my whole life: Girl likes me, I don’t feel anything/I’m oblivious, I don’t go for it. The ones that I like, I kind of give it a try, but they never like me back. Truth be told, if I had been thirsty as hell, I definitely would not be a virgin right now, as I’ve had, in hindsight, quite a few opportunities. I remember a friend of mine (she definitely liked me) literally showing me her panties in the street or making other sexual remarks. I remember another friend literally telling me: “Je vais te faire ta fête”, which roughly translates to “I’m going to give it to you hard”. I kinda liked her, yet I never went for it. Was I scared because of my virginity? Did I just “not feel it”? I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I don’t think I have that “urge” that most people have to get laid. I almost hired a prostitute twice (once in Bangkok, and once in Prague), but I couldn’t actually go through with it.

That’s enough for context. The problem, is that I’m an introvert, who likes being alone, and I can also feel myself getting jealous towards women.

Now, before I continue, I want to stress that I do not share or project these feelings on any girls. I don’t post about this online, I don’t disrespect/hate anyone, I smile at every person that speaks to me, I just keep all of this inside of me, without bothering anyone with it. My views might (will) sound ridiculous to you, but that’s how I feel, and I’m trying to find a way to change that.

The bitterness doesn’t stem from all the times I’ve been rejected: everyone gets rejected, you’ve just got to get on with it. It comes from how seemingly easy it looks for women to find sex, partners and love. As a guy, I need to not only be physically attractive, but I need confidence, humor, charisma, and I need to actively put myself out there, and even that might not be enough. I see girls outside (pretty, less pretty, whatever), and all I can think of is how easy they have it, how most of them are always in a relationship, love or just sex, but still always desired by someone, and how there’s probably several guys texting them at this very moment. You know how you look at a trust fund baby just coasting through life, and think to yourself that you wish you had that, but still can’t take them seriously? I would say that is how I feel about the opposite sex and dating. It feels unfair, hard, and just not worth it. Obviously, it’s not like this for every girl out there, but from my experience, this applies to most.  

I’m not trying to date anyone at the moment (too busy with school and work), and I don’t want to mistreat or project this stuff on anyone, which is probably what would happen in my current state of mind.  

This way of thinking will not help me have a family (I’m not even sure if that’s what I want), especially since I’m an introvert that enjoys being alone. I also think the dating scene is a bit of shitshow, and you can either be content with a sh\*t sandwich served with a glass of piss, or you can be alone your whole life. Sometimes I feel like I’m “too far gone”, and people like me just don’t have what it takes to be love/be loved.

Can anyone relate, and if yes, how can I change this?

To anyone who read this far and wants to offer their advice: thank you so much.

PS: Therapy is not an option.

tldr: My way of thinking towards dating and women feels toxic, and I need help breaking out of it",19Nov2018,1

After he said it, I was speechless. I know he said it as if he was joking, but maybe he really meant it. Maybe he was serious. I stopped talking to him after he said that. I was hurt and sad. I don’t know what to do.

So I have been depressed, alone, and have put up a front my whole life. Not too long ago, I decided maybe it is time to change that, so I started seeing a psychiatrist. I still put up a front with them, I don't let people in at all, to the point that people I have known for years, don't know my real name, how old I am, really anything about me at all, but she did get me to do one thing that has changed stuff for me a bit, and that was to write in a journal about my past to now, and I update it almost every day now. I write to my journal more than in it, I treat it as I am talking to someone about my past and each day.

last week she told me unless I start to open my life up to other people, not just a book, I will always be alone, I believe she is right

To let others into my life, I was thinking of moving my journal online, and making it public, I can't think of a way to make my life more open to others than to open it up for all

333,"When I was younger one of my close neighboring families moved across country. I was specifically really close with their younger son, who’s about three years older than I am. My family never really like theirs much because they have very different political leans but when I was younger I didn’t really get that. I used to call their new house on my home phone and ask them to put him on. He would tell me all about his new life. 
  
Now I’d always looked up to him as an older brother figure, and up until I was 13 we talked constantly night and day. We never we a day without talking and we both played pivotal rolls in each others lives. I actually helped him come and, and he helped me through a real rough patch in my depression. 

When I was 13 we got in an argument about the war in Iraq. I don’t remember how we got on that topic but it made things kind of icy. Less than a month later we got in a horrible fight where he called Muslims dirty goat-fuckers. We stopped talking. 

I was really close with his girlfriend at the time so she tried to help. We unblocked each other on everything but we didn’t become friends again. I should probably mention that even though me and my dad are atheists, my moms family is Muslim.

334,"Hello guys , first time posting here.   
I tought I should ask here for some advice because I have noone to talk this with , All my friends would just say some stupid stuff like ""you'r overreacting"" or ""bro she's defenetly cheating"" or something like that.  
Also all my close friends are also close friends to my girlfriend so I don't want to spill the beans and have a way of her knowing this ever happened. Ok here's what's up: 

 I've been dating my girl for 7 months now, It's the most time I've been with someone and we are having a perfect relationship. We are really open with each other, I've known her for 2 years and never seen her with someone else besides me , she's really shy and is not the type of girl to just have ""friends with benefits"" or to just make out with someone just because.   
Two days ago , We were going to her house so she could pick up some stuff to sleepover at my house, I droped her at her and was going to wait for her to pick up her stuff.

She left her phone on the car, and stupid insecure me decided it would be ""fun"" to go through her phone, I had never done this before, as I said we are really open and she always lets me see what she's doing on her phone and I do have my finger print on it So I'm sure she has nothing to hide. 

(just a reminder , I've had 3 girlfriends in my life, and all of them seemed to be such nice ,caring and loving girls, but 2 of them cheated on me and I've gained quite a bit of distrust in the people I'm seeing, I also have a lot of anxiety so shit hit's the fan pretty fast for me ...)

  
Ok, I go to her messages and I scroll down a bit to see who she's talking to, just the usuall people her best friend, her girl friends, some people she's is selling tickets to (She is a event Representant and sells tickets on Social media).

Ok so first thing I found strange was a guy she told me she has been with before 1 time, I go through their messages and I didn't find much, just a random conversation about her job and whatnot nothing special . 

Another guy , that she was with a long time ago aswell messaging her if he could go pick her up, she just responded with ""just go to sleep"" and basically ignored him.   


Then I actually went to see the messages with her Best friend. I scroll a bit up and I see this ""I'm going to make you suck my dick right now"", something like that. She didn't even respond to that, just laughed, I think they were just joking about something , but still that messes with me quite a bit. I scrolled a bit up and I see that she told him about a a thing she said I was the only person she told it too , she even said to me ""I trust you so much, I would never be able to tell this to anybody else""  
. Basically she had a Rectal Prolapse (have your intestine coming out of your anus literally) .  And there it was she just talking to him about it like nothing happened, Even more than what she talked with me. She basically lied to me, and I don't know why ... I was never pushy, or demanded to see anything, or stopped her from doing what she wanted, If she wants to go out with her friends she just tells me and I just tell her to have fun, as I said We are really open with eachother and noone of us stop the other person from doing anything.

Why would she lie to me? She see's the guy and doesn't tell me, She lies about stuff that she tells him, and I saw some really ""dirty"" stuff in their messages ... But then I scroll up and I see them talking about the girl his best friends is trying to Pick up , and that he is a virgin and whatnot. I don't know what to do...   


Any girls around here can help me understand this behavious? I'm having really strong anxiety because of this , I can't get this out of my head... Is it normal for you to just have these kind of relationships with your friends and ""try to hide it"" just so it won't be an hassle? 

I'm so lost.. I love her so much , but I don't want to end up confronting her about something I might not be right.

Also, I'm not one of those guys that ""stays in a shitty relationship just because he loves the girl more tham himself"" , I already have my experience with this and if she really is cheating or anything like that, I will immediately leave her, no questions asked. I just don't know what to do because I don't want to ruin our relationship because I'm just thinking about it too much , but I can't get this out of my head...

The first week was really hard, we were fighting and he was doing everything his way without making sure it worked for the both of us. We went to dinner at BWW during that first week and he had a $97 beer tab without eating anything... i left the restaurant with the baby and came back to pick him up and he was so combative with me about everything. Once we got home he was screaming and yelling at me. At like midnight the baby was still awake so I brought “b” to our bedroom to put him to sleep and “x” wouldn't let me out him to sleep, he was yelling in my ear, tickling the baby, and just being ridiculous. So I pushed him away from us and he got angry again and threatened me so I told him to get out and he wouldnt and he grabbed me (I've got a picture of my arm) and left a mark. So!
  I called the police because he wouldnt leave. I also called my dad and my brother and they came over right away. They took me and the baby and the dogs back to my parents house and I stayed there. He called me the day after sobbing and apologizing telling me he loved me etc. His family told him if that's how he's going to treat the mother of his child then they don't want him around them so he didn't have ""anywhere to go."" I told him if he would get help he could stay in the guest house. He told me he would and we moved forward. He didn't. He wants to go on trips and see concerts and football games but I'm the one paying for all of it because he's not working. And then last weekend I had a great day at work and I wanted to go out so I invited him to come with me. He got drunk (shocking) and we were fighting. I was driving us back to our house and I was going like 15 mph in our neighborhood and this fucker opened the car door and jumped out. He ended up breaking his wrist and he doesnt have insurance so he wont go to the hospital to get the necessary surgery. So now he super cant work. He can barely take care of the baby. And he treats me like shit. But he'll ""come on to me."" And when I try to push him away he says I'm his and no one else can have me.”

The biggest qualm I have with the company is the budget cuts that will occur starting in January. Instead of 5 days a week, I will only be guaranteed 4 days. I could potentially get the 5 days if there is additional work to be done.

The third problem is the schedule. I have 7 day availability and my schedule changes every single week. Sometimes I have Friday and Saturday off, sometimes I have Monday and Wednesday off. There is no telling what days I’ll have off that week. The schedule is published only 7 days prior, so every week I am left wondering when I will work. This problem is also fueled by my supervisor continuing to schedule me irregularly even after I (very kindly)asked if it was possible to have set days off.  Mind you, it is very possible for a regular schedule to be in place. I have discussed this with my coworkers and we agree a fixed schedule would work best for all of us.

However, lately I've been having a lot of second thoughts, and I've come to the conclusion that I don't think I'm ready to commit to a graduate program yet — especially for the program I originally wanted to pursue.

Recently, I was offered a full time job in the field that I studied for undergrad – which was very unexpected. I did some thinking, and I think it would be a really good opportunity to get some work experience, especially since I've been I've been in college for so long, and have never had an industry internship before. Furthermore, the company is willing to offer grad school financial assistance when I feel ready to pursue grad school. I ended up accepting the offer, and will be starting in a couple of weeks.

I'm really excited for the job opportunity, but now I'm not sure how to tell my professors about my change of plans. I feel terrible since I asked them early-on if they were willing to write a recommendation letter for me, and I'm afraid that by telling them — especially around this month (The application deadline is in late January), I wasted their time and I'm worried that this might burn a bridge with both professors (I'm also friends with one of the professors on facebook). I was planning on sending them an email about this, so what would be the best way to address this? Or would there be a better way to go about it?

Thanks!",19Nov2018,1
361,"So I work in an office job and I am 19 years old and working full time and going to school full time. At work I feel like I’m doing all the work of my higher-up coworker. I wouldn’t mind doing a lot of work if I passed by and saw she was working hard too, but every time I pass by her cubicle she’s looking at car dealerships for her new car or she’s just on her phone. She’s not my supervisor or anything, just someone I work with on this program; we have the same supervisor. She doesn’t do anything all day, but send me work to do. She doesn’t even give me credit half the time. It’s starting to really piss me off and I hate it. Any advice?",19Nov2018,1
363,"I'm a freshman pre-engineering major at a liberals arts college. I'm struggling in physics and calc (D's), and will probably fail both classes this semester. My school has the 3+2 program where you do 3 years of engineering cores and fundamentals along with liberal arts requirements, then transfer to WashU or Columbia for two years to study your specific engineering major of choice. My goal is to go to Columbia, but they have a strict policy for a B gpa, where I think they want a B grade for your science courses at the liberal arts school on the first attempt. Admissions is guaranteed with this GPA, but if not, the admission process is more ""competitive"".   maybe if i boost to a high GPA next semester and next two years, Columbia will overlook that first semester.  I'm unsure what to do as I've considered transferring to a state school, URI. I was told that if I don't get into Columbia or one of the affiliate schools, I would graduate with a 4 year bachelors in applied physics from my LAC which sucks. URI might be an option as I was also accepted there, and into the honors program as well, where I would graduate in four years instead of 5 years with the 3+2.This option would be my backup ( I think URI has a decent engineering ranking). WashU's dual degree program is also an option at my school, where a a certain gpa is the only requirement. If I stayed for an extra year, (3+3), I could graduate with a masters in engineering and a liberals arts degree form my affiliate school. Is this  program very difficult and worth it for that prestige? A concern of mine is financial aid, as my parents income was very low a while back, EFC of zero, but they're making 65k+. State school (URI) is much cheaper, but I'm unsure of the quality of the program. I also found out that you need 40 credits of gen eds to graduate, a bit too much. I've taken a lot of APs in high school, tho, if that helps. Any advice would be much appreciated.",19Nov2018,1

365,"I live in Pittsburgh Pa, I’m 27 going to be 28 soon. Only have high school diploma but I work full time (weather depending) as a union ironworker apprentice. So technically I’m studying construction currently and working for experience. 

I’d like to get a degree that will allow me to not have to ironwork until my body gives up. I was considering engineering or construction management. Journeyman rate is about 35$ plus a benefit package that is about the same hourly. It’s a 3-4 year program to journeyman and I’m in my 2nd year.

I applied to a community college and got accepted but I didn’t follow through because I thought it would be too much to work and study. This job is very physically demanding, typically drive round trip about 3 hours. But I would like to go to school.

370,"Some background, I am F/23 living in New England US and I’m bipolar. 
Recently I have found myself not wanting to do anything. None of my current hobbies are interesting to me anymore (well, they still are but I just don’t want to do them, ya know?) I am not taking any medication for my bipolar as it didn’t help in the past and I am a regular marijuana user. 

When I can tell that I am starting to go from mania to depression or vice versa I try to distract myself with keeping busy. Just doing things in general to keep my mind off thinking too much. 

I love being outdoors and hiking but it’s getting cold and dark too early for me to go on my hikes like I do the rest of the year after work. That was my main outlet this year and no being able to do it has taken a toll on me the past few months. 
I like art. Painting, photography, editing software (photoshop) and mixed media but I just don’t have a desire to do them anymore.

373,"I wasn't really sure what to headline this as, but people of Reddit do I ever need your help and advice!

My boyfriend and I live in Maryland and we are renting a two bedroom aparment from a common rental agency here. First of all let me just say; I knew when signing the lease I was signing up to live in a not so good part of our town, but the rent is cheap and we're just trying to make it right now - I'm sure some of you can relate. Anyhow we've been here for about 2.5 years now, and haven't had that many problems aside from our neighbors. 

However, about two weeks ago my boyfriend was waking up with bites but I wasn't getting bitten or anything. We find out that some people who live downstairs (there is 6 apartments upstairs, and 6 downstairs) have bedbugs and they aren't doing anything about it. Two of our upstairs neighbors are being bitten as well. Well my boyfriend and I bought some foggers and fogged our own for a couple days while we stayed in a hotel with our cats - we made sure before that it would not affect the other residents in the building. It was all fine for about a week, but now we are visibly seeing them again because they will just keep coming back if downstairs won't do anything. We are also behind on paying our rent because money is tight as it is and the hotel and foggers was a big chunk of our money that I wasn't preparing for, but the landlords aren't doing anything about the bedbugs!!!! Yeah when we call they send an exterminator out and they do a treatment but downstairs WON'T call it in so we can't get rid of the whole problem.

So I guess my question is - if I call the Health Department can they do anything? Isn't this an unfit way of living that the rental agency isn't meeting a certain requirement? 

Also we are stuck in our lease until July so we can't just up and leave. We don't have any money saved to go anywhere anyway, we are struggling to make ends meet as it is. 

Thanks in advance. Something has got to give. 

Don't know if this matters - but we also have black mold growing in our apartment, and a big problem with homeless people sleeping in our hallways and they do occasionally do/sell drugs. ",19Nov2018,1
374,"I am in my early 30s and I am married mom to 3 small children. I don’t have family that live really close to me, except for grandparents and an aunt that live in a town fairly close by. My grandma is in bad health and has been for 20 years or so now. She is almost 80 and my grandpa is in his late 80s. My 55 year old aunt has lived with them for most of her life and she is crazy. She has no children and has always been jealous of my close relationship with my grandma. She has been an alcoholic most of her life and I believe she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. A few years ago, she threatened to kill my grandparents and got arrested. They put a restraining order against her and changed all their locks and got an alarm system put in. Well after a while, they let her back in. She has been really nasty to me in the past, posting on my Facebook page that she hopes I rot in hell and a bunch of other mean things. I immediately blocked her. But I can’t see my grandparents without seeing her. For a while now, she has been trying to make it harder for me to see my grandparents. Telling me not to come over without her permission or calling her first. I went there a couple weeks ago and no one would answer the door or the phone. I know my grandparents are ok because other family members have talked to them on the phone. She honestly scares me and I really don’t want my children to be around her or influenced by her at all, so I have stopped trying to see my grandparents altogether. I can’t cut her off without cutting them off and it hurts because my grandparents are getting old and not in great health and I worry they will pass away and I won’t be able to say goodbye. They haven’t tried to call me at all. My grandma is really not ‘all there’ anymore but I feel like I can’t even see them anymore because of my aunt. I can’t call my grandparents’ home without her answering the phone. She has pretty much taken total control of everything. My dad is her brother and he thinks I should keep visiting them and just ignore her, but after she threatened to shoot my grandparents, I don’t feel like it is a safe place for my kids or me to be.

379,"So for all of my (16M) life, I've been a pretty nice guy. All throughout elementary and middle school, I've had a positive outlook on life and treated people extremely kindly and with the upmost respect and consideration, no matter how bad a person they were. I knew that they probably acted that way for a reason, as I tried to be considerate and think on how they must feel and what they go through with life. But ever since the beginning of high school, last year, I've kind of turned into an egotistical dick. I'm not blatantly mean to people or anything like that, it's just that sometimes, I get into moods where everyone seems inferior or annoying to me. This doesn't happen all the time, just every now and then. But when I do get into one of these moods, I don't like it, since I know it's wrong to be so judgmental and cynical. I don't like the way I think and who I am. 

So my question is, what do I do in times like these to get back my considerate and positive outlook on life and all the people I meet? Is it just something I have to let pass or is it possible to control my moods like this? I do keep in mind that I am a teenager with raging hormones and am prone to mood swings and stuff like that. I'm trying to not focus too much on this but I just thought I'd ask someone and this sub seemed the most accepting.

I don't have any way of proving it was him without a doubt but I'm tempted to call the restaurant where they work and just ask. 

I know there is little to no chance that I get my property back but this is so infuriating. I don't know what I should do, should I call the restaurant and blindly accuse a random delivery driver? ",19Nov2018,1

385,So I am confused. At my work I seem to be on good terms with people. I have my little ‘group’ that I tend to run with/work with most often. We laugh and talk and to an outsider would seem to be a group that gets along and has much in common. One person will sometimes surprise me by bringing me food at lunch. Several in our group are collectors and they will gift me pieces on occasion as I’ve done for them. Everything seems great until 5:00. From 5:00 onward I no longer exist. The others all hang out. Make plans. Go see movies. Text each other. Have game nights. I’m never invited. Never involved. Ever. But a new hire will like the same board game as somebody in the group and instantly get invited to a game night. Sometimes I’ll get the “oh we thought you knew” line after the fact. I’m never formally invited or included in anything. I’ve tried to initiate stuff and just get a blank stare or shoulder shrug. I just don’t get it.  If these were fake friends why would they buy me lunch or presents. I just don’t get it. I am older than them. I have a family. But that doesn’t mean I can’t or don’t want to socialize. It’s beyond frustrating feeling left in the background. I’d almost rather they just keep it professional at work and not act like I’m in the group when I’m clearly not. One guy lives 2 floors above me. I even helped him get in to the place and yet he will literally invite every single coworker over EXCEPT me. I’m a 15 second elevator ride away. It’s dumb and insulting. It’s been like this for 4 years. I don’t know what I did wrong. I’d just like to be asked once to be included. ,19Nov2018,1
386,"Hello Sub, 

Any input appreciated, my situation has me very stressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am in San Antonio, TX - My lease is up Dec 31. I am a Paramedic by trade, but I am not license to work in the state of TX, and have been slowly studying to retake my license exam, as this would allow me to obtain a job making more money. As it stands now, my medical office job does not pay me enough to live on my own, 14$/hr. 

I moved to SA in April after having to leave Phoenix very unexpectedly and quickly. I had 2 friends here but they are both gone now, so I have no heavy emotional ties to this town, as I have no made many other friends. I am ""dating"" someone but he doesn't seem too interested in me at all, so I can't put much weight in that in determining where I go. 

I will have roughly 1,000$ in savings by the time it is time to move. Everything I own can fit in my truck. I have always wanted to go to Denver (I have very close, long standing friends there), but I am afraid that I am not in a well enough position to do so. Moving back to FL (where I am licensed as a Medic) is not really an option at this point, unless I move back in with my Mom, or find a friend to stay with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have moved a lot over the last 10 years. I am tired of it. I want to be somewhere that I enjoy, with friends and a job that I can provide for myself with. I need some advice.

390,"Hey all, I hope I’m posting in the right place about this. I work in the parts department at a car dealership. Currently I work 45 hours a week, 10 hours 4 days and 5 hours on Saturdays. I also am salaried. 

The dealership decided today that next week we will be start being open from 8-5 on Saturdays instead of 8-1, meaning I will have to work a 9 hour day every Saturday instead of my normal 5. Seeing as my salary is based on a 40 hour work week and I don’t get paid overtime, now that my base hours are increasing would it be out of the question to ask for an increase in pay? 

The way I reason this out in my head is that since my pay is based on 40 hours I am already giving them 5 hours of my time with no compensation every week which I’m not really thrilled about, but also understand that’s how it goes sometimes. But now to be asking me to essentially work a 50 hour work week with no overtime pay or any sort of compensation and with me not being a manager just a counter person, seems like overkill. That’s 9 extra hours a week or 45 a month that I feel I’m being shafted on.

391,"So two years ago,I was studying abroad and my grandpa passed away. Today I found out that before his dead, my family became aware that he had been cheating on my grandma with his secretary. Apparently she wanted a child, and though grandpa had some nice DNA so she talked to him and told him to make her pregnant. While they were having an affair, this woman came to our house like nothing apparently. She got pregnant and moved away. 

Back then my family used to live in a small town and apparently every single person knew about this affair. Grandmas friends, my moms and aunts classmates, people we've been close with families for ages. None of them ever told us,they didn't even think about it twice, they all lied to my family's faces. Some of them were in contact with this woman and telling her, her son and her grandchildren (there are 4) about fam and me specifically, ""so when we connected as a family we'd be friends"". These are all people still in our lives, who kept up a lie for 45 years. (thats how old my uncle is). 

Basically fam found out 2 years ago, and they didn't tell me until today. They expect me to meet my cousins in december for christmas. Now I don't mid that part, but also I just cant wrap my head around the magnitude of this lie. Every single adult that I grew up emulating has been covering for my grandpa the whole time, in process lying to their friends (grandma, mom, aunt). Al of this because grandpa had a standing in the community and it had to be protected. Meanwhile my poor grandma got hear heart broken at 80, after 60 years of being faithful. 15 years of taking care of sick husband and on his deathbed she finds out him and literally everyone else in her life have been lying to her. My faith in every single adult in my life has been shaken. I feel very lost, confused and sad.  Any advice that will help me rationalize their behavior and help figure out how to interact with all these people from now on will be very helpful. 

TL;DR grandpa cheated on grandma, literally everyone we knew helped cover it up for 45 years. I now have an uncle, 4 cousins and bunch of people in my life who I can no longer trust. Confused af as to how to interact with this people. ",19Nov2018,1

397," 

I never asked for this. I wasn't the one that started this. You invited yourself into my life and MADE me like you. The closeness, the physical contact, the cute clinginess, and just overall showing me all this affection, all out of the blue.

I didn't show it, because I was unsure and afraid, questioning it, but I loved all of this. I loved your company, even if I never directly said it.

Now that I finally got comfortable enough to show affection as well -to show you that despite not having shown it until now, I've always very much cared about you-, you stopped caring.

You invited yourself into my life, spent all this time trying to make me like you, and now that I do, you're acting cold, uninterested and are treating me like a damn stranger.

You used to hug me all the time, smile whenever you spoke to me, ask me to spend time with you whenever possible, give me cute little handmade gifts, and I'll never be able to forget that look of genuine happiness and comfort in your eyes when looking at me. Now you give me a half arsed ""hello"" once a day, barely look me in the eye, and we haven't spent time together in weeks. There were two things you used to LOVE doing together with me, and now you don't care about them.

But the thing that eats me is that you're not necessarily angry or hurt or cold. You just... don't care about me anymore. Like, it's not all in spite of me. I can feel it. You just... stopped caring. You don't hate me. I just stopped being your priority. That's what's eating me. I'd like to believe I've done something wrong, something which I can fix. But there isn't anything to fix. You just became indifferent. You're uninterested in me.

All in all, you've made me feel like I was genuinely needed, loved and appreciated. For a short half a year, I've had someone who wanted nothing more from me than my company. It was the best thing ever. It's not gone yet, but it's dying very quickly.

I didnt mind, we was still messing around (I know, we are both scummy for doing so). The hooking up went from 100% to around 75% in terms of frequency which is understandable and I didnt mind.

During this time we became really good friends, we would tell each other everything. I was still ok with her boyfriend because she was still hooking up with me.

Im abit egotistic, not the best trait but it is what it is. Fast forward to today, its been slowly declining to 0 and she doesnt want to hook up anymore. She also got married about a month ago. I didnt mind them getting married as long as we was still hooking up.

We got in a big argument about it last night and said if we arnt hooking up anymore, then ill still be here for you in emergencies but we cant talk regularly like normal. Shes grown really attached to me and is non stop messaging me still wanting me as a friend. I feel horrible cutting her off because she wont have sex anymore but its too depressing to watch her with her new husband while I get nothing (its an ego thing, i cant help it.)

402,"I [22M] recently got out of what I would consider a toxic and unhealthy relationship with my ex [23F]. I say recently loosely it’s been about two months but our relationship over the course of two greats has been quite rocky.

Our relationship was toxic in the beginning more so on my part due to it being long distance and having some trust issues. The toxicity thinned out and we were good until the end where it became more toxic in her part. Needless to say I’d say there were bad bits and pieces in between. 

There was a major lack of communication and respect on her part paired with things she said and did which caused mistrust on my part. Despite all this I kept pushing through it all because I genuinely felt that I loved her and wanted her to be a part of my life. She claimed she loved me as well but her actions spoke louder than words and often times it felt unrequited. 

A lot can happen in two years. A lot of moments with memories and experiences shared. This is why I find it so hard to move on even though I know it’s what’s best for both of us. At the end of the relationship she kept back pedaling and going against her word. It was taking a toll on my mental and emotional health and well being. 

I’ve gotten rid of/hid majority of our photos and videos. Removed her off social media and haven’t been in contact with her since September. Normally this helps me to move on and forget. Unfortunately this doesn’t seem to be the case. Almost daily I’m constantly thinking about her, just over thinking and replaying memories in my head.

So basically my husband and I have this couple we are friends with. He's known the husband since childhood and I just met both of them about 2 years ago. A few months ago, maybe 6-8 I found out they do not vaccinate and did not vaccinate their child. The wife was not vaccinated when she was small and believes vaccines are dangerous and refuses to even think about the idea of vaccinating her child. Keep in mind this has nothing to do with the autism scare. The wife is the main issuye. Her husband supports her but I really don't understand his point of view as much as hers because she is way more vocal about it. She literally believes that vaccines kill children and they they simply do not need them. She doesn't quite get that if the kid gets a preventable disease the kid could fucking die... She thinks measles is like the common cold, etc. She has lived her entire life without them and is in perfect health so to her, her decision is justified. Well quite frankly FUCK that... I will be having a child in June and I refuse to even expose this child to anyone that is not vaccinated. I don't give a damn how long someone has gone without them and is fine. My child will not be able to speak for his or herself so I have to be the one to do it. The only issue is these people are sweet hearts. They may have misguided and uneducated beliefs but we love them dearly and they love us. I need to figure out a nice way to announce the pregnancy to them but also go ahead and let them know right then and there they will not be coming in contact with our baby when it is born. This sucks because they always talk about how excited they will be when we finally have a baby and how our kids will grow up together etc etc. They have this fantasy in their head that my husband and I will have to smash into a million pieces before they can even get excited about the announcement....

404,"A bit of context : I’m a 16 year old high school who attends an international school in France. 

To keep the teacher anonymous we can call him Mr J. 
Anyways, Mr J is the type of teacher who loves playing around with his students. He’s constantly talking to us about his life or making fun of us in what started to be a friendly way. Let’s say I’m quite chatty so he talks to me a lot also. Recently his actions have been making me feel more and more uncomfortable. It started when he openly talked about his sex life to a boy in my class, claiming he had slept with “1000 people” he also tries to be in with the boys and comment on how this famous guys wife is “hot”.  We thought it was weird but also thought nothing of it.

The other day when I asked Mr J to repeat the end of question he answered with “your Mum”. I looked kind of surprised and ignored it until he said it again.  He also went up to me once, started at me into the eyes and asked “why are you taking drugs” (which I’m not)  This makes the class laugh. Note that everything Mr J says sounds dead serious.
Mr J has said other comments such as that another boy had a “foot fetish” for taking off his shoes or that I was “rich and dumb” But this isn’t that shocking.
One day I walked into class and for no reason he just looked at me and claimed that he would kill me. I was vaguely surprised but again the class is used to his outrageous behavior.  Should I also mention that during tests he all fails us?  We had to draw volcanos once and he circled one and said “this looks like a penis” and failed the student.

The other day in class he looked at me and mentioned that I had the body of Apollo which really creeped me out.  In the evening I sent him an email asking what we had to study for a test and he replied with “I think we went over this in class, good night little boy” 

To finish, we found out Mr J has an Instagram account - I mean it’s his private life he’s allowed to. However this account is in public. We looked at his followers and all he follows is pages of Gay porn. We even found some 17 year old models in there. We were absolutely shocked. 

Whenever I complain to my classmates about him, most of them claim that these exchanges are funny and that reporting him would be stupid. Last year another teacher was a bit of a perv and multiple girls complained about him, and the school did nothing. (This teacher did stuff like force girls to put condoms on fake penises during sex Ed or he’d fail them) lucky this teacher has left since. 
I feel like if I report him to the school, he’ll just fail me which could penalize my university choices.

Am I overreacting? Should I do something about this if his behavior continues?  
Thanks.

I (19M) have always had a strained relationship with my father (39M) because he has abused everything he can get his hands on drug wise since I was a little boy... 6 or 7. He cheated on my mom constantly, mentally abused her, my three brothers and I (the oldest), and has been in and out of treatment for meth, heroin, opiates, etc... since I was little. He is also very homophobic and racist, which is quite convenient because I am gay and my mom is dating a black man.

&amp;#x200B;

He has clean periods where I genuinely enjoy being around him. He taught me all that I know about computers and when he was sober he was always a very intelligent man. When he is sober, he seems to reel in his homophobia because I never hear him use homophobic slurs. On one hand, he tells me he loves me no matter what, yet on another, he makes jokes like ""your farts sound tampered with"" and uses the word gay in a derogatory manner frequently. But it isn't always bad. He gives me life advice sometimes (which is sorta weird because he is jobless and lives at his mom's abandoned house) and I find myself enjoying my time with him.

Recently, my grandfather (dad's dad) was diagnosed with a very late stage cancer that has spread throughout his entire body. This man is a carbon copy of my dad, but swap drugs for alcohol. He was mentally abusive toward my grandmother and when I would spend time at their house he would constantly yell and scream and me and my younger brother (18M) for being too loud when we were kids (5 years old to probably 13). My dad has been trying to reconnect with me because he is very depressed about his dad dying, which I understand. I mean... that's his dad. I cannot find any sort of bone in my body that feels upset because both of these people have been awful to me and the people I care about for as long as I recall, but on the other hand, they're still my family.

It's been like this since I was a little kid. It's a constant mind game with him and he up and down insists that my mom is brain washing me to not like him because she's jealous that he's a better parent than she could ever be. (Hint: my mom raised 4 boys without him and works a 9-5 job, the only money my dad has ever made has been from dealing drugs) I don't know if I should cut him off completely or if I should try to reconcile with him and try to be civil. My mom doesn't like him, my grandma's opinion is ""I know he isn't a good dad, but he is your dad..."" and my brothers are see him as an angel on earth and all contact him frequently. He lives alone in an abandoned house with no running water, no heat, no electricity, no food, no internet, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Soooo overwhelmed, any insight would be very much appreciated. I can provide further details if necessary.

409,"So just a quick background to give a little context. My girlfriend and I have been in a loving relationship for 3 years, we are at a pretty good point and we are very much okay with each other having friends in the opposite sex. She's always had a lot of close guy friends and she just started university a few months ago (I'm in second year).

About a week ago, she made friends with this guy in her lab and he asked for her Snapchat and Instagram. Apparently, he was quite nervous which would indicate he was kind of into her. Anyway, she told me about this right away and doesn't hide anything. However, every time I look at her phone his name is always in her notifications and they have been constantly snapchatting each other since then. Not sure if I should say anything as I don't want to seem controlling or jealous or if I should just leave it be. Thanks

410,"Hello, before you read this its' going to be very long and probably off topic. I'm going to be as honest as I can. I really want someone to understand me. Before you say just break up with her, I believe I actually do love her (i think). The thought of being with her forever does scare me, but it scares me to be with anyone forever. I love living alone, I feel like a child. I don't like any of my friends either. I don't live with all of the basically. I have one other friend that I used to highly respect, but my opinion is changing.

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

I'm very introverted and I have bad social anxiety. Being alone is when I feel the most comfortable. The reason I don't like it is because I feel like I'm being judge by friends, family, etc. I feel weird when they are all hanging out or something, but I would rather be alone. I like going out like every other weekend for about three hours, but people don't like that and don't want to be friends with you anymore. I'm scared one day they will all get married and just judge me that I'm not. The main reason's I wanted a relationship was to have someone care about me so much (but I learned I don't like it) and so I could tell people I do.

I was popular growing up, I got more social anxiety as grew up. Like I don't know why people liked me, I guess I was nice and didn't judge people. I acted kind of wild too. In high school I was pretty popular, but I was still scared to talk in front of the class. I was the only one to freeze up and didn't make sense, people told me. I actually really liked high school. People were nice to me and I was nice to them, but the best part was living at home. I had all my time to me. I could talk to my parents when I wanted to, but they left me alone when I didn't want to.

My immediate family is very diverse too. I'm the youngest by a lot. My oldest sister is 16 years older. My mom was married once before my dad. So I have two half sisters, a brother, and a sister. One sister is a doctor, another works for my mom, another is a social worker, and my brother recently became a sex offender. He has terrible mental problems. He had took special classes at school. My father is a farmer and my other is veterinarian. My mom works all the time and my dad is always outside.

One thing that really messed me up was liking a girl too much in high school. I would have done anything for this girl. I paid for her speeding tickets and even basically gave her a car for nothing. Anyway this girl invited me to a party. I just turned 16. I never drank before or anything. I got my license the day of the party and went to it. I got very drunk and cried the whole time. I was kinda mean to everyone but I did like it, because I felt like I could be myself. Then I started drinking very heavily at 16. And I was a good quiet kid everyone thought. I was an honor student and I respected my teachers. But then I started drinking and driving my dirt bike. I did it for a months. I hosted a party once, I invited the girl I liked. I told her I liked her before the party and she just said I never tried to make a move on her so she didn't know that. Well that night I kept talking to her and touching her, but she told me to get off and then later was making out with another guy. When then I got sad again and ended up pissing everyone off. Well later on she invited me to anther party, but instead of riding with me she just told me to come to it. I ended up buying her alcohol too. That night I drove my dirt bike drunk again and this time got pulled over. Instead of stopping I ran though. But eventually stopped long enough to get tasered by the police. I had to do community service I was kicked out of sports. Everyone asked what happened to me, I used to be so good and now look at me. But that some how faded and I was treated the same. But I changed a lot after that. I was put on probation and had to be home by 8pm. I never liked talking about what happened but people would always ask me. I was alone most of the time and just did push ups and sit ups in my room (like 1000 a day each). Then when ever my probation ended I still stayed home a lot. I didn't drink for a long time.

I didn't have a lot of relationships in high school. I was very horny though. Oh yeah that girl I really liked, I paid her to have sex with me.. I liked her so much. I told myself if I ever got the chance I would to anything to have sex with her. I also thought I would die a virgin and be alone forever. Then everyone found out. Nothing really happened though, it was just really embarrassing that I did that and I lost my virginity that way. I did go on dates somethings and had a few hookups. But whenever a girl would want to date me and I just couldn't do it. My friends would say she's not pretty or something and then I could never date them. But I also didn't like running on someone else's schedule. I had routine that I loved. I would program a lot and dating someone took time away from that. One girl I was about to have sex with her clothes off and everything. I just said look I can't date you and said I can't do this. I liked her but I just didn't want to be tied down. Then girls i didn't care about I would hookup with them. And others would just stop talking to me.

In college I haven't made any friends after 3 years. My first semester I did the best in my classes. I didn't party or anything. I was on the cross country team but quit because I didn't have any friends on the team. I barely talked, they said I was quiet. But i never talked because I didn't really know what to say. It's not that I'm holding anything back, I just don't know what to say. It was hard telling the coach I quit. He let me on the varsity team as a freshman. My second semester I partied every weekend. I was happy though I finally had my own room. I did see some cross country people at a party and talked to them, and they said that's the first time they heard me talk. When I'm drunk I can actually talk to people. After that semester I only partied once a semester. I became super strict again. Anyway, all my friends are all from high school. I barely talk to anyone else. I mean I don't, unless I have to. And i just don't know what to say. Like in my classes I've always felt so lost. Like I feel like a literally retard. I don't know how to study and I don't understand what I'm reading. I'm a computer science major and I get C's in all my classes. My parents are even paying for all my schooling.. I've had an internship and they want me to work there. Even there I feel weird. I barely talk and they point it out. All the other interns talk to each other and talk to the employees. I just talked to my boss and my face turns red when talking to anyone else. I felt stressed whenever I was talked to. I mumble bad, I'm quiet, I have a very small vocabulary ( so I can't understand a lot of people), and I can't think whenever someone is talking. I usually just say yes or no.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend:

I've been dating my girlfriend for 1.5 years. She is great. She is beautiful, funny, smart, and everything I was looking for. She's my first real girlfriend. We live 2 hours apart, but see each other every weekend and talk about an hour on the phone every night. Most nights I would say I don't want to talk to her. Usually I just have to listen and say yes. I don't really care about talking about my day, I never have. I tell her this. If I do have anything to say, it usually turns around to her talking for 30 minutes straight again.

We have lived together before. About 2 months after we first started dating she moved in with me while I was on an internship. I told her I didn't want her to move in with me, but she convinced me. It went better than expected, but it was still not ideal. Whenever I live with someone, there is like a small pain in my head that makes me have to control what I do. I don't like people asking me why I'm doing something. Or having to tell them when I'm about to do anything. When I spend the weekend with her. I sleep a lot more and feel more tired.

Also I don't like going to her family events. I don't like going to mind either, but she is very close to her family and we spend a lot of time there. Her brother is nice to me, but also says I never talk. Especially at the family events. Once I got drunk at her mom's house and then I started acting stupid. But him and his girlfriend was there. She said that's the first time she ever heard me talk and asked why I never talked. She said I usually just mumble something or say yes/no. When I was drunk I just joked with her. But the next day it kinda hurt. Because usually when I talk in front of them my face turns yet and try to get the attention off me.

But anyway when my girlfriend wants to go places, I tell her I don't really want to. Like she wants to travel and I do too, but for some reason I don't want to with her. She wants to go to my sister's house out of state, I like going there. But I don't think it when she's there. I feel embarrassed or something with my girlfriend (not of her). I have no idea I just like going alone. It's terrible for my girlfriend I know.

My girlfriend also wants to get married and have kids. But I don't really want kids or marriage. She's religious and I'm not. I want to change for her and I would. But I know I won't like it. But I know she's great and if I broke up with her I would want her back. The grass is always greener on the other side. I love just hanging out with her, watching movies and stuff. But I just can't image having to spend 24/7 with her.

I know I would feel this way with any partner. Like I don't want to see someone everyday after work. Have to sleep with them and share my stuff with them. I think I shouldn't be a relationship. I romanticize it in my head, but I don't like it in person.

&amp;#x200B;

My Friends:

They are all fine people I suppose. There are four that I'm closest to. 1&amp;2 of them are pretty normal, I feel like they are too judging but I am weird. 3 is just a terrible person. The 4th is just becoming too strange for me. 1,2 want all of us to fail, besides theirselves. Like if were are trying to study they come in and try to get us to go out with them or something. They've said in person that they hope we fail our tests and stuff. Or me and friend 4 have money in the stock market. They tell me they hope friend 4 loses it all. I kinda fail the same way, but I don't act on my thoughts. I tell them to study even though it makes me happy for some weird messed up reason when the fail. But I make sure my actions help them in the long run.

Friend 3 is kinda a terrible person. Like he was engaged, cheated on his girlfriend, she forgave him and he continued to do it. He would steal bikes and give them to her. He sends snapchats of him having sex with girls. He's an attractive guy and gets a lot of girls. He lies all the time and then we find out. Sometimes he says he has a problem. But people that don't know him love him. But people that do hate him. He lied about going on a date with a 40 year old, she calls me just to say how much she hates him. He doesn't care at all though. He got a DUI continued to drive without a drivers license. He sent my girlfriend's mom a message on facebook. But in the end nothing happens to him. He got a summer pipeline job made $70k in one summer. He's good at making friends though. I respect him for this. He can travel alone some where and make friends with people. He does seem interested in other people's stories.

Friend 4 is probably my best friend, but lately I don't know. He's a year older. Has a career. Doesn't want to get married or anything, which I respect. I went to high school with him and he knows friend 3. Friend 4 is started to love friend 3 now though. Friend 1 and 2 hate friend 3, but continue to hang out with him. Friend 4 know's the bad stuff he's done, but I think he wants to get girls like him. Friend 4 has done a lot of drugs too. I was recently with him and he's so cocky now. Him and friend 4 were just trying to top each-other's stories. Friend 2 doesn't know friend 4, but thought he was a complete idiot and drugie. In front of people he will just talk about dropping LSD and doesn't listen to anything you say.

411,"I moved to another state with my boyfriend and 9 month old. Got an apartment with a roommate. Our car took a dive so we had to get something else. With all the bills I know I can't be a stay at home mom anymore, and working 3rd shift is the only schedule that allows someone to always be home with our son. We refuse to trust a babysitter even if we could afford it. So how do those that work 3rd shift still make life at home work happily? I do well at my actual job, it pays decently, and it has great health insurance for my son. My issue is that I feel like I've gotten lazy with doing activities with my son, I only have sex twice a week now, and I tend to be more upset lately because I know I by far have the most demanding job out of the 3 of us yet I'm the still the one doing 100% of the cleaning. Not to mention that I'm constantly tired while home. I feel guilty all the time because on my days off I just want to sleep, or I'll spend my time cleaning and just be angry with my boyfriend. I'm not saying he hasn't stepped up immensely when it comes to taking care of my son. He just seems incapable or understanding that there is always more that can be done. I definitely don't want to become that gf that thinks he can never do enough and I know it'll head in that direction if I bring up my issues.

412,"I work for a minimum wage coffee shop in Canada (Tim Hortons) and overall with my position (Baker) it isn’t half bad but man the amount of bad days and stress it gives me compared to the good are heavily out numbered. I’ve been told by many of my friends to change jobs because this one doesn’t give a raise which makes sense. But in my small town all the jobs are the same. 

I’ve left and came back 2 times trying to find a job to better myself myself with no luck. I have no clue want I want to do for college although I really want to do something. I feel trapped and this feeling of “I can escape” is hovering over my shoulder and it’s dragging me down. Any advice at this point would work. ",19Nov2018,1
413,"This is a throwaway because my other account is subscribed by people I know. Also I apologize for the formatting, I’m on mobile.

TL;DR: My seasonal depression mixed with existential crisis are destroying every successful aspect of my life and I’m having trouble coping.

I’ve always been described as a successful, ambitious, and determined individual. All traits I’d argue come from my mother. However, it seems my seasonal depression is back for blood this year and I’m trying so hard to cope.

I’m a rising junior in college (for a computer science degree) and I took a nose dive in the spring semester and overloaded myself with 20 credit hours. This semester, I dropped it down to a mere 11 credit hours and am struggling like never before. I’ve been missing my classes- something I’ve never done/struggled with before. I no longer feel the drive to take notes or study. I turn in all my homework on time and get 100s, yet I’ve always struggled with extremely bad test grades. Even when I was attentive with my courses, taking notes, studying an hour a day, printing out practice worksheets- I’d always fail miserably. I feel this may be prompting me to quite literally give up.

I can’t seem to advance in my major because its taken me a total of three semesters just to get past the general credits I keep miserably failing. I understand the concepts so well I could regurgitate an entire semester of calculus in 10 minutes, word for word, yet can’t pass a single test. I’m stuck in the same course because I can’t get my mind to cooperate.

I work a job in which I have tentative scheduling week-to-week. I’m a shift supervisor which grants that I get paid more, yet deal with an abundance of stress. My job has had me break down into tears twice within the past week and I don’t understand why. Its not THAT stressful but every time I work, I feel I can’t breathe and I start tearing up. I’m unhappy with this job. I’d like to work a 9-5 somewhere, Monday-Friday assured of the days AND hours I’d work. But that’s no place for a 19-year-old with a struggling GPA, so I’m trapped. I’ve been stuck working until 11pm, getting home around midnight and going to school the next morning at 8am just to do it all over again. If I don’t have school, I’m working extra hours. If I don’t have work, I’m studying/doing homework for hours.

To show for this, I do have savings. Something I’m very proud of myself for. But now every time I check its status, I can’t help but feel my efforts are going to nothing. I haven’t spent any of my savings on myself- it all goes toward school. So really, it doesn’t belong to me.

My friends all attend universities hours away and they’re branching out, making new friends, going to parties. All while I stay trapped in my apartment, stressing over school and work. I haven’t interacted with anyone that wasn’t my boyfriend for months. I feel so alone and unliked. I check in with my friends every once in a while but it just feels like small talk. I try to make plans for breaks but they’re all busy elsewhere (not their fault)- so I typically spend time alone or with my boyfriend, sleeping or watching netflix.

Friends outside of my close circle are going on trips to different regions, states, countries even. I couldn’t even imagine the ABILITY to do this considering my confusing, ever-changing work schedule, school, and daily responsibilities demanded by life itself. Yet every time I look out a window, I can’t help but mourn for the places I could be, but can’t. 

I’m moving into my own apartment with my boyfriend in March (we’ve been together a year) and I can’t help but feel like I’m stuck in limbo between adulthood and being a child stuck in the bounds of familiarity. I’m so genuinely depressed with the idea of being stuck that its eating into my social, financial, educational, and mental wellbeing.

I’ve been trying to eat healthier, exercise multiple times a week, take time to myself by drawing, cleaning, and going for drives but I 
still
feel
stuck.

I’ve talked to many therapists before and all they seem to do is ask me ways in which I could fix this. Ways I’ve brainstormed up and down- every cliche in the book. And once I tell them it doesn’t work in a prolonged sense- they’re lost. I’m out of things to do and I need someone of the same stature or experience to share. I need to know that this isn’t something happening to just me. I feel like I’m drowning while everyone around me flourishes in their own identity. ",19Nov2018,1
414,"My best friend (we’re both mid-twenties) has been depressed for a very long time and has been suicidal since a year or two. Generally she is a very sweet girl, but sometimes she turns into a very toxic/manipulative person. We’ve been best friends since high school and I’ve supported her for a very long time and have been there for her when she went through a very messy breakup (during which she kinda stalked her ex and threatened him with suicide multiple times). I’m in no way an enabler tho and I firmly told her she had to stop doing that because it’s not fair and very toxic. But she barely listened to my advice (which is understandable). She lost a lot of really good friends during this period because she was in a very bad place and kinda took it out on our friend group, so they left one by one. I managed to get her professional help after a suicide attempt and she is seeing a psychiatrist so things are getting better. However she’s very self absorbed and still kinda acts (?) like she’s entitled to things because her life is worse than other people’s life’s so they should let her have that one thing because she needs it more than others. I’m sure she doesn’t do this on purpose, because she’s a really sweet girl on the inside, I’ve known her for a lot of years, but that doesn’t make it less shitty. This is very selfish behavior and pushes away the remaining friends she has, but I don’t know how to make that clear to her because she doesn’t listen to my advice, and I’m afraid if I tell her too harshly she’ll think that her last good friend hates her too and that life doesn’t have a purpose anymore. I don’t want to push her over the edge but I don’t want her to continue behaving like this because if she does she’ll inevitably end up alone.

416,"So last night at 6 a.m. my neighbors nephew's car was egged, and to preface this story, my neighbor is an old, southern man who yells when he's angry and drinks a lot of alcohol. In the past, after a few days of him shouting passive aggressive remarks across the street toward me, I had this incredibly stupid idea to give him some due payment back in the form of an egg. It is my shame, and something I wholeheartedly wish I would never have done, it was petty and he even caught me doing it, and I went over to his house to clean the mistake I had made up after, fortunately it was only on his driveway, but he never accepted my apology.  


And that is why he decided to accuse me of this most recent incident, at 6 a.m., he decided to come banging on our door, screaming at my Dad about how I threw an egg at his nephews car, while I had been asleep for the past 5 hours (and no longer asleep thanks to the yelling), and my Dad, who is not a very pleasant person to wake up at 6 a.m., yelled at him to go away. After he left, he had called the cops and eventually after talking with them, one cop came over to our house and checked with my Dad, and even the cop was positive that it couldn't have been me, and was just doing his due diligence.  And after that, we both went back to sleep.  


This neighbor will hold this against me even though it wasn't my doing, and the only basis he has to go off of in thinking it was me was that ""I threw an egg at his house once, so the only person who could have thrown the egg is me"". I really don't want to have him shout at me when I leave the house, but I have no idea what I can say to him to convince him that I didn't egg his nephews car.

422,"Hi folks, not sure if I'm typing this for advice or just as a way for myself to properly process it but any advice you could give would be hugely appreciated either way. 

So two years ago my Nana died due to a sudden heart attack/ asthma attack combo (the asthma attack hid the symptoms of the heart attack so paramedics didn't realize that she was having a heart attack until too late) and this obviously came as a shock to the whole family. Two years on though, despite the fact that I think of my Nana almost every day, even just in the general ""hope I'm making her proud"" way, myself and almost all of the rest of our family have managed to get over her death and continue our lives as she would have wished, all except for my Mum. 

My Mum was always an amazing woman, even raising myself and my sister for several years (when we were around 4 - 8 years-ish) between her and my Dad splitting and her and my Stepdad (an awesome guy who was as much a Dad as our blood-father to me and my sis) getting hitched. Ever since my Nana's, my Mum's Mum's, death though she hasn't been the same, and not just in the way that you would expect a death to affect someone. 

About two months ago my Mum and Stepdad made a last minute arrangement to come up and see me one Saturday (I live about 3 hours drive away so we typically get together every few months or so, so I don't see them that often). Once they arrive I am quickly told the reasoning for their visit is that they have decided to split up after over 15 years married, a decision that left my Stepdad the most upset that I'd ever seen him. The reasoning was that my Mum had decided she wanted to try and be single for a while (she had always had a partner or kids ever since leaving her parents) and so they would be taking a break for a few months and that my Stepdad already had a deposit on a small apartment to move into.

My Stepdad also told me that this wasn't the first place that he had put a deposit onto and that my Mum had backed out each previous time and that deposit had been lost, multiple times, so this time he would ensure that they saw it through 'cos he couldn't keep living like this. Cut to a week later when the landlord of my Stepdad's new apartment gives him the deposit back and says he can't move in 'cos the landlord had just split with his wife (on theme at least) so the two of them decide to keep on trying until a month later when in my weekly phone call with my Mum she tells me that now she has a deposit placed on a place and that she will be moving out for six months.

Two weeks later and I get talking to my sister (who lives closer to them and so sees them a lot more) and she fills me in on the shit that has been happening that I didn't know of, not the least of which is my Mum cheating on my Stepdad and shouting at my Great Uncle (Nana's brother) when he pointed out how disappointed my Nana would be in her. As well as this, I find out that she has been seeing various mediums on a regular basis (Con-men/women making a fortune out of my Mum by imitating a woman more than 100 times greater than them) which I believe has been preventing her from properly letting go of my Nana, not by forgetting her but by moving on with her life just as the rest of us have and just as Nana would have wished her too.

Whilst talking to my sister, we decide that we need to get together and talk to my Mum. So in a few weeks, once my Mum has moved into her new house and been there a bit, I'll be heading down to meet with my sister first to talk to our Stepdad to make sure he's okay and knows we love him and then meeting with our Uncle (Mum's brother who is also worried) to go and talk to my Mum and hopefully get some sense into her (note that we won't be bringing our Stepdad with us as we don't want it to seem like it is just her splitting with him that we are wanting to talk about).

This is where the advice stuff comes into play, I am a horrible useless anxious mess when it comes to the peoples stuff and have absolutely no clue what to do in this kinda situation (never honestly expected to have a situation like this in my life) so anything you folks can offer, whether it's because you've been in similar situations or just know people better than the robo-man that is myself, would be super appreciated.

Alright, I think that's it. Note that this is my first Reddit post so sorry if it's in the wrong subreddit and hopefully it follows the rules properly, honestly not sure my heads properly in the game tonight so there may be some issues.

Thanks folks.",19Nov2018,1
423,"I cut off a friend around last month, and in turn she made our mutual friends gang up on me. I was never really close to them so they took her side and I just stopped talking to them and avoid them now because I really want nothing to do with her.  It was hard at first, but then I realized that it wasn't a huge loss, since them taking her side pretty much meant that they're just as mean as her and too weak-willed to stand up for themselves. 

I cut her off because of some extremely rude and passive aggressive things she did to me during the course of our friendship, and she would pretend they never happened when I confronted her. 

Problem is we still see each other everyday at school due to having almost all of our classes together. We're in the same college major so I'll still see her around next year...

Luckily I've made new friends in our classes so I can divert my focus somewhere else. ..but:

Now that I'm finally out of the picture, her level of passive aggressiveness has shot through the roof. 

\- When I walk into the room or am in her light of sight, she immediately turns away

\- If I make a mistake while giving a presentation in class or am talking with other friends, she will start laughing out loud or start trying to make fun of something I just said by giving her friends these side looks or make these disgusted faces

\-She'll start passively aggressively shading me in another language (which I understand slightly but she doesn't know) while I'm sitting in the same row as her, and purposely speak really loud so I can't concentrate on my class work, even when I put in my earphones

I think because of her my anger management problems are resurfacing. I've had dreams about screaming/yelling at her, and punching her, but I feel like if she provokes me enough I might end up making a fool of myself in class one day. The teachers know that I've fell out with her but I'm not going to get them involved. 

Tomorrow is her birthday and I know she's going to do a bunch of passive aggressive things with her friends. I hope to god she'll ignore me but who knows. 

How do I keep ignoring her and control my anger without giving it away?",19Nov2018,1
424,"It all started (i think) in 2015 where my dad lost his job. Before that, he was badly treated by his feminin chef. She always told him that he was incompetent and that his work was not enough but he always did his best. It really made him sad which he hid it  but he kept on going for us and bc he was already too old to find a new job if he quits. He also begged his chef to not fire him and cry in front of her. But that piece of sh*t fired my dad after a certain time.

He had a lot of difficulties to find a new job bc he was old (around 50) and he told us that every time he applied for a job (made interview and stuff), the one where he did the interview, called my dad's former chef (piece of sh*t) to know if he does a good work and she just talks crap about him and that he should not hire him. Furthermore, my dad sued his former chef and last year she lost her job but she works in another company. 

So he created his own company after he went to a business school (not sure if that term is right) to get a license so that he is permitted to make his own company. That took 1 year and got during this time unemployement benefits.

Now that he has a company since the beginning of 2017, he has problems of getting projects and stuff like that. His biggest worry is to pay the house every month (which is around 1400€). But next year in around october, it will be lower.

Since he lost his job, he has sometimes those moments where he doubts himself and is afraid about the future and shouts and asks God why he deserved this (bc he's really religious and we're chatolics). I think he is convinced about the karma system where he does something good and gets something good. Now that its not at all the case, it drives him crazy (im not sure about that one bc thats how I think about). It also makes me really sad bc he already experienced so many crap since he was a kid. 

Yesterday, he had one of those moments (I was in my room doing school stuff but my door wasn't closed so that I could hear everything and he talked with my mom) and he also said that sometimes he asks god to take away his life. It was the first time that he said that. This one really scared me and I dont know if he has suicidal thoughts. My dad is one strong person and does every possible thing he can do and always fights to make this situation better but this one just scares me.

I hope that it's all understandable. Sorry for the grammatical mistakes if I made some and also sorry that the text is really long :)",19Nov2018,1

432,"Hi Reddit. How are you?

First of all, sorry for my english.

&amp;#x200B;

I´ll try to explain my situation to the best of my abilities. It´s kinda confusing.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is VonRoderik, I´m a 34 years old male from Brazil.

&amp;#x200B;

10 years ago I got my bachelor degree in Biomedical Sciences. This is a profession that only exists here in Brazil and in some parts of Europe.

Basically this profession was created so they would have teachers for healthcare courses and to run and work in laboratories that work with blood samples and so on.

You know when you need to check your blood for a disease, or your urine, feces, sperm, or even your DNA for a genetic disease? Yep, that´s what I do.

&amp;#x200B;

A Biomedical Scientist, here in Brazil, can work in many other areas, like food (analyzing it´s content, bacteria, etc), water, blood banks, fertility clinics, genetics, and so on.

For you to be able to work in any of those areas, except the clinical pathology lab, you need to do a long internship or get a specialist degree.

I have a specialist degree in Clinical Pathology (the analysis laboratory) and Biochemistry.

I also have a masters in Genetics and Toxicology and a PhD in Molecular Biology.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides my specialist degree, I have never put a foot inside a lab. I discovered too late that I hated it.

When I graduated I started working as a professor in a university. Around 7 years later, the university was going through a hard time and fired most of its professors, including me.

&amp;#x200B;

For 3 years I was unemployed. I started working as a photographer to pay the bills (old hobby). 

Then I learned that Biomedical Scientists could get a new specialist title: in Aesthetics Procedures.

I decided to try it, and I fell in love with it. Now I have a degree in Aesthetic Procedures. I´m a professor for a grad school that offers this degree and I have my own clinic.

Basically, this is what I do (and that we are legally allowed to do):

* Botox
* Fillers
* Mesotherapy
* Skin peelings
* Ultrassound and radiofrequency equipments for body contouring and fat loss and skin tightening. 
* Sclerotherapy (only using glucose, and only on the small veins)
* a lot of other things

The thing is: doctors are not happy with it. Not at all. Every week they sue us on our federal justice system. We always win the lawsuits, but I´m afraid that someday we will lose it and I will no longer be able to work with that.

I´m highly trained in the procedures I perform. I have awesome results and I have never ever had any problem with my patients.

But, still, if doctors win the lawsuits one day, I won´t be able to work anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here´s my dilemma.:

&amp;#x200B;

I love what I do, and I don´t see myself doing any other thing, specially the other stuff I can do as a Biomedical Scientist.

My only alternative? Going to med school.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here are the problems:

Here in Brazil we have public and private universities. Public ones are free, and REALLY hard to get in. Private ones are easier to get in, but they are really expensive.

I have a private med school next to my house, but I can´t afford it. I really can´t. It costs more than what I make working full time.

The public school is around 30 miles from my home. That´s a lot of commuting. And it´s really hard to get into it. I´d have to study a whole year to have a chance to get into it (we have to do this big test, that happens every year, and covers everything you learned in highschool). 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I´d have to study all day. Morning and afternoon. I´d only be able to work during weekends. That´s a problem because half of my salary comes from my weekend work as a professor, and half from my clinic, where I work during weekdays.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I´d have to study from 8 am to 5 pm during weekdays, work at night in my clinic (IF i have patients during this time of the day), study late at night at home, and work during weekends. For 6 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I don´t know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don´t want to work with anything else beside aesthetic procedures, and I´m afraid I´m not going to be able to work with that anymore if I don´t get into med school.

I can´t even have a decent relationship nowadays, because I travel every weekend for work, and I work a lot during weekdays.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you guys give me some advice?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I´m sorry for the English mistakes and all the confusion. I´ll gladly answer any questions. Thank you guys.",19Nov2018,1

Pay plan cuts ,bonus cuts company wide. my personal debt is climbing and now is double what I have saved up. Which is around 8k after I pay bills next week. Now to the girlfriend part I love her and care for her but I have to be careful with how approach this with her. She recently switched jobs as a patient care technician at a hospital for a more paying job doing the same thing.  She suffers from chronic unhappiness and mild depression. She has been on medication for few years for both that dont really help but more or less numb the feelings. Ontop of that she recently last November was found to have a skin irritation that causes only her hands to burn and hurt and dry up and become insanely itchy. She was prescribed steroids and a special hand soap to use her old job allowed her to use said hand soap.... now on to her new employer. Because of the lack of medication for her depression due to lack of insurance while waiting for the new employers insurance to kick in,  her mind has been scrambled and confusing stuff. The new employer during orientation did not give her a formal shift schedule sheet showing when she works Instead it has been through last minute emails. Sadly  last night she did not realize she was supposed to be at work and missed as a no call no show. Her manager called this morning explaining that she is writing her up for this and it does not look good to do this during orientation. Needless to say she sunk into a bad depression hole this morning devastated. Ontop of that the new employer is not allowing her to use her own prescribed hand soap and the doctor who prescribed it won't see her to reinspect her hands with out insurance. Causing her to be even more upset that her hands are getting destroyed by the soap at this new facility and that she looks bad due to her not paying 100% attention to her email as her mind is all over the place at the moment. I have no ide how to help cheer her up. I really do not want her working at this hospital but at the moment it seems we do not have a choice as we are in need for income.

I wouldn’t cheat if I had a girlfriend but I justified sleeping with another dudes girl and that was wrong. However, she’s fucked me over a bit and idk what she’s told a few other people but I know she threw me under the bus so she can save herself from being labeled as a cheater since there’s been two people who treat me much differently than before. 

Anyways, this girl had the nerve to bring her boyfriend to my house then act like nothing happened, acting super cute to him like hugging him constantly smiling and all I can think of is, “bro I fucked your girlfriend 10ft away from where your standing and she’s acting like that never happened.” 

I don’t want to start drama but I wasn’t the only guy she’s fucked and I was going to leave it alone but to me it’s like if a guy brought his girlfriend to his side girls house. I had hope she wouldn’t stoop that low because maybe I shouldn’t be a moral crusader but that’s just retarded. 

Maybe she was rubbing it in my face? I know she knew I wouldn’t cause shit on someone’s bday so there’s that. 

I’m thinking, since a redditor suggested, making an anonymous instagram and DMing him. Would anyone know a good thing to say to avoid suspicion? I know she’s probably suspect me right away and then probably make up some bs like I manipulated her. 

She’s  already accused me of possibly sexual assaulting her friend after I told my roommates girlfriend that we did have sex a few days before but obviously sexual assault would hide that.

So I want her boyfriend to know because I’ve met him and he’s not a bad dude. He deserves better than a girl who confesses love to another guy then says nvm I love my boyfriend after having sex. 

Also if you think this is a bad idea then let me know, if not then please give suggestions. I’m all for women and men fucking as many people as they want as long as they’re single or in an open relationship where both parterners know. ",19Nov2018,1

At the time he was becoming aware of the effect she was starting to have on his life, and what could happen if they got back together. Well they got back together immediately. But as far as we know the thing that got between them was another boy, but my friend isn’t the type to just roll over without any jealousy if that were true. And given the change in their behavior over the last year and the now drastic changes over the last month we (my other roommates/friends) think it might have been substance abuse that come between them. 

For example the snake they bought two years ago just died because they forgot about it despite it needing little to no attention. They go out multiple times a night claiming to go to the store but they never come back with anything. Lately they’ve been staying out all night and seemingly avoiding work despite neither of them being able to hold on to a job and having big plans to move to LA this next year. On top of all that they smell, leave a mess everywhere, they are starting to look sickly, they eat garbage food, and they talk like they’re world is constantly ending. And by that I mean that they complain about everything in their lives even the good things. 

I’m at a complete loss for what to do as a friend and as a roommate. For one I don’t feel comfortable having them in my house for long periods of time anymore especially when she doesn’t provide anything. And I feel less able to talk to my friend than I ever have before which is terrible because he is one of my best friends and has helped me through multiple obstacles in my life.

443," CW: Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, Divorce (If I missed any please kindly tell me)

Looking for some advice/insight. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read the full post, I know it is very lengthy, but believe it or not, this isn't even a quarter of the detail. Please be kind with your responses, I know I have not handled this perfectly. 

From a very early age I am able to recall the extremely volatile relationship between my parents &amp; I am very confident this is where most of my mental problems began (I struggle with anxiety and depression 10+ years). I have always been a highly emotional person, even in the early childhood years. Every emotion I feel is so heightened and intense- the positive and the negative. 

My parents always argued. My dad was always neglectful to the marriage and I can count on one hand how many times I saw them hold hands or even show the slightest affection. I didn’t feel like there was very much love and the thought of that always gave my anxiety. There was lots of drama, walking out, yelling, door slamming and crying on the phone - especially around the holidays. I eavesdropped on more conversations than I’d like to admit - ultimately revealing my fathers infidelity to 8 year old me, much too young and fragile to be holding this secret. I never told my mother that I knew this. I remember being in my car seat late at night that my mother packed me in to find my fathers car out front of another woman’s house. She cried into the steering wheel. She thought I was too young to remember, but it’s one of my most vivid memories. Just when things would seem like they were gonna be ok, they would turn on a dime &amp; become worse than ever.

I just remember wanting it to stop. I remember crying and hiding and closing my eyes so hard wishing it would all be ok and my mom and dad would love each other again. I never wanted to be the kid with divorced parents. Broken families were embarrassing and people would have looked at me differently, I believed. Hindsight tells me that we would all be happier if they would have went their separate ways long ago. When tensions were high, I felt responsible. I was difficult to deal with as a child, and to this day I wonder if I may have thrown gasoline on the fire many times. They fought often about my brother and I (messes we made, fights we had- we were kids being kids).  I remember hanging out the drivers side door of the car in our garage pleading my mom to not drive off after an argument broke out as we were setting up another year of over the top Christmas decor. 

My dad always seemed detached and uninterested. Always eye rolling and irritated, rushing events that were supposed to be enjoyable and not really connecting with anyone. For this reason my mom did many things alone. I don’t fault her for that. We put on happy faces on holidays and at social events to save face. It was very important that we never led on that there was any unhappiness. We had everything &amp; I never remember wanting for anything. My parents would pretend I wasn’t getting that gameboy for Christmas, but come December 25th, it was under the tree with a bow &amp; every game I could have ever dreamed of - mine pink, my brothers was grey. (We were spoiled, very very spoiled and my father worked nonstop and was a great provider).

In the summer of 2015, I landed my first 'big girl job'. A week later my dad and mom had a giant argument &amp; my dad packed a bag and walked out the front door. He never came back. He went to live in his new house that he bought behind my mothers back-  a very nice townhouse (which I have never been invited to...couldn't tell you the address)....way out where no one would find him. My mom only discovered this by looking through his computer bag out of suspicion and finding documents on the house. 

He wanted to be alone, in the privacy of his home to come and go as he pleased and spend his time with people that weren’t us. To my knowledge, this is the 4th home outside the family home that my dad has ran off to, one I was too young to even notice cause he would leave the house after tucking me and my brother into bed. It hurts to know things were so broken and he was OK leaving his family to spend the nights alone &amp; my mom to sleep alone. They never had a healthy relationship.  A year later, my brother moved to Colorado to pursue his career. My mom will forever believe a small part of his reasoning for this was to remove himself from the disaster zone that our home had become. I think she may be right.

Since August of 2015, my life has being a fucking living hell. I have found myself in the dead center of the crossfire between my parents. It is the saddest and most disappointing thing of my entire life. Being an adult child &amp; seeing your parents you believed could do no wrong act in the nature they have has crushed my view of marriage, love, loyalty &amp; forever.  In the past 3.5 years I have worn many hats and been of service to my mother as the therapist, the spy, the shoulder, the middle man, the hurt child, the marriage counselor, the best friend to hear gossip I don’t feel I ever wanted to hear. “Have you heard from you father? Did he say anything about me? You won’t believe what he did/said. Your father went dark on me again! Same shit different day! Do we know that he’s even still alive?” I have so much involvement, every therapist is shocked when I explain the details. It makes me sick.

It has been nonstop drama and each time my phone rings, and I see my moms face on it, I cringe. Is he dead? (My father has many health issues which deprive him of any valuable sleep. He uses ambien for a nightly pseudo-slumber and to my knowledge is now a heavy red wine drinker- a new hobby for him and his new girlfriend to indulge in together? Maybe.) The remains of the relationship that once belonged to my father and I, are sad, dull &amp; basically meaningless. I joke sometimes that he’s a perfect stranger and I know more about my coworkers than my own father, though it's not funny. As I type this out, today, it has been 11 months since I have seen him in person. 

&amp;#x200B;

Still with me here? THANK YOU.

&amp;#x200B;

I am stuck between hurting my mother by giving her tough love, as she calls me sobbing, driving all over searching for his car when he goes silent for 4,5,7,10 days at a time (he has a girlfriend that I am sure is spoiling greatly) OR THE ALTERNATIVE... watch the remains of my sanity and happiness dwindle down as a direct result of my mom's leeching onto me as her only solace in this situation. The feelings of guilt when I try to detach myself overwhelm me immensely and causes anxiety attacks. My mom and dad are STILL married and ARE NOT legally separated. He lied to her for years about there not being someone else and he was ""so fucked up mentally and emotionally that he needed distance to learn how to be happy"". My mom believed this despite his history of pathological lying and infidelity. He has lied to me too.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*VERY IMPORTANT: NO ONE in my ENTIRE EXTENDED FAMILY HAD AN IDEA THAT THERE WAS ANY ISSUE AT ALL. I WAS SWORN TO SECRECY BY MY MOM. SUSPICIONS HAVE RISEN AS MY MOM HAS ISOLATED HERSELF FROM THE FAMILY, NEVER RETURNS CALLS AND IS GENERALLY ABSENT. PEOPLE NOW REACH OUT TO ME FOR ANSWERS.\*\*\*\*\*\*

   A few weeks ago, I got drunk and mentioned to my aunt that he was not living with my mom anymore. (She had suspicion). Then, I told a little more and said there was another woman. It was a mistake, I know. I shamed myself for days on end over this. I don't know what came upon me, but the word vomit almost kind of felt good &amp; right. I had been forced to lie to everyone I loved for years and years that finally telling the truth was confusing, yet cathartic.

  Now, with the holidays quickly approaching &amp; my anxiety absolutely killing me as I have to put on yet another year of performances, I am also terrified my aunt will bring this up to my mom and a shit storm will occur. Not to mention, MY MOM IS STILL ALLOWING MY DAD TO ATTEND ALL THE FAMILY PARTIES. HE IS OPENLY CHEATING ON MY MOM &amp; HAS NO SHAME. My mom stays week after week in a marriage that is non-existent. She's holding onto a memory of what once was and is terrified of the permanence a divorce means.

   Meanwhile, my depression has never been worse. I am so drugged up my psychiatrist and downright fucking sick and tired of exhausting my boyfriend with conversations of the same issues day in and day out. This weighs on me so heavily, no one will ever understand.

The issues between my parents have impacted me greatly for the last 20+ years and I have since been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety, PTSD and many doctors have pointed out fear of abandonment, attachment issues, trust issues and serious anger issues. They're right, I am so fucking angry. Angry for my mother, she deserves better, angry AT her....she is choosing abuse. Angry at my Dad, he has shown himself to be a terrible person &amp; angry at myself that I have successfully let this run my entire life.

I am drowning over here, friends. Any and all insight is so so appreciated. I have no one to turn to as I am forbidden to talk to anyone about this. 

Thank you. Be well xo.

445,"Alrighty... using my throwaway account because SO knows my other username, but I didn't know where else to go as we share all of the same friends and I just really need to hear some outside opinions. Apologies in advance for the length, there's a very shortened version at the end.

My SO and I have been dating since our senior year of high school (coming up on 7 years) and overall, the relationship has been great. Of course, we go through rough patches like every other couple, but this past year has probably been our best and we're even in the process of looking to buy a house together. But after this weekend, I'm having some second thoughts and just want to know if these are validated or if I'm making it a bigger deal than it is. Here's the backstory:

First of all, I do need to note that in college about 4-5 years ago, we were going through a really bad time in our relationship and were technically on a break, although we were still talking, and I ended up hooking up with a past SO. I told current SO about it and we ended up working through it and haven't had any other ""cheating"" issues since. Fast forward to this weekend, I was on his computer and for some reason had a really weird feeling and honestly don't ever do this, but I (kind of regrettably) looked at his browser history and didn't find much, except several Facebook searches (he never uses FB so I found it a little odd) of about 10 different girls, all of whom are pretty attractive. I then determined that all of these girls are in his current college classes. Side note, we're the same age but he's taking quite a bit longer to get his degree (I've had a full-time job for 2.5 years now and he hasn't taken a single semester off since 2012), so he has this whole different life/lifestyle than me as he goes to school 2 days a week and despite TREMENDOUS attempts at persuasion on my part, refuses to get even a part-time job, so there are 3 days a week where I really have no idea what he's doing while I'm at work. 

Anyway, I was very curious as to why the only searches were not only girls, but good-looking ones, so I decided to ask him about it. He immediately laughed at me and said how sad it was that I was even questioning him about it, but after about 30 minutes of arguing and asking him to see if from my point of view, the conversation pretty much ended with him admitting, ""yes, I looked them up because I found them attractive and wanted to get to know them because they're the only people I sit near in my classes"" and had a pretty sorry apology that did not make me feel any better. For some reason, he thought him owning up to it should make me immediately feel okay and move on??? But if anything, all it did was make me feel 100x worse. Not only is he looking these girls up, but he's purposely sitting next to them and trying to get to know them. He swears that he's never talked to them outside of class and I do think I believe that, but still, it's the whole principle behind it. He also made sure to remind me several times that I have ""cheating tendencies"" and he doesn't, and would NEVER do anything like that to me. But in my eyes, if he wasn't interested in the possibility of hooking up with these girls, he wouldn't be doing what he's doing. And also, just because he ""hasn't cheated before,"" doesn't mean that he won't and definitely doesn't mean I'm not allowed to be upset about something like this, especially because if the roles were reversed, he would be just as mad. But when I tried to explain this, he just brushed it off. He's always been very poor at arguing his side, usually because he knows he's in the wrong and just ends up digging himself into a deeper hole, but the fact that he just seemed so unapologetic and didn't try to comfort or reassure me whatsoever is making me question so many things.

I am at a point where I don't even think about other guys at all, and whenever an attractive guy comes up to me or tries to flirt, I shut them down immediately. And I don't mean to sound conceded, but I know (based on the amount of attention I get at bars and how often he has to tell guys to leave me alone, etc.) that I'm above average in terms of looks, so it's not like he's the only one who has the opportunity to talk to the opposite sex, it's just that he's the only one doing it AND actively pursuing it.

And to quickly address the not-wanting-to-get-a-job issue, he has lied to me NUMEROUS times about applying to places and I've always caught him in it. About 2 months ago, he lied to the point of giving me the name of the person that interviewed him (George), the questions he was asked, etc. and I could just tell it was bullshit because he's an AWFUL liar, so I called the store and asked for the person he claimed interviewed him and just as I expected, the woman informed me that they've never had a George work there and on top of that, they aren't currently hiring. After calling me out, he promised he'd get his act together and would stop lying to me about this, but then, this weekend, he told me he looked for internships for an hour on Friday, but when I asked him to show me proof or even give me the names of the companies, he realized he was caught again but made no attempt to give me a sincere apology for it. I know that once he graduates, he'll have a lot of opportunities and will be more committed to looking for a job, but I don't think that excuses the fact that he sits around and does nothing 5 days a week, especially when I worked 3 different jobs at the same time during college and still managed to graduate on time.
I know all of this makes him seem like a terrible person, but besides these things, he is truly the most loving and considerate person and I know he cares about me so much. I do feel strongly about being with him for the rest of my life, but I know that if I just keep forgiving him, he's going to continue to do these things, and it will probably only get worse. He definitely understands that I'm very upset and am not taking it lightly, as I've canceled our house showings for the week and have told him I might go stay with my parents for a little while, but he still hasn't shown any sign of remorse (other than saying he won't do it anymore, which apparently I'm just supposed to believe despite his past issues with lying) and is making me feel like I'm overreacting.

So really, I'm just asking for any advice you might have for me. Am I wrong to be so upset? How do I move past this? How do I make him see that what he's doing is not okay?

TL;DR I found out my SO has been looking up girls on the internet who are in his college classes specifically because they're attractive and wants to get to know them. He's making me feel like I don't have anything to worry about and that I'm overreacting, but we're currently looking to buy a house and I don't want to make such a giant commitment in our relationship if he's interested in talking to other girls, especially because I would never even consider/have no interest in talking to other guys...

So a woman was sitting in the car. She rolled down the window and yelled at me, but she didn't get out of her car to look to see if I made a ding. She just said ""you just hit my car! I'm going to be very angry if you dinged my door"" or whatever. I contemplated saying ""sorry,"" but that felt even more awkward than saying nothing. I didn't say a word. I kinda stood there for a few minutes, speechless, and got into my car and drove away.

I'm not really sure what I should have done. Saying ""sorry"" just seemed weird in that context. I feel super shitty about getting yelled at and I just didn't know what to do/say.

450,"Hey all, so a few months ago I took this job with the Forest Service, and it's great, pretty much my dream job, but it only pays about $34k a year plus benefits and will top out around $50k a year (which I know is decent but I've got $85k in student loans and was told by my ex fiancee I wasnt going to be a decent husband or father only earning that kind of money, i hope she is wrong but i dont really know). This job is also in a tiny ass declining town in the far northern midwest (legit im closer to Canada than any known city in the USA). Population is around 1200 and mostly retired folks. I wont be eligible for transfer for at least another 10 months. The bar scene here is mostly white haired and I wouldn't feel right going to church looking for a gf since I'm not a Christian anymore, volunteering options here are also pretty limited. Honestly I'd be shocked if any young women wanted to move here because frankly there isnt shit here for them to do, groceries alone are an hour away. There is a college an hour away too and I've chatted with some girls on tinder from there, but dont know how to relate to them now that I'm out of college myself, I actually feel kinda creepy talking to college girls now. I guess I'm just worried that by choosing a job that I absolutely love I am sacrificing all the other parts of life that matter like having friends and a girlfriend, and a salary that would make me attractive enough to be considered husband/father material. I'm very lonely, but dont know where to even start to look for a girlfriend because the college girls are too busy with school to get involved dating a guy an hour away, its inconvenient as hell for both of us to start a relationship like that, and the handful of local women I've met so far arnt interesting/attractive to me (they're mostly only here because they had kids in hs and never left town). Its not so much a confidence thing or an ability to approach women, I find approaching attractive women to be thrilling actually even though I get shot down in flames more often than not, it's more that there arnt any women here to approach! Im not trying to find random hookups either I'm just looking for someone to casually date and ya know... do the things that couples do. So my question is two parted: 1 how do I find a gf in bumfuck nowhere with no bars, gyms, or events? 2 how do I get over comparing myself to others so i can get that attractive confident personality i keep reading about that women supposedly love, like how do i become attractive when my salary is low level and my passion for my job is super high, but I let my low income dictate my value as a potential mate? 

I'm not sure if my being alone is a product of my personality, my low income, or just living in an isolated area, but my default is to assume theres something wrong with what I'm doing because I'm lonely and I'm not happy or content with being lonely. I do have standards that might be holding me back but I dont think are unreasonable (have a job, an education past HS of some kind is preferable, dont have kids and be healthy weight wise, I'm not rockin a 6 pack but I am very active and want a gf that is active too)

I work out, and take care of myself, dont have a drug or alcohol problem, fairly attractive women tell me I'm handsome occasionally, I've been gainfully employed since graduation, haven't moved back in with my parents and have hobbies I enjoy, what  more can I do to not be such a lonely incel????",19Nov2018,1

455,"So I've (22F) struggled with very low self esteem for many years now and I'm getting really fed up of it.

I am extremely sensitive and find myself getting very emotional from someone just picking fun at me. I think this is due to having a very low opinion of myself so I feel very strongly when someone says something remotely negative towards me as it makes me feel that I am as awful as I think I am. 

So today at work I was in a really good mood (I'm temping at this great place really enjoying it so far) and was chatting with two of my colleagues about various things. I was chatting to them for about 10 minutes and then another male colleague of mine said 'are you on drugs? You haven't stopped talking since I got here' which got a big laugh. I tried to laugh along and thought that was the end of it but then he continued to say 'I thought my sister was bad but nowhere near as bad as you' and so I just went really quiet and didn't know what to say. I actually ended up going to the toilet to cry for a bit which is so embarrassing. 

I am trying to reflect on this situation and I really don't think I was being very loud or chatty whatsoever, it was relevant to work but maybe it was my tone of voice. Everyone else at work has been extremely welcoming and friendly but he just rubbed me the wrong way with what was said.

I think it may just be his personality so I'm not worried going forward. I just really want to stop having these insanely over emotional reactions to comments that are intended as jokes. 

I really don't have the finances for a therapist so I was hoping that someone here might have some advice on what I can do to improve this?

I was doing a bit of 3D art freelancing for a bit, but work ran out and I've been spending a lot of my free time trying to improve my skillset for the slimmest chance at some sort of a future income online, though I find it's impossible to focus on anything anymore, resulting in entire wasted days where I can wake up at 8am, look down at my hands and feet, look back up and it's 4pm...

I've been to doctors a lot over the past year, but I am always told I'm doing well. My family doctor is impressed with how much weight I've lost, though it was likely due to depression and anxiety. I've been to therapy.

460,"So I'm a psychology master student, who is doing her clinical internship. At this moment I work 32 hours at a mental health institution, but due a conflict at my internship I'm slowly slipping into a depression.

&amp;#x200B;

Previously I worked in several mental health clinics, so it was a logical decision to start my internship in a mental health institution. In this institution I have around 110 colleagues in my department. So when I started it was quite overwhelming, besides that due shortage in office space, my office was at another floor away from the department and my colleagues. This resulted in that I had problems with meeting and getting to know my colleagues, this takes quite a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been a quite social awkward. But once you get to know me, I'm a friendly and cheerful girl, but the ice needs to break and I need some time. Three weeks into my internship, my mentor had ""doubts if the company fits by me as a person"". I was surprised and scared at the same time. Losing my internship, would result in having 1 year delay with my studies. Besides that.. I wanted to figure out through the year if this company is something I would want to work at when I graduate. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that week I had to have a conversation every week in which they made comments like: this company is not right for you, you're to vulnerable, you are to shy etc. When I explained my point of view in which I just need some time to get to know people, I get comments like: you can't take critique These conversations used to be in my mentoring-sessions. I also got comment's that colleagues would approach my mentor, because they were worried about me. If I asked about who, where, when, about what etc, I would not get answers. This made me very scared to be around colleagues, because I was wondering who would approach my mentor. I really want to work about my shyness and why my colleagues are worried, but I couldn't get grip on the exact behaviour or signs I was sending. I really wanted to improve myself, so I was making reflection rapportages, models, asking feedback. In the feedback some people commented about my shyness.. I never try to apply every feedback I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stuck in this spiral that every time I try to relax, they start doubting again if the internship is right for me, which causes me new stress in which I can't relax. 

&amp;#x200B;

This week I got an invertation to talk about my internship with the management and my mentor. When I asked them about what it was they told me it's about my dysfunctioning in my internship. The management is somebody who hires and fires people, so when they get involved it's serious business. 

&amp;#x200B;

The conversations made me really stressed, I also cried last week at my internship. Besides that I'm having physical compalnts and a chronic headache due stress, have trouble waking up and want to sleep whole day. I'm familiar with depressed episodes, and I'm slowly falling into depression again. 

&amp;#x200B;

My advice questions are:

\- How do I start being less shy?

\- How do I break the circle of shyness -&gt; mentors doubts me -&gt; more stress -&gt; more shyness -&gt; more doubts?

\- I'm also worried about my mental health. Is it better to quit my internship?

\- What do you guys think about the situation in general?

461,"Hi, I am a 20 year old university student and I've been dating my boyfriend for over a year and a half. We met a school and get along really well. He is mature, confident and for the most part a good boyfriend. He is not a very loving person. he tells me he loves me usually after I say it first and I've grown accustom to that since he has told me that he shows love in different ways. Over the last  few month we've had issues communicating how we are feeling loved by the other person. We have been very busy and became very compliant in the relationship. I've expressed that I respond well to verbal affirmation several times, he is not big on this. I cook him dinner at least once a week, I never forget to text good morning or good night and I go out of my way to spend time with him. I am a very motivated person. I study math, play for a varsity team and work a job. My free time is limited but I always make time for the people I care about. I consider myself to be a good and fair girlfriend and have gotten confirmation from him many times on this. 

&amp;#x200B;

A  week ago we had a very serious talk about how we make each other feel and he raised the concern that he thinks I want more from him. He used the example of a time I was away all day and he said he would cook me dinner. I ended up being an hour later and he claimed he was too hungry to wait so he cancelled on me. He said he could tell I was upset and wished he had waited for me, which I had told him about on that night. He says he constantly feels like what he is doing in not enough. While I was annoyed on that night any time he does anything for me I thank him because I do genuinely appreciate any little thing and am very understanding. He explained that every time he asks me how I am doing he is expressing love to me. Which I did realize but not the extent that he said it was. I told him that I found a new appreciation for how he feels about me and I apologized for making him feel like he wasn't enough because as I tell him everyday, he is. 

&amp;#x200B;

This past Saturday we were supposed to go on a date. Instead he came over and said he thinks he wants to break up because he feels like he cannot bounce back from feeling like he is not enough. Since our conversation on how we love I've felt appreciated in new ways and have tried to voice that. He feels like no matter what I say I will always want more. After I expressed that our relationship was a good one that I did not want to throw away without consideration he asked me for a break. We agreed on less than two weeks for him to sort some stuff out in his head. He expressed that he knows I do appreciate him but its the feelings inside his head that are telling him otherwise. It had only been one week since our big talk, so he had given himself one week where he acted completely normal with me and gave me no indication that he was still upset.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am feeling like he's already thrown in the towel and is enjoying this break. The night we decided to go on a break I spent alone crying while he went out to the bar. I cannot focus on work or school because I am sitting here assuming he has decided that he likes being single more than he likes being with me. This makes me sad because he is my best friend and our lives have become very intertwined over the course of our relationship which is part of why it is so fulfilling. 

&amp;#x200B;

My internal debate is the following; do I deserve to be treated like I have done something wrong after loving and supporting him fully for so long? My head tells me to go break up with him for not wanting to try harder to move on from what we shared. My heart is telling me to wait a week or two and let him realize that he loves me and should want to try. The only problem with the second part is he might realize just the opposite, which would make me feel like my love and support was not enough.

463,"I had a crush on a girl, we'll call her Poppy (not her real name) for about two years. She was everything I could have wanted but she only became interested around the end of half of the first year (end of seventh grade) and broke up with me after about two days, promising we'd get back together one day when ""it was the right time."" She went on to tell me over the summer she wasn't sure who she liked anymore, and dated someone else before I went to therapy, broke up with them and was asked out by some guy she didn't know in October of 8th grade. (They're still together as far as I know). I at first tried to be friends with him but he began to spread rumors about me and told me to kill myself multiple times. I'll admit, his antics pissed me off enough to where I retaliated and did some pretty bad things- tried to break them up for selfish reasons instead of actually caring about her well being and spread rumors about him and eventually spilled her secrets to everyone I knew, which I still regret. I left around February without a word and she only tried to talk to me once after that. Now, half a year later, I've tried everything. Waiting, new relationships, trying to convince myself she's not as good as I think, trying to take off the rose tinted glasses, vent drawing, talking to a therapist, EVERYTHING. Nothing helps. I tried to talk to her through a friend, just to maybe text or something for some closure, but she said we'd be better off not (if my friend didn't lie to spare my feelings).

464,"   So I’ve been working with this company for 3 years, but in this current department for about three months. For the most part everyone is friendly and extremely busy including myself and a majority of my work is done independently with absolutely no micromanaging, which is amazing. 
    There is one lady who works next to me and while we have the same job title, we don’t work on the same things. I get along with everyone in the department and usually keep to myself while working, however, this lady loves to talk..extremely loud. She hollers and acts like a child and spends a majority of the day complaining about work and other people in the office, with her two other friends that share the office with us. 
   At first I would block her out and focus on my work an music, but it’s a constant daily habit of hers to complain, gossip and talk. It’s getting to the point where I don’t even say much anymore, the other two ladies ask me what’s wrong but I simply say that I’m just focusing. I’m not perfect by any means but I can’t stand people that talk shit about others  and then act friendly with them to their face, and negative/complainers. 
   I’m the only guy on our office, but not the only guy in our department so I know when I came in I changed their dynamic. I did however, come in super receptive to their advice and training and was generally polite and friendly to them. I haven’t made any negative comments about or to them but it’s getting to the point where I have to pretend to go out of the office to do things, just so I can get a few minutes away. 
   I don’t want to resign, but it’s getting pretty unbearable, anyone know how to handle this, especially since wearing headphones isn’t an option for me.

I have tried working at places that they say are good for people with no skills (I have no skills) But my disabilities make that next to impossible and I have had to quit a few jobs. It is very discouraging.

I am probably going to fail one class without a doubt. And I still hardly know what I am persuing. It's my third year of school and I have most of my basic classes covered but I'm a junior with no declared major? I can't keep doing this, it would be stupid and I feel like I'm wasting money. I feel like I love psychology and that would be cool maybe but how can I know these things without experiencing it?

467,"(Alright, so fair warning this is my first post to reddit and I'm on mobile. I'm super nervous to make this!) 

So recently my boyfriends friend has been being very strange. It started out when I was pushing my boyfriend to spend more time with his friends, rather than me every single day. However, his friend only wanted to hang out with him when he knew I was with my boyfriend. 
The other night my boyfriend was over and he kept telling him to come stay, and obviously he didn't because he was with me for the night. The next morning we wake up and his friend has added him to a group chat where they send each other the dirty photos girls have sent them. My boyfriend shows me, and is honestly disgusted with the concept-as am I. There's about three girls photos getting sent and they're all saying ""expose these hoes"".
Well at this point we were both wondering what his friend was adding him for? Because apparently they dont talk about sexual things plus he knew I was most likely with him still. So, it was either to piss me off or he wanted my pictures that he doesnt even know if they exist or not. It's just baffling to me.

But then later my boyfriend has a picture of us on his story, just a random selfie. And his friend messages him and says ""You guys just got done fucking""  Now, I'm very freaked out. I dont know if I'm overreacting about this one or not. It could be just an ignorant comment but it bothered us both a lot. Alright, so my boyfriend nicely tells him that it's weird hes saying this and the guy says ""I mess everything up..."" and I tell my boyfriend to blow it off for now and be kind but his friend just said ""yea..."" so we just tried to ignore it. 

Well today is where it gets hella weird. His friend asks if hes still mad and I dont know what was exactly said since I dont go to the same school as them but they made up. His friend proceeded to invite him to go with a couple other of friends to an abandoned asylum. Red flags set off for me when he named off a couple people he isnt too fond of as the other two that would be going. They said it was in ""Louis Town"" in a state nearby us and I looked it up... and there isn't even a Louis town in that state. Soooooo now that I found that out, my innocent and overly trusting boyfriend thinks he was going to get murdered. Which isn't that strange seeing this situation. 
I'm honestly so confused about this all.

(TL:DR My boyfriend has a friend who seems to be too interested in our sexual life and also invited him to a place out of state that doesnt exist. Which is super creepy.)",19Nov2018,1

473,"I am a college student with a work study job. We only work 8 hours a week.

I have had a supervisor for the last two years at my work study. He was hired two years into my college career. I have been there four years. My boss loves me, and so does the chief head of the department I am in. All the staff love me. I have never had a bad experience in the department with the other staff.

I met my supervisor and he seemed nice. We got to know each other in the workplace, and we actually started keeping in touch outside of work as well. Last December, he took me to the college he used to work at and we walked around and saw the Christmas lights. He took me out to sushi for my 21st birthday too before I went home for the holidays ( I am 2.5 hours away from home when I am at school ). He and I gained a really nice friendship and I gave him advice on a girl he really liked. He and I did get into slight sexual talk, and he asked me if I would ever have sex with him and I said I wasn't sure.

After a little while our friendship grew distant. We stopped texting every day. I thought it was mostly because we were busy etc. Over the course of the last two semesters, he has just turned into an absolute asshole. He has been trying to make me look stupid in the workplace, giving me more work to do than my fellow work study students, telling me to do one thing and getting mad if I do it and telling me he wanted something else. Work studies are supposed to allow me to study a bit while I work and now every time I work I have to do projects for him that other students aren't involved in.

The last 4 years I always call the specific person in the department that specializes in an issue to resolve a problem someone contacts me for. (that's what I'm supposed to do... always have) and one day I called a specific person for help and my supervisor came FLYING around the corner saying ""NO! YOU DON'T CALL THEM FOR THAT YOU CALL ME!!!"" and stomped off. There have been times he's made me almost cry because he stresses me out and is a dick to me.

I've seriously never had an issue like this before and I don't know what to do. He smiles at everyone else and has a great attitude but with me he doesn't even have an average look on his face. he just looks angry with me.

484,"So we used to be 6 in the household, but my brother went to Nottingham to get his Master’s Degree and my dad works across country, so me, my mom, my sister and our maid are in the home now.

Me and my mom realized that money had been disappearing left and right, I lost my old phone and  about 560$ dollars in total and my mom lost some perfume gifts and 60$ dollars. 

I mean I suspected my sis maybe she took the money by mistake or really needed them but she denied it and she always hands out money to me whenever I need some so it would be weird.

I suspected my mom (I KNOW) I really felt ashamed afterwards but it got me really paranoid because I wanna upgrade my Gaming Pc and my parents don’t have that much money to spare so I save money for that.

What really made me suspect the maid is that when the perfumes went missing and my mom asked her if she knew where they was (she didn’t shout or anything she was normal) the maid denied it and the next day asked my mom to send her back to her country (Bangladesh) after a couple of days she said she changed her mind and wants to stay.

Fast forward 2 months, yesterday 60$ disappeared from my mom’s bedroom and when she asked her about it again (I admit she was pissed but she didn’t shout this time too, her tone was angry), surprise surprise the maid told my mom today that she wants to go back again. 

I tried everything I could to see where my phone was but it was JailBroken and the Find my Phone was not working, me and my mom swept the house and didn’t find any of the stolen items.

out of frustration I went to the maid’s storage room downstairs when she was sleeping in her room, but I couldn’t find anything in such small time because it’s literally trashed, until I found a hidden purse with like 4000$ in it, I am a complete fool because it’s just that I never saw that much money in my life, they were just lying there, I took about 800 dollars and upgraded my pc with the money. 

I feel like shit and I can’t return the upgrades, and I spent the whole night crying out of desperation, and I can’t tell my mom about it.

490,"So basically, I’ve been employed in a restaurant since February; I started as a hostess and takeout server, and I got promoted to an assistant manager position two weeks ago. The coworker in question is a bartender/server.

About 2 weeks ago, I had to do something called ‘positionals’ before I got promoted. It essentially means I follow around people with different positions so that I can better understand what each position entails. During one of my positional shifts, this coworker was the one who I was following. She was being very rude the whole time; I thought it was uncharacteristic. While we never had any in-depth conversations, we exchanged basic niceties. 

I was supposed to just be following her around, but I ended up taking care of 3 of her 4 tables. She spent a lot of this time in the kitchen, talking on the phone. She was very agitated at the fact that I wasn’t pre-bussing tables; she raised her voice at me several times through the shift. It ended up being a very emotionally draining day, so I tried to convey that the way she was speaking to me was upsetting. She told me that I needed ‘to put on my big girl panties and stop crying.’ I mostly let that day roll off my shoulders, but it doesn’t stop there.

A couple days pass and I thought that the drama surrounding the situation had died down. She was working the bar, so I swing by and ask her how she was doing. She told me to not to speak to her. Which, weird; I told the manager on duty that she said that. They pull her aside and apparently, there she was upset about a rumor that I was talking about her behind her back. The person who was spreading this rumor is notably untrustworthy and enjoys drama.

I tried to let it roll off my shoulders again, because at the end of the day some people are just going to not like you. Today, though, was actually my first day serving as the on-duty assistant manager. I was working expo; I accidentally sent out a steak quesadilla instead of a chicken one while we were in a rush. The coworker tells me to “stop plating her food because I keep fucking it up.” I’m not proud of my response, but I told her that I invite her to; it makes the $15/hr I make a lot easier. She’s pretty angry at this response and talks continually about how no one in the reataurant “cares” when she’s struggling. 

The manager on duty ends up calling us in the office at the end of the day. I proceed to ask her what her problem is; she blatantly refuses to speak to me and says that she will never work a shift with me again. The other manager just sort of lets her walk all over me without speaking up in my defense. 

All in all, there are a few factors I’m annoyed about: 
1. The managers on duty NEVER discipline this woman.  No getting her sent home early or revoking her bartender position like they’ve done for other rude people. They let her speak to whoever she wants to, however she wants to. 
2. The fact that ALL of this drama stems from a rumor that isn’t even true!
3. That the drama happened like, 2 weeks ago and it still hasn’t blown over?

How do I proceed from here? I have no clue how to handle any of this anymore, and I’m on the verge of putting in my 2 weeks. Logically I know it would be a bad idea; who else would pay a college student $15/hr? But I really cannot cope with this sort of environment anymore.

TLDR: I work in a restaurant and one of my coworkers is being a bitch because of a rumor that isn’t even true. My managers are being no help. What do I do?

491,"I've posted bits and pieces about this before but here's the whole story so y'all can get a better idea of the situation.

So recently I've had feelings/a crush on this girl I work with, like legit out of nowhere. I've never had a crush on a girl before and when I met her I was not attracted to her at all. 

Now that I like her though, I have become attracted to her. So it all started on this one shift, I just noticed she kept brushing by me, nothing that couldn't be accidental but it kept happening. And she also walked up to me a couple of times and just said 'I love you'. She tells me she missed me when she sees me or when I'm leaving she sometimes says she's going to miss me. 

She's also the only person I like hugging, she often just walks up to me and hugs me (this isn't unusual though, she hugs tonnes of other people too). 

Anyway, after it all started, a few things have happened which have made me kind of confused.
 
She asked 'Wait, are you straight...? Or gay..?' 

The question wasn't entirely out of the blue but it didn't fit into the conversation either. 

I said something along the lines of 'Uh yeah, I'm straight... (This is where I thought about how much I liked her, so I continued) I think, but I dunno, I mean it's 2018, anything's possible'

Then I asked her, 'why? Are you gay?'

She just smiled, shrugged and said 'its 2018, anything's possible'

For reference with the next part, she's a manager (or training to be) and the managers office in our store is quite small maybe 2x3 metres with only 2x1m of standing room, if that. 

So after this, I was rocking up early for work so I could stand in the office and talk with her, then she invited me a to come sit and eat with her while I was on break a couple of times. One of those times I ended up sitting on the stool facing her, while she stood between my knees counting cash. This is mostly because there's not a lot of space but she could have easily moved aside and counted cash from the side if she wanted to. 
Another time I ended up sitting on a crate, squashed in behind her while she sat on the stool, my legs kept brushing against her thigh but neither of said anything about it just talked about stuff. 

She also said to 'I can't really imagine you being friends with girls' (she'd asked me if I was friends with more boys or girls and I told her girls).
I'm not really sure what that means but it seemed a strange thing to say, especially seeing she is my friend - otherwise what were we?

And just the other day, we were talking to someone else we work with, about who to choose over her Ex and her best friend who both like her, and the girl I like said out of nowhere 'you should get with a girl'

So my question to you guys is, does she like me or is just a friendly, open minded straight girl? 
Or maybe she's bi/gay but she's not into me, how do I know and what do you guys think?

I'm looking forward to start a hobby-specific subreddit, but I'm worried I'm getting ahead of myself when I don't have any sort of personal following or tight bonds with any sub-community in reddit, and I generally don't try to stand out in any situation. Because of this, I'm very skeptical that I can push this forward and reach a community.

That's one thing. But besides that, I'm curious whether there are unspoken rules to this, or common patterns to a subreddit destined to fail. Do you have any personal experiences you could share?

Whatever it is, I thank you now for your time.",19Nov2018,1

494,"hey guys, so long story short my dad has had really bad anxiety since he was a kid. he’s an alcoholic (8 years sober). he always worried about me growing up, taking on those bad traits from him. i remember in 8th grade the first time i felt extreme anxiety and just kind of continued dealing with that and just thought it was apart of my personality until 10th grade i completely fell off the deep end. stayed in bed constantly, never went to class, acted extremely reckless and out of character, hopeless, felt like i was dealing with anxiety and depression but for some reason felt ashamed saying that out loud. i didn’t want to seem like i was just making it up for attention because i know a lot of people loosely throw around those terms. my mom finally decided to take me to therapy and i hated it a lot because i was super angry all the time and very resentful so i didn’t want to be there. i stopped going despite my parents encouraging me to stay. a few months went by and some things in my life were getting better so i didn’t feel as sad or down but definitely still anxious a ton. anyways, four years later, i feel like i’ve just accepted anxiety as apart of my personality and kept it at bay for remained of HS since i had a tight knit friend group and was always super busy and distracted but now that i’m in college i feel like it’s gotten a lot more severe. i feel like even when i’m in situations where i should be happy, i still feel like this sadness creeping up on me no matter what. i’m definitely super lonely since i’m commuting this year so that doesn’t help. i had an anxiety attack for the first time in a long time and it was awful. i dont know what to do. my parents think everything is great and i hate worrying them. i’m annoyed at my 10th grade self for taking any sort of counseling for granted because now it’s all i want. but i don’t even know how much that costs. part of me says oh you’ll be fine once you transfer schools one day but at the same time i don’t think i should undermine what i’m feeling. anyways i’m just tired of this looming sadness over me constantly and i can never suppress my anxious thoughts no matter what i do. my heart races and i get this pit in my stomach. how have you guys overcome this type of thing? thanks for reading everyone.

497,"i’d just like some guidance on where to go in my life...
so i’m 16 years old male living in south africa. many factors in my life have led me to become extremely depressed, demotivated and lazy. some days i feel like killing myself but there is so much more out there i can never bring myself to do it. i’m at an important junction in my life but i cannot think clearly for myself so i will provide some background on my current situation.

i have terrible social anxiety and cannot look people in the eye that i do not know well. school is not a problem as i am in a small boys only catholic school and have known everybody for 6-8 years. i cannot relax in social gatherings and become super weird and uncomfortable.

i have been a guitarist for 2 years or so and plan to do a bachelor of music after i have completed school. i also write poetry but i am still unsure if i am truly creative. Music is the love of my life and the only thing i’m truly interested in. 

i only have 3 close friends. my so called best friend also is impersonal and extremely vague. he is kind but i do not have the same character as him. he’s moving schools as well so that relationship is pretty much over. My other friend is my favourite friend so to speak. i have had the best times with him. he introduced me to weed and introduced me to my true self as well (unrelated to weed). he is great but i don’t think he regards me as an extremely close friend. he has a whole different friend group who he hangs out with often. he has many other close friends.

there is a girl i have been talking to over the internet for  a year and a half who lives 10-15 min drive from my house. we know that as soon as we meet we will start a relationship. we ‘like’ each other so to speak. we have even fantasized over a life together. the only problem is i cannot meet her because of my social anxiety and the fact that i can’t find a way to tell my parents i am going to hangout with a girl. i know i’m 16 but in South Africa you aren’t as free as in other places. 

my father (an ex-psychologist) says i have a high iq but i’m not so sure anymore. i think it’s been a slow decline since childhood. i do averagely in school but i cannot study so my b’s and c’s are luck anyway. 

despite what i’ve mentioned i think the true me is cool, personable and truly caring. 

Now to my family members...


For one my father is cheating on my mother with somebody at work. only i know and this is not the first time. the first time i found out, i was 10 and heard the confrontation about him cheating between my mom and him. it has happened again and i don’t know what to do. i even saw his texting a different woman romantically just before my first trip overseas. completely terrible trip after that. sad to think about.
 i never told anybody i heard this until last year when i finally told my dad. i forgave him but only out of necessity. I am still deciding about what to do about the most recent time.

i think my mother has alzheimer’s as she is showing major signs of it. she is 56. i don’t know how to bring it up to anybody.

my relationship with my sister (27) is strange, she is the nicest person you’d ever meet but she can be extremely cruel behind your back. i have heard her say some very hurtful things behind my back. 
she wants to control my life (cliché i know) and she always weighs her point of view higher than mine and other.

my brother (22) is gay (out) and has extremely high functioning autism (my sister told me this). he can’t ever get very personal, he is a private person. i understand that autism may cause this but he can never truly be kind for long periods of time. he believes that i am unmotivated and lazy (i’m anything but). 

i go through moments of everything not going my way. people think that i am rude when i don’t  greet people properly or avoid them but i just cannot socialize properly because of social anxiety. i don’t have anybody to vent to and i am really lonely. (in person at least). i worry that i have been lying to myself and am not a creative person at all (i want to be a writer and musician). i never feel happy unless i am chilling and smoking a joint. i do not abuse weed don’t worry. i have no money because my family is financially struggling right now. we are middle class but recently we have been struggling much worse. i am constantly feeling lost and in a daze. i am depressed. in the past month i have been smoking 2 boxes of cigarettes a week- out of stress. i’m also in the middle of exams flunking out when i think i could be top of the grade.

i feel that i should kill myself but i can’t bring myself to do it cause i know there’s so much more to experience. i want to meet more people and see more places and do more things.

there’s so much here i’m unsure of. any ideas will surely help. thanks if you have taken the time to skim through this.

505,"Let me start with some context, I turned 23 a few months ago. From the age of 16-21 my life pretty much consisted of going in and out of the hospital for mental health. I never could hold a regular job, and purely lived of my family. When I turned 21 I started working for Uber, it is a great fit. I live close to a big city and on my bad days I can take time off without having to explain why to a boss. I slowly crawled my way to a functioning adult over a year and half.

But then in early October I was in a car accident, that I wasn't at fault for. It happened on private property so the police wouldn't say who's at fault, and spent 3-4 weeks arguing back and forth with insurance companies about fault and repairs, even though I had video showing them at fault. I missed an over a month of work, which was a bad enough start. Then when I tried to get back to work when my car was fixed, I hit a mental wall. I was so anxious about the debt that had accumulated it was causing me to freeze. Now when I try to work, I usually end up overwhelmed and back home crying in an hour or two.

I am $2,500 in debt. My cellphone, car payment, and car insurance are all past due. I tried applying for a loan with local bank, even considered selling my car (wouldn't get anything for it). I don't know what to do. I feel so stuck and overwhelmed by everything, my mom tells me the missed car payments prevented her from getting house loan.

516,"My husband, whom I think is a wonderful person and whose praises I sing up and down during has a frustrating habit of always working too much and I just don’t know how to not let this bother me nearly as much as it does.

I find this frustrating for several reasons:

1. He’s a salaried employee and doesn’t get paid extra for his extra time.

2. He’s got ADHD which he does not take medication for any longer, this in turn makes him procrastinate and dilly dally a lot more so when he stays late to finish a task I get frustrated knowing he likely could’ve finished it a lot earlier if he didn’t noodle around on his phone every ten minutes. He has no interest in taking his medication again because he doesn’t like the way it makes him feel (this part is not an issue for me, just providing some context!)

3. He goes in early and stays late most days - partly due to being unable to get tasks done in a timely fashion but it’s A LOT of extra time that he works and the company we work for could not give any fewer shits about its employees so I feel negatively watching him give this company his precious time when it’s not going to give anything back - I’ve tried to suggest he look for other jobs but with the ADHD (and his anxiety) he puts that off as well. 

4. It is *impossible* to get him to leave work on time to get to events. If we need to be somewhere at 7 and he has to leave at 5:30 to get there in time, I just tell him to leave at 5 instead. And then even still he’ll be late and leave at 6. It seems that no matter how much I stress we can’t be late or how much earlier I tell him to leave he still loses track of time and ends up late.  

5. When hourly employees or someone else calls out or goes home early he’s the first to fall on his sword to stay late and help out. 

6. I end up doing most of the housework because it needs to get done but it’s dark or late by the time he gets back. For example I love cooking but it would be really nice to not be the meal maker 90% of the time. I don’t mind doing dishes but I do mind doing all the dishes all the time. We own a house and there’s a lot of shit we need to do for that and I do the majority of all that as well because if I didn’t he’d never get it done. He’s a procrastinator by nature and the working late just exacerbates it. 

7. He does all this and is always so eager to give up his time and prove that he’s a good employee but he’s never eager to give up some work to show me he cares. I know this is irrational but it hurts to constantly play second fiddle to his job. 

8. I’ve talked to him about how he and his time are more valuable than he treats them and that I don’t feel like work should take up as much of his life as it does. We’ve had some deep, philosophical discussions about this and the we agree on part parts but he and still stays late and especially lately hasn’t made much effort to leave on time. 

9. For a while I was nagging him all the time to leave on time. I decided to stop doing that and just appreciate my alone time before he gets home. But now that I’m not nagging him he leaves even later! And it’s often an hour and a half to two hours later than he should have left. It’s inconsistent and I think rude to make a person wonder when you’re going to leave with a two hours swing in there.

I know I can’t fundamentally change him as a person but I also don’t know how to make myself not be bothered by it. And I just don’t know what to do, even as a write this he was scheduled to leave over an hour ago and hasn’t yet, I don’t know how to accept this about him without feeling personally hurt as if he’s choosing time at work over me.

523,"Hey Reddit, I'm posting here because I have no other options left and don't know what I can do from here. A little backstory on this situation. I'm a 20 y/o and living in a home with my mom and stepdad. They were together but recently have gone their separate ways. For the last month or two they've been arguing and finally decided to break up. My stepdad, Dave, is a business owner. He runs his own BBQ catering service and during this time of year he usually vacations to Florida. My mom would usually go with him as well but since they are braking up she is home this year. 

He told us he is going to be in Florida for the next 1-3 months. While he's down there he decided he wasn't going to be paying for cable or internet. Now he is the account holder of the service and he usually pays it. This time he put our service in vacation mode. So our cable and internet has been shut off for about a week now. We tried calling Spectrum to see if they can do anything and they couldn't help at all since neither myself or my mom are the account holder. We even went as far to as trying to get a whole other company to provide us internet but where we're located no other company provides us service besides Spectrum. As far as I know, having Dave take our service off vacation mode is our only option. We have told him that we would pay the bill and all he needs to do is just call and get it taken care of. For whatever reason he will not do that. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? Is there any way around this? Any kind of help or suggestion will be greatly appreciated.



TLDR: My stepdad owns the internet account and went on vacation and had the service shut off for the next few months. My mom and I are stuck at home without cable or internet and don't have any options. ",19Nov2018,1
524,"I’m a student who just started university this year. I got accepted into a program I wanted the most, and I was actually super happy about it. However, throughout the term, there have been several times where the thoughts of switching to another university came to mind. My current program isn’t stressing me out right now, and nothing wrong with my social life here either... I’ve been trying to figure out why I have these thoughts, and I concluded with these:

- I don’t like being in another city. I can and like to go home every weekend, but this also made me realize how much I would’ve enjoyed it if I went to a university in my city. I start getting a bit stressed when I can’t go home. 

- Everyone in my program are all here because they have a clear goal (obtaining their CPA and working in big firms) but for me I found that I don’t really mind where I work. So I would think, do I really want to be paying so much tuition to be at this university if I don’t take advantage of the networking and career opportunities

I’m scared that if I don’t act soon I’ll be stuck in this program, not that I dislike it though, and I’m well aware of why it’s better than similar programs in other universities.  Idk what I should do or do anything at all..I found that I was always able to handle stress before because I got to go home everyday after school. 

Sometimes these thoughts come and go. When I tell myself “ forget about it, you’re thinking too much”, I can’t tell if I actually am, or am I just ignoring how I actually feel. I also feel like I lack the courage to switch. This is mainly because if I do switch, it will be to a similar program that’s not as great, and I might have to redo first year as the courses in first year are quite different despite being similar programs. If I switch however, I’ll be able to go home everyday with short commuting times, I also found that I’m more motivated at home. But I lack this courage to switch because I can’t guarantee that I’ll be any more satisfied. What if I regret leaving this great program...

527,"'Short' background: (sorry if the translation of the conversations isn't great, I'm from Belgium and speak Dutch) 

Last saterday we were hanging out with friends, checking out a series on Netflix (it was a group weekend and we had to kill time). While watching she was laying next to me and I put my arm around her and she was lying with her head on my chest. 

We decide to go to another room to continue looking Netflix. In that other room we couldn't lie close to each other because of camp beds. But we started holding hands and when we wanted to kiss, people came in and said they wanted to sleep, so we couldn't continue watching and had to leave. 

So we leave the room, go to the main hall and continued hanging out with the others. I texted her to ask if we could finish the season (it was the last episode and like 10 minutes remaining) of that series so that nobody would notice what we were doing and she said 'Yes sounds good'. We were having difficulty getting out so I sent 'can we get out of here? Lol' and she said 'hahaha not without getting any looks'. 

We finally do manage to get out, talked some more in private and eventually we kissed outside, wanted to do more but since all of the rooms had people inside (and it was cold outside), we said goodnight and went to bed (in different rooms). Even though we both had something to drink, the kiss and holding hands felt more than just a kiss, or holding hands. 

Sunday, when we were both back home, I asked if she wanted to continue watching what we were watching the day before and she said she wanted to watch the previous episodes first. So I said we could start the next season of that series together, because picking up a series right in the middle of a season is hard and that the backstory could be useful. She responded with: 'Sounds good ;)'. 

I stopped sending anything, because I thought that I should give her space, prefer talking in person and let her rest since it was a tiring weekend. I have not heard back from her yet, nor have I sent anything yet. Today is Monday evening so it has only been a day.

Have I messed up by not sending anything after that? Should I send something still, if yes what could I send? I see her almost every weekend, alongside all of the friends who were with us last weekend, so I could also wait and talk to her in person.

Sorry for the wall of text. ",19Nov2018,1
528,"As the title states, I've found a stray cat (not sure of gender), and my family is willing to take it in and take care of it. The reason I'm concerned is that winter is right around the corner here in southern Ohio (it was 30 degrees fahrenheit/ just under 0 degrees celsius the middle of last week), and, seeing just how thin the little thing is, I'm not sure it is going to make it. This is why I want to take it home to my family when we travel back for Thanksgiving.

The reason I hesitate is because, while the cat seems generally uncared for (poor thing was drinking out of muddy driveway water, and there's certainly not much weight on it), there seems to be a sort of communal feeding system going on. I've seen a couple sets of bowls on porches around the area, and one porch even has a small shelter for it, but it doesn't seem significant enough for the upcoming winter.

Let me reiterate: this cat is without a doubt a stray. But the factors I've mentioned have made the decision a bit blurry. I've not yet made a move to take it back to my apartment so we can take it back up for Thanksgiving, but I need to by Wednesday afternoon. Along with this, I'm not really willing to chase it if it runs onto a porch, since I neirher want to look creepy, nor do I want to trespass.

If I do take it home, should I also try to sedate him for the ride home, and what should I use? My wife is allergic to cats, and can't really hold it during the two hour trip, but she is willing to help this one out due to the winter.",19Nov2018,1

543,"Background:  I bought a house a few years ago, and got a house mate at the time to help with costs.  I've since gotten a great raise, and I've been leaning towards going solo. I finally made up my mind, and waited for the first of the month to give a clean three months notice.  Two days before the end of the month, my roommate let me know that they were dealing with some psychological issues.  I made the call to hold off (didn't tell them anything), as I didn't want to add to the problem. 

It's now been two months, and it is starting to really affect me.  Moving from a decisive action to a holding pattern for a few months is crazy stressful for me.  I'm starting to feel like a prisoner in my own house/dreading going home.  Always on pins and needles. We have a lot of shared friends, and I can't really talk to anyone in those circles about this.

545,"Need advice for coping. 

Me and SO currently live with SO's dad and who has terminal cancer and his partner. I will refer to him as SD and his partner as G.
SD and G come from a different generation that value independence. They value their independence to their own detriment. 
G also has cancer. Several months have passed since her last chance to get an operation that would completely cure her cancer. She has not told any of her family and is not getting any treatment for it. She works 7 days a week on her feet all day. Me and SO aren't supposed to know about her illness but SD told us about it anyway. She will not even entertain the idea of taking time off work for any reason, even to save her life. G's son lives here too and is a 26 year old deadbeat. He is rude, aggressive, self centered, doesn't help around the house, doesn't pay rent, has shown schizophrenic symptoms, eats 3 times as much as a normal human, spends all day in his room playing games and talking aloud to himself. G refuses to entertain the idea that he needs help, and takes it as a personal attack on her parenting. She truly believes that one day he will wake up and just go and get a job. She will never kick him out because it would make her feel bad. She alternates between complaining about him and defending him. She is also a hoarder and costing them a lot of money from needing to rent a storage unit due to her refusal to throw anything away.  
SD is incontinent and in pain all the time due to a botched operation to freeze his tumor, and on large amounts of medication. He is entitled to compensation that would ease their financial burdens but keeps convincing himself he's not entitled to it despite being told repeatedly, in no uncertain terms, by all relevant authorities,  that he is. He doesn't eat food or drink water on any kind of regular basis and keeps going out to do errands by himself. The last 3 times he has almost blacked out in public. He also doesn't take his phone with him because he wants to feel independent. Both SD and G aren't taking their illnesses seriously and keep pushing themselves further than they can handle. They are too stubborn to listen to anyone. They put their own pride above all else. 
SO has multiple severe health issues of his own and is not coping well mentally with this situation. Neither am I. I have several mental health issues I'm getting medication and treatment for, but to be honest an hour a week at therapy isn't enough. SD has no sympathy for SOs health problems and keeps lecturing him and pressuring him to get a job. I have not disclosed most of my own issues to SD because I refuse to subject myself to the same judgement. SD tends to think he knows best and is not open to new perspectives or information that doesn't match his own view of the world. Very close minded and judgemental of others. 
Me and SO will be moving out to save our sanity next year, so long as we can push SD to apply for the compensation. Once that goes through they will manage well financially. It's the hill we've picked to die on because it's the one thing we can actually help with that gives them a better life and gives us a way out. Emotions are running too high to stay here much longer and someone will snap eventually. I know that despite everything SD will not want us to leave, but it's for the best. If he won't let us help, there's nothing we can do, as much as this situation hurts. We need space to breathe where we can feel like adults instead of being treated like teenagers who don't know anything and can't say anything of value as far as SD and G are concerned. They want our rent, but not our support or help with the problems they complain about. They rarely thank us for helping around the house, buying essentials or making dinner.

I’d be lying if I said I deep down didn’t want to end up with someone in life, love someone and be loved, etc., but I’m honestly not willing to do the work for that right now. Right now, what I really really want is sex. Good, passionate sex.  Something that really gets me going and is not just only “okay”, because then it wouldn’t be worth it. 

I had two potentials, both seemed promising. One I’ve been acquaintances with for years, and we ended up sleeping together once (was supposed to be the start of this new sexual relationship), and the other I had gone out for drinks with once. They both didn’t work out for different reasons, but I was 100% open with them about what I wanted, if that’s something they’d be interested in, no pressure, etc. “What I wanted” basically consists of smoking pot, cuddling, having sex, laughing, watching movies. And, for that person to be a decent human being. That’s it. And it wasn’t easy for me to get this across at first because I’ve never been so direct in my life, and I needed to be careful and crafty lol. 

Anyway, I’m pissed that I don’t have this. I didn’t think it would be this difficult, once I had the 2 potentials. Now that both those guys are out of the picture, I want another potential at least.

I was curious to know what possesses people to do such evil things, so I watched the entire video. I was horrified by it, however, in the coming days I started to think about pedophilia a lot. I remember that the man seemed normal, and started thinking that anyone could be a pedophile. That morphed into me thinking, ""what if I am/will be one too?"" I got so scared that I stayed away from kids for like a month. I even felt guilty when I was around children younger than me or if I watched a movie and there was a kid in it. I've never had any sexual thoughts about kids in any way but I still felt guilty all the time. I'm 16 now, but was about 14 when I watched the documentary and anytime I found someone famous attractive I'd have to look online to check their age. If they were like 1 or 2 years younger than me I'd start feeling guilty all over again.

I've noticed that anytime I watch a horror show or the news about someone doing something terrible I always get what if thoughts. I wonder if that could be me.

552,"Hey everyone, first post in this sub from mobile so early apologies for errors. If I need to fix anything, kindly let me know! This may be long winded.

Some preface, I worked at a horrible car dealership for over 3 years selling OEM parts previously, had awful management and consistently disappointing commission checks as I learned the industry. We were sunk cost constantly and the dealer (from what I hear from employees still there) is now up for closure review as of last week. I had been one foot out the door for a year under new management, and they eventually suspended me for COI due to the fact that I opened a drop ship business for new/used parts after hours. I feel like it was a cop-out to term an all but gone employee, I was top sales performer but had daily disagreements with upper management. This is long story short, I can provide details if needed.

I have been working for a new employer under the same role for 2 months now. During the initial hiring process, they determined they could not afford me at the original dealer I applied for due to it being a low volume dealer. I ended up being placed at a very high volume dealer instead. During negotiations, I was told my shift is 8-5 Monday through Friday with one Saturday a month. I am a salary (low sal) plus commission pay plan. We could not negotiate PTO, but was informed my reporting manager is very relaxed with time off requests. We settled on a projected comp reviewing sales of the other employees.

To date, my schedule has now been changed to:

Week 1 - 7-5 m-f
Week 2 - 8-6 m-f w/ 1 8.5hr sat
Week 3 - 7-4 m-f
Week 4 - 7-5 m-f w/ 1 8.5hr sat

There is no comp for Saturday's, and no relief shifts for the additional shift.

Where I had initially been told I was working 160 hr months with one 8.5 hour Saturday, I am now working 192 hr months with 2 Saturday's and zero extra compensation.

They grovelled at my feet during multiple interviews, begging me to join their team. They said my experience was exactly what they needed and would consider me for an assistant manager position within a year if I joined.

My concerns: once I got here, I learned everybody else in my Dept have been here for a minimum of 15 years, and none of them are APM's. Listening to their convos, most of them are single with no kids, and don't bring a lot of money home. They work through their hour lunches, I do not (that's an additional 20 hrs a month). Another concern is I'm watching my sales figures, and they are about 1/3 of what the projected sales were if I took the position. As I note take my sales I'm learning at least 1/3 of my calls are transfers to other employees by client requests (typical in my environment). This leads me to believe that I am an overflow position, and these numbers were an assumption, not a known figure.

It really does seem like a great company, and there are a lot of lifers here. My fears are that I DO NOT want to relive my last employer experience. I don't want to get stuck in a pattern again of thinking the next month will be better than the last month. My SO also has concerns as well because my last job was so bad, it significantly affected my mental happiness and put me into depression for over a year until the suspension where I finally got some clarity.

I guess, my question is, did I get honeypotted? Am I unreasonable to not want to take on almost another weeks worth of work for a projected 1/3rd of the compensation I was promised? Should I stay here longer? Looking for advice from the community. I am happy to answer any questions or fill in any info.

556,"I'll try to keep this relatively brief. \*\*TL;DR:\*\* I'm stressed, depressed, and considering taking next semester off to work and get healthier. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 20, living at home in California, and I've been taking classes at my local community college part time since I was 16. At first it was just courses I was interested in (mostly music and foreign languages), but now after this semester I'll have taken all the general education requirements for transfer to an UC/CSU. The problem is I still have no idea what to major in. I was considering computer science, but I'm not terribly excited by it, and I'd need a ton of math courses that I haven't taken. I'm only just taking Calculus 1 this semester -- I'd need 4 more semesters of math alone after that to transfer to Berkeley -- and I'm not doing that great in Calc 1. I don't think I'm really bad at math necessarily, it's just I don't have much experience in it. This is my first real math class; I was home-schooled and remembered/learned absolutely no trigonometry, so that's been making it harder, and I've been falling behind a bit. I also haven't really learned how to study, since until this class I've been getting by doing all my work right at the last minute. I don't think I've ever started an essay or homework assignment sooner than the day before it was due, which is pretty pathetic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I need to change my habits and attitude towards school, but it's not like I'm bunking off to go party or play video games. I'm constantly tired and have no energy even to pursue any of my other interests. I think if I took a semester off, I'd be less stressed out from school and could focus more on improving myself. I'm pretty substantially underweight, and I think I'd be able to eat and cook more consistently. As it is I've been skipping breakfast often due to sleeping in since I'm always exhausted and running out of time to eat before walking the \~1.5 miles to the bus stop to get to my morning class. There's also not much I can get to eat while I'm at school due to my Celiac disease. I'm finally getting my driver's licence in a couple weeks, which'll make it a lot easier to go get groceries, go to the gym, commute to school if I choose not to take a break, as well as get a job. All this could be done while going to school, but I don't think I'd have the energy or capability really to manage it all at once. I'm thinking while I'm not at school I'll be better able to get into a routine of actually practicing my hobbies, which I might be able to transfer to study habits once I start school again.

I'm sort of afraid my parents will be cross if I decide to take a semester off from college, and I'm still not sure if it's even the right thing to do. I don't think I'll do very well if I \*don't\* take a break either though.  I've glossed over most of the depression stuff.
