0,"I know the title is vague but this might get long so please bear with me. 

I’ve (F21) been working at a bowling alley in the cafe for 6 months and I’ve had a problem with a male (20) coworker. We’ll call this guy Brian. I knew Brian was off from the first day I met him. Not off like psycho or anything but off like difficult. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt when I have this feeling because I will have to work with them so better to get along, right? Well Brian has a massive problem. I believe Brian to be a pathological liar and flat out lazy. 

Brian has told me a lot of personal things that, for fear of being too obvious I will not disclose, just don’t add up. Lots of lies littered with the occasional truth so I don’t know what to believe. He’ll subtly insult my work ethic and intelligence while praising himself. He talks big game behind my back but has said nothing to my face. 

So far, not too bad, until he started this habit of leaving the cafe and going off somewhere without telling me. He disappears for like 15-20 minutes at a time every 1-2 hours. On top of that, he has been calling out a lot which makes me have to pick up the slack because we are supposed to close together. 

Then the worst thing you could ever have as a food worker: Brian has been making our staff and customers sick with his food. It isn’t cooked enough at times and he never takes the temperature of meat on the grill. I’m getting tired of food having to be remade or manager privileged because we didn’t make it right the first time. I’m so tired picking up and cleaning up after him. 

I honestly feel like this is something I need to talk to him about because it’s impacting me. I’ve already gently talked to a manager about it and she knows all about what Brian does and wants him out of the cafe, but unfortunately we have so few people that can work cafe that we have to have him in there. 

What can I do, if anything? Do I just leave it to a manager? Do I talk to him, and if so how do I bring it up and what do I say? Thanks for reading, I know it’s long. 

TL;DR: my coworker is a huge liar and not a great worker and people are getting sick off his food. The managers know but their hands are tied for now. What do I do, if anything? ",10Jun2018,8

2,"I don't know what to do, today has been a very hard day.  My dad is in his late 30s.

To start off my dad has been acting strange for the past few weeks.  We marked it up to stress due to him losing his younger brother, his first grandchild being born, and being evicted with my younger siblings still in his care. 

My parents got into it earlier today and my mom asked me to mame sure my dad is okay, as he had taken off on foot and his car was no where in sight.  

I ended up driving around for a bit to find him and then I found his car parked at a gas station.  I sat with his car waiting for him to show for about an hour.  

When he did show, I flagged him down for him to not not recognise me.  I'm assuming that he didn't know where he was.  He couldn't speak besides words that he parroted back to whoever was speaking to him, if he said anything at all.

I asked him where his shoes and wallet  were and all he would respond with ""shoes"" or ""wallet.""

I managed to get him into the car.  I helped him into the car and he seemed to not remember how a seatbelt worked.  

I took him to the local ER and no one is allowed back.

Any closure or advice would be appreciated.",10Jun2018,1
3,"I just graduated high school, and went on an overnight orientation. I met one of the leaders, who’ll remain anonymous, but we got to talking and I ended up getting mixed signals. She initiated much of the conversation and I noticed her looking at me at the times I wasn’t “paying attention” when she was taking me to get my school ID. At the end of the tour she said something along the lines of “can’t wait to see you in the fall” or something like that I can’t remember. 

Anyway I’m a little stuck on what to do. I found her Instagram but I think it’d be weird to add her    so soon after meeting her.

4,"I've also posted this in r/abortions.

I found out I was pregnant yesterday, I'm a month along, and told my boyfriend about it. He was quiet &amp; just said that he'd take me in to get the procedure. I didn't say much except that I needed to think about my options first. I think he thought I meant procedure options, not whether or not to keep the baby. 

I'm struggling so much with this decision. I love my boyfriend more than I have ever loved anyone. We plan to get married, and have kids down the road. I understand his logic, we don't want to financially mess up our lives &amp; it would make everything a whole lot harder. His mom got pregnant with him unexpectedy at 18, so he knows it makes life hard, first hand. BUT his parents say all the time, that keeping him was the best decision they ever made. 

I feel like we have such a strong relationship, and maybe this is TMI, but the reality of it is that we made love &amp; created baby. It goes against every moral fiber in my body to abort. I understand that it's a choice other women make &amp; that it was best for their life. I totally agree with the option to abort, but I don't think it's for me. 

I just know that he's going to be so mad if I tell him this is my choice. I want to honor his wishes, I really do, but I don't know if I can. Any thoughts? ",10Jun2018,1

The fiancee and I are considering a joint home with her sister and brother-in-law.  We would be raising our families in the same house and helping each other out. We have all discussed ethics and morality, especially regarding kids, but I am still concerned. What do you guys think the potential risks are?

Me: 18 years old, just graduated from high school, not many friends, usually play video games, watch tv shows at home, sometimes take a walk/run by myself.

My neighbor (not directly next to my house, but close): older than me (probably 25), works something public relations, plays football(soccer), he usually watches movies in the cinema (I think). I really don’t know much about him.

He is kinda new in the area (less than 1 year), I don’t exactly remember how we started talking, but we got friendly. Me, trying not to be rude, always listen to him, he usually talks for a couple of minutes and I just nod and etc. 

Whenever he sees me he hollers at me, I usually respond, sometimes it’s just “how are you, what are you doing”, other times “hey we should go out some time, just let me know when you’re free” (I usually don’t tell him, although I’m free most of the time), he usually suggests going to the movies, having dinner at a restaurant, or me watching him play football.

He has become friendly with my family, he asks them about me whenever he sees them.

He’s a really nice guy overall, but I don’t see anything we have in common.

Here are some “stories” so can understand the situation even more: 

•	He once drove me to a place ~30 minutes away when I told him I was going to take a cab. (I feel like I need to repay him in some way)
•	He usually texts me asking how I am and where I am (yes, I gave him my phone number) I usually reply late.
•	He invited me a week ago to a “feast” (not by him) over the phone, and I, for some reason, accepted. later that day I got extremely sick so I texted him apologizing and saying I couldn’t go with him. I think he saw me today, because he called me (I didn’t answer the phone), I assumed he wanted to invite me to another one.

I know I’m gonna run out excuses someday, and I do not feel like going out with him.

What should I do?


TL;DR: I think my neighbor, who I have nothing in common with, want to be my friend, but I don’t.

10,"Hey, so as stated in the title my brothers 21 and has been studying and now working as a paramedic for about 3 years now, he's always been caring, empathetic and generally wanted to help people so this seemed like a great fit for him but over the past few months I've noticed a few things. He's become more and more tired, he looks like he's aged about 5 years. He's told me a few stories about some of the shifts he's had to do and it sounds like something straight out of a horror film, the shift patterns and times are ridiculous where he'll work 14 to 16 hour shifts due to long calls and a lack of paramedics in the area.

12,"In the past few days I have tried everything. For reference the item in question is (was?) a dabber. 

So to start:

At the time the item was dropped, all doors, windows, and vents leading in and out were closed. There is 0 chance it has left the room. It is NOT anywhere on the floor. My floor is quite clean and I have scoured every inch of it multiple times now. It is not between any cusions, it's not on top of anything, and it is not in anything. I've pulled apart my furniture, removed every single item from my room that wasn't too heavy, I even attached a pretty heavy duty magnet to a stick and just ran it over every corner of the room and over every object it could have landed on/in. Nothing. 

Any ideas? I'm tapped. I've spent 2-3 hours a day for a few days now literally just scouring my room because I don't want to spend money to get a new one. At this point though I'm pretty sure I'm going to need too, I'm starting to think I'm out of possible logical explanations. I'm ooking for somewhat onorthodox advice I suppose. If it comes to mind immediately, chances are I've tried it. I'm looking for ideas/methods of finding something that will find things that have been lost in incredibly unlikely/illogical ways.

14,So this is going to be pretty short.

16,"So before anything, I think it could be important to mention that I consider myself to be both girly and tomboyish. Many of the times I tried to research why I could be like this only brought me answers such as viewing oneself more as a guy, where that isn’t the case here. I love being a girl, I love female empowerment, but somewhere there is something wrong. 

Unfortunately, I see other women as competition. It’s also important to know that I’m a very competitive person in general. I’m pretty sure it developed through having a sibling, as well as school—there was a point based system throughout them that drove me to want to be on top. Growing up, my brother and I both spent a lot of time together playing girly games as well as boyish, each equally leveled out. Whilst I enjoy being girly, I don’t enjoy the company of other girly girls. I love being a tomboy, but at the same time I don’t completely enjoy the idea of a tomboyish girl joining my guy friend group. I guess it can’t be ruled out, but I am not sure that jealousy is the issue either, but rather trying to be one of the most important person in someone’s life, to an extent (not really through means of anything beyond friendship). I’m very okay with gay couples, but more so than straight couples that are personal to my life. I’m not sure why that is either. I’m also completely fine with older women and whatnot. I really think this is about the competitive side of me. 

Basically, I hate this, I hate these feelings that affect my relationships with other women, and I wish I wasn’t feeling like this at all. ",10Jun2018,9
18,"So for a while, I've had a crush on this girl in high school. At first when we met, I wasn't really interested in her, but as time passed, my affection for her bloomed. I started to build up the courage to confess, but things went south; yet I tried to stay persistent and chat with her. I soon find out that one of my buddies started dating her, which completely bummed me out. 

With both my crush and my buddy being in the same circle as my other friends, I would always see them together, making me just drown in my own sorrow. Now time has passed and they no longer date each other and I have developed a more fruitful mindset. In spite of me being disheartened in the past, my crush and I remanded friends, but not as close. The times I would be lost in dreams of us being together began to fade until I found out she shared feelings for me. At first, this made it easier for me to talk to her as I still felt a bit uncomfortable because I still liked her. Soon, signs of me moving on seemed to arise. 

Right when I thought I'd moved on, I fell for her once again, knowing full well she doesn't even like me anymore. Now I've started thinking what could of been almost every other day, if not everyday. I've really tried to move on but my feelings always comes back like a boomerang. To make matters even worse, I might not even see her ever again, which hurts me as a friend and as an admirer. I know I probably should be making a big deal out of this, but it is hard for me not to and I don't know what to do. 

Advice would be appreciated :)

21,"So hiya, I started a new job as a budtender in Oregon last weekend. Ive been a smoker for a while so I frequent a lot of dispensaries, but have not done it myself before now. This place is an hour away from my home, and though far I was offered full time and figured with tips I’d probably be able to cover gas without using my actual paycheck.

My problem is, my boss told me on my first day it is ILLEGAL for me to take tips. That is the word he used. On my own research and asking other budtenders, Im nearly 100% certain Im allowed to take tips, but my boss has the right to put a tip jar out or not. So far despite telling people I cant take tips Ive had 4 customers leave behind at least a few dollars. I really dont know what Im supposed to do in these cases. Im told Ill get fired if I take it, but I cant just chase these people down. Not to mention, I’d really like to be able to take it because they are complimenting me on my service to them. So first day boss says I have to put ALL the money customers give me into the drawer. Today I had a guy whos a regular come in, always really nice, likes having a new face here. Hes asked about tipping before and I told him I cant. After I gave him his change he put it in his wallet but then “let” a 5 fall on my counter, said oops with a wink and he left. I had just picked it up and the boss comes fuming out of his office and starts telling me I could get his business shut down over a dollar. 

Now normally I try to be respectful of other peoples points of view, or the way the live their lives. This guy though, the big paranoid business owner, leaves money scattered everywhere. In different filing cabinets, his hurricane of a desk, in jars with the weed Im supposed to be selling! This guy breaks so many rules it hurts my head. I already decided Im quitting today but I wanted to ask: is this guy a bad boss or am I a naive employee?",10Jun2018,2
23,"The other night I got asked to be a bridesmaid. I said yes but deep down I really don’t want to be a bridesmaid. 

My husband and I met the couple getting married less than a year ago through my husband’s sport. Let’s call them Neil and Susie. They got engaged shortly after we met them.

From the beginning, Neil and Susie seemed friendly and very keen to make friends with us. So far about 90% of our hang-outs have been initiated by them. They frequently invite us over or out to dinner. If we can’t make it one week, they are very accommodating and follow us up the next week to see if we are free. 

After hanging out a few times, my husband was being tagged by Neil in memes about bromance. Husband said to me, ’I think Neil sees us as closer than we really are.’ I responded, ‘I wonder if they don’t have many friends.’

At one dinner, I mentioned to Susie that I liked her curtains and that I needed get some for my own house. A few days later Susie messaged me saying, ‘I’ve been thinking - I can get my mother to make some curtains for you! She loves sewing and it wouldn’t be any trouble at all. Can I ask her for you?’ I politely declined. My comment about her curtains were intended purely as small talk.

A couple of months ago, Susie and I hung out for the first time without our SOs. Susie mentioned that Neil was considering asking my husband to be a groomsman. She also mentioned that she was struggling to choose bridesmaids because she didn’t have any close friends. This was the first time I thought she might be considering me as a bridesmaid. A few weeks later, my husband came back from sport and mentioned that Neil had said Susie was struggling to choose bridesmaids. The fact they were saying this to us made us more confident that were considering us for their bridal party.

A few days ago, we hung out for dinner. I had had a stressful week and was not in a great mood. Susie and Neil handed us a present each. My heart sunk because I knew what it was. Inside the presents were things like golf balls (for my husband) and candles and bath bombs with notes saying, ‘Will you be my bridesmaid?’ (and groomsman for husband). I acted enthusiastic, gave Susie a hug and said yes. Husband did the same for Neil. Neil also asked husband to do the best man speech because the other groomsmen are shy.

Husband said to Neil, ‘If there are strippers at your bucks I won’t be coming.’ Strippers and sex shows are something that my husband I have agreed to not watch or participate in/with. It seems to help us have a good marriage. We don’t judge other people who see strippers but it’s just not for us. Neil said, ‘There won’t be any strippers at my bucks day.’ Susie said, ‘I won’t have strippers but I wouldn’t mind topless waiters wearing nothing but an apron.’ I didn’t know what to say to that. In previous conversations I had mentioned to Susie why my husband and I don’t see strippers. While topless waiters are not as bad, it’s still something that I would choose not to participate in. And I don’t want to come across as ruining anyone’s fun by saying I don’t want to participate in that. I don’t know the other bridesmaids but I see it an awkward conversation coming up. What I plan on doing is saying, I just won’t attend that part of the hens night or weekend.

While I see it as a great privilege being a bridesmaid, I just don’t want to be one right now in this stage in my life. I’m a full-time student and I work 2 days a week so my finances are limited. I’m actually in another wedding next month that I can’t wait to be over and done with. It’s been the most expensive wedding I’ve been part of. The bride has been a bridezilla at times and other bridesmaids have been frustrating to deal with. I wasn’t expecting to be asked to be a bridesmaid at this wedding. The financial pressure and the stress that I’ve been pulled into with this wedding - and the previous two I was involved in - is just not something I want to go through again for a while. 

I also can’t help but feel Neil and Susie pursued us with the end goal of getting us to be in their wedding. It’s not necessarily a bad thing but in some way it makes me feel a bit used and they weren’t very subtle about it.

I didn’t feel like I could say no either.

26,"I've had chronic sciatica for about the past 7 years, but it was only a year ago when I got my current job \+ insurance, that I sought to finally do something about it. Back then, the pain was tolerable, and I didn't realize how serious of a problem it was until I finally got it checked out. Then two months ago, after an intense swimming session of all things, the pain suddenly accentuated itself and none of the therapies that I've tried afterwards have helped. Simple daily activities such as getting out of bed and sitting for prolonged periods of time would cause immense amounts of pain, and I've had to alter my daily lifestyle to manage it. 

During those two months, I've had to cut a lot of my activities that I did and/or enjoyed, such as exercising and drawing, out of my schedule. The pain has subsided substantially since then, and worse off prior to the swimming incident, I do have a lot more control over my body. However,  I'm finding that I'm suddenly lacking a lot of the motivation to do seemingly ANYTHING; exercise, hobbies, even interacting with the people around me. It doesn't help either that I've always just been a sedentary and lazy individual that struggled to form habits. But now I can't even get together the energy to start even if a get a flash of motivation. Finally, I've found that I've also started using injury as a convenient excuse as to why I can't do what I want both towards others and myself, even if I do have ways to work around it. For instance, standing alleviates a lot of the pain that I get while sitting, and so in theory, I could get back into drawing by using a standing desk or an easel. But something in my mind tells me my results won't be as good as if I were sitting, and because sitting causes me pain/ how long I spend drawing once I start, I give up and end up wasting away time on Youtube instead. On weekends, I've wanted to get back into swimming as I would like to be more active, but I know that the process of leaving my bed would be painful and so I lie there until noon, when guilt finally gets me going.

I hate what I've become and am desperate to not only get my lifestyle back into shape, but to improve my mental state. Obviously I know that the first thing that I absolutely have to do is to get my body fixed; I just had a CT scan done the other day and while awaiting next steps, have been considering necessary actions in case I have to resort to surgery.

32,"I am frustrated that they weren't upfront about any of this. It is an entry level position she was going to take and experience is not required, it is assembly work at a hardware factory (alarms / switches / speakers etc). My boss said experience is unnecessary and that they would train her on the job, letting her work indefinitely, or until she found another job. She only has experience working in a nursing home and bartending. But the town in Georgia we are moving to, the local government is doing a training program they are paying for, sort of like a ""job placement"" type of deal, and the program requires two interviews, and then 30 hours of training over a 2 week period, all unpaid. She won't see a paycheck until almost two months after we have moved.

I don't know how to approach this with my boss. Work has been difficult already since it is so busy and I am nervous about giving him something else to worry about. I also already signed a lease in Georgia, we are from NY state. 

I work in accounts payables, handling invoices and things of that nature. I have money saved and I can look for a job but the uncertainty scares me. I also don't even know if my boss has considered how badly this is going to screw me over, having my wife out of work for such a long length of time. We spoke about it for only 5 minutes, he said she just had to do some night training starting the 25th, ""a couple of classes about an hour long"" and he gave me no reason to believe it is unpaid. We found out from the email she received after filling out the forms, a woman from the program asked her if she is moving to Georgia, explaining that she has to reply to set up an interview that will take place on Thursday (we won't arrive to Georgia until Saturday). 

I plan to talk with my boss on Monday before my wife replies to the email. I don't know what to tell him but I absolutely need to make sure he knows that I did not expect for her to have to have no job for almost 2 months and work 30 hours unpaid when I agreed to relocating. Technically he could tell me to f*ck off (US employers are ""at will"") and then I'd be screwed. I know he has liked me the 4 years I've worked for him but the past 4 or 5 months have been bad for everyone, the move coupled with breaking sales records every month has been stressing everybody out.

We live in a small poor country and there are very little options when it comes to job and he has to pay college and we are basically screwed since my family is poor and there is a lot of drama going around in my household,and his has money but they are complicated people and we need to move out.I feel like a turd because i own very little and i cant give him much and i would have to live even a shittier lifestyle with more risk since jobs here are really unstable. My father is an old fashioned person and we cant stay together at my place and he wants me to fake normal conversations with his jealous wife that keeps finding issues with everything and act like a happy little family,he can be possessive , a narcissist sometimes (close enough to god complex sometimes) and he takes my things without asking and making up "" issues i have"" when i try to clean and help around the house and i'm desperate to find a job. His family on the other hand is a cookie cutter family but his mother doesn't like the fact he is dating me because apparently it should be normal to change your partner every 6 months and his father is often grumpy and cold. I don't hate my father even though he is an asshole a lot of times (he thinks i don't care about him sadly) but i just want to move out and let us both have some peace since we argue often. Now we want to both get jobs and start working long term but if we move out it might backfire (both of our parents don't exactly like the idea) and to be honest i'm terrified because i basically have no real skills or talent and if i lose a job we are basically fucked and we cant go back, waiting for a while is also not an option.

38,"Basically, I bought a discounted theme park ticket for $X (original price $Y) last night from a travel agency. When I bought the ticket, they said that they'd confirm the ticket for me within ""24 hours"". This was important because I specifically purchased the ticket for Monday so I could go with a group of friends (there was a drop down menu and I selected Monday as the ""travel date"").

However, after paying for the ticket, I received an email saying that they'd confirm the ticket within ""two business days"", something they hadn't mentioned before. This is obviously a problem because I'm planning to go on Monday, selected Monday as the travel date, and two business days from now would be Tuesday.

I'm a law student so I know that there's no way their 2 business day clause was incorporated into the purchase contract. It's unlikely that they'll refund me because they have a ""no refunds or exchanges"" policy. If they don't provide me with a ticket by Monday, I'll have to pay for another one at the park entrance ($Y).

One option I've got is to file a claim against them at the small claims court and get compensation for their breach of warranty ie that they'd confirm and email me my ticket within 24 hours of purchase ($Y, or putting me in the position I would have been in had the contract been carried out). 

Another option I've got is to just let it go, since $X isn't a lot.

40,"Hey Reddit,

I'm a 25 year old male &amp; for YEARS I've struggled with my ability to focus &amp; maintain any mental clarity. It causes me anxiety,self esteem issues, &amp; makes me feel like a sloth.

Examples include
1. I don't have much of an attention span for anything.
2. I struggle reading because my mind is all over the place while i should be processing the words off the page.
3. I struggle at work. If a task takes more than about 10 minutes to do, I procrastinate &amp; do a ton of other unrelated things in my attempt to accomplish the main task at hand. 
4. I dread &amp; get anxious over any task i know will take more than 10 minutes.

Am I lazy or just lack self discipline? Is there a difference? 

I've sought out help several times. Twice professionally, but nothing has come of it and both encounters were one time visits. 

I think I'm subconsciously looking for validation from people to say ""you have adult adhd. Go get Adderall to fix all of your problems"". But I also know habbit fixes will be more powerful &amp; that I don't necessarily want to be on a pill forever. Should I find a doctor that can let me start adderall at least initially for help with gaining the mental clarity necessary to implement habbit changes?

48,"For the record, it's not a religious thing. I just find the whole concept of being in a committed, financially-able relationship and not having kids to be irresponsible and hedonistic in an abstract but impacting way.

But at the same time, the concept of raising offspring is nightmarish to me. Nothing in my life would ever be the same again for at least the next eighteen years, perhaps even longer. Karma would find me for the many years that I gave my parents a difficult time. My child would likely either be too different from me (making a parent-child relationship all the more difficult) or similar to me but better at it (bringing out my envy). Also, I have Asperger's syndrome, meaning that there's a fairly high chance that any child I have would be on the autistic spectrum, possibly the low-functioning end.

55,"I have been in a relationship with a woman for 7 years. At the beginning of the relationship she told me that she was married, but they were living seperate lives. I asked her what kind of time frame was she looking at at finalizing her divorce and she answered one year. Fast forward seven years and we were still together until 3 weeks ago. I broke up with her and told her that I can't keep waiting for her to move on from her ex, whom she claims to have no feelings for.

In the time following our break up, I met another woman who am I developed a very close yet strictly platonic friendship. As male and female relationships between attractive people typically do we became a little bit intimate but nothing sexual. Following a couple dates with this new girl I choose to give my old girlfriend a second chance after she promised to finalize her divorce as well as seek some therapy for a work related issue she experienced that involved her patient's death (she's a pediatric nurse)

The crux of the problem is that the new woman that I met and I have a very close (much closer than my current GF) connection to each other and we feel that we are better fitted and closer connected to each other than my current relationship.

 Would I be wrong to break up and go start a real relationship with this new girl? Should I stick it out with my old girlfriend and hope that she actually follows through with her promise to divorce her husband since she hasn't shown me the divorce papers yet? Also, on a scale of 1 to 10, how stupid was I for waiting 7 years for her to get divorced?

56,"I want to establish a branch of cyber command, like USCERT to have the legal right to deploy a team to surviell and stop cyber harassment and bullying that does not require a warrant but relies upon clear consent of the victim.

Like a warrantless, 13/13 rule sorta like a FISA warrant but it is meant specifically to catch the bully or hacker, clear a suspected bully who may have had messages spoofed, it would build a strong cyber case for the child in their defense. 

Calling bullied children crazy isn't going to help, stepping into gather intelligence and thwart the violence before it happens could screen record and document and trace the actual incidents that lead up to mass shootings. I am sick of these hackers not going to jail for the things they do 

It can protect our kids so nobody has to die because the child thinks violence is his only defense and he brings a gun to school. 

We can do something, if we refuse to do nothing the blood is on our hands. This is where it starts and we aren't doing enough.

A team like this could provide tons of insight into how these bullying cases turn from slinging insults on facebook to mass casualties.  

We can trace and lock up any outside parties or abusers in the incident who may be instigating or inciting violence using the profiles of the childs friends to do so. We can use the same program to catch child sex traffickers who use this tactic to lure a child into an unfamiliar area and take them. 

You don't realize how easy it is for some disgusting pervert to lure some child into a trap by posing as a friend of theirs on social media by spoofing messages. Or how easy it is to isolate a child online. If cyber command could see what the children see on their screens and go after the people bothering them? We could save these kids.

This wouldn't be just for minors but adults too. This type of thing does happen to adults. We need a program like this and there is nothing like this out there. 

Example: Timmy is being bullied by his friends at school and needs help and authorizes cyber command to help him stop the individuals.

After a few weeks of remotely surveilling Timmy's social circle of bullies at 5:15pm one Tuesday Timmy recieves a message from Tommy telling him to ""Go drink bleach and die"". 

Tommy, being that his devices are already under surveillance because Timmy hit SOS...it shows cyber command in real time that Tommy is at the doctors office during this exchange and thus it is impossible that Tommy was the child who was him bullying him through messages on Facebook. All evidence proves that Tommy is not the child bullying Timmy and perhaps further reveals he also is being sent messages by Tommy or another
friend that did not originate from Tommy. Now there can genuinely be real time evidence the cyber team can build to trace and ID the malicious 3rd party. That 3rd party is a 18 year old from 4 States away. Or maybe that 3rd party is a sex offender who had stalkerware in the child's phone so he could access his cameras and microphone while he was in the tub? 

This stuff is real. We either wake up or shut up when bad things happen to these kids and we could have stopped it but didn't. Instead we isolate victims and call them crazy when it's actually our own community that is clueless and lazy. 

The warrantless tap can not be to gather criminal evidence unrelated to the bullying, the 13/13 warantless tap only allows cyber command to corroborate the victims statements and could potentally clear an innocent child from being accused of bullying and gives the teams an ability to pursue any malicious 3rd party using Timmy and his friends profiles to cause unrest and fear between a group of minors who need a team watching over them to fight this bullying before the child gets the wild idea to walk into the school with an assault rifle. 

It's better to approach this offensively and do everything we can to defend these children rather than wait. By the time any child has one fleeting though to resorts to bringing a gun to school to kill their classmates in retaliation for cyber bullying we have already failed that child and every victim.

Would it not be helpful to know whether a malicious 3rd party has been using a friends profile to bully and isolate Timmy and get Timmy to harm himself or others? 

Would it horrify people to know it might not be Tommy sending the messages? 

Would it scare anyone to know that sometimes this type of escalation to violence happens over 2 or 3 years of cyberbullying when the child feels like no one will show up to defend them?  That now 20+ might die and authorities did NOTHING to save any of the children before the violence escalated?
 

They could have a button like a cyber 911/SOS button that allows a team of highly skilled cyber defense professional to install appropriate surveillance tools and stay there and monitor the child and their social network to collect evidence to thwart have online harassment and bullying and actually do something productive for society like lock some of these cyberbullies up before it escalates to mass violence.

58,"**A little background:**

I am a uni student in a city where it's not relatively difficult to get a job, but I find myself in a dilemma. 

Last night my younger sister had a baby.  I'm an aunt for the first time, and it's scary but I feel like this is a new chapter in my life. I now have a little kid to be around and set an example for. A couple of weeks ago I also had a conversation with my long term boyfriend about how we haven't spent much time together since I moved in with him 3 months ago, and although it's not a huge problem yet, it has begun to put a little bit of a strain on the relationship. We want to nip it in the bud before it does be come a problem because the relationship is otherwise awesome.

**My problem:**

I am currently working a 20\+ hour week on top of my studies. I am studying hard to get a scholarship to Germany, and working hard to save up the money for what won't be covered by the scholarship, and for a trip to Japan with my boyfriend in December. We are both well on\-track with savings and are ready to put down the money on flights, train tickets and accommodation. I am maybe 1/8 of the way to the connecting flights to Germany and other expenses there, and think I will be able to easily make the rest of the money and about 20&amp;#37; more with the current hours I am working. 

My job, however, is a minimum wage job and my taxes are back breaking as I have a student loan. It's also an awful job. I work alone, in a fast food container making food for mostly rude, ungrateful, idiotic and drunk customers. I try to have a positive outlook each day I go to work, but so often some asshole decides that I am not human, I'm just a food maker who will make their food right this second or else. I work eight hours on Saturday and Sunday, and six on Monday. I come home and crash. On the days I'm not working I'm at uni and study in the evenings when there's stuff to do. Then I crash. My social life isn't non\-existent yet, but if I upset the routine just a little bit and get behind on university, I'll have to turn down invitations more often than I already do. 

My boyfriend and I set a weekly date night, so that for at least 4 hours a week we totally switch off, and engage with each other. Of course, we have dinners together most nights of the week as well, and we wake up next to each other before he has to go to work on week days, but it would be great if I could devote a little more time to my relationship and less to a soul\-sucking job that pays the bills but does little else for me.

Now that my nephew is here, I absolutely know that I'll want to make the drive up to my parents house (30mins) at least once a week to spend time with him.

There are definitely perks to the job that I'm sticking around for. We get incredibly quiet at certain times of the day, and certain days of the week, so my boss lets me sit there and study or read. Reading is another important part of my life as it helps me unwind, and if I don't have studies to do I use this time to read a little. It's hard to find another job that will also give me the freedom to relax and study on the job. I also really like my bosses. They are both understanding, and let me take the day off yesterday 

Next year I will be studying only 1 paper a semester so I'll be able to work more while not sacrificing other parts of my life.

**My options:**

Here are the options I can think of currently.

a) I cut down my weekend hours to 1 day. I will be working less, making less, but spending more time with people I care about. 

b) I cut down weekends and pick up more half\-day shifts, making the same amount of money, but allowing me to still spend my weekends with family.

 c) I drop the job entirely, give up on the trip to Germany, but spend time with family. 

d) I find another job that pays better/I hate less, but that doesn't have the same perks. Hopefully better pay = less hours, and I can spend time with family. 

e) Suck it up and see my family less while I work the same hours until December when I can give up the job and travel and come back to uni next year and get a new job.

f) Write a long post on reddit and hope someone else will be able to tell me what to do.

**tldr:** job is soul\-sucking, relationship with boyfriend is ok but could be better, want to spend time with family and new nephew, not sure whether I should quit the job, find a new one, stay with it of cut down my hours.",10Jun2018,1
59,"I'm [18f] and he's  [19f] On memorial day weekend, I met a guy my age outside of my wprk. I work at a grocery store and he was outside taking donations for a trip to Africa that him a team are going on. I spent most pf.the day out getting carts and we'd talk when I.was out. On my lunch break, I went out and talked to him. We joked around, he told me about what people say to him when he asks for donations, he asked me about the town a little bit, and we kinda complained to eachother about what we we're doing. He was different to me then customers he was asking for donations from. He was chilled out and laughing. It was all good. 

He's been here four months from California (I live in Michigan) and he came here to join a center that focuses on volunteering and hands on activity. Once he left, I was oddly sad. It sucks when you're kinda crushing on someone you don't know when you'll see again. Haha.

He's been outside almost every weekend since. Once when I got dropped off he remembered me and said ""heyyy"" but we haven't talked as much as we did the first time. I followed him on Instagram and it was probably obvious I looked him up because I only knew his first name and he knows no one around here really so it was kinda hard. Lol. He didn't follow back for a day but when I saw him again he left soon after I got there but right after he did I got a follow back (almost a day later) he hasn't been as talkative since but he's still been nice and smiles so hopefully he doesn't think I'm weird for searching him up. 

I've thought about him a lot lately. They were just small parking lot interactions but he sends off good vibes, and clearly likes helping people. Icam see myself  getting to know him. 


So next time I see him, what should I do? I might tomorrow depending on if he's out or not. He leaves in about twoish months for his volunteer trip &amp; he told me that he might move back home afterwards. I don't see the trip as a deal breaker if feelings of interest happened to be mutual (unlikely lol) I do think it's really cool what he's doing over there though.

This will allow me to run commercial kitchens in healthcare facilities. I just started the course, it should be finished a year from now. I live near Philadelphia, PA. I am 19 and living with my parents trying to save up as much as I can.

However, my backup plan is that if I can't find a job that will be able to make me financially independent, I want to move to Colorado where my brother lives, he has a house there and says that a room is always open for me if I ever wanna move there. I figure that I could help him with the mortgage payments should I move there until I find a suitable job. It is such a beautiful state and I would love to live there one day. I want to consolidate all my possessions to be able to fit into my car, so I could drive to CO to move there, and simplify my travel. This means I would sell a lot of my stuff to get some extra money before moving, which I don't mind. I haven't been using a lot of my things recently and it would be best if I just simplify my life.

I have family at various points between PA and CO, so I could make arrangements to stay a night at each place to visit, and take a break from the road instead of getting motels.

64," I am posting to see if there are other people who have my same behavior and to seek advice on how to overcome it.

So as the title say I am literally paranoid of everything in this life but in particularly diseases and catching things that can affect my health or living situation.

I am paranoid in a way that i would even skip handshaking with someone if ill believe i can catch something from him/her or even to stand in front of him/her and breath the air they release.

Earlier in my life I even was afraid to be in a relationship cuz i was already predicting the future and what will happen between us since it can make me catch some diseases like hepatitis, herpes or any other kind of disease or STD. (This got changed by now since I got married)

The problem that I am thirsty for information related to everything of the human body and the diseases we can catch so I continuously read and learn about a lot of diseases and HOW they can make their way into our body and that's what keep making my stat worse, the more i know the more I am paranoid of people.

I avoid drinking from the same cup after anyone even my family neither eat from the same plate or even to taste something after them (I know they are clean and i trust them but they can get things from peoples around them and like that its gonna be like if i trust peoples around them and the peoples around the peoples around them which will not be possible)

I know all what I am doing is wrong as it's making my life hard as hell but if I don't do so i don't feel calm and I can even spend a month thinking if I caught something for just drinking water after someone.

My main fear is about to things related to skin diseases, diseases that will deprive me of dopamine giving by my mind (as sex or drinking) and things that leads to certain death within a limited time.

My worse fear are : 1\- HIV (as it will lead to certain death knowing that i can't afford living on treatment as it is very expensive) 2\- All kind of hepatitis (as it will deprive me of drinking from time to time which is something i really enjoy) 3\- Virtiligo and warts (I have a huge fear of those two)

Bonus: I am dying of paranoia of cancer ( its very common in my family, a lot of member in it died and keep dying cause of it) and I am almost sure if I won't catch HIV or died in an accident i will die from Cancer.

Feel free to tell me if you have one or all those fears as me, Ill be so thankful for and advice on how to live safely without this paranoia cuz it is tiring me so much and finally I apologize cuz of my bad English.",10Jun2018,1

66,"Extremely anxious about an event today:

One thing about me is that I unfortunately am a very anxious person, as well as a goody two shoes who panics whenever I do the slightest thing wrong. Today I was trying to parallel park in a spot I could not get into and was very close to the car in front of me. I dont think that I hit the car, but I also couldnt completely confirm that my car was touching the other one. I felt no slight bump, heard no noise, and, as far as I could see, was still a few inches away. After pulling away I noticed blue paint on their white car, not exactly near where I was but close. My car is also white and I dont think the paint could have been from my car (seeing as it isn't blue) and there was no scratch or paint mark on my car, but I panicked. Already late for work I did something that I thought I would never do and took off. I had planned to check on the car in an hour and possibly leave a note asking if the small mark was new or not, but the car was gone by then.

Realistically I don't think that I hit the car, and even if i did i dont think it would have left blue paint on the car, however I keep freaking out. I know that the parking lot has no security cameras, but I still feel extremely bad. What should i do and how should I calm my anxiety? ",10Jun2018,1
67,"I have a friend that Ive known for over a decade.  He has always been a rather rowdy nihilistic kind of person, and I understand that it is a part of his nature and not something that should necessarily be changed.  Occasionally he will make comments about how life is pointless, he doesn't see the reason for him or anyone else having any value to their life, it doesn't matter if your alive or dead, etc.  He has also said once that suicide is selfish, which I understood as meaning he doesn't think its wrong or something he would not do if not for it being a selfish act as far as he is concerned.  He is a SERIOUS alcoholic and uses cocaine, to the extent that he gets shakes if he doesnt drink when he wakes up in the morning, however he also always seems mostly composed and together when he is drunk.  Hes been fired from his job (for drinking on the job) but got it back, he lives with his parents in his mid twenties.  He recently came out as bisexual which everyone has been supportive of, but he claims he never felt that way until now and that he was not in the closet.  I have heard of people suddenly being attracted to a new gender out of the blue, but I think this is more of a sign of some deeply rooted repression.  The issue with discussing it with him is that he is basically impossible to talk to about interpersonal problems like that.  He's a heavy metal, i dont give a shit about anything, who cares kind of person.  I am just concerned with some of the comments hes made in the past and how wild and crazy his life is going, and wondering if anyone has any advice of how I could possibly help him.

I was involved with an online volunteer organization on a board of directors of sorts for more than a year, and my service to that organization was excellent up until the point where much older people than I began to disagree with my ideas. So much so that they decided to have a vote to remove me from my position with them. Normally, this wouldn't be so bad as this would be a typical ""you just gotta move on and find other opportunities to shine"" kind of deal, however I did make the mistake of pouring my heart and soul into that organization and I felt that I had truly made it my own. So my question on this one is how should someone cope with this kind of loss? Putting a more academic spin on it, how do you psychologically recover from rejection by others when you're a Philosopher King and perfect for the role that you were ousted from?

A followup question as well. Why is Schadenfreude such a powerful force? Why do we seek more often to bring people down rather than build people up?

Thanks everyone!",10Jun2018,0

70,"Hey reddit V-Sau.... your average teenager girl here.

So I have been playing around with the idea (oof that sounds dirty lol, nvm I’m just dirty minded) of moving to the USA, specifically LAX because I want to create content. I won’t be the next Casey Neistat or Liza Koshy, but I’d love to just take in the “LA/US” life.

Although (again your av. Teenage girl speaking) I know my shot isn’t too big in making it there what so ever but still I love doing crazy sheize. And making slight impulsive decisions is part of my personality. Although this choice isn’t a “impulsive decision” nor is it a thought through decision. 

I would just love (in general) moving to the USA. 

Peace out.

71,"So I’m a long time commenter and lurker on this sub but I had to use my throwaway because my main account UN is the same UN I use for all social media so if the person this is about were to stumble upon this they would know for sure its about them. The chances of that happening are slim but, I’d rather be safe than sorry.

I met my best friend my first year of college about 10 years ago; we were in a level 100 course together. Toward the end of the course we ended up exchanging emails for a project, one thing led to another and we’ve been friends ever since. Our relationship manner has always been kind of peculiar. I came from a sheltered conservative christian home, I’ve always been rather shy, reserved, socially anxious, and inexperienced sexually. She on the other hand has been dating since she was about 15, is very outgoing curvaceous and pretty well endowed., she's also just naturally very flirty.

When we first met I was very awkward, quiet and closed off, I was afraid to do anything by myself; even doing something as simple as ordering from a fast food restaurant or talking on the phone terrified me. But I was anxious to make friends so when BF asked me to start hanging out I jumped at the chance. BF took me under her wing and encouraged me to be more outgoing, and to just start putting myself out there more as a person.  She was there for me when I confessed to a mutual friend about my feelings and got rejected, she was there for me when I started dating my first boyfriend, actually taught me sex ed when my parents refused to (because of their belief in abstinence before marriage) and talked me through what it would be like to finally do the deed. We went shopping, out to bars, clubs and parties. Over time I started to become more independent, began branching out and being more assertive and just more ok with being myself out in public without being anxious. I started to dress a lot better, I got a haircut that was more flattering for me, and overall I just became more confident in myself. I had always considered myself ugly up until this point but when I changed I noticed that a lot men started to take more interest in me and of course my BF was there to help me respond when I didn’t know what to say.

I’m in a much better place now then back then. I can do most things by myself, but there are still certain days when I might have anxiety/depression about something. Most days though I try to push through it and keep going. But I’ve noticed that even as I’ve grown as a person our dynamic has changed very little. BF still treats me like I can’t do anything for myself, bosses me around, and just in general treats me like I’m some sort of pet.  I’m a person of a lot of patience but lately our interactions have been rubbing me the wrong way. These are the few instances that really stand out in my mind.

Admittingly I’m a lightweight, it doesn’t take much for me to get drunk, and when I get drunk I become the person that I truly am (once you get past my defensive shy barrier), but I try to maintain my composure and practice self control. There have only been 2 times for sure when I got REALLY REALLY drunk and needed to be taken care of, 2 times out this whole 10 year period that we’ve been friends. I on the other hand have taken care of her dozens of times, held her hair while she vomited in my kitchen sink (and other places) when I was still living with my parents….(which my strict mother unfortunately witnessed.) I’ve been the designated the driver and the responsible party countless times and not once have I complained. But every time we go out drinking she tries her darnedest to speak for me in regards to how much I can drink, she’ll tell me when I’ve had enough or try to tell the bartender not to serve me any more. This pisses me off to no end so I’ve started saying things like “no you’re not going to tell me how much to drink” or just giving her a look like “what the heck”

Like I said I’ve gotten a lot stronger as a person, and have become more outspoken. Our group of friends say they love me because as one of my friends put it “you don’t care if people think you’re weird you are true to yourself I love that about you.”  That has translated to be being more comfortable in group settings and being ok with speaking my mind (within reason I still consider people’s feelings). This is one of the things that’s become a bone of contention between us. A few months back we were out and about at a popular bar, we’ve been going to this bar since college as the city we live becomes more gentrified its become the hip new place to be. So on this particular night it was very crowded but we managed to secure our own space by the bar. Cue a group of obnoxious women, about 4 of them, they shuffle in and start ordering drinks and then sit themselves by us, but because of the way they are situated they have to consistently move out of the way of people trying to make their way to the bar. Unfortunately they began pushing into us absolutely invading our personal space, stepping on my shoes, and spilling their drinks on us, and one of the girls elbows was digging in my back. I ended up overhearing one of them say “keep pushing them they’ll move eventually.” So I got super pissed, most of the time I’m passive and will let minor infractions go...but if you really piss me off its not pretty. So I started speaking up about it and standing my ground because we were there first and overall that’s a bitchy thing to do. So BF gets upset with me, because I’m ruining her fun and we leave to go to another bar. There she rants about how I was acting belligerent and how we could still be at the other bar if I was just cool. After a while and I finally snapped at her and said “They were purposely pushing into us so they could get us to leave!”  after which she proceeds to also blame me for not telling her about it because she would have spoken up herself and I tell her “That’s why I didn’t say anything to you because I didn’t want you to get us banned from there.” I said this because a few weeks before this incident we’d gone to a party and there was a drunk guy that bumped into me a few times, he apologized to me and I was cool with it. But she swooped in there like a mother eagle trying to protect its eggs from a flock of seagulls. She started going off on the guy about it and tried to physically fight him, while one of our male friends held her back. WE.GOT.BANNED. Ugh just remembering this is making me mad...

There was another instance in which she got mad at my partner (who is also a bit quiet and mousy) for not doing a good job protecting me in her eyes. I’ll be the first to admit we do live in a little bit of a rough area but; if you're smart and street savy you’re fine. Plus I know all the migrants living in the area pretty well.  I go out and do physical activities at all times of the day so I might take a jog at 3:00am for instance, or have a bike ride at midnight. On this particular day I had taken a bike ride out and just ended up staying out until it was dark. BF and I ran into each other by coincidence and we decided to grab a bite. We ended up staying out till late, and I decided I was going to ride my bike to where my S/O was working and just have him take me home. He wasn’t far from our location and it would have been more convenient  as I had ridden from home and that was pretty far out. BF would have none of this, she insisted that she walk with me to where S/O was at, even though it would have been faster for me to ride my bike. When we linked up with S/O she tore into him about letting me ride me bike out so late. Honestly I was kind of pissed off because, how dare she speak to him like that but I could tell S/O was about to bark back at her so I let him say his peace. Which in hindsight I should have said something to defend my partner.

She also has a bad habit of  making everything about her or  making herself the center of attention and if she’s not she will drown you out in order to be heard. Before when I was still a bit mousy and I found her talking over me, or talking for me when a question was directed at me I’d I finally just relent and just stop talking. Sometimes in group settings we'll break out into mini social groups I might branch out with someone else to have a deep conversation and she'll likewise be having a conversation with her own miniature circle. She’ll break away from that group to interject in our conversation. But now things are a bit different, when I’ve found myself in conversation and she starts to talk over me I’ll speak louder and louder  while maintaining eye contact with her (I usually have an expression like you see me talking here right???) until she either stops or I finish my point, I feel like a dick doing this but....that being said I’m tired of being drowned out all the time.

She also seems to have a bad habit of “cock blocking” me, when I get attention from men. If anyone shows even the slightest attention to me she will do everything in her power to bring attention to herself. Doing things like purposely throwing her cleavage around or telling people to rub her butt.  Most of our male friends I notice indulge her in this behavior, and I suspect that a lot of the men she calls friends are only friends with her because they perceive her as promiscuous and want to get something out of her. In the past I’ve had a fairly attractive guy come up to offer me a drink at a bar, he was asking me about my earrings when she literally butted in between us, like literally took her hands shoved them between us and spread us apart so she could start talking to the guy. Eventually the guy just walked away.

Around the same time I was talking to someone that I was interested in, he was someone I’d known since I was a teenager and had liked very much and I was finally making some headway with him. Paradoxically she was giving me great advice on how to talk with him, but at the same time when I was trying to be alone with him to talk she kept butting in and ruining the mood. There was one day in particular when I finally worked up the courage to vocalize how I felt about him. We were talking in a really loud environment and as he was asking me to repeat what I’d said to him she came and yanked me violently by the hand to find someone else. 

Then there was an incident a few weeks ago in which I saw an ex at the bar, things were awkward between us so I felt uncomfortable and wanted to leave.  I told her this, and she got pissed because we rode together and that meant that she would have to leave too. But I didn’t understand why this was a problem because at the beginning of the the night she stated explicitly that she didn’t want to stay out until the bar closed that night at 2am, and it was already past 1 in the morning. She told me I was “ruining her fun” and that I needed to “get over it.” we argued over it for a sec but I stopped because I found myself started to get really pissed and yelling. That very next week we went back to the same bar, and immediately upon arrival she ran into someone she’d been on a few dates with and felt very very awkward around. She wanted to leave for another bar, as she said that I stared at her and slowly a big shit eating grin curled up on my lips and I said “get over it”.  On the inside though I was about to explode on her but I told myself to calm down.

I find her behavior very hypocritical, she’s always demanding that I don’t act in a certain way but doing the same things she gets mad at me about. I’m honestly getting really tired of being talked over and steam rolled. I’m about to explode and when I have explosions they aren’t pretty, I leave dismembered body parts and shattered tibias in my wake. I’d really like to say something to her, our mutual friends definitely notice it, I’ve had them pull me to the side and say “hey her behavior really wasn’t cool.” or “I don’t know what her problem is”. Honestly I’ve been thinking if it's time to end the relationship, but despite the crappy parts of it, there have been good times, and she’s definitely been there for me in times of need.  I’m sick of this power dynamic though. I’ve thought about what I want to say to her...I have a tendency to be blunt so I really need some advice on this. I was going to say something along the lines of 

“Hey, Can I talk to you BF? I know that when we first met, I was very mousy and even now I can be kind of mousy but I need you to know that you don’t have to take care of me like a mother. I think if we are to take care of each other it should be more of a sisterly bond where we just look out for each other instead of trying to dictate what the other does. I appreciate you, and all the help that you’ve given me on this journey of growth and discovery. Sure there will be times when I get anxiety but during those times I find the the best remedy for me to calm my nerves as a person is to just isolate myself for a few minutes so sometimes I need to leave and I need you to not hold it against me for doing so.” 

I’ve been thinking about it and I think that’s the best way to say it without being too harsh about it, my other alternative was to list out these examples but I believe that will lead to a falling out between us. What do you guys think?",10Jun2018,3

76,"I'm the mod of a group chat about a video game.  There's one guy who has been there for a long time and seems to be well-liked by a few core members.  However, he doesn't contribute much.  He pops in to share fan art or talk about an event he had, sometimes mid conversation, and then leaves.  One important factor is if I'm the only one annoyed, I can ignore him, but if other people are annoyed, I want to step in.  It's like a little kid running up to you and showing you what he drew and then running away, but the kid is 17.

Privately, I brought up that he never, for example, asks about anyone's day.  He just assured me he asks about his irl friend's days and forgets to on here.  He was upset because he has a self image of the ""chat dad"", someone people can go to for help.  He asked me about my day a few times after and has since gone back to only talking about himself.  He's 17 but seems pretty immature.  From what he tells us of his family and friends, I don't think anyone really makes him do chores or work or criticizes his behavior.  This might be a first.

Back story: So, it’s been quite a while since I’ve seen Dirty Dancing - let’s say a year. Don’t get me wrong, I love the movie, just haven’t seen it for a while. Anyway, I on the train today, sitting in a corner seat, and my friend comes on and says, “nobody puts baby in the corner.” I laugh and get up and go on with my day. Later, I head into work and hear the same phrase at least twice throughout the night. All were with complete different sets of people. All had no previous reference to the movie(as far as I know). Only the first one was directed at me. One of them I wasn’t even in the conversation, I just happened to walk by the group as they were saying it. But it’s not just the movie, sometimes I’m constantly seeing the number 11. Or getting the same total on different receipts.

Howdy! I will be staying anonymous for this post, but I will be giving very basic info, since I think it may be easier to understand my current situation.

So I am a male on quite the younger side, and I am still going through puberty ( I know that part is random, but it will make sence later. )

But anyway let's stop wasting time and get straight to the deal.

So my problem right now is very similar to mysophobia. But replace germs with ""Alcohol"" and ""Drugs"". I believe this fear originated from when I was looking at what affects brain growth and what stuns the development of the body.

So bear with me, I know it sounds stupid but my problem is that I can't touch anything without washing my hands or feeling extreme anxiety. So reason why I feel this way is that my brain seems to think that touching anything that was exposed to ""Alcohol"" or ""Drugs"" and then touching any food or touching my body is going to make me ""CONSUME THE BAD THINGS AND MAKE ME LESSER THEN WHAT I COULD BE"" 
and on top that my brain thinks that everything in existence is ""contaminated"". 

And the worst part is that I know that it's absolutely idiotic, but I just can't stop my self.

And this is currently causing social problems, and constant anxiety, and Im at the point where my hands are getting damaged by washing them too much.

I'm really sorry if this is very light compared to what others are going through, but I'm in fear because its getting worse and worse, and I thought that some outside help maybe worth it.

85,"Roughly a year ago, I went on a date with a really nice guy. We had a good time, but in the few weeks after said date, I decided to call things off before they got too serious. My main reason was that he's white and I come from a very traditional Native American family. My step-dad isn't very strict about most things, but my mom is very strict and controlling, specifically over who I date. She only wants me dating other Natives men and in the past when I've dated white guys, my mom went out of her way to treat them badly and butt into the relationship every chance she got. They never worked out and I figured that I would just end up back at square one with this new white guy. I called things off with him, told him the exact reasoning behind it, and we parted ways.

The difficult thing is that we're coworkers and things were definitely awkward after I called things off. I was going out of my way to avoid him so as not to lead him on and give him false hope for the future. After a few months, though, I suddenly decided that I wanted to be with this guy and that I needed to finally gain some independence in life. So my new plan was to get into nursing school (it's my dream job to be a nurse) and once I start making the nursing salary (they start paying as soon as you're enrolled and begin training) I was going to find a place of my own, move out, and do whatever I want with my life. In the meantime at work, I was going to go back to being friendly with this guy and act a little flirty to let him know that I'm still interested so that he still likes me and doesn't move on. I never told him about my actual plans of moving out, though. We would just grow close again and be friends for the time being.

But two major things recently happened: One, I was denied entry into the nursing program, so there goes my living wage. Second, my step-dad has changed his mind on who I date. He use to think that I should be able to date whoever I want, but he is now urging me to date other Native men for the sake of the family. If I were to move out and defy my mom, she'd disown me like she did with one of my older siblings and our family would be torn apart. And honestly, I agree with my step-dad. Our family is already fractured, I don't see the point in making things worse.

I'm torn on what to do with this guy. These past few months, I can tell that he still has feelings for me and we've both been acting kind of flirty and extra friendly towards one another at work. I know he's waiting on me and he's expecting me to come back to him, but I need to move on. Do I just simply move on without informing him, going back to avoiding him and letting him down? Or should I at least tell him that we can't be together and that he shouldn't be getting his hopes up anymore? Like I said, he's waiting on me and I kind of feel like I owe him an explanation? What do you think?

So obviously he’s hurting in some way. We felt around his leg to see if anything would make him really hurt. No cries but he does kind bite at our hands.

I guess you probably need to have at least a vague idea of what im interested in too recommend a good podcast for me so heres a brief list. I like video games of all sorts such as danganronpa, Final fantasy, persona, and minecraft[You have five seconds to make fun of me], so its a pretty wide variety of games. continuing the fact that i'm a nerd I also like manga and anime originally I was gonna list specific ones but that got too long so I just listed the types I like shohen and story heavy ones, I also really like school animes the more messed up the school the better [although I do like ones like my hero academia if their good enough] and I kind of like trashy ones like magical girl and love triangle even though I always find them to be incredibly trashy and dumb I still like them, mystery ones are fun too. Book podcasts of any kind are great because I read so often that chances are if theres a book I would be willing to read it If I haven't already [I wont read romance ones though]. I still really enjoy fantasy middle school books yknow like warrior cats and wings of fire. I also like mythology especially greek [Ahem Percy Jackson does NOT count] any mytholgy is fine though. classics are nice too I also like writing history and mysteries this got way too long whoops.

for those who dont want to read that way too long paragraph heres a basic summary; Im a nerd and geek who likes video games and anime. I also like to read stuff including classics and mythology. History writing mysteries and DND are chill too.

90,"I was wondering if you could psychoanalyze this problem my friend has with his dad.  I think these problems stem back from his grandpa and great-grandpa, so I will tell you about them too.

GREAT-GRANDPA
Great-grandpa was a raging drunk who literally rode a horse through his house once.  Big drunken fights occured. Not sure how he treated his kids.

GRANDPA
Grandpa was a preacher, worked in the coal mines, was a drinker, physically and mentally abused his family, and had a mistress.  He died in his late 40's while with his mistress.  This had a bad impact on the family mentally/emotionally.  At one point, the Grandpa told his son (my friend's Dad) that he didn't think he was actually his son.  One time when my friend's dad came home a couple minutes after his curfew, and his dad punched him in the face and he fell down the front stairs of the house.  Grandpa was very good to other people, but mean to his own family.

DAD
Dad worked at a low-paying factory job for a long time, never told his son (my friend) he loved him, had my friend play baseball and other sports because he (the Dad) really likes sports, and spent a lot of time with him practicing baseball, etc, but would yell at him when he did bad in a game.  My friend loved video games, but his Dad would NEVER play a video game with him, even though he (the Dad) would play video games by himself.  He told my friend once that he wished his cousin was his son instead.  He would tell his sister she was stinky, but in an ""endearing"" / joking way.  It's like the Dad was afraid to show sincere love. The weird thing is that sometimes his Dad is actually pretty cool, but he gets into these weird phases where he's a jerk or pouty, or kind of does or says things to be a troll.  Right now, he's in a weird racist phase, but it's almost like he's trolling my friend and his family with his racist comments that nobody likes. 

SON (MY FRIEND)
My friend has done good for how he was raised.  Raised poor in a trailer park, ate the same meal most days, always got used clothes. Dad was a jerk. His mom was good. He's a worship leader now. I'd say the biggest problem my friend has is that he doesn't have as much self confidence as he should, is easily offended, and takes things personally. Married. He is good to his kids.  He has anger issues when he plays competative video games (probably normal). Doing good in his career. 

That's the basic rundown.  I'd love to hear anything you have to say about this, what the root of these problems are, and also how all these things affect self confidence, and any suggestions on helping people like this.  My friend doesn't want to disown his dad, but I told him he needs to at least mentally cut off all influence from him. Thanks for your input!",10Jun2018,1
91,"I don't care about my daily life. I feel like when I was younger I had dreams and aspirations, the world looked so much brighter. I went outside the other day and saw the trees and the people and realized I haven't seen the world in so long. I grind at work dealing with people at a desk, a job I hate, just so I can get money that I piss away on booze and drugs. Yeah I know that's a huge part of the problem but other wise I don't know how to find happiness or meaning. I feeling like my life is moving right by me and I'm just surrendering my time. It's a grind everyday. I don't like waking up anymore. I just want to run away.

93,"I used to be the guy playing guitar on the school bus, skating everyday, designing and drawing, so passionate about a lot of things. Now at 26 it feels like I have no option BUT to be a corporate drone. I let my dreams fall away when my Dad went through a lot of health trouble, now Im kicking myself realising how close to achieving them I really was. It even felt like i was living the dream for a while, but I let it all slip away instead of taking things to the next level. 

I see my friends are now playing in bands in other countries, or designers or tattooists. And I just gave up on it all and had a downward spiral. I now don't see a way back up and out of this. And feel like I dug my own grave. 

I am 26 and my Dad is 84. Thats what conflicted me, the time I needed to be moving out 18\-19 I held myself back because he was going through health problems. 

I feel powerless, dead, a failure and looking at jobs online and looking at the companies that I will end up working at because I burnt through what little savings I had, makes me want to blow my brains out. The thought of being a van driver across europe or working in a factory for the next 40\-50 years makes me think suicide would be better. 

If I realised that I was basically there with myself living my dreams I would not of chucked everything in. I was good at graphic design, art, guitar, drums, the lot. \- I wish I just got the fuck out my parents house at 18. 

I didn't realise until this last few years that they never really knew how much I had going for me, my dad grew up in the fucking war time so obviously the generation gap is hugely conflicting. 

One minute I was seen as some kind of renaisance guy that everyone in my social group looked to for inspiration \- from ages 9 to 20. Next thing I know they are all living there dreams \- barbers, musicians, tattooists, designers, and I am at home, unemployed thinking what the fuck went wrong.

It feels like I started to fly with my life, for a few years, but instead of taking things to the next level, I just cut off my fucking wings and buried myself, in a downward spiral of depression, mistakes and regret. 

I don't know if grief changed me? Or if I gave up? Or if the things I once cared about no longer do? 

My ex is now a professional tattooist \- Something we both wanted to do as teenagers, but she made it happen. I just \- for some reason, worked shit job after shit job. I kick myself everyday for taking her for granted as a teenager. I chose to go out with her at 15 Because she was the best girl in town, but I soon slipped into complacency with everything, taking her and everything else in my life for granted. I think my problem was I peaked too early.

I am really finding it hard to cope with how backwards it feels like my entire life has gone. I look in the mirror and don't recognise myself. 

Do I just accept things will never be the same and get a normal corporate job? It feels like a complete betrayal of myself. And the 16 year old me would be disgusted at how much I have already sold myself out. \- 

I think part of the problem was my Dad. He came from the fucking war time and so everything that meant the fucking world to me, he made me feel like theres something better in the future \- my life hasn't started yet. etc. Now Im realising I had my life spot fucking on when I was younger. In every kind of way. He never had the opportunities or the life I had. He had to walk miles with shopping for example, his house got bombed out in the war. etc etc. 

I have passed up SO MANY amazing fucking opportunities and it haunts me every fucking day. If I knew how much I used to have going for me, I would of moved out at 18 and built the life I wanted and was already living. 

I used to feel like somebody, I was a hero In a lot of peoples eyes. But I have betrayed myself instead of moving forward and I feel like my life will just be a big downward spiral now.

He also stated that Kate stole a lot of money from him. I’ve noticed a change in her as well. He also said that she got hit by a car a few days ago (coincidence?)

She said she wasn’t in the place for a relationship and just in general said it wouldn’t work out between us bc of strict cultural and religious differences. I regretfully said some insensitive things about how i was dealing with the rejection and it hurt her feelings. I keep throwing my unfiltered feelings towards her and it makes her feel guilty and she wants me to stop and handle it like 2 adults. However, she said she didn’t want to lose our friendship and cares about me. I do as well and want the same thing. The main problem is me. Shes told me its fine, catching feelings can happen but that i need to understand it probably won’t happen. But i just can’t seem to move on. I told her about my feelings a week ago. Since then, when we talk through text its all fine somewhat. But in person its awkward. And it hurts bc she is definitely trying to keep it like it used to be but i just keep bringing up the topic and wanting to talk about it. Its obvious she doesn’t want to talk about it anymore. I also just seem all around colder towards her. My mood has definitely gotten worse since she let me down and at work people have even asked me if i was okay. I just want things to go back like they used too when we were just talking and having fun. I know I’m being immature with how I’m handling it.

98,"Throwaway account in case parties involved have a Reddit.

    I really truly love my job. But a few months back my old manager (G) left for a new job and our new manager (L) is a huge pain to deal with. L is 24 and knoes everything. G was a amazing manager, L actually worked under her until she was fired (I replaced L) and L hates G and refuses to do anything resembling her methods.
      Her mood dictates everything. If her and her abusive boyfriend fight, or she gets in trouble for a mistake from higher ups, all her agression is taken out on us, her employees. This involves blowing things out of proportion, threatening to not back anyone on requests for a raise around annual reviews and even changing the rules.
      In a good mood, everything is fine. We follow the rules and go about our day. If she's in a bad mood, suddenly there are new, unheard of rules suddenly in place. Rules also absolutely don't apply to her apparently. She also places blame on us for her mistakes.
     She takes to chastising and belittling us in front of one another and customers. Favoritism is the name of her game. You'll see her mood flip a 180 depending on which employee she's talking too, and I happen to be one of her least favorites (most likely because I replaced her when she was fired) and therefore get singled out alot. Other coworkers see this too.
       Me and another co-worker have tried to discuss these things with her and she immediately gets defensive and twists words around and manipulates her way out of the discussion.

I'm not coming here to whine, I'm just very inexperienced in the working world and wondering if this is regular ""boss"" behavior and if this is something that should be discussed with higher ups since we have already addressed the problem, to no avail, with her. I can elaborate on anything, I'm just stressed and I feel like the way she acts is wrong and I'm not sure what to do.",10Jun2018,1

101,"Hello,
I'm in a tight spot and I don't know what to do

I recently moved in with my grandmother because she needs help around the house so I'm able to take care of her and do anything that she needs me to do. She is not well and has a plathora of illnesses. She has congestive heart failure, diabetes, high cholesterol, COPD (she's on oxygen and she smokes a pack a day), she also has sleep apnea and she doesn't take good care of herself. 

She does nothing but continue to push her health's limits and continue to destroy her body. I've tried to inform her that I can cook health and I have even bought products such as Nicotine patches to cut her off smoking but it's not judging. I have tried for years and I'm at my wits end. She doesn't really need to work or do anything for money bc she's covered by the state but she's not doing anything for her condition. 

She buys junk food with her food stamps and goes out to eat fast food with her social security checks. She doesn't go to her appointments because she doesn't want to wake up early. She doesn't want to stop smoking because she can't kick the craving. I've been trying to get her to stop smoking and stop eating horribly but the damage is done and it is no longer reversible. Her heart has drastically weakened over time and the doctors say there's nothing they can do. All this could have been avoided if she put her part but she thinks that she can fix her ailments with gastric bypass (she's not even a suitable candidate but...)

In all honesty am I being insensitive? I've tried so hard since she was diagnosed with her first illnesses but she's honestly just a disaster now. She's in Massachusetts. I feel like she needs around the clock care at a nursing home but she refused to go since she believes she will be mistreated - but she won't have access to eating mcdonalds and KFC everyday or buying Newport 100s.

103,"This is my first post here on Reddit and I'm just looking to get some kind of advice on what to do next in life. I'm still living at home with my mom, I was taking classes at a community college but after a year of that I decided that college really isn't for me, school in general really isn't. I never really struggled to get good grades in high school, I graduated with a 2.8 GPA. My problem is I never study for tests and I procrastinate on all assignments. I also really struggled to pay attention in class which made learning difficult for me. 

Anyways, I'm working a retail job at a Nike store. I've been working there for exactly 2 years now and make around $10.00 an hour. I have open availability and usually pull about 30-40 hours a week. When I'm not at work I'm usually just laying around in my room at home. I do go to the gym and workout for about an hour, 4-5 days a week. But other than that the only time I leave the house is to go to work or to get food. My best friend that I did everything with moved away to South Carolina this time last year and since then I haven't had any kind of social life. I get on and play video games with him all the time but don't really talk with anyone else or hangout with anyone. 

One thing I know about my myself is that I have a really strong work ethic. I'd say that's one of my best qualites. I acquired this trait back in high school when I was playing football. I was a small kid and I wasn't very strong or athelitc. I wanted so badly to be a starter on the varsity team and play on Friday nights. It was a long process and it took me all the way up until my junior year to get a starting spot on special teams, and then my senior year I started on defense and special teams. Anyways, I faced a lot of adversity through that time but I always stuck with it and reached my ultimate goal. I love setting goals and working hard towards them. My problem now is this, I have no passion for anything anymore. 

About 2 years ago I started to get into making YouTube videos and streaming on Twitch. This goal was similar to my football one. I wanted so badly to be a big YouTuber and streamer and I worked my ass off to get there. I uploaded videos daily while I was taking college classes and working a job on the side. After 2 years I had reached 1,000 subscribers and just over 50,000 total video views. It was time for me to move on at that point. I lost the passion for it and felt that my growth wasn't there anymore. Now I'm just stuck and don't know where to go from here. 

If anyone is in a similar situation or has any advice for me on what kind of move I can make next, anything is greatly appreciated. I want to get out of my mom's house and move out on my own. I just don't know how to go about doing it. ",10Jun2018,7
104,"One of my co-workers is a pretty relaxed guy, we get along well. His girlfriend loves me but I CAN NOT TAKE HER ANYMORE. It's hard to explain it besides she's just annoying. She starts one thing then acts like she's an expert. She'll interrupt others to say the same thing they were saying, but she'll repeat it ten different times. She has a short fuse to her temper. It's takes everything I have to hold my tounge.

It's getting to the point that almost everyone hates her. Others have not been able to hold their tongue, and while I understand why, it's beginning to cause drama. Today, she was talking shit on others talking shit. Ug. The type that says ""I hate drama!""...then goes and starts a whole bunch of it. 

Something needs to change. I just don't know what or how. He works there full time, she fills in randomly but isn't there too often at least. I'd rather not go to a higher up if possible (more drama) so I was debating going to the guy instead. But seriously, I couldn't blame him for getting mad/upset. I'd basically have to go up to him and say, ""She's annoying everyone, go stop her."" 

So...what do you guys think? Going to her would blow up, and out of respect to the guy I don't want her getting pissed at me because he'd be the one to deal with it. Going to him might also blow up, but atleast he's level headed enough I think I could talk it out with him. Going to boss, would probably be the most effective but I don't want to do that to him. 

How do you even word something like that? ""Her personality clashes with others""? I have a feeling he kind of knows, I've seen him shoot her weird looks or step into conversations to defuse a situation before, but he's not always by her. Before when she talked about others messing with her, I suggested just focusing on the job, ignoring it. This works for me, I'm at work so if I'm *working* I'm not talking with people. But she can't or won't, I don't know. (For the record there's time when you have *nothing* you can do, and it's common to talk to people.)

105,"I'm about to enter my last year of college and I'm really having a tough time deciding which direction to take my life.

I'm either going to become a high school teacher or go to law school. I'm a history major, so my job prospects aren't great, but these are the two fields I actually want. They're not just a default because of the job market.

I feel like they represent such opposite sides of who I am, but two valid sides nonetheless. If I become a teacher, I would probably stay in the same general area where I grew up. I'd have a normal middle class lifestyle, just like I was raised. I would have a ton of time off, and the idea of not usually working weekends and never working holidays is really appealing. I would make enough money to travel, which would be dope, but I would never really live extravagantly. My main concern isn't the money though -- it's more that I would just feel kind of stationary by continuing with the same kind of life.

If I go to law school, I would be able to go to a good enough school to get into Biglaw. I'd work crazy hours (at least for the first few years before moving to a less stressful firm) but I'd earn a substantial income. Most firms start at 180k + bonus, and quickly go up from there. I would most likely live in New York, which has always been a dream of mine. I'd also get to go to school for another three years, and to be honest the prospect of delaying real life for a bit is appealing. I'd like to meet new people, go out to bars, and simply enjoy that lifestyle a bit longer. If I become a teacher, I'll do a one year credential program near my house (wouldn't be able to afford the loans to live on my own on a teacher's salary). My early 20s would essentially be over at 21, because there's no nightlife to speak of near my house and by the time I could realistically move away as a teacher I'd be 26-27. I've dreamt of moving away from home and getting a prestigious job for as long as I can remember, and I feel as if I would have a lot of regrets later in life if I gave up on that.

At the same time, I am a bit of a homebody. I like staying at home and watching Netflix or browsing the internet. I could be happy staying home a decent bit, going out for hikes, and just playing board games with friends. Most of my friends from home aren't coming back after college, though, so I'd have to find a way to meet new people, which is kind of difficult in my area.

My concern is that if I go to law school and hate being a lawyer, which I've heard is pretty common, I'd essentially be trapped. I'm looking at a minimum of 100k in loans, probably more, and I'll need a high income to pay that off. I'll already be 16k in debt just from undergrad. Working in Biglaw I could pay it off in 3-5 years, but that's a long time of 60-80 hour weeks if I hate the job.

My thought right now is that I could become a teacher, which I do think I'd enjoy a lot more than being a lawyer, and still move to New York or a different big city. I'd have a lower income and a worse lifestyle, but more time to enjoy my life. I probably wouldn't be able to leave until my mid-to-late twenties, which sucks, but I'd still have plenty of time to enjoy my life. I really am tempted to go to law school though, just because I want that fun city lifestyle while I'm young. I'm also attracted to the idea of a high income and being able to provide my future kids with the freedom to pursue the arts or anything else they're interested in, free from the stress of student debt.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What are your thoughts?

We have been snapping each other every day since, talking on the phone every now and then, and there is this mutual understanding that when she gets here, we will be in a relationship.

But as of the past 3-4 days, she has been rather cold. She went on her grad trip, so I assumed maybe she isn't texting me much because who wants to waste time texting on a special week like grad trip.

But now she came back and still hasn't really been texting or showing much affection. I asked her how her trip was, she asked if she would like me to call her to tell me about the trip. I told her yes, but she didn't end up calling.

Right after her trip, the next day, she is on her way to visit another country with her mom, so I understand if she's really tired and busy. But at the same time, it doesn't take much time to text someone.

116,"I get annoyed with anyone regardless of gender if they are just pointlessly starring at me for no reason. There was a girl who I had a crush on a few weeks ago, asked her out, she mentioned that she had a boyfriend and I know she actually does have one. Cool no problem, still remained casual aquintance with her. 


Last week during college class after I finished my work, I'm looking down at my desk waiting for class to end. I randomly look up to see the clock and I see her staring at me for a short few seconds, I then look at her  and she quickly turns back around and looks away. I was getting ready to nod my head and wave but she turned around too fast, so I was like ooook then and returned to what I was doing and didn't think much of it. She was only two desks ahead of me and no one or nothing was behind me. 




Yesterday when I was getting my things together for the next class and out my peripherals I see her head turned  in my direction and just figured she was looking at something else. I was in a different seat and we were facing a different direction from eachother, I turned to her and saw her looking dead with  at me and as soon as I looked at her she quickly looks down. I'm annoyed at this point. I clearly see she was starring because we were close enough. I just open my arms calmly said "" what the hell are you looking at me for? Jesus christ... "". I walked away to my next class. I didn't want to say it loud and cause a scene, or embarrass her but come on... She's seems social and happy not shy so if I have something on my face, if I look funny, doing something weird, dressed funny or if she wants to make a comment, little conversation, great! She's came up and started a random convo with me before a few times.

This goes for anyone, not just her, if there's something you need to say, say it but please don't stare. Not bitter at all because I said something similar to people I wasn't attracted to before. I'm not doing anything to attract attention obviously or everyone would be staring, there's no reason to look at me, just don't god damn stare, fuck...

So, I need to leave and have nothing lined up, but I am getting depressed working there.

I’m pretty sure that he’s a psychopath.

120,"Okay I’ve never posted on reddit before but I wanted to take this opportunity to. A couple months back I decided to confront my friend about how mean she is to people. She’s a toxic girl who blames people for things she does to herself. I told her that it’s not okay to be rude to people based off things she did to herself. She exploded on me. She told me I’m a terrible friend and that I deserve no one. I told her to stop contacting me and to leave me alone. Now for a few weeks she did and I would hear about her talking about me here and there, but it didn’t seem like much worth getting worked up over. Last night, I got a message from a friend (since I blocked her on everything) saying that she wanted to tell me something. It was a screen shot of my ex-friend telling me that I’m a horrible person and that when she kills herself, it’s 100% my fault. I didn’t respond. I didn’t want to. I was content with not associating with her but what am I suppose to do with this. I really don’t want her to bring harm to herself but I also want to stay out of this. I could just really use some advice. ",10Jun2018,1
121,"I definitely peaked when I was 10\-20 years old. The trouble with that is you think good times are just going to keep on comming, and maybe they would, if I made better decisions such leave parents behind, move out, keep friends closer etc, took some more leaps of faith. But I didn't.

Now I am 26, unemployed. Gone from feeling like king shit to not shit within 10 years. 

My Dad is 84 \- the main reason I didn't move out when I was young and continue living my dreams. I have gone through loads of anticipatory grief, and realised by not leaving him and mum behind I let the life of my dreams that I was living get away from me too. 

I used to play guitar, it was my life, I even played in a few local bands, but now I cant look at it. I have friends who made it, and are playing in bands in france as well as here in england. \- Im realising that I gave it up just as everything was starting to come together for me. \- My ex is a professional tattooist. 

I also studied graphics for 4 years and it lead me no where. \- I can do it well, but I wanted to be freelance and the college course sucked the life out of me. \- I should of quit it as i knew deep down it wasn't right for me. 

I have let friendships slip away, and deeply regret it. 

I also feel like no matter what, I am going to end up in a corporate job and it haunts me. I am currently unemployed because the shit jobs I had basically lead to me being depressed. 

I used to be well respected amongst all the creative types, now I feel like I am having to betray myself just to survive as I didn't make it. 

The same thing with hobbies. I could kickflip in primary school, skating was my life, then it was guitar, I was someone you would of thought to be a success, but i am utter failure/fuckup. It felt like I got to the top of the mountain just to realise there was nothing there and I wish I could re do it all differently. \- I had things all wrong.

My older bros/sis all have there own lives and familys, I am an uncle now \- But its like I became an uncle before I really figured myself out and thats another thing that is fucking me up.

I feel like if anything my life is just reverting in every kind of way and I will have to soon get a boring job just to survive and keep myself fed.  \- I know I sound like a selfish cunt, but I had my 'Is this it?' moment at 17\-19. I already bought all the shit I wanted from previous jobs, kayaks, cars, guitars, games, \- I just wish I took things a bit slower when I was younger and realised I had my whole life in front of me. 

I feel like i built my own traps in so many ways and I am definately having a quater life crisis. But the thing is. It just feels like no matter what Option I choose, my life is just downhill from here. My Dad was my best mate and now is old and decrepid, its horrible to watch him get older as he was the strongest man I knew. Mentally and physically. Its like without his energy this house is a dull, grey, environment, and so is most of life. He gave no fucks, had solid integrity, so much knowledge wisdom and life experience, and seeing it all disintegrate infront of me is leaving a big gaping fucking void. 

Money doesn't motivate me \- I have seen an uncle save and invest for years only to get cancer and die within a few months. I couldnt be somebody paying off a house for 30 years, let alone save for the deposit. 

I don't really fit in with my generation or with anyone else. I have had a unique life and its a blessing and a curse. 

I have had love, friends, great family, great times, everything i ever wanted it feels like \- intrinsically. Now it just feels like Now what? It feels like I have become irrelevant. Lost my essense if you will and no matter what I do its not comming back \- Is this depression? Growing up? Reality? If 16 year old me saw who I am he would fucking hate it \- I used to look at boring passionless adults thinking where did it all go so wrong? Now I have become one",10Jun2018,2
122,"bARE WITH ME PLEASE? So I suppose this is me just being able to rant, I actually hold a lot of this in but anywho, I've been having a pretty rough year you could say, first, found out my first serious boyfriend cheated on me with his ex\-gf while I was in Mexico (gone for 3 wk only) took him back stupidly just to do me dirty again, moved in with him it was horrible his friends would go over daily he would work from 8 am\-10 pm (19 yrs old) with 2 hr from 3\-5 break and they'd go over during his break and after work to just smoke and work on soundcloud music, I was very upset but decided that this was not my path and got tired of maneuvering my choices around his life. Ngl, why,we had a little contact here and there we would have sex see each other or call one another to see how we were doing, a month after our break up his bff so close that they call each other brothers PM me and asked to see me, we hanged out thought it was weird and ecpevted my ex to be there with but it only turned out to be him aND I and we ended up fucking. While all this was ahppening I also had family problems, when I first moved out to move in with my ex my brother completely cut me off wouldn't talk to me for absoloutley nothing unless it was completely unavoidable but did the best for things to flow that way, my parents would always nag to me about college oh yea i graduated 2017, they nagged about me getting a job because those I cannot keep to even save my own life. His bff and I got together at least 3 times never mentione d it to either party being his own gf and my ex bf, because thats fucked up right? bro code? and in between those times yes, i was still seeing my ex. anyway, started talking to someone online which they came to me on instagram earlier this year jan 30, and i had broken up with my bf the second week of january. so I had all these people wanting to come around which I dont know why cause I was/am bottom rock. During that time me and my new internet bff came close super fast we progressed into facetimes, had a good connection between each other and everything was very simple and innocent with my friend, speed up during all that time i did have people i was talking to BTW and hooking up with, but i ended up meeting him and now i guess you could say we're dating but when my ex found out i moved to LA \-oh yea because when i left to LA no one knew where i was going my parents thought I was visiting a friend in college, my ex thought I was visiting family in cali and others thought it was just a trip, but no it was just to start my life over there alone all over for me and while i had met my new boo, my ex tried contacting me everyone wanted to know where i was and i didn't reply a day later because i had to take a plane back home but i was gonna miss it on purpose and overdose because i was just ready to end it all.. that night my cousin texted and my new boo ended up sleeping over another night at the motel so nothing happened\- and he was so upset i had lied to him on my reasons for being so sudden with my move to L, he asked if we culd start all over, if  i could accept him in LA with my unlces I said no sorry that ship has sailed, he then told me he wanted to kil himself that he would rather die than to wake up knowing he couldn't have me (shouldve thoight abut that when he was cheating on me) then he proceeded with him sending me a picture of his arm all cut up where he caused it on himself, i caled his mom, made me feel guilty asked me to stop bringing him false hope (lol) and to stop talking to eachother! whatever! not hard for me but thanks for making me feel like shit!:) anyways, my new boo had known about this and decided to finally invite me over his house but wait!!! I never knew his family was not the common, mom spends all day in her room, doesn't work, doesn't clean, for breakfast mcdonalds? and what do u want for dinner? mdcdonalds? and that's their nutrition, with breakfasts sometimes or lunch even just consisting of chips with a powerade and wait till night time so we can eat mcdonalds the second time today. the money they use is from the dad (child support) of course they're divorced, in the house 9 live there and more than half are a minor. His brother and gf live there with their 3 kids including my now bf his two brothers and mom with one bathroom and two bedrooms with a small ass kitchen that doesn't even have real plates and the microwave looks like experiments have been done in there. Roaches, rats, broken sofas, so dirty that even the walls have to be scrubbed. but who was i to say anyting i was living in califormia with goverment help, no parents, no car no money with a maxed out credit card and while he stays in LA my closest family lives in Landcaster/Palmdale, oh yea so fun and deserty where you have to drive out almost 30 min to at least get a civilized area. and the worst part is that they are my uncles, coming from my mom's side and my uncle is the brother of my mom but guess what!! they DONT even talk because they HATE eachoter and my mom can't stand even talking on thephone with him apparently because of things he has done in the past not only to my parents but to others in the family, not even my gradnma wants me living there but how can she say that if  thats her own son? but they are all very manipulative in their own ways, including my mom which is why i know how much more xtreme my grandma can be when it comes to these things, also cause ive seen it myself. they told me my uncle was asking my grandma is she knew when i was planning to leave aka hint hint  ""oh we want her out of here as asoon as possible"" that's what she said it seemed like my parents called me to let me know that i should be careful with them but they've been so helpful and nice to me, they literally sit me down and want to know what's wrong with me they want the best for me clearly they tell me they're happy i chose them to trust, that althoug everyone is basically against it they don't know what happens behind closed doors. they motivate me to help me find myself to let the words of others that hurt me to let them slide like soap, i feel like i have no one i can rely on emotionally feel like i have been letting it pack up so it's like i'm a big huge baggage of nothing because  alot o f the things i'm still suffering for i never got to let them out or preocess so now it just seems useless to bring it up. i've also slowly LOST myself, i'm usually high maintenance nails done, hair nicely styled, smelling good, showers with specific shamppoos, cleansers, steps after showering, trying to eat healthy, have intentions for getting more toned, dropping sodas/chips, but i seemed to drop all that  out the window i literally look so dead everyone thinks i',m sick or bullimic but honestly it's all the stress, i cry because my parents tell me they're proud of me but i just don't feel it in myself either. nothing i've done i'm proud of. also recently found out i have ADHD, man that shit blows, only person that knows is my uncle and aunt, no one else and i'm scared to tell anyone related because they don't believe much in mental illnes and less in medication. i turn 20 this year... i feel like these are the years that i have the chance to look my best, to be my best, to do everything i want to do, but  i just feel so stuck and rock bottom, i have no one to tell me what to do what to wear, no kids to plan my life around nothing and i still find myself depressed and with enxiety, i now recently had moemnts where i really feel like i'm getting killed because someone is gonna come and shoot me, who? idk ut it's gonna happen and it goes away and if not it worsens and then i depersonalize i feel myself looking at myself 3D and myan does that shit suck beause it just makes things worse for me. i have considered very very close to killing myself twice, last month and today.. i just dont care, i don't care how my parents might take it and i also don't care how anybody else wil react because i feel like i can't move foward with my life. i don't know what to do.

125,"I was friends with this person for a while, we first became friends in 2016 and it’s been an on and off relationship. This person is amazing and wonderful, highly motivated and hard working, never quits, always willing to lend an ear to listen or a hand to help. I’m the complete opposite; lazy, insecure, more prone to anger than I’m willing to admit, just a really loser-type person. Of all the people this person could have befriended, she chose me. She’s described me as one of her best friends at times but I can’t fathom what she sees in me. This insecurity of mine has driven us apart twice already, both times with months apart without exchanging so much as texts or words with each other, complete radio silence.

This person came back to me recently and after a lot of mutual venting we decided to try and be good friends again. They made it seem like it was just a quick one-and-done, yes-or-no type of deal, but I don’t see it like that. My rationale is that we’ve already fallen out twice already, what’s to stop us from doing it again and hurting us both once more? Whenever we talk now all I can think of is how I fucked it up the last two times and how we can probably never go back to the initial tight bond we had. I really do want and cherish this relationship but now it just feels so uncomfortable to be around her and talk to her knowing I’ve revealed my immaturity and insecurity and how she probably thinks less of me.

She’s tried several times before this to rekindle our friendship over the past few months and every time I brushed her off thinking she was better off without me and I without her. Every time she’s pointed out that she truly does value me and my friendship but was tired that she felt like she was the only one trying to hold it together, the only one putting in effort to maintain it; I realize she’s right. She always organized hangouts and get-together while I did jack squat. She always lent an ear to listen to me rant and offer words of sympathy or kindness , and I tried to do the same but I’m so awkward and unsociable it’s hard for me to do anything but listen silently. I’m at a complete loss. I care about and want to maintain a relationship with this person but I can’t figure out how to go about it without letting my stupid dumbass insecure self get in the way of it.",10Jun2018,3

127,"I just had a week long vacation with some of my friends and am making a short travel film for it. It's not a short film with a storyline or anything, just kind of a compilation of clips of fun memories and views from the trip played to a song (kinda like this: https://youtu.be/FzuM9Z5VQJ8). I want to use a certain song as the background music, however the singer in the song uses the n-word a few times. None of us involved in the video are black. I definitely am not trying to be ignorant or say anything at all related to race, it's just that the song I wanna use is dope but has the word used a few times. I talked about this to some of my friends but none are really sure if it's right or wrong. Is it wrong for me to use the song as background music? I would rather not use the clean version of the song as it kinda breaks the flow of the music, but obviously I don't want to be insensitive and ignorant.",10Jun2018,0
128,"(Wow just ended it, it's way too long. I just wanted to throw my thoughts somewhere anywhere, I don't expect feedback.)

This post is going to be long, I don't expect many people to read through it. Nor am I looking for the key to all my problems, I am just here to vent about my life, in hopes that this will be a catalyst for change in my life.

I have a good life, my parents work very hard to give me all the opportunities to be successful. They put me through private school, and now currently in university. They work their asses off to pay for my education, and allow me this opportunity to become successful. But I just take it for granite. I have never been great in school, through high school I was fine, around a 3.0. Now in college I have dropped hard, currently a 2.7 gpa and I have really let myself fall. Actually I haven't fallen I just haven't risen or grown at all for that matter, I don't know how to lite that fire under my ass to get me going. And I know grades aren't everything, nor do they really matter all that much after college. Though I feel like I am robbing my parents, when they work day and night to provide an opportunity most people in the world don't have. It doesn't help that I just don't retain any info in class. 

I don't want to make this a post only about school, because it's really about my life. I am a very likable guy, I am really inoffensive, everyone gets along with me no matter what because I hate confrontation, and will do anything in order to keep it that way. This being said I am a passive person, I am a person who views things from afar and keep my thoughts internalized. This may seem pompous but, what I usually observe in situations are almost always correct. Now that may have made no sense, so let me try and rephrase it.  I know what to do. Whether that be in life in general, or something smaller like having one more drink at a party. I almost always have the answer, because I have good instincts. But the thing is I don't listen to them, especially when they are telling me I am a disappointment and or conflicting with my problems (grades, girls, becoming a responsible adult). Not sure where I am going with this, but let me bring i back to my first couple sentences. I am passive. I don't want to be, I want to be aggressive to attack and opportunity, bloodthirsty for success, not afraid to jump into the fray and take a god damn risk. But I just don't know how to, being comfortable being a passive person letting everything pass by and just happen has taken control of me. I know what actions to take, in order to change my life. The problem is, I have had these crisis's in my life more than once. I tell myself I am going to change for the better, I get all hyped up for it and everything. But then the flame dies out, and I return to being the lazy, procrastinating, passive, and ungrateful person again. I just don't know how to keep that flame lit inside of me, to keep pushing me to become a better person and pushing my into the life I want to live.  

In my life I want to be successful, that being with money, becoming a CONFIDENT human, living my life to the fullest. But right now I am not on track, honestly everyday I just push away my problems even though I know I am a piece of shit for all of this. Especially since I know exactly what I was doing when I made all these mistakes. Currently I landed a really lucky job as a State Farm Insurance Agent, which I was happy about. I am back home from university, working, which means I don't have my computer to play games, which is my biggest most fierce passion (e\-sports). So pretty much everyday 9\-5 I go to work, come home watch Youtube videos and go to bed. I can't hang out with my friends since they are working on a different schedule. I can't even play some games with my friends when they do end up playing. It has only been a week and a half with the job and I am close to go insane, with this monotonous grind where I can't do the things I enjoy (games &amp; friends). Which is why I want to buy a laptop for myself so I can play games. I saved $10,000 when I worked senior year as a waiter, I put $4,000 into a ROTH IRA, and have $6,000 sitting and \~$5,000 more coming after working at my job. Though I know I can probably do without the laptop, and I know I could spend my money in a smarter way. By this point I don;t even think its a money thing I think it's a matter or principle and self\-discipline. I know that I could keep the $1,800 and live without the laptop, but wow do I want it haha. Oh and by the way, my parents are funding a dream trip of mine with my life long friend to Europe, in August. I feel like such a low life lazy piece of useless shit, and I can't help but hate myself for it everyday. The worst of it all is I would rather be ignorant to the fact that I am taking the shit my parents give me and allow me, for granite. But instead I know what I am doing and I KEEP doing it, and if that doesn't make me a bad person I don't know what does.  

I guess just to summarize things, I am a very self\-conscious 20 year old who refuses to change. Lacks confidence, scared to take risks, insecure, all while knowing that this is a problem.",10Jun2018,0
129,"Okay, its not really even an itch feeling, its more of the movement of my hairs is what is causing the feeling of something that is like crawling on me when really its my hair.

This may sound stupid but I'm pretty sure its my hair follicles that are itching. Which is under the skin. I've tested this theory out by pulling out a hair that starts ""Itching"" and the itch goes away. 

So how do I stop this? I don't want to pull out EVERY single hair on my body which would  probably be impossible in the first place.

Also I'm 17, And I am growing thicker hair everywhere so I also feel like that has to do with it.

I can never get comfortable because there that one hair that either itches or it feels like its moving and makes me itch, or feels like some but is crawling on me but its really hair.

130,"I know that sounds really dumb. I'm very much into video games myself and can play for hours. But I don't let it take over all of my time and like to go outside as well.

My husband, on the other hand, has a tendency to get so immersed in them that he will play through the night and sleep all day, essentially messing up his sleep schedule. This also impacts our weekends because he sleeps in and all the activities we agree to do (i.e. hiking, shopping, going to the aquarium, etc.) Require us to be there early in the morning.

His latest addiction is Fortnite. He also streams, and I know it's something he's always wanted to do. But it becomes a problem when it runs our weekends and I don't really get to hang out with him one-on-one because he is antsy about getting back to the game.

I've tried talking to him about it, but he'll spend time with me as for a few hours then go right back to it. I just want an entire day of no video games and to get out of our apartment. But he's always tired from staying up all night playing or wanting to be near his console to jump on as soon as we are done hanging out.


And, as embarrassing as it sounds, it affects our sex life. He's always too tired to do anything or begrudgingly initiates. It's a huge turn off.

132,"I have found myself in a rut involving making plans with a friend or a romantic interest, but the day or two days before (I’d say 80% of the time, and even that’s low-balling it) they either cancel or reschedule. I’ve tried being friendly about it, asking when they’re free next, telling them when I’m free next, and even showing that I’m somewhat miffed about the reschedule when it’s someone I’ve known for a while (different situations for these examples, I’m not too keen on pestering people when I don’t think they’re interested), but none of them tend to work.

133,"I (f 28) recently went through a major depressive episode.  It was my first experience with serious depression, and it was triggered by a personal trauma I won’t get into here.  The worst of it lasted about 6 months, and it was a really dark time for me.  I’ve recently made some positive changes in my life and started seeing a therapist, and I’ve been feeling so much better.  I have energy and motivation again.  

However, I feel like I’ve lost my drive to socialize. During the worst of my depression I cut myself off from friends and family as much as possible.  I used to have a pretty full social life but I lost a lot of friends while depressed and I just no longer feel a desire to be around people.  I’m close with my parents and have a couple of good friends who I speak to regularly, but mostly social interaction now feels meaningless and draining.  I’ve always been a bit of an introvert, but the pre-depression me used to like people and value friendship.  It seems like depression has fundamentally changed me in this regard, and I wonder if I’ll ever be my old self again.

I guess I’m just curious if anyone else has experienced a shift in their social drive after depression, and what they did to start feeling connected to others again. ",10Jun2018,3
134,"Women have always liked me in my younger years. I’m 29/M. But I’ve had thoughts inside me for my whole life saying I hate them. Especially the beautiful ones.

138,"My own theory is that I’m just tired of being snubbed. I feel bad, because sometimes ifI’m playing a game with my friends and I’m doing bad and something kinda shitty happened that day, I’ll either get really pissy or really quiet and sad. 

I notice when I’m not being understood/when I’m getting lectured from people in authority, ESPECIALLY if I’ve already mentioned I understand the point of the conversation, is when I get the most angry. I don’t know why, I was a really quiet kid and even up to a year ago I was okay with sitting and taking it, sighing and agreeing just to avoid unnecessary arguing. Now it’s like I live to argue. But at the same time, I feel like it mainly happens when I feel I’m not being understood no matter how hard I try/compromise. 

I(17f) have been having some issues with my mother, who recently got remarried after knowing some guy for 3ish months. She was acting really irresponsible and pretty much not taking care of her kids/ANYTHING in the house for quiet some time and I think it began around then, but might have started even a month or so before. I think it just got at it’s worst around then. 

Nothing seems to help. I’ve tried some really typical things, but all I want to do is lash out physically. I want to thrash around like a kid, or punch things, or fight someone. I don’t have access to a gym or anything where I could try to take out energy healthily. I usually just have to be insanely, UNBEARABLY agitated until I naturally calm down. 

Is there anything I should be doing? Any tips or things I should know about feeling this way?

139,"I don’t usually post on reddit, but I really need some help. I’m sorry this is long, I’m desperate.

I am a sixteen-year-old girl. I have been attending these extra-curricular classes about twice a week for four years now. I’m the second oldest there, with the oldest being an 18-year-old guy. I’ll reference him as “CG” (Creepy guy) to keep this less confusing.
CG’s been there longer than I have. Ever since I met him four years ago I was creeped out by him. CG has always followed me around the class. If I went one direction suddenly, CG would quickly follow. He would always try to sit and stand next to me no matter what. My two closest friends (K and C) have both noticed this. 

CG is a very physically aggressive person (I have reason to believe he has anger issues). He is very large and taller than me. He does odd things, like putting on a (bad) Russian accent for no reason and making violent threats towards people. He’s also never had a girlfriend (he tells us all that quite a lot and is quite angry about that). I’ve always been quite uncomfortable around him, but I was always polite when he spoke to me (I never made an effort to talk to him though). Unfortunately, as of this year I have had to get to these classes early. CG has started coming early to “keep me company”. He’ll patrol up and down the street until he spots my car arrive, then he’ll follow me inside. I always figured he had a bit of a crush on me, but I thought it’d hopefully go away if I was very careful not to lead him on.

A few weeks ago, CG asked me out before class. I told him I was dating another boy (also 16) in the class. CG hadn’t known prior as my boyfriend and I hadn’t made a big deal out of it (due to us not wanting some kids in the class to know). He got quite intimidating but, my boyfriend arrived shortly after and it was okay.

However, ever since CG has been very persistent about being near me. I’ve become quite afraid of him. He has been getting quite close to me. No matter how carefully I plan where I sit or stand, he will (very obviously) move to be next to me. I’ve already notified my teacher, and I’ve asked her to not put us in groups together. This doesn’t stop him from coming near me though. He has been getting increasingly closer to me over these few weeks. I’ve tried to ignore him by rambling on and on to C and K. They’re also trying to get between him and me. He still tries to force his way between us though.

CG is stronger than me, and I’m terrified he might try to touch me. I suffer panic attacks and I don’t know if I would be able to adequately stop him if we were alone. C and my boyfriend both think that it won’t come to that (they both think CG is a kind person), but K is also very worried. I can’t tell my parents, they just brush me aside and think it was sweet he tried to ask me out.

At the moment we are going to start having a few extra weekend classes. C, K, and my boyfriend cannot make it most of the time. I’m terrified because I know I will have to speak with CG. 

Please, how can I deal with him?",10Jun2018,28

My brother on voice chat won't disrupt my sleep, however, this has been happening every day, her fight against my brother disrupts my sleep, thus I play games at night, sleep at day, in return she screams at me. Her blood pressure is like 260 and I am sick of her screaming at night everyday I literally wake up at night to game to avoid that fight.

Should I still pretend to stay neutral?? My University intake is in January 2019, so I am relatively bored.

I can think of these things.

142,"I have just recently graduated from college and during my last semester got offered two jobs. One is from a giant here in India (TCS) but is an entry level IT job. The other is from a startup that essentially started last November. The startup offers a salary that is 1.85 times the one offered by the MNC. I was greedy and decided to join the startup now, but still have the other one on hold. It has been a couple of weeks now and I don't feel that the company is going to hold up it's end of the deal salary wise. Mostly because one employee who has been here for 4 months hasn't gotten paid his salary for 2 months now, and the interns are getting variable, lesser pay as compared to what they were promised. The training seems slow, and the overall office atmosphere is bad, with no perks whatsoever. I'm afraid I'd be letting go a chance to a low paying but stable job if I continue, but since the future of this company is very unstable, I don't know if I should take the bet. Please advice me.

Because im grounded for streaking the neighborhood at 3 am with some friends. Anyways they gave me a choice to go to 2 different highschools and im at a cross roads i have the whole summer to think about it but i just cant. Highscool number one is closer, theres a bus right outside my house that takes me but i have so much fucking drama there with tons of people and my only friends that are going to go there are complete dick heads to me. And i hate everyone that goes to the school but my second option is another highschool basically a 2 mile drive from my house and it takes about 13 min to get there (might be wrong on the miles thing idk) and on top of the long drive, after school i would have to take a train home and have my parents pick me up at the train station since im not old enough to drive yet. But this school has some of my friends and no drama and it also has great sports teams and shit. I think my worst fear is having to go to school 1 and make new friends im horrible at it, in my 7th grade year i didnt make friends till the last month of school so yeah im pretty fucked.

148,"Dear Reddit,

I am that kind of friend who has been through a lot. I have been bullied, I had to bounce back after several major surgery's. I had to grow up fast. And I am still focusing on personal growth. 

I have this friend. She is kind of superficial but can be deep from time to time. Through the years we grew closer. I let her in, I dared to be open. I cared. Whenever I felt something was going on with her, I tried to talk about it. I always made sure I didn't hurt her. She started pushing me away whenever something happend in her life. At first I took it personal. We fought about it. We had three fights the last year. I now realize she is only doing it cause she is scared of getting hurt.

I tried to talk about this new insight. She pushed me away harder then ever before. She says she doesn't  khow we could save our friendship because she doesn't know what will work for me. We only talk about my insecurities. She acts as if she isn't the one causing a lot of difficulties. And I'm tired. I'm so tired of fighting for her, being there for her even when she pushes me away. I'm tired of giving so much of myself and keep knocking on these walls in return.

I live in Saskatchewan, Canada and was renting from Avenue living  in Yorkton, they are a horrible company but that's a whole other can of worms. Our apartment building became infested with cockroaches. To the point it was un-livable, they had a pest control guy who only ever applied bait and sprayed, we lived like this for five to six months until it became to much, we severed our lease with the help from the ORT(office of residential tenancies)  and took our time moving to a new place as to try and minimize any of the cockroaches coming with us. Now that we have been settled in for a few months we have noticed that they are starting to appear. Can we make Avenue living pay for pest control in our new place, it's incredibly expensive. And can I get reimbursed for rent I payed during those five months? Or at least a portion. I honestly have nightmares about these bugs, and I just took apart my microwave trying to find and kill one I just saw crawl in there at 3 in the morning, it is honestly driving me insane.

On the second date we went to a movie we both really want to see. As soon as the lights went off he reached across and held my left hand and started stroking it. After awhile I moved my hands to get water and he put his hand on my thigh and started stroking it. I felt incredibly uncomfortable and at no point made any move towards him.

154,"Hey there, so I've liked this guy for a few months now. We've got one ""main"" (4 periods/week) class together, which we both love. I've spoken to him before, on roughly five\-ish occasions. I complimented him, he smiled, we share lots of similar interests, but we mainly speak about school. He's not exactly ""popular"" but well\-regarded, with a fair few friends in that class; so he's almost always talking to someone. He's introverted, socially selective, kinda weird but really nice. I, on the other hand, am known as the ""vampire girl"" (actual nickname) \-\- I don't talk very much (social anxiety), I was a shite person a few years ago so that reputation stuck, I've got ""odd"" interests (shock horror and the like)... I think you get the point. People are hesitant to talk to me 'cause they know me as bitchy and cold, but I'm slowly starting to regain some respect. I'm not one to start talking to random people out of the blue, unless they're new kids. 

Hopefully all that information helps with the question.

In the past when I've liked someone, I usually just ignore them until they fade from my mind; I never talk to them, never talk *about* them, etc. But this time, I want to see how far I can get. He sometimes shows signs of potentially wanting to talk to me more \- my friends have also witnessed this \- but I'm sure that's just my biased opinion/hope.

I believe it was the second time I talked to him when he had a proper\-ish conversation. It was honestly one of the best days of my life, for I got to see someone so special to me smile and be grateful for what I said to him (it was about his work in an extracurricular activity). 

I really want to become friends with him, to know more about him, but I don't know how. I'm sick of the overgeneralised ""be yourself"" and ""just talk to him"" suggestions. They don't help, and my crippling social anxiety is absurd. I don't have the confidence to walk up to him and be like, ""hey, how's your day going"" and he'd most likely reply with a look of ""what the hell"".

Now, her friends began to say that we are a couple and that we should go on a quadruple dates ... or what ever so have you. 

One of her friends didn’t like me to begin with, made an excuse to say that I am apparently “scary”. The said girl who likes me has most likely shown some emotion in the response of why I am not showing any mutual feelings to her. 

I fancy somebody in her class to add. And she is acting hot and cold and it’s annoying me (to which I have shown I like her on many occasions). 

To make this situation worse on my account. Is today. I saw Girl 1’s friends looking at me through the door after before I went through (Staring ... to be correct), when I decided to go through the door she signalled me to come over. Waved at me. To which I did! 

After I went over, not know Girl 1 was next to her and Girl 2 was a few metres behind. Girl 1’s friend slightly waving at me when I was in-front of her. Bluntly said “Leave” ... “Leave” and I did. Quietly calling her “mean”. 

Not so soon after I walked back through the same door and all of them were staring at me. Plain staring, no idea what happened. 

Clearly I think Girl 1 got upset. Didn’t say anything, as she is shy. Girl 1’s friends instantly marked me as a hostile. Girl 2, there is no point in talking to her, playing games is not for me, waste of time.

171,"I recently realised and admitted to myself that i'm a compulsive liar and have been for the majority of my life.

I''m 17 and I'm currently in the process of healing and self\-improvement after a particularly rough year in terms of mental health ( which I'm seeing a therapist for at the moment)  and have been making  a lot of changes to myself and my life.

Just recently, I realised that  a lot of my unhappiness stems from the fact that a lot of my life was built around lies that I told myself and other people. I learnt as a child (because of having a strict mother) that telling lies was a good way to get out of trouble, and now that I'm older I find myself exaggerating the truth or making up fake stories way too often out of fear of being perceived as boring or uninteresting.  Usually they'd only be small and pointless lies like lying about what I  what I did on the weekend, boys I'm talking too or even as insignificant as what I had for breakfast \- but i just felt the need to lie all the time and it just became natural to me.

After understanding the reasons why I lie in the first place ( mainly insecurity and low self\-esteem) I really want to do everything I can to change my habits and be more genuine and honest to myself and the people in my life. I realise now how pointless and futile all these lies are and that the REAL me is worthy of love and is enough without them.

But here's my problem:

I've been talking to this guy over snapchat who I met on an app similar to Tinder for about 2 months now, and we're planning on meeting IRL in july after my exams). I really like him, and he's  been there for me a lot and has expressed that he likes me too, but I'm just scared that I've sabotaged this potential relationship from the start by telling lies to try and make my life seem more interesting. 

as part of the process of overcoming my problem, I want to be upfront and tell him about my problem, and that i'm in the process of changing. I just feel like I have to tell the truth as soon as possible that I've been lying if I want to have any chances of having a REAL and genuine relationship built on trust. Even if it means sacrificing my pride and him cutting me off \- which I'm prepared for \-  I think I should tell him before we meet in person.

( just for a little extra information I've made a list of the lies I've told him and there are approx. 4:  having festival tickets that I don't have, meeting the Rock when I was 6, some outlandish story about a trip to the store and the reason why I was on the dating app in the first place)

The interesting thing is that  he's one of the only people who has called  me out on my lies and he has actually said a few times, kind of jokingly, that i'm bullshitting him.

Do you think telling him that I do have a problem is the best idea and if so how likely is it that he wont want to talk to me again?",10Jun2018,0

I'll just proceed acording to fate, and just try to keep myself calm and collected when issues rise up. It is fine. I am not fit to be one of those people that struggles so much in the pursuit of happiness. It's just all pointless for me. Too tiring. I don't even want to think about it. It just drains my energy and ruins my mood. Motivation, goals, discipline...whatever. I'll just keep doing the little things I do. No need to chase after anything. I'll just keep barely scraping by until I die, while finding some peace and joy in the things I like. It's fine. 
Worrying about things only makes me suffer, so I'll just ignore it all and go back to zero. I'll just live like a ghost. I won't mess with my stuff. It's painful. I won't do it. There's nothing to solve.
I'm worthless, but that doesn't mean I have to suffer all the time. I'll just accept it and stay where I am, taking just a few baby steps where I can. I'm too prideful and expect too much! Let's just go with the flow, and not think.

176,"[20F] So, it’s currently June 10, and my first day at my new college is August 27. I live in the south suburbs of Chicago and will be attending a school downtown. I really want to move out of my mom’s house sometime between now and then (I’d prefer a bit later rather than sooner to have as much $ from working as possible) into an apartment in Chicago. I’m really clueless on how to go about this. My ideal, perfect situation would be to live in a studio or 1 bed, no roommates, for $800 or less; however, I realize that might not be possible, so roommates may be inevitable. I’m keeping my options open, but $800/$750 would be the absolute most I can afford on rent per month.

I’m wondering if it’s too early for me to start looking, since I want to move August 1st at the earliest. (even though I’ve already done plenty of browsing in anticipation). Also, which sites work best for apartment hunting? I’ve tried looking at apartments.com, craigslist (I hate), and some student apartment sites, as well. I plan on using public transit to commute to school, if needed. In addition, I’ll be needing a job for when I move there, so I should secure the apartment then look for jobs in the area, right?

Doesn’t really make sense since my photos are way cooler as I’m doing a tons of travelling abroad but I guess I have stopped caring about make up so much and I’m much more care free in the way I look. 

HOWEVER, getting more “likes” is not what I’m looking for. How the fuck do I stop caring so much? I don’t really want to stop posting photos because my family really loves to see what I’ve been doing while travelling. But I care way to god damn much about the likes I get. Nobody knows this, obviously. I feel so pathetic for caring about such a wacky thing. But I know that a lot of people care about this, and a lot of people are too embarrassed to admit it. Social media isn’t bad, it’s the fact that so many people form unhealthy relationships with it, I really hate it. I feel like Instagram especially is the perfect way to teach young girls/women (and some dudes too) that popularity is a competition, and there’s no better way to “sell your brand” if that makes sense.

i’m 23, did my undergrad in arts (politics and literature, v generic). currently working in banking and hating life, my job is soul-crushing and doesn’t align with my interests or more importantly with my values. considering going back to uni to study a masters of environmental sustainability bc it’s what i’m most passionate about and it can open doors to roles in govt and NGOs and consulting on environmental sustainability which is where i’d love to go

been working full time for 6 months now and idk i’m just worried about stopping working to study fulltime. i won’t be able to continue my current job or any other role in the bank, have done some asking and only full time roles are available. so if i go back to uni i’d need to quit my current job and look for another part time job. i have enough savings to comfortably last 6 months. 

but then again i feel like this would open doors and get me in the direction i want to get into, and the course is quite practical and has an internship component and industry connections which would help heaps with securing a full time job in the field after graduation. 

i’m currently living at home (in australia, not uncommon at my age) but looking to move out in the next twelve months regardless

has anyone done something similar? or any advice?

i’m speaking to the masters coordinator tomorrow. she’s been emailing me heaps of resources the last fortnight which i think is a good sign - if she’s this invested in helping me decide if this is the right course for me then i think it bodes well for the way the course will be set up and tailored to students.

190,"I've split my life up into 3 parts: academia, fitness and social life.

**Academics**


Throughout my Maths major, out of my group of friends who tried, I always had the lowest mark. I told myself it was because I didn't try as hard as they did.

Got my results back for my MS Computer Science finals 3 weeks ago. Throughout the year, I worked as hard as I possibly could. During exams, I still studied 10 hours a day. Results: Average. Among my peer group I got the lowest mark. I can't think of anyone I know who tried who did worse. 

I thought I knew everything from this course but seeing my grades makes me doubt that. But I don't know how I could have prepared better. Several people used my notes for finals, asked me for help etc and they all did better. Fundamentally, my effort vs reward ratio was very low.

**Physical**

I decided to start lifting a year ago. I went from 145lbs to 170lbs in half a year. I decided to stop going to focus on my academics and social life. My weight has already gone down to 155lbs in the other half of the year. How is that even possible?

**Social**

I don't fit in. I've not wanted to drink alcohol or smoke weed for a while. But that's all my friends do. But what is my alternative? I tried boxing: the coach's first impression was I'd clearly never done a sport before (he was right and I never went again). I've never touched an instrument. Even at basic social events like minigolf or bowling I always come last or joint last. What else is there?

I've raised myself and I've always had answers to my own questions. But I don't know how to break beyond this limitation of mine. I don't even think it is possible anymore. Do I have a mental barrier or is this a legitimate barrier I am facing?",10Jun2018,1

196,"Hi, I'm currently struggling with a lot of negative feelings and am looking for advice how to get over it.

First, quickly about me: I'm a PhD student, currently doing a summer internship away from my university.
By the nature of my work, I'm typically working alone, a little bit less now during the internship, and normally don't see people until I leave work. (During the internship I actually have lunch with others)
My field is filled with a lot of people who lack social skills and typically don't want to interact with people. So naturally I made friends outside my field.
I'm very ambitious and have a lot of goals outside of work. I'm learning a language (taking a class), and work out a lot (twice a day on good days).

Now lately my girlfriend kinda broke up with me, but we're still texting a lot and sending photos and she's coming for a visit in a couple of weeks. So I'm not so sure what's the state, but I know once I'm back from the internship, the relationship will be different than it was before. For her it was too much, too soon. For me, well, I can't wait to move in with someone and even wouldn't oppose the idea of having kids.

Now here comes the bad thing. I try medidation &amp; journaling nowadays to deal with my negative emotions, but the day after she broke up with me (although she still spend that day with me), I couldn't help but sit there, crying thinking ""why does nobody love me"". And this feeling doesn't go away. I wake up, feeling lonely, sad, and, for me as a morning person, I'm starting to struggle getting out of the bed to start my morning routine. I've been through a way rougher breakup last year, but this feeling is just killing me. My motivation for anything passes so quickly, and every minute I'm not distracted by doing something, the feeling comes back. I'm still loving this girl, and not getting texts from her is killing me. Meanwhile, I'm at the point where I'm getting anxious about texting her (I don't wanna project that I'm super needy, although she knows that).

If I was at my university, I could go to my councellor and talk to him, but unforutunately, this is not possible. I'm not depressed, and I know it could be way worse (like last year :/). I also don't really have friends I feel comfortable talking to about all those feelings, especially not here. I always had a hard time talking to guys about my feelings, and, well, the girls I've talked to about my feelings kept falling in love with me, essentially destroying the friendship. Don't get me wrong, but talking/opening up to guys is so tough, and I also know people don't like a ""downer"". (I also don't have a any friends at my university that I'm close enough with (I'm an international student)). I further really don't feel comfortable telling my guy friends, even the good/best ones, that I just want someone to hold me and cuddle with.

I'm really trying to reach out to friends now, more and more, but it feels so sad to me, that they never reach out to me. 

I'm not quite sure what I should do to overcome all this, and I'm glad for any tips you could help me to get over this lonely-unloved feeling.

Maybe I should add, that I'm not close at all to my family and when I tried to closing that gap last year, it didn't work out.",10Jun2018,2
197,"Hi all.

I'm in university living away from home. I moved away in September 2016 and it's been good so far. I've met new people, made friends, grades are good, etc. Except for one issue.

A bunch of us decided to move in together for academic year starting September 2017 and it has certainly made me see one of them for what she really is. Let's call her Eve. Me and Eve used to be pretty close, but over time I've started to notice things.

Eve is extremely toxic, jealous, sly, and manipulative, and I have decided that I don't want to be friends with her anymore. I've actually felt this way for a long time but haven't taken action because we live together. She is moving out in 3 weeks so I will be blocking her on everything as soon as she goes, but we are on the same university course. My boyfriend and her boyfriend are also on the same course and were once good friends, but that's gone to shit since they got together. 

How do I cut her off? I worry because she has this poor guy wrapped around her little finger and she goes crying to him whenever a mean 'ol puddy tat gives her a nasty look and he's onto them. Since we are on the same course too, how could I avoid all communication with her? It would probably be easier if my bf and hers weren't on the same course so I'd know he's ok.

I've been thinking of sending her a message telling her that I do not want to friends with her and just blocking her. Any advice on how to handle this situation would be much appreciated. 

Thank you all.

Recently, we had another fight. She accused me of not caring out of nowhere which is weird since she was always talking and I was always listening. If I wanted to say something about myself, she'd say she didn't care and she'd move on with her stories. I explained this to her, along with the fact that not being allowed to talk didn't really bother me because I didn't want to fight again, but she got mad, called me a loser and stopped talking to me.

Now she texted me again, saying she wanted to see how I was doing but reading our last conversation, she decided to give up.

200,"I’m graduating soon and have decided that I don’t want to shake my university president’s hand at graduation. This is because of his recent lack of support for sexual assault survivors and his refusal to acknowledge that our campus has a racism problem.

He basically sucks and lots of students want him to resign.

It is basically unheard of that someone *DOESN'T* drive drunk. The only thing they have to do is go out to bars, drink all night, and either go home or go to the next bar over. Sometimes this would be slightly less disturbing when they stay in town, but apparently this gets boring, so all of the same people drive to the next town over, half an hour or so away, to go to different bars.

And these stories are met with hysterical laughter and good humor. I've asked a couple of those who are closer to us about it, and they say that it's just a ""part of life"". I'm astounded no one that we know personally has ever killed anyone or been killed. I've heard of a handful of people from the small area communities getting hurt, but luckily for us it's not yet been anyone close to us.

Another thing that gets to me is how they handle their animals. I'm from a suburban area that has house pets. Anyone who keeps dogs outside 24/7 ends up getting in trouble or their dogs take away due to the summer heat or winter cold. It's a serious matter where I'm from. I completely understand dogs and cats are more animals than family members for those with land and farms; they stay outside and that can never change. But so many of their dogs go without any source of heating during the winter or any good source of cool areas during the summer. And many of them have short-haired breeds. When the dogs get heartworms, they do give them medicine, but they continue to let them wander around the property and do any and all physical activities, including running, playing, barking, etc.. 

It breaks my heart that they have animals that I consider to be in small ways mistreated, especially by people who do genuinely care. They just don't realize what they're doing is bad for their pets. And there is no justification for drunk driving - ever. 

I am not comfortable not saying anything about these matters. I know that saying something will just fall on deaf ears and just cause rifts between us and our friends and family. My husband is of the same mindset I am, and he knows how distraught I am over some of these matters, because he's been one of the few smart enough to get away from many of these... traits.

I was wondering if any of you folks had any advice on how to handle these matters. I do not want advice on how to talk to people about it. These are grandparents, parents, and friends and family friends who are old enough to be either. And these are also friends who have their own lives. These life choices and styles are so engrained in their culture that it won't change. I just want to see if anyone can offer advice on just how to not get upset by these things and how to handle these things when we come across it. ",10Jun2018,1
207,"Hey guys, I really need some help.

I come from a conservative and religious family. Since I was little, my older brother took it upon himself to take over my fathers’ role (my dad has schizophrenia) in parenting me. He controlled every single aspect of my life. My mother never did tried to intervene and man-up so to speak, to get him to back off. She just let him control me and did nothing herself. 

As I grew older, I found myself with a nice mixture of mental illness; depression, anxiety, PTSD and BPD traits. I had no family members to support me. I had my controlling brother tell me that going to a psychologist is stupid. I had him tell me that I don’t need antidepressants, instead I needed Jesus. I had my mother tell my psychologist that her utmost mission as a mother was to keep my innocence (virginity) intact until I get married, hence her strict rules and not caring that my brother was controlling me. The rest of my family were very much bystanders-they saw how unhappy I was but never intervened. 

Anyway, fast forward to now. I’m 20. My controlling brother has backed off a lot compared to how bad he once was. My mother recently found out I lost my virginity. She wouldn’t speak to me for a week. She now has major trust issues and makes horrible comments about me and how my worth is gone and how I’m going to sneak off and have sex with that person etc. She wants my sister to take her car off me (even though I’m the one who pays for service and registration) so that she can find a way to control me and prevent me from having sex (which I’m not even currently doing).

Basically, I am so so tired of being controlled and being so unhappy. I’m not even currently sexually actively, but even if I was, why the fuck is it anyone’s business except for me, myself, and I? Who fucking cares if I’m no longer a virgin, there’s so much more to life than “keeping your innocence”. My mother has failed me in so many ways beyond belief. She has treated me terribly for years now. She is untrustworthy and unsupportive. The rest of my family just follows her lead. I’m so tired of things. I want to move out of home, but I’m terrified of my eldest brother (not the controlling one) who has schizophrenia as well, and has abused me in the past. I’m scared I’m going to be disowned and not allowed to come back home if I ever need to. I’m scared I won’t ever be allowed to see my niece and nephew again, both whom I adore with my whole heart. I’m terrified that my parents are going to die and I won’t have spent time with them before they die. I have so many fears and doubts and I have no one to turn to. 

Please help me.",10Jun2018,39

209,"So I’ve been working at a bar for the past four months and have developed a sweet innocent relationship (if you could even call it that), with one of the guys I work with. We’re both young and started around the same time. He’s already told me he loves me which unnerved me and I’ve recently retreated. Let’s call him Jack.

But here’s where it gets bad..

Last night we had to close the bar early because of a violent demonstration going on outside, so our manager opened a company tab and we all started drinking. Come 9pm we’re all drunk and ready to leave. Me and two other co-workers went to a small bar next door because it was still early. One of my coworkers who we’ll call Kevin is a close friend of Jacks, they’re both from the same country and speak the same language. So our group of three continued to drink and seeing as this bar is near ours we get a discount because staff from both bars know each other. So the other coworker leaves eventually and I aim to finish up my drink and leave soon after too. Me and Kevin are having banter and chatting when he leans in and kisses me. And I kiss him back. The kiss was good, really good. And he’s by far the best kisser I’ve encountered. We kiss on and off for 10 or so minutes. And it’s HOT. This is then followed by him propositioning that I come home with him. Which I reluctantly decline. However, this has unfolded in front of bar staff. Bar staff that our staff know well and the realisation that this will soon be general knowledge in our bar is scary.

I feel awful about it, I know this will tear Jack apart especially having it be his close friend and love interest who’re kissing. One more thing though I cannot stop thinking about that kiss and all I want to do quite honestly is kiss Kevin again. Should I tell Jack? Should I pursue Kevin? Am I over thinking this lol? What now?

214,"Hi everyone, 

My boyfriend and I share an apartment with a roommate who we're friendly with but didn't know personally before he moved in a few months ago. We had plans on Friday to hang out and play some board games and he invited his friend over around 6pm. He was acting a little bit off when his friend got here, but nothing too concerning. He ordered dinner for himself and his friend, went downstairs to load his laundry in the dryer. Came back up and was chatting with his friend while he was waiting for my boyfriend to finish something up for work and we were going to play. 

All of a sudden he got very strange, said ""I have really bad anxiety right now, I need to go smoke a cigarette"" and went outside. We haven't seen him since. His friend left around 45 minutes later when he didn't come back. He didn't touch his food, still had laundry in the dryer, didn't bring any essentials with him. 

My boyfriend and I have been trying to call him all weekend but it keeps going straight to voicemail and his texts aren't being delivered (iPhone). I found his friend who he left here on Facebook to see if they'd spoken and they haven't, and he's very worried also. This is even more concerning since he left him here with no warning and never reached out afterward. He also had a mutual friend try and contact him but she got no response either.

We went to the police station yesterday but they weren't very helpful- they just told us that he wasn't arrested or that no one called 911 regarding him. I tried to call them again around midnight last night when he didn't come home, but they didn't answer their non emergency line the 3x I tried calling. I called the hospital a few times as well but they had no one by his name there. I reached out to his friend again to see if he could track down his mom, but I'm not really sure what my resources here at this point aside from continuing to call the hospital and file a missing person's report. We live in NYC.

Is anyone able to point me in the right direction of where I should go next, maybe another sub to post this on or grab resources from, somewhere to start if we were to look for him? Anything is helpful. Thank you!",10Jun2018,24

I had been in love with her for most of my senior year and she with me for most of that time too but neither of us acted on it.

219,"I’ve been speaking to this guy for a month, who I met on Bumble. He’s travelling but based in my home country (he’s back any day now). We were having a conversation earlier about how I’ve never had “proper” sex and that I feel like it won’t happen until I meet someone where it goes deeper than the superficiality of casual sex. He said he doesn’t care and doesn’t think any different of me (not that I care anyway, lol).

He then says “I hope you’re not looking for anything serious with me because travelling, it wouldn’t work”. I replied “Haha, no! It’s just a bit of fun”. I then said “Look, if you’re looking for sexy fun, I don’t want to waste your time”.  He replied saying “what ever happens, happens. Let’s just leave it at that”. I took this as him being a bit blunt so I said “oh dear, okay 😂” and he replied “let’s just let it flow hahaha”.

What I’m trying to ask is, am I the only one who thinks the comment he made then the comment he followed with in a bit... contradictory? I don’t get why he said that when I refused sex. I literally said he can walk away, but just said “what ever happens, happens”. We’re meant to meet up when he’s back, which I’m happy to do, but do I bail now, knowing there is effectively no point to this anymore? ",10Jun2018,1

225,"At the risk of making this too long, I will cut it down to just important details... I am a 33/f child of an alcoholic, and my boyfriend is a 36/m who works from home and runs a successful tech company. Met through a mutual friend, first date we ever had he got super wasted and made a fool of himself. That repeated the next few times we met (we dated long distance for a while, so every time I saw him, at least one night he would get way more drunk than me when we would go out). 
He moves in with me, but the week before, gets drunk and spends the night with a girl I always had suspicions about. We stayed together, but the first year became me not only getting over that, but also realizing that he is a binge drinker (i don’t drink often, really just twice a month when we go out with friends). If he decides to stay in and play video games by himself, he will get wasted and stay up until 9 am listening to music or talking to friends who are up late. Alcohol is like cocaine with him, he doesn’t pass out, he stays up. This keeps me up, because I was raised by an alcoholic and it stresses me out to see him lose control and binge.
We have had talks about it, and it goes in cycles where he admits he gets too wasted, controls it for a while, then falls back in to calling me controlling and being apathetic to my concern. His defense is that he pays his rent so he can do whatever he wants in his own home. I am a control freak over that issue, I know. But being in a relationship with someone who drinks that way can’t be the norm, can it??

228,"I'll start by saying I'm not even sure this is the right place to post this. This is long, thanks in advance for reading... 

About a month ago, my wife's great uncle passed. My wife has a female cousin who we met up with st the funeral. Months before the funeral, said cousin messaged me on Facebook; she sells makeup and my wife wanted some mirror that she sold.  So it was around the time of valentines day and I bought the mirror. I added the cousin on Facebook. I noticed some of her posts were not the happiest. I messaged her and asked her what was going on, she explained that her car got repoed and her boyfriend who is the father of her two kids, wasn't able to help too much as while he works full time, there is only so much money available... Totally understandable.

Now we are at the wake. Cousin shows, and she and I sit down and just talk for hours. She explains how things with the boyfriend aren't going well and she's essentially over it. She's worried that he will somehow end up with custody. I explain that in most cases, that's not how it works... But the boyfriend has her scared into believing that he will get custody. She has no car so she can't get to work to make money to be able to get out and start... A vicious cycle Im familiar with.

That night I turn to my wife and I said, what if we just bought your cousin an inexpensive car? Something for A to B. Nothing fancy. Wife agrees it could be a good idea. Secretly this is a dream of mine. I grew up dirt poor and I always wanted to be Ina position to help someone out who needs it. The fact that it's a female with two kids doesn't hurt either as I'm a sucker for a damsel in distress...that's not meant to sound  showvenistic (yes, I'm aware I absolutely butchered that spelling.) I was raised by a single mother and we needed help so that naturally tugs on the heart strings.

So I messaged the cousin and explained that that is what we would do.  She was beyond ecstatic, and we agreed to go out Saturday. This decision was made Thursday. Later that night, she messages me saying how shit is about to go down. She decided to tell the boyfriend that she had had enough and that she wanted him out.

Next day is Friday. We are at the funeral, and while she made her decision, she is clearly beside herself. Not much conversation is taking place. As I always want people to be happy, this is bothering me, but the realist in me knows what it is. After the funeral, we go to the repass dinner. My wife takes her home to get her kids, and she comes to the dinner. We are discussing different cars and shit. It ends up she prefers a truck it just makes her feel safe. For the same money, I don't really care what we get. So we messaged a few people from Facebook, craigs list, letgo, etc and make some appointments.

Saturday I pick her up in the morning. We go to see the first truck, but the idiot selling it isn't home and despite numerous discussions about what time we'd be there, he left his house AFTER we showed up. We have two crying kids with us, so we leave.  We are driving to see truck 2, boyfriend calls. I can tell that this fucked her up, and I asked her, doesn't he know we are truck shopping? She says yes, we go on about the day. We go to see truck 2, nice enough but it has issues, so we go to see truck 3...the winner. On the way home, we are discussing how her boyfriend isn't affectionate, which hits me hard because I start to realize during this conversation that my wife and I have that same issue. So now I end up in a deep depression for a few days. This is Saturday.

Tuesday is the day we go to pick up the truck. We had to register it, so we paid the owners and they gave us the title. We are driving down to the truck, and she turns to me as we are talking, and says okay, we are going to get personal. Do you and your wife use toys...i reply, and we continue discussing. I mention this as this will become important later.

So we register the truck, she drives it home, and thats that. We continue talking over the next few days and weeks about anything and everything. Including some details of each other's sex lives... Nothing crazy, just some things. I have several female best friends and we all discuss that shit together, my wife is aware of it and doesn't care, so its not a thing.  We offer her and her kids to come stay with us for awhile... Enough time to get her job squared away, get child care situated, figure out the social services she will need, etc. Cool. 

So a week or so ago, as things were beginning to get seemingly better between her and her boyfriend, I get a punch in the gut... The boyfriend feels it's inappropriate that she and u speak as often as we do, and he told her he doesn't want that happening. Initially, she basically told him to fuck off as she doesn't have anyone she's close with and I'm family (I say this because logically that's fact, I was trying to help a family member when I bought her the truck). So I think nothing of it. At this point she also started saying how she didn't like what she was reading about the local school districts near me... I said you're not going to be in this house long enough for that to matter, your kids have a few years before they are school aged and a lot can change in that time...i will say here that I learned that the cousin is a self admitted basket case... She has deeper rooted trust issues than I do, which I. Legit never thought was possible 

Then, the next day, we are talking, and the tone kind of changes. She gets mad at me for asking questions that pertain to me, saying I'm trying to get involved in her personal life... Which I wasn't. At that point, I told her I needed to take a step back as all I wanted to do was help and it doesn't appear as though I'm doing that and I now have stress, anxiety and a lack of sleep, etc. So I take the next day and analyze all of this...this was last Saturday... I realize that I knew her for like 5 minutes when we decided to help her, but figured as it was my wife's cousin, it would be a good thing. I realize the situation was more fluid than I realized at the time, and so in my head she was leaving, but in reality that wasn't necessarily the case. So I cleared. My head out and I was mostly good. So I message her that night and basically say I sorted the shit out, and if she's good, I'm good. She says she's good.

We don't talk much on Monday other than to confirm we are all having dinner at the aunts house, which is something we agreed to do when the uncle passed. Turns out my wife and I aren't going, and the cousin asked me thst. I told her it was news to me.

Tuesday night wife and I go to trivia with friend of ours. Cousin messages her and says boyfriend wants to meet us... Which is something I suggested earlier that day. Cool. But my wife and the cousin keep talking, and my wife asks her what he wants with us... Cousin says he wants to question us probably. Wife says that's not cool... We didn't do anything wrong, and if the boyfriend tries to make me seem like a piece of shit or something, there will be issues.

Next day cousin messages wife. Says how some of our conversations were inappropriate and never should have happened. Wife says that she participated willingly so don't try to make it seem like I'm the bad guy. She says she's not, but they shouldn't have happened and she would not be okay with her boyfriend having those conversations with anyone, family or not. She also says that he's not okay with us talking as much as we do, family or not, and she really wants to make this work. Punch to the guy 2.

I tell the cousin that she was actually the one who opened the door to those conversations (recall what I said above about her turning to me in the truck) and that she was never forced to do that. I said I just want you to be comfortable and chill and shit around me, so whatever it has to be. I also said that the boyfriend thinking that us talking is inappropriate is weird because we are family. I have many female friends who I speak to regularly and it's not some odd shit. She said she doesn't want to discuss that stuff anymore and so we won't. I say fine, but it's not fair that you're making me out to be a leper when I didn't do anything wrong.  I basically end the conversation with that she won't be hearing from me much if at all because all I wanted to do was do a good thing and it doesn't seem or feel like thats what it is anymore. 

Wednesday night I'm walking into my bedroom... And it all hits me like a ton of bricks...shes lying to the boyfriend. She told him my wife offered to buy her the truck... My wife took her out for it... My wife paid for the registration... My wife came up with the idea... Thats why he thinks it's weird that we talk as much as we do... He thinks my wife did everything. Now I'm just fucking pissed off... And she won't tell him the truth. 

I said that to her as well, but naturally there was no response.

So now my head is all fucked up because logically I can't behind and don't understand how I did a good thing in hopes that we could all forge a relationship and become close and cool and shit, and instead of that I bought her a truck and now have a proverbial knife hanging out of my back. My friends and wife are mostly tired of hearing about it but I still feel like shit. I mean right now as I right this, it's mostly over and out of my head.. I'm just kind if waiting on someone to say something that will kind of free me from this, so to speak lol... I obsess over things so naturally that's what thus has been for the past few weeks.

232,"Due to an overwhelming amount of things out of my control that have happened in my life, I'm a few years behind in my position in life, and even further in terms of social skills.

I'm almost 20 years old. I won't have a driver's license for awhile and I won't have a car for a very long time. I just started my first job, though it's part-time and doesn't pay very well so it's not too impressive.

I graduated High School last year. It was a very small private school which I'd been at since 6th grade, never any more than 40 kids at a time there, all being anywhere from Kindergarten to 12th grade. It was unofficially for troubled kids; not advertised that way, but almost everyone there was only there because something was wrong with them in one way or another. In short, I didn't have the same opportunities to grow my social skills as other kids, not by a long shot.

I struggled with crippling depression and anxiety disorders for the majority of my teen years as a side effect of the medication I was taking for my ADHD. Being at such a small school full of troubled kids didn't help already, not to mention my mother and father's parenting skills are far from excellent, but all that alongside mental illness causing me to having absolutely zero interest in self-growth and improvement, things we. It didn't occur to me that the medication was a big part of the problem until much later, and I finally kicked the meds in the second half of 2016. I've grown more in the last 2 years than the majority of my life.

As you can imagine, I have terrible social skills. With ADHD, I tend not to notice things I do until I've already done them. I have a hard time with eye-contact, body language, and I ramble - a *lot*. I have friends, but they're mostly people I've grown up with since early childhood, and it's easier to look past glaring flaws when you've known someone for so long and know so much about them. It's not so easy when you're a stranger or an acquaintance.

I've never been in an intimate relationship. I'd *really* like to. But when I'm talking to girls, I feel like an alien. Like I'm experiencing some sort culture shock, despite living in the same place for almost 14 years. I'm about average, maybe below-average in looks; I'm not ugly, but I'm not Ryan Gosling.

Since I don't drive and have only a part time job despite not being in school, it feels I'm not ""worthy."" They say there's someone out there for everyone, but at the same time they also say you need to bring something to the table. It feels like I'm, for lack of a better word, a total loser.

Is there anything I can do to change this? 

Do I just lack confidence, and the rest doesn't matter? 

Or are the thoughts in the back of mind my right, where it's not worth the effort to try and I should wait a few years until I've caught up with the rest of the world before I enter the dating-scene?",10Jun2018,1
233,"Recently I discovered something truly sickening, on Youtube there are pedophiles who target young girls, they groom them, gain their trust, stalk their channels, and request inapropriate things. It became a huge problem when I would be on Youtube, to the point where I couldn't ignore it anymore, so I decided to do the right thing and protect these girls. I began commenting to these girls on their videos, waring them about the creeps who are trying to manipulate and hurt them. And yet, most of these girls do not care. I've had success with some girls and they listened to my advice, but most of them completely ignored me and even worse defended the pedophiles! Has our society gone mad? I mean, where are these young girls parents? why weren't they raised to be aware of these things? Is social media ruining kids safety? It's like evil is truly winning. I have even contacted Youtube about this and yet they do nothing. I feel utterly depressed, and have no idea how to deal with this situation. I have a big heart, I'm the kind of guy that always looks out for people, but this experience is really making me lose faith in humanity. Are there any good people left in the world?

234,"I live in Bangladesh and I am a ""writer-thinker"" (read graphomaniac if you will). I need to write privately. I need to write down my thoughts, ideas, inspirations of philosophy, academics, science that pop up before they vanish. I am sure people who write have the same issue as well. When you feel like you have such wonderful ideas only for them to vanish away because you haven't written them down. Or the yearning you feel for writing, a passion that makes writing a must-have activity for itself.

240,"Hi all, hopefully this is a good place to post. So we just moved out of our condo a few hours away. Our lease was up June 15. 

We told our landlord, Rob, about 2 months ago we would be leaving. Then may 15th my husband included a formal letter letting him know we would be vacating the condo June 1st. Rob thanked us for giving him so much notice and told us we’d get our security deposit two weeks after we had left and after he had done a walkthrough of the apartment.

Here’s where I’m getting nervous. We were there for 4 years and it’s an old condo. It was built in the 80s and the bedroom rug, kitchen counters and bathroom tub/sinks are all the ORIGINAL foundations. So they look a little worse for wear, and he is aware of that. We told him about 3 months ago the tub needed to be recaulked even though 6 months prior he had done it. But he said he wanted to wait until we didn’t need to use for 5 days or so. So I’m guessing that’s why he didn’t do it when he found out we were leaving. We also told him he needed to spackle the walls because we stupidly hung our pictures with hangers. He said it was fine, he’d take a look and needed to repaint anyway.  He sounded like he was a little annoyed he had to do it.. even though he told us he’d be fixing things up either way. He was like “ugh.. like 20 small picture Frame holes?” And I said “I’m not sure how many, but we had pictures all over the house.” And he groaned and said ok he’d have to take a look. Like I’m not talking gaping holes. Imagine a small thumbtack sized hole, normal stuff that is an easy fix. When we left we cleaned everything up and we advised him he should probably update a lot of things because it’s really gross to have an original carpet in the bedroom, tub ect. We took pictures before we left and both my mom and dad agreed the apartment had normal wear and tear.

But it’s been a week since we left and rob has not contacted me back. I had inquired if he had done a walkthrough yet and nothing. I really want to ask when we will get the security deposit since we left 15 days before our lease was up. Which was fine because we had paid for it, so we thought we were doing him a favor by giving him 15 more days to fix things up and find a tenant. Should I call him again? He has our deposit in the bank, we know the money is there. He just hasn’t communicated to us when we will see it. 

Tldr; lease ended June 15th, left June 1st all paid up but don’t know when we will get our deposit back, landlord seemed like he didn’t want to fix up minor repairs and now won’t return my calls 1 week after we left",10Jun2018,1
241,"Hi! This problem is reoccurring and I’ve never asked for advice on this before but my relationships have all lasted a short while and I’m not sure if I’m the problem at this point. 

I’m 18 years old, I know I have a lot ahead of me but I want to try to solve this now before it just gets worse. 

For some details on my past relationships and why we broke up:
1st boyfriend: Ghosted me constantly, I broke up with him after a month
2nd: Cheated on me, broke up with him after 5 months
3rd: Not my type, broke up with him after 2 months
4th: Stole from family, broke up with him after 3 months
Present: It’s been 4 months, but I feel like it’s going a little downhill.

All these guys, I’ve only known for less than -6 months except the 4th one but I don’t think that matters.

In a relationship, I’m just a normal girlfriend who doesn’t cheat and high maintenance. I give a lot of attention; one major flaw is that I over analyze things *a lot*.

Anyway. I want to stop this stupid streak of 1-5 months, should I just stop in total? I’ve read somewhere that if i keep dating bad guy, I’m the problem.

248,"Hey Reddit. I've been debating posting something like this for a little while, and after last night I think I have to. I really hope no one who knows me sees this post because they'll probably know exactly who I am. First a little background info.

I'm a kid who's never really had friends. I've thought I had, but up until about a month ago, I never had friends that I enjoyed talking to, and talked to outside of school. Never been invited to anything outside of school accept for a few birthdays. Another thing about me which kinda sets up this post is that I develop feelings for people EXTREMELY fast, usually a day or 2 max. Oh also, I'm gay. 

I started playing Xbox with a few kids from my school about a month ago, and I think I'm friends with them (not completely sure yet, but that's a whole 'nother set of issues lmao). There's this one boy who I developed major feelings for, I've only felt this way about one other person, and I rarely talked to them. This person I talk to almost every day online  (they do go to my school but we have no classes together this year) so these feelings are definelty bigger than the last boy. This boy also seems to have a pretty flirty personality, like a lot of kids my age he don't mind making jokes or just saying things that make him sound gay and even though I'm pretty sure he's straight, but everytime he says something flirty it confuses me and it's makes me unnecessarily hopeful. This person I always friendly with me, but whenever we see eachother in real life it's just a quick Hey, or just a quick comment.  That's pretty much the whole story up until now, so the issue.

I notice that in general, not just with this guy, but with pretty much anytime I get close to someone (even as a friend, just more amplified with crushes) is that if they aren't talking with me when they could be (Example: Online on Xbox, but they aren't talking to me) I get a little sad and start questioning if they are my friend still or if they ever really liked me. Or if they are using me because I have something they want. Or more specific, playing with me because I'm good at the game and they want wins. I know it's unhealthy and that the whole world doesn't revolve around me but I just can't stop my mind from thinking illogically. The person I like I want to remain friends with because honestly they are one of the best friends I've had in years and I don't want to go back to being lonely and without friends. I just cannot keep my mind of of them and being jealous whenever they hang with someone else. I also want to deal with this problem now because It isn't just with this person (although amplified) it's just in general. If I don't I'm going to have it the rest of my life, and I know no potential parter wants to deal with a jealous partner who is always worrying.

So here are the things I need help with, each one I will take any help or stories that might help me. Thanks

• Developing feelings for anyone who shows me any attention 
• Jealousy/ feeling worthless to friends
• Any other issues you might see in what I wrote.",10Jun2018,1
249,"Hi all.

A few months ago a girl called Beth at my school attempted suicide. She was bullied pretty badly by a group of girls (guess you could call them the ''popular'' girls but IDK) and named some of them in her note. Thankfully she was unsuccessful and has gotten treatment and help and came back to school not too long ago, though she spends one-on-one time with a specialist who comes in to see her every day. Although I don't know Beth very well and barely spoke to her, I always regretted not sticking up for her against those girls, and have tried to make friends with her recently, though understandably she's keeping her distance from everyone. 

As for the girls who bullied her, they've pretty much had their popularity undone. They deserve that, but it's pretty strange that not too long ago most people in our year would happily join in with taunting her and would laugh at the things the girls said, but somehow when it went too far they all suddenly realises how ''disgusting'' what the girls did was, as though they didn't take part in it. 

That just is what it is, but a lot of people have started bullying the girls, especially Anna, who was the ''ringleader'' and the most vicious in bullying Beth. But this is a different kind of bullying. For example one of Anna's friends, Jess, has asthma and it's been hot lately so she was feeling unwell, but someone (they still don't know who) took her inhalers from her bag. Luckily they keep a spare one with the school nurse so she was OK.

Anna gets by far the worst treatment. She's had her seat pulled out from under her, gets things thrown at her in most lessons, and some girls shove her around in the corridors. In class the teachers seem to ignore anything that happens to her or her friends. The worst thing happened about a week ago, when some guys were playing football in the school field while Anna and her friends were nearby, and a guy kicked the ball hard. It hit Anna right in the face and broke her glasses, and she ran away in tears. There was no way that couldn't have been deliberate. 

I don't like Anna or her friends, but after what Beth went through I don't want to see anyone get bullied. I'm not saying they don't deserve to be punished for being cruel to Beth, but people are going out of their way to *hurt* them. The stunt with the inhaler could have gone badly wrong, and it's really low that someone would kick a ball into a girl's face. 

We have another year of school left and I've thought to myself that if I couldn't stick up for Beth then at least I could show some kindness to Anna and her friends. But then that might stop me from reaching out to Beth properly and being friends with her, something I think she needs. But I want to stop the girls from being bullied too.

Since being pregnant, I've noticed that he has a problem with everything I do. For example, my mum has been on my case about sorting out my room and decluttering to prepare for the baby and to get furniture in for him. This has taken me a lot longer than it would if I didn't have negative effects of pregnancy such as sciatica symptoms and round ligament pain, and he's always on my case about getting it done and last night I had to tell him I need time to breathe because of the pregnancy, only for him to kick off today because I offered to cook dinner for my mum and my sister as well as us.
Every other week he kicks off and says he's sick of everything and is just going to stay at university and not take the planned leave of absence we've applied for.
He's also constantly complaining about my mood swings and not really being understanding about it all that sometimes I can't control it.
I just don't know what to do about it because we have a good relationship and we're really close but recently we can't have conversations about certain things without it turning into an argument.

257,"First a little bit of backstory.
I've been raised all my life going to catholic church, taking part of all manner of activities and in nearly all of the events the catholic church has.
I walked away from it the year before I graduated high school (I think it's called sophomore year?), because I didn't like that my parents were attributing all my victories and failures to god, my mom got desperate, and tried really REALLY hard to force me to go to church, which made me nope out of there even harder, my dad was kinda chill throughout the whole deal, but he didn't try to help me much.
After a while, they kind of accepted it, were kind of sad every time they went to church and I didn't, but everything normalized.
Then I went to university and choked hard. I was a smart kid with good grades in high school but got really lazy in university and failed classes frequently.
I got over it, but I needed to change to a private university, parents and family expected I would get better grades, which I did, only for two years though.
Then, the situation I need help with happened. I failed yet another class, this time however, because I got overwhelmed and the class was way too hard for me. Even then, I almost passed, which sucked.
My family snapped: my uncle, my grandparents and my parents, because they thought I wouldn't fail anymore. And now they are in full fierce catholic mode. I can't talk to them without them mentioning I have to go to church or I will keep failing my entire life, and they are being really aggresive about it, I can't even study at home anymore because someone always comes and starts talking about how I need God and how I need to go to church or I'll lose everything.
I just want everything to go back to normal, I want them to go back to accepting my non-religiousness and be civil about it. But right now I don't know how to make them stop.",10Jun2018,1

After graduation, my parents purchased me a rather expensive (close to $100,000 MSRP) vehicle as a congratulations present.

I must drive to my campus as it is approximately 30 minutes away from my current residence. Is there any way I can work around this? The body panels are fiberglass, and therefore not magnetic (as I was originally planning to make a magnet out of the sticker).

Should I note down how I feel and stuff before the appointment and show the doctor? Or do I tell the doctor everything when I'm there.  It's really bad and is effecting my life. I have no job and I'm just not happy.

265,"Hi Guys!
well,the original plan was that me and my gf would go away from this hell of a country(Ir..an),and go try to make it in the EU,with a liberal and athiest mindset it's not really the easiest thing living in a religious right winged country with much restrictions,because Poland and Czech republic have very affordable universities(and cities) we figured out they would be nice locations for us,now,my question is,if you live or have studied or do study in one these countries,could you  help us make a decision?I have never visited neither,I've been to France and Italy and Austria in the EU but seems like they would be impossible to get a VISA to from our country,so I have no idea how they are,PLEASE help us,

(just FYI,we are on a clock because it would be best if we could get out for this semester)
Another FYI,she is fine but if i leave the country i wont be able to come back again,so it's exit and no come back for me,please help me out.Thanks",10Jun2018,1
266,Hello reddit! First time posting. I need your advice. Im 17 and doing part time job on weekends (waiter) and my boss recently hired a new waiter and she has been playing on my nerves. She is always annoyed and looks for every mistake i make. Its been getting worse and worse today it was raining so we didnt get many customers so i was bored. She was cleaning some glasses and i wanted to help her so i took the straws out of the glasses so she could clean them faster and she almost killed me for that. Should i talk to my boss or should i just keep cool and try to ignore her? Thanks,10Jun2018,1

269,"So I can already here the answer “don’t quit your job if you other job is a temp job”, however there is more information.


So I recently graduated and have been looking for a job in the IT field and found a summer temp job that ends at the end of July. The thing is though, the head of IT keeps telling me about a position that will be opening up at the end of summer. He even brought it up in the interview. Every time I talk to him he seems to bring it up and the job is exactly what I’m looking for.

So since it’s a temp job I decided I’d keep on my shitty, stressful retail job on the weekends. So I’m working 60 hours a week when I really don’t need to be. My bills are minimal so I’m really just doing it cause it’s just the situation I’m in. 

My main reason for wanting to quit is just the amount of stress I’m feeling. I get one day off a week and all of my day off requests for my retail job are promptly denied no matter what. 


I’m just trying to get some outside perspective to help me decide. I’m currently sitting on my two weeks notice paper and don’t know if I should turn it in or not.


Thanks for any advice.

271,"No family is perfect I know that but I’ve noticed my family isn’t the definition of normal that other teens have, when I was younger i was hit or pinched for punishment and my elder sister was slapped. It all stopped when one my parents hit me with a whip, they cried and it left a mark. They never apologized and I was never hit again. They would only threaten us, which worked just as well.  As I grew up I noticed my parents were different, they would be so violent and yell one minute then shower us in kisses and hugs.
They think that buying us everything we want is gonna make us feel better, I won’t lie it made me happy for a moment but it’s not the same as having the love of parents. I was basically raised by my older sister, I consider her as another mom. I won’t lie I’ve caused my parents stress due to my selfish acts, and things I say. But I know one time my family took it too far, we were leaving our apartment when the door slammed in my toe. It hurt and I told my parent, they said “that shouldn’t cause you use to cut yourself, wouldn’t that hurt more”. After that my family brought up my self harm many times after that, and told teachers that I was on pills. I really didn’t want anyone to know. 
My parents kinda mock me, they’ve bought me so much piercings, a laptop, clothes. They kinda use it as a way to bring my self a steam down, I don’t know if it’s on purpose. They would say “others moms wouldn’t let you get piercings aren’t you happy?” “I spend 110$ on that stupid crap of yours” Everything is based around money, I use to earn my share of money on filming. Then I stopped and wanted to do my passion of art, my parents criticized me saying if I kept going we would be rich. Or why would I stop cause I was making money. 
My father does drink, he and my sisters husband would say some hurtful things when they’re drunk but never touch me. I know they don’t mean it. My mom kinda pushes they to by drinks, then criticize them for drinking. It’s confusing I know. Sometimes I wish I was my older sisters daughter, I cried once when I saw her happy family. And for once in my life I was jealous of my nephew, but I know he has a amazing mum.
I’m complicated, sometimes I feel perfectly fine. Happy with life, excited for the future. Then other times I would just flip to being suicidal, not being able to get myself out of bed. I do cut, and I’m taking pills for depression and OCD. And I know I should tell someone about this but I’m scared, I don’t want all this attention. No more doctors, no more questions, I feel like I’m being judged and everyone hates me. But my intrusive thoughts are so scary, what I i act on them. Im stressed even though I haven’t even gotten up yet. Sorry if this turned into a vent, please some advice would help. Thanks",10Jun2018,1
272,"Hi all. I am a recent male college graduate. While this step forward in life has been wholly positive, it has also brought about serious reflection about a few high school memories. Specifically, I have been deeply disturbed by three distinct memories of squeezing female friend's breasts without permission in high school as a 14\-16 year old Freshman and Sophomore. 

Each time involved a quick squeeze of one breast \- I say this not to excuse myself or minimize the act, but to give detailed context. I cannot understand why I would ever do something like that. I imagine I thought these were just mischievous or sneaky acts rather than heinous ones. I doubt I understood how much of a violation it was then, and again that is no excuse, but when I remember my high school self I do not otherwise see an inconsiderate, bad person, and I do not know how to reconcile those two things. 

My Freshman year of college, I went through a phase of extreme self\-hatred. I deal with intense daily OCD, and for most of that year I spent hours of each day working backwards from the idea that ""I am a bad person"", racking my brain/memory for evidence of this belief. Often I distorted or totally invented memories, but I was certain of these three grabs. I called one of these female friends and apologized tearfully at one point in the year. She at first did not remember what I was talking about, but was extremely understanding, accepted my apology, and assured me it was not something she thought about or that colored her perception of me. 

The other two friends I am no longer in contact with, but I want badly to reach out and apologize. I have often thought about sending a private Facebook message, but have found myself discouraged. I wonder whether they would be unsettled by my contacting them out of the blue. I am sometimes paranoid that they will screenshot my apology, although I recognize that that is probably paranoid and that even if they did and posted it, perhaps that would only be fair. 

In college, I became very sensitive/scrutinizing about any physical contact, and largely avoided it. If I threw my arm around a female friend as we were walking to a party, my OCD would blow it up into some kind of physical boundary\-crossing. I also felt an extreme responsibility for female friends who were drinking (as many men do), and countless times made sure a too\-drunk friend got home safe whether I had been with hanging out with them or not, or obsessed over whether someone might need my help. A couple times I intervened when I thought a female friend was at risk of being taken advantage of. I see the level of attentiveness and concern I had, and how neurotic/hypervigilant I was about the possibility of someone being sexually assaulted, and I just don't understand how I ever could have been so thoughtless before. 

Basically, I would be grateful firstly for any advice on how to make amends/apologize to these two high school friends. Otherwise, I would appreciate any thoughts on how these memories should inform my perception of myself. Do they make me a uniquely bad person, and if so, is my self\-loathing appropriate? Should they permanently change how I view my own morality? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. ",10Jun2018,1

276,"I was told my entire childhood that I was a very smart child. I did very well and began to think I was smart until secondary school. I came across people who were smarter, more hardworking and extraordinary than I could ever be and I became so depressed I stopped taking care of myself. I lost all sense of self worth and confidence. 

I don't want to be subpar anymore. I don't want to be average. I know that I'm a fast learner, but I never learned how to use this to my advantage. I got good grades and that's it. 

Now that I am entering university next year I want to get back on top. I used to be an avid reader. I read up to 40 books a year at one point. Since entering high school I spent less time reading and pursing hobbies to lie in bed and watch youtube all day. To remedy this, I reserved about 60 books that I want to finish by next February. I've even began to pick up landscape drawing as a hobby. I spent my entire time in school chasing the achievements of others, I didn't realize that I was holding myself back. I want to be the old me again, who knew so much and was interested in history and loved reading about trains and learning languages and filling my mind to the brim with knowledge. 

I've begun to doubt myself again though. I know that not everyone can be extraordinarily intelligent or talented and I'm not trying to say that I am either. My question is, was I ever really intelligent to begin with? What if I had always been subpar but just had a headstart earlier in life? I wonder now if I have reached my limits when it comes to how Intelligent I am. Nowadays people don't expect much of me. I know I'm not important, but I thought that the one thing I had going for me was my brains, but my peers who were once considered my equals have surpassed me in every single way. 

Can I ever be incredibly intelligent?",10Jun2018,2

278,"Hey everyone! 

I'm going to start by saying that if you're reading this I hope you're doing well and are having a really good day. I apologize that this post is long but if you could read through the whole thing so that you understand the situation then I would really appreciate it! 

So as the title says, I have a friend who is currently struggling with severe depression. I care very much about her and am very concerned for her well-being. I met this person over two years ago at a social event, but this was the only time I ever saw her in person as we live quite far from each other and have different lifestyles. But we have kept in contact through frequent text messages nearly every day for the past two years. 

Over that time, she has told me a lot about herself, and unfortunately she is not in a good place right now. Mainly this is because she is grieving over the loss of her grandfather. Now, her grandfather passed away in March of 2014... and ever since then she has not been able to shake the sense of grief and loss. This has led to a horrible depression and she says she feels sad every day. I'm not sure what else exactly is contributing to the depression but I suspect there are more things. 

Now here's the thing... this person has a pretty serious disability that limits her in various ways (I believe it may be Down's Syndrome but she has never openly discussed it so I don't want to assume anything). She is 30 years old, yet not able to live on her own or really take care of herself on her own. She also is not very good with communicating with others and this limits her further. But the main problem seems to be that she feels she lives in a very unsupportive environment with people that do not understand her emotional needs. 

She herself has expressed that she wants to get help for her depression, but she has no idea how to go about it and it is not something she would be able to do on her own, which is a problem since those she lives with seem not to understand her needs.

I'm at a loss for what to do to help my friend. I care about her so much and I'm so sad that she has to keep living like this. I just want to help her in any way that I can, as limited as I may be from where I am. Does anyone have any advice for what I can do or who I can contact to get some help? If you would like more details please feel free to message me or just ask here.

281,"My first semester of college, I got drunk pretty much every weekend. My GPA of 3.4 that semester reflected that. After that, I decided to sober up and stay away from alcohol so I could get my grades up. This past semester I got a 3.95. 

So, when I started this summer session, I decided to start to ease myself back into drinking again because pretty much all of the people in my friend circle drink in order to become more social. 

But as far as I know, I’m a *horrible* drunk. Like a terrible person drunk. I get drunk easily, so after 6 shots, I become a whole new person.

To give you an idea of what I am like drunk. Last night I choked a guy for pronouncing my name wrong, nearly broke my phone six times and punched a hole in the wall. And according to my close friends, I’m a total asshole drunk, like Archer-esque asshole without the womanizing. I become over-emotional, easily-angered, and overly passionate. 

My friends on the other hand seem to be skilled at controlling themselves while drunk. Alcohol makes them more friendly, nicer, and overall better people to hang around with. 

Keep in mind that sober, I’m a pretty normal friendly human being. 

Why is this and how can I become a better drunk person?

At school I get picked on by all the popular lot, sometimes they are nice to me, but mostly they call me names such as ""emo boy"" and ""faggot"" as I have long hair and don't go out drinking every weekend. This month has been exam season, and it's been the worst time of my life. Everyday I told myself I would revise, but it never happens. I revised the night before every exam and it was a huge mistake. I'm embarrassed and ashamed, and so will my parents be on results day. Outside of school I pretty much do nothing, I go out the odd times but mostly stay in everyday doing nothing be on my computer. Me and my mum are not very close anymore, shes sick of me being anti\-social and never going to family gatherings. I got to ""CAMS"", a mental health clinic for children. I have to speak to this women about OCD and intrusive thoughts, as she believes I have both, and now she wants me to have CBT therapy. I don't even want to go anymore, it's just a questionnaire each session which destroys as I need to tell her everything that is going off in my life. So in the future I will be expecting my parents to be sick and embarrassed of me as I will no doubt need to re\-do my exams and I will still be doing nothing with my life. I want this to change. I want a fresh start, but I dont know how to. This is the reason I came here, my life's a mess and I want advice.

291,"I'm a student at a small college and I have really bad social anxiety. There is this girl who works at the coffee shop in the school. I work at the school as well so we cross paths a lot whenever we are working at the same time. I kinda got a little crush on her at the beginning of this quarter, like the kind you get on people that you've never talked to. I have been wanting to talk to her since the beginning of this quarter, but like I said, I have social anxiety and it was very difficult. Last Thursday, after probably 2 months hyping myself up and then backing out every time I saw her, I finally went and talked to her. She was sitting alone in the common area (not working) and on Thursday there were 5 days left in this quarter so I thought ""You better do it or you may never get to."" It was just basic small talk, but she didn't seem annoyed or uninterested. After probably 20 minutes a bunch of her friends came over (probably 6) which reversed any lessening of my anxiety. I was with them for probably an hour total, but after her friends came, it was mostly me sitting there like a really tense idiot. The group thing split because she had to start work and when she was leaving she said to me ""Hey, I liked talking to you. I'm closing tonight, so I think I'll see you later."" From that I was feeling really good. Even though I didn't talk much, her comment made me feel like it went really well.

Ok, so later on that day while I was working I was thinking about how little time is left in the quarter and I didn't know when I would talk to her again. I was worried that I wouldn't talk to her before the quarter ends and I really wanted to get contact information for summer. I decided that I would ask for her phone number after I finished working because even though it was kind of soon, I felt like our previous conversation went well and I knew that I would probably never have the courage to ask again. So I finish working (now about 6 hours after our conversation ended) and she was still working and the coffee shop, so I go to ""order a coffee"". I ask her what kind she recommends and make stupid small talk. We talk while she making the coffee so for a few minutes. Then she gives me the coffee and I go to shoot my shot, keep in mind that I have crippling social anxiety when creating your mental image of this. I say in my super nervous, high pitched, trembling voice: ""sooo I really liked talking to you today and the quarter is close to ending.. I was wondering if maybe I could get your phone number..."" and then right after I said that, it's hard to describe but I felt the imminent rejection in the air and I saw it in her eyes, so after that 1 or 2 second pause I quickly added ""If you don't want to that cool, thats ok, I don't know, I was just wondering"" in my trembling, nervous voice. She kind of cracked like a small smile when I first asked for the phone number which I'm still super confused about, but then she responds ""I don't usually give out my phone number, I'm sorry."" and then she says ""You can still feel free to say hi and stuff though"" or something along those lines it's really hard to remember because I was so anxious. So then I respond ""Oh yeah, thats fine, thats ok. never mind"" and I nervously shuffle away probably all red. 

She doesn't come in to school on Fridays, so I haven't seen her since then. As you can tell, I'm not the best with people so basically I'm super confused on what this means. As a person who has common sense, I know that there aren't people who don't give out there phone number because whats the point of having a phone; what she really means is 'I don't give my phone number to you.' So now I'm trying to figure out does this mean I misread the signs and she's being nice but has no interest in knowing me, does she just want to know me better and maybe had bad experience in the past, was she trying to get me to push for it, I don't know I'm doing a big confusion. What does you can still say hi mean? As a barista does she get hit on all the time and I'm just another idiot, but I talked to her first when she was not working. I think she is going to be there tomorrow and I'm confused about what to do. Do I accept defeat and give up? Do I make myself visible but not initiate conversation and see if she does? Do I pretend like nothing happened and try to talk to her again when she isn't working? Except another thing too is that the rejection\-ish thing basically brought back 110&amp;#37; of my original anxiety about talking to her, so even if I wanted to act like nothing happened I don't think I would be able to convince myself to talk to her again. 

Im pretty sure it was very obvious how anxious I was while talking to her. If I don't start a conversation and sit alone doing work like usual, do you think she might think that I don't want to talk to her. Or will she assume that I am anxious about taking to her because of how anxious I was before? If she really had any interest why would she decline a phone number?

**TLDR:** It would make more sense with all the context but basically. I have social anxiety and there's a girl at my college I hadn't talked to before that I got like a stranger crush on. After backing out for most of the quarter I finally talked to her last Thursday, I read it as going very well and she said she liked talking to me. I was worried about the quarter ending in a few days, so later on the same day when I talked to her for the first time I asked for her phone number (while showing obvious signs of social anxiety). She responds ""I don't usually give out my phone number."" What does this mean, what do I do, pls help.",10Jun2018,1

296,"About 5 months ago a single guy in his mid\-30s moved into the apartment below my bf and I. Then, about 3 months ago, we got a note on our front door from management that we'd had a noise complaint about us ""walking too loudly"".

We still tried to be a little quieter if possible but there wasn't much we could do as it wasn't like we had been stomping/jumping around to begin with.

My bf answered and a polite conversation ensued with the neighbor explaining that he could hear squeaking when we walked around and if we could please try to avoid that. My bf told him we'd try but there wasn't much we could do about the floors being squeaky. Since then, we've identified a few squeaky spots on the floor that we try to avoid (especially at night) but that's pretty much it. We've heard banging on the floor from him 2 more times but that's it.

Cut to last night my bf and I were smoking weed on our balcony (2nd time we've done so ever, first time was 2 weeks ago). Weed is legal in our state but we live in a non\-smoking apartment complex. We heard our downstairs neighbor's patio door close so we assume he smelled the smoke and he probably could tell it was coming from us. At that point, we both agreed that we won't smoke here anymore.

Then, this morning we pulled into a parking spot that was facing his kitchen window. I saw a glint and looked up just in time to see his phone ducking down out of view as if he was crouched below the window taking a picture of us. Then, both my bf and I saw him stand up a bit to peek if we were still there and then duck down again when he saw us. 

We aren't really concerned about him reporting us for smoking but we are concerned that he's trying to take pictures of us, even if we're just going about our normal business. Should we do anything about this now or wait and see if anything else happens?

TLDR; Downstairs neighbor already dislikes us for making noise we can't really control. May have caught us smoking weed on our balcony. Next day he's sneaking pictures of us in our car. ",10Jun2018,1

The girl I love we have been together for 2 years now, has a 3 year old daughter and is currently living at her mom's house. Her mom is crazy and beat her growing up and she will scream at her and tell her how big of a piece of shit she is. (She's not) she will barge into her room while her and her daughter are trying to sleep and start screaming things that don't even make since. Her mom let's the 3 dogs shit all over the house and her mom won't let them pick it up. It's not a suitable living situation for her or her child. She was just approved for a house and is supposed to close on it next month. She does have a pretty good job but needs to pay to keep her child in daycare. And she also needs to come up with just over 3k for the closing and inspection. And she will not be able to make this happen unless she agrees to sleep with this guy that offered to pay for everything but she has to stay at his house for 10 nights and he gets to do anything he wants to her. I don't know what to do. I want to help her and I can try my best to come up with some of the money but I definitely can't come up with over 3k In a month. I love her so much and don't want to see this happen but she definitely can't stay there. And I'm currently living with my parents that will not allow her to stay here. I'm so devastated thinking that some older guy is going to be doing god knows what to her for 10 days. And there is nothing I can do to help..",10Jun2018,1
299,"Hey everyone 

Can i ask anyone who has experienced in running/organizing a group or some sort for your advice/help please? Because i am thinking of starting up a meetup group for young people age 18 to 30 years old in East Sussex for Bexhill(where i live) and Hastings.

In the meetup group we will hopefully be meeting every week or every 2 weeks a least and we will doing fun things/activities like bowling, going to the cinema or theatre, Seeing live entertainment or music at a venue, Going to the pub or having a meal at a restaurant, Physical activities(Hikes, Rock Climbing, etc), Going on adventures(day trips) and lots lots more.

I am 23 years old and since moving to Bexhill in East Sussex 2 years ago i haven't really made any proper friends here mainly it has been really really hard because of my anxiety and shyness but once you get to know me i am a talkative and really fun person and in Bexhill/Hastings there are no clubs/groups my age for people like me and the locial Scouts network groups for 18 to 25 years olds only meet up once every 2/4 months.

And Just to say that my group won't be on the Meetup website, I will be having my Meetup group on Facebook(groups) as I can't afford to pay a subscription fee on Meetup but hopefully in the future if my group does well and getting a lots of members then I will most probably expand it on to Meetup as well but I am not too sure if it's a good idea just having my Meetup group on Facebook though. 🤔

I am sure there is quite a few people on here who has had experienced running/organizing a Meetup group or a group on Facebook.

What good advice would you give me?? What should my 1st meet up should be?? How did you get people to join your group and go to your meet ups?? Did you advertise your group?? How often should i arrange meet ups? 🤔🤔

I am a complete newbie at this haha. 😃",10Jun2018,1

302,"I’m 19, but my birthdays later this month so i’ll be 20. i’m a female. this is a new account by the way, but it’s not really a throwaway because I used my real email. I don’t have a regular reddit account, I normally just browse without an account but i wanted to post. so here I am 

my situation is pretty shitty, I’m disabled (I have me/cfs, fibromyalgia, and severe migraines) and my disabilities affect me physically and cognitively, so it prevents me from being able to work. I am homebound, which means I never leave the house. some days I can’t even get out of bed and I will sleep for like 3 days and wake up still fatigued. I have a ton of other symptoms daily as well but I want to keep this short. my parents wanted me to either get government assistance or leave because they don’t want to support me anymore. and I get it because my doctors appointments and treatments and test are expensive. but I was unable to fill out the paper work necessary for SSI and had to take back my application. my family could have helped me with the paperwork, but they did not want to. I now found out that i could’ve found someone at the social security office to help me, but even that isn’t very helpful because it’s very hard for me to leave the house and then waiting in line for hours is hard on me as well. my parents mostly wanted me to get medicaid, which is so much easier after you get approved for disability, but i could’ve still gotten it anyway but my parents make way too much money and since I live with them they wouldn’t give it to me. so my parents don’t want me here anymore, i think it’s mostly cause they’re trying to buy a house and save money. but I have no where to go, I have no friends, no contact with anyone where I live because I’m homebound and have no energy for friends or anything like that.. and then I don’t have any other family either. I do have a car though, but it basically on empty and I only have $20. it’s hot where I live. I could go to shelters, but they only allow you to be there from like 8pm to 6am, and I can sleep for hours and hours and be unable to wake up. so I may not even be able to make the times. it also worries me because i’d have to park my car somewhere and I will have valuables/personal info inside of it. leaving and going would be a lot of work for me too. I also have a lot of medications that I take which I’m good on for 1-3 months but idk what i’ll do after. this is just all a lot and it doesn’t see how it will be possible for me at all. it seems like I should just kill myself because I’m really a waste of life anyway. I don’t have any reason to live. my last option/hope is to try and find someone on craigslist who would let me stay with them for free but that is so iffy like I would want it to be an old lady who’s just got a kind heart. then while I stay there I can try to apply for everything I need. but of course it’s mostly shady ass weird men on craigslist and I don’t want to be exploited. so idk what to do anymore

303,"Hi reddit,

So I've got myself into a bit of a pickle and I recognize it's fully my own fault. My Asian girlfriend, who doesn't live in the same country as me, is pregnant. 

She has been visiting me in my country for two months; she had a period in May and then nothing in June. Her pregnancy was confirmed yesterday. 

I'm at a loss on what to do. Since we live on the other side of the planet to each other, logistics are a bit fucked. How can I take care of this child? 

I don't even feel excitement at the pregnancy if I'm being totally honest. I've suffered from bad anxiety all through my 20s and I can barely look after myself, let alone a baby. I know it's my own doing though so I don't want to turn my back on my girlfriend and baby and neglect my responsibilities. 

What makes this even trickier is that I had been planning on ending the relationship. I am not sure how to proceed though. If the relationship ends, is it enough to support my child financially while my girlfriend brings the kid up? 

The other option is to uproot and move to her country to help take care of the kid, but that would involve the unlikely scenario of being able to find a job in her country that pays well (developing nation). 


Just looking for any modicum of advice because I'm a bit all over the place thinking about how to handle this. ",10Jun2018,1

Coincidentally, I met this girl a few weeks later. Her and her friends have mutual friends with my friends, but I really only got super close with with two of them. We created a chat and hang out a lot, with her initiating a lot of the conversation and the hangouts. It has gradually moved to a lot of just us two talking and hanging out with the other three on the outside. From this, I have really developed a crush on this girl. She makes me happy and I get goosebumps every time I see her. However, I do have severe anxiety and depression and have not really been able to work up the courage to ask her out. A lot of my friends have pulled me aside and said they really have noticed the chemistry between us.  She is very single and does not really go out and is always mentioning that she wants someone to take her out. I am away for the summer and did not think that asking her out then would be a good idea (aka I was too nervous), but anyway she and the other friend wanted to FaceTime me today so we did and they brought up that we should all get an apartment together. My initial reaction was excitement because I love every minute I spend with her, but of course anxiety set in and now I am all worried. Definitely leaning towards a no because i think 1) this could be a big friend zone thing 2) what if I tell her how I feel and she says no-- awkward 3) Say it does not work out, it would be incredibly awkward to bring others over.

-i make a lot of landscape paintings based on photography, one painting that i gave to her apparently resembles paintings that her spiritualist friends have made about some great spiritualist event called The Event.

Please refer to this link to know about the cost of living here: [https://www.numbeo.com/cost\-of\-living/country\_result.jsp?country=Malta](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Malta).

I currently work a full\-time job 8 hours per day, five days per week, and earn 5 euros per hour/800 euros per month (I know it may seems crazy to people living in other countries, but it's roughly what most people make here...). The rents are really expensive, and I am paying 210 euros per month for a shared room (including the utilities).

These are my expenses:

\- Rent: 210 euros per month.

\- Transportation: 26 euros per month.

\- Food and beverage: 140 euros per month.

\- Cigarettes: 80 euros per month. 

I am not even considering other expenses \- such as hanging out with friends or taking a girl somewhere nice \- at the moment 'cause I can't really afford them.

This leaves me with 344 euros of savings per month, or 4128 per year. Of course, I can't really plan anything with them, and I really *do* need to plan stuff at this stage... but:

\- ~~I can get another full\-time (earning other 800 euros/month) or a part\-time job (earning other 400 euros/month). This would leave me with 8 (first job) \- 8/4 (second job) \- 6 (sleep) \- 2 (transportation, showers, launches and dinners) = 0 or 4 free hours per day.~~ Of course, I can't plan to get a better life with 0 hours to work on it, and I will be too tired anyway if I had 4.  This is not an option.

\- I know programming and can work as a freelancer (I did this before). Attempting to land a position is not an option because I dropped out of school and nobody seems interested in me at the moment. Doing the paperwork costs around 1000 euros.

\- I have done an interview with a good company for a very good paying position. I didn't pass because I lack a single certification. I can acquire it with 800 euros and try again (they suggested me to do it).

I am completely lost. What should I do? My bank won't give me a loan, nor I have parents which can support me. I don't want to borrow money from other people without knowing if I can pay them back.

This is something I struggle with to tell people around me, only the closest ones know, simply because I'm embarrassed and it’s an extremely sore topic for me.

I got a friend a few months ago, we told each other everything, and eventually I chose to tell him about what happened to me. He was incredibly supportive.

Eventually, I noticed that I couldn’t handle him anymore, he simply ruined me. He has personality disorders he can not control and I became somehow his ""punching bag"". He made me cry every day, and eventually I chose to stop talking with him.

Today we talked again. He chose to scream at me in front of a whole group of people, saying that I was beaten by my ex, that it was not a bad thing and that I deserved it. Everyone laughed, nobody took my side. There was also more that was said, but I chose to leave.

I'm crying and crying now, I can not stop. I do not understand that anyone can be so numb. I wonder if this is normal? I don’t understand, I had never managed to do anything like that. This is a stupid post, but I need to hear the truth, while I can afford to cope with such future situations. Because now I'm terrified and will never tell anyone something so personal again.",10Jun2018,7
332,"Honestly I don't know what's wrong with me. I get depressed over ridiculously things sometimes nothing at all, and sometimes I don't get depressed over things that I realistic should. It's not like I have a terrible life or I'm being bullied. I stay inside pretty much all the time unless it's going to school or going over to a relatives house. I get angry over the most ridiculous things and don't get angry over things most people do. I hate myself. I'm scared of the most petty things imaginable. Never had a girlfriend or even attempted to get one because I pretty much know the outcome. Literally do nothing with my life because I'm scared of others opinions on me and I want to do so much but can't bring myself to do anything. This only a handful of things but I can't really put into words the other problems I have. Any advice would be appreciated",10Jun2018,1
333,"Hello all,

I don't wanna take much of your time. But I have been suffering, and I mean it, literally suffering from what I will be explaining below (sorry for the long text, but I need to explain everything).

It all goes back to 2014, 4 years ago. It was senior year. I was graduating from University, got the job of my dreams in line, and couldn't care less about anything less. Was partying hard every day, enjoying my time, and scouting for girls left and right. That's when I become real close friends with a girl, a girl who was my childhood love. But innocently, she was just my friend 4 years ago, and I never saw her as a ""Bluefin Tuna"".

We used to go out together, have dinner together, go on cruises together, and most importantly party hard together. Get drunk together, spend the nights together, munch on food together, but never got intimate like Mcgreggor and Mayweather. (apologies for the metaphor, but felt that I should rhyme something in here).

During this time, I was dating girls, hitting on others, while she was always around. Sometimes she'd poke me, other times she'd just come close to me, but I was always oblivious to what was going in her mind (or at least I'd like to think so). 

She got accepted in her master's program in Europe, and my I was moving to a Middle Eastern country. To compensate for the time we'd be spending away from each other, we went out even more often, went on cruises almost every day, until that night happened. And oh I do love it, and hate it at the same time!

That night we got so drunk. We kissed so hard, so passionately. We hugged intimately. I was surprised. I felt something weirdly amazing. I did not care about any other girl during that night. As if I had been wanting her for ages. Clueless, oblivious, I could not stop kissing her. And we did kiss throughout the night. We went on to drunkenly munch on food. I walked her home, expecting a good night kiss, which never even happened. 

I woke up the next day, confused, lost, but feeling in love. I called her, expecting to see her. But she did not reply. I texted her, telling her I wanted to see her, and here to my surprise, she told me she is meeting me... With her sister.

Of course, I did not mind that. I wanted to see her. I wanted to talk about what happened, but not thinking about getting together. I knew for a fact that long distance is a bitch, and I did not want to ruin my relationship with her. I just wanted some clarification, wanted to understand what happened. But we never talked about it. I traveled, and she traveled. And that night's fairy tale, was lost forever. Or so I thought!

We rarely texted afterwards. Almost never talked. But we somehow managed to make trip plans to Berlin, where we spent 4 days together, in the same room, sleeping next to each other. We did not even touch, nor talked about that night. We just enjoyed our time together. I desperately wanted to kiss her. But I could not make a move. I could not even talk about that night. That night that I despicably adore!

That trip made me fall even more for her. It was so perfect, so amazing... So much fun.

I flew back to the country I reside in, and she went back to her master's worries.

I started dating a girl, and she started dating a guy. One year into my relationship, I passed by Paris, and she was there. We went out for a drink, or ten, I don't quite remember. I felt that I had to say it, tell her I loved her, tell her I cannot stop thinking about her. And so did I. I told her I felt something for her, since that kiss, my feelings for her have changed. She's become someone I look up to, someone I want to be with, someone I want to sacrifice for. She kissed me, we hugged, we kissed again, and we hugged again. I went to her place, we spooned, kissed once, and I flew back to my country of residence first thing in the morning. Never to talk about what happened again.

Don't get me wrong. I was broken up with my then girlfriend, and I would never cheat on her, especially that I loved her, or so I thought. But I knew I could never be with her. I loved my then girlfriend for two and a half years. But I could never, ever forget about that night, that trip. And so I had to put an end to my relationship, blaming it on things that I did, things that she did, but never on the fact that I loved another girl.

Now, it has been a while since I last saw her, we rarely have private conversations, but we often talk on a Whatsapp group (between her, me, and a mutual friend, let's call her Jamie). I do so because I want to hear her stories, show her I am still there, and I still care. She initiates conversations often on the group, some of them generally asking about how everyone is doing, some of them asking me questions about things.

That girl is the sister of my brother's wife. She been in my life for years, more than 15 years. I feel that she's part of my life.

I cannot be with her currently, or at least try to be with her, as I do not believe in long distance!

She initiated a trip on the group, and I saw myself saying yes to that trip without even thinking about it. We are going, and Jamie is joining as well. I do not know how to act over there. Whether I have to say something, try to talk to her. I have no clue how to act. 

I just want to tell her that it started out with a kiss, how the hell did it end up like this? I am lost, I am hurt, I am unhappy, I am sad, and do not know what to do! Any advice is appreciated...",10Jun2018,2
334,"Everything lately stresses me out. I was told that it could be a side effect of my IUD, I have a skyla IUD. I used to live with my step sister and they aren't really all that well off, but I'd see her posting on Facebook about all these trips they're taking with her kids and nieces and nephews, and it not only makes me angry that she's wasting money that she doesn't have, it just gives me anxiety in general because she wasn't the nicest to me when I lived up there. (By that I mean I had a panic attack in Wal-Mart because I knew she would scream at me for buying something from the great value brand, she's an angry alcoholic). Any time i post about being unhappy about anything, my step sister comments with something along the lines of ""just deal with it"". Also, I have a friend that I've known since 6th grade (I'm 22) that has been posting a lot of political stuff lately, and seeing politics constantly also stresses me out. I've been torn between just trying to ignore it or unfriending her so I don't have to see it.

339,"I know it sounds stupid but for some reason, when I want to do something, I just don't do it. When I know something would be good for me, I do something else. For example, I have allergies, and sometimes it gets pretty bad, and I know that if I take the antihistamine I'll get better. The fucking thing is in front of me, I just have to reach for it and take it. But for some reason, I don't understand why, I don't do it. Another example, I love reading, I really really like reading, but I only do it like a couple of times a week. I have the time to do it, and sometimes I'm thinking I would really like to be reading right now, AND I COULD BE DOING IT, there's nothing stopping me, but I don't do it.

340,"Okay, I am a 19 yr old college student and my family life is pretty bad. I have two younger sisters, age 14 &amp; 9 and my parents have been separated for 4 years. 

My dad is not really that cooperative with child support and money support that goes towards my mothers rent and groceries for the kids. He works full time and is irresponsible with his spending and responsibilities. On top of this, he is very controlling of my mother, my sisters and I. He also has a girlfriend that he spends too much time with. 

My mother has lyme disease and some form of bipolar disorder and works full time. She is a great mother but is often exhausted and overworked. Her job barely is enough to support us. (And while I have a job, I need to save my money for the upcoming semester of school.) 

The house my mother and sisters live in is very tiny due to the affordability and our shady landlord was willing to rent to anyone. My mothers bad credit and lack of money don't allow for her to move. To help pay for rent, she would do odd jobs for our landlord but as she got promoted she couldn't anymore. This caused him to raise rent and charge her for late rent, that she obviously couldn't afford. 

I have a job as I said, but I can't drive and am still treated as a 14 year old child by both my parents. So my question to you reddit is what can I do to help my family situation while I am home from school? ",10Jun2018,2

346,"...who ive been in love with for about 6 years now. We were really good friends at one point but about 3 years ago we had a massive argument (i thought he lied to me to try get me to sleep with him), and haven't been friends since. I know at points he was interested in me (he has asked me out before, but there were always reasons for me to say no - self-conscious, didn't wanna be a rebound, etc), but i have no idea if there is any attraction left on his part. The thing is school is gonna be over in a couple of weeks and i will never see him again. I dont know wether to 'shoot my shot' or not. I know it seems like the obvious answer to just give it a go, but when i have with him in the past its ended badly - for example one time he responded by saying he fancied my best friend of the time and proceeded to ask her out the same day, they dated for a while. I also don't know if he's still with his very blonde very skinny girlfriend who is older, or not. Even if he has, I am by no means fat but i wouldn't be described as skinny, also i am brunette, so i don't know if im still his type. I think i catch him looking at me sometimes but maybe it's just wishful thinking? How do i proceed? I'm not confident enough to just go ask him out, because i dont want to be humiliated. I also dont know if he's still angry over the argument. And ANOTHER thing, about a year ago he made out with my friend, who has since become one of my best friends. He isnt typically the nicest guy in the world, alot of people dont like him because he can be quite rude but i know he's the only one for me. Thats not to say i dont think i'll never fall in love again, but i do think i could regret not giving it my all for the rest of my life.

353,"I'm 25, male. I don't want a relationship for many reasons (way too long to list)but one simple reason is because honestly do not think I meet the numerous qualifications required in order to have such a privilege. It's like applying for jobs, a person needs a minimum requirement and I do not fit the profile right now. 

I don't know if there's something like a therapist, but not a therapist that I can just talk to but be intimate with. Just be in bed with, laugh and tell stories and talk about life and flirt, maybe go on a few dates. I have this innate need for female intimacy and attention; actually more of the emotional thing than sex. 

Sex I've only had once last year, zero this year. Relationships, never. However, in 2016 and before that I always had female attention and I honestly felt I didn't need either sex or a relationship. I worked around a lot of beautiful women and I'm comfortable being around (attractive) women, it's just that I didn't ever focus or try or want to get relationships or sex that much at the time. I was content enough just doing my own thing. But I'm no longer in such an environment.

I didn't think too much about it back then. But I'm 25 now, and it's different because I'm old now. I want to get into this new world of women and sex, and not want to be 30 or 35 by the time I start. I don't know where to go to meet women, or how to find someone who can fulfill my desires. I'm no longer in school or at my old job with all the beautiful women (tempting to go back though :/ to school or my old job)

Online dating is not working for many reasons (too long to list, I'm already typing a lot), and I don't know how to meet someone in real life who can give me what I want which really is just female attention. Making a girl laugh, seeing her smile, it's like a drug for me. 

The closest I can find is hiring an escort, possibly even cheaper than a therapist, but it's still super super expensive. It's simple, quick, and efficient on the sex part however I do not think 30 minutes or 60 minutes is even close to enough time. This is more for rich old men to be with a young 20 year old girl again. It's not meant for guys like me.",10Jun2018,1

356,"hey everyone, a bit of context

i’m 23, did my undergrad in arts (politics and literature, v generic). currently working in banking and hating life, my job is soul-crushing and doesn’t align with my interests or more importantly with my values. considering going back to uni to study a masters of environmental sustainability bc it’s what i’m most passionate about and it can open doors to roles in govt and NGOs and consulting on environmental sustainability which is where i’d love to go

been working full time for 6 months now and idk i’m just worried about stopping working to study fulltime. i won’t be able to continue my current job or any other role in the bank, have done some asking and only full time roles are available. so if i go back to uni i’d need to quit my current job and look for another part time job. i have enough savings to comfortably last 6 months.

but then again i feel like this would open doors and get me in the direction i want to get into, and the course is quite practical and has an internship component and industry connections which would help heaps with securing a full time job in the field after graduation.

i’m currently living at home (in australia, not uncommon at my age) but looking to move out in the next twelve months regardless

has anyone done something similar? or any advice?

i’m speaking to the masters coordinator tomorrow. she’s been emailing me heaps of resources the last fortnight which i think is a good sign - if she’s this invested in helping me decide if this is the right course for me then i think it bodes well for the way the course will be set up and tailored to students.",10Jun2018,2

All my other friends validated this decision to break up with him. I wasn't happy. Everyone knew that. Even his mom  questioned me, as to why I dated him. I was kind of hoping for you to express some empathy or understanding that he put me through some stuff. I deserved better and I should never been stalked or harassed by him. Additionally, I never wanted this decision to affect my friendship with you and your bro. If it is, just tell me. I didn't cheat, and I know M has accused me directly of that. If that got spread by him, I want to clear that kind of bs up now. Cus that's what it was...his BS. If he said anything else about me, I want you to tell me so I can clear it up. It sounds like you guys got a different perspective. I've felt isolated from you guys for awhile. It's been tough feeling that way. But I didn't want to stoke the drama M was creating.  I was hoping after a year it would be okay. I know you want to stay neutral but it's been really hard for me to deal with this on my own. I unblocked a person who wouldn't stop harassing and stalking me so that I could work on the friend group, and find out you guys think it all happened because I ""hurt him"".

364,"I'm going to be completely honest.

After some stuff happened with one of my closest friends (L), I started losing trust in EVERYONE in my life. And I'm saying, I went crazy  and possessive and shit. I tried my best to hold it in because I knew it was toxic but it did come out from time to time. So I resorted to being sneaky.

My other close friend (S) had given me her instagram password a long time ago to look at an argument she had. At that time I wasn't crazy and I immediately logged out like a good friend. And then around some time last year I realised even though I logged out my phone had still remembered her password and I could log in any time.

Now, I really liked S and I planned on replacing L because our friendship was getting very toxic on both sides. L and S hated each other and I secretly liked it at first because my logic was ""Yay, they can't ditch me for each other"" (please don't judge my screwed logic)

Then recently my friendship with Lyrics started getting better (i still didn't trust her tho) and I was happy and not crazy for a bit. Then I started seeing that L and S were getting really friendly. A little *too* friendly for my liking.  Now even though I really liked S, she had this reputation of being a real bitch and never being able to keep a friend. I ignored these rumours and came to really like her but then when I saw their friendliness I got extremely paranoid. 

This was when I logged into her account again and kept going through L's and S's conversation. It's been happening for about a month and I was trying to stop but I felt like they could betray me anytime now.

And then recently I came across a conversation between them.

They were talking about me. But in a good way. They were planning a surprise birthday for me. They were arguing  (in a jokey way) about who was a better best friend for me

And now I feel like a complete idiot. So I logged out of those accounts, I apologised to them about any crazy stuff I may have done without me realising. But I still feel really guilty. Is there any other way I can NOT be a bad person? I see clearly everything I did wrong.

I need to get over my trust issues and I need to make it up to them (they're not angry, I just feel really  guilty) and I need to stop being so controlling.

But on very different kinds of people. 
Like i go for completely different guys than girls. 

I go for girls i wouldn’t long term be with and guys that my mum would like as her son in law. 

Is that something you experience too?

How did you know you were bi?

Is there a i‘m much more into guys but sometimes i crush on strong women?
Especially when i’ve recently had terrible experiences dating guys (i‘m big chested and attract douchebags that like my tits more than me)

368,"I have always had issues with social interactions. In high school I “had” a big group of friends but they turned out to be a shitty group of people that would all hang out without me. I would text one and they would respond saying they were all together and I should come out too. But if I had never texted, they would have never invited me. 

This always got the best of me and I would eventually confront them about not liking me, which made me out to be very needy and clingy - which I was because I desperately wanted to have a true friend that cared about me without me trying so hard, but I was too needy to allow myself to be lonely when I realized these people weren’t truly my friends. 

Now, almost 6 years after graduating high school, I am in a generally better place. But I think this is because I am in a really great relationship with my fiancé and I’m not too worried about trying to find companionship. But he is now starting to hang out with a friend of his from high school, which is fine with me and I am invited to come along and make friends with him and his girl as well. But here is my problem: 

I don’t know how to be normal in an endearing way. I know this is very iamverysmart of me, but I just graduated with a bachelors in biology and all I’ve known for such a long time is learning about this stuff. When people say things that I have knowledge on, I desperately want to comment with my knowledge and sometimes it’s super hermione-granger-know-it-all and I’m very aware of it, and I hate that I don’t know how to interact in another way. So I stay pretty much silent and just listen to others interactions. 

I am good at being a normal person if alcohol becomes involved, but that is a very rare thing that we go out to drink with people. The thing that would happen if I went to hang out with my fiancé’s friends is that people would be smoking, which brings on a whole other level of sometimes anxiety, and sometimes embarrassment or self consciousness if I ever do get the courage to chime in and be a part of what is going on. I want to just be able to be a girl who interacts with people in a normal way and doesn’t seem like a know it all, and I definitely don’t want to default do the normal outgoing girl flirty thing that can happen.

371,"Hi all, in a situation that I feel kind of lost. I would like to see if anyone has any advice to my situation. 

I drove to Los Angeles from Texas for a pharmacy job. I don't have my California pharmacy license and found out that they will cancel my hiring process if I don't get it by June 22nd. I've contacted the board of pharmacy and they said it's maybe possible to get my license before 22nd, but may cut it close to the 22nd. 

So right now, I'm fortunate to have my parents with me until the 17th but after that I'm on my own. 

After they leave, I'm in an awkward situation, I don't want to sign a lease because I don't know if I'll have a job. I plan to find a hostel/Airbnb or ask my coworkers to see if they'll let me stay with them for a week 17th - 22nd until I can confirm I have a job. 

If I am able to get my license and continue working, I plan to look for more extended stays at Airbnb or hostel or maybe ask my coworkers for longer stay

If I don't get my license, I would like to live in LA, but I'll probably head back to Texas to live with my parents until I can secure a job. 

So... yea, I just want to hear if this logic makes sense or if anyone has advice to my situation. ",10Jun2018,1
372,"How do you kill the feelings you have for someone? He and I became incredibly close friends too quickly. We are both in an incredibly competitive and intense graduate school and we bonded through the suffering. Then he began flirting with me. Hard. At the time I wasn't single and I never took it further. But, Reddit, I must confess, I fell hard. Eventually, I became single. The moment I told him I was available and that I had feelings for him, he promptly left my friend group and wanted nothing to do with me. I think he loved the chase, not me. Now, I am about to start an internship for the summer and guess who is my coworker? Yup, its him. My stomach still flips when I see him even though I have tried so hard to quash the the false hope. I just want to look at him and feel nothing. I also don't want to get sucked back in.  Any advice is appreciated. ",10Jun2018,1
373,"My girlfriend (23) and I (24) have moved to Monterrey, Mexico together and have been living here for 5 months. We’ve been dating for +3 years and currently work at the same company. We have become close friends with one of our coworkers (26), who was just very recently married (in a lesbian relationship). We have gotten so close that we were even 2 of the 4 official witnesses for their wedding, signing their documents and everything.  They have now (twice) brought up the possibility of me donating sperm, since they would like a total of 3 kids, but we haven’t come anywhere close to specific details on the situation. They seem to just be bringing it up to see how I would feel about it, but they are not hard pressing me on an answer or working on the specific details. So I guess in the end, I’m not even 100% if they have considered everything themselves or if they have totally made up their minds on this!

I would imagine that I would have the expected responsibilities of an Uncle. They are going to raise the child, and I will care for it as much as any uncle would, but I will likely not be very involved in the child’s life in general. Specifically because we are only planning on living here in Mexico for another 1-2 years, and we are positive that we will be returning to the US.

Relevant details:

• As I States earlier,  I am currently in a relationship with my girlfriend of 3 years. Our own likelihood of having a child/children is pretty high, and she has expressed a little uneasiness about the idea of my first child technically being with them and not “ours”.  I mean, it wouldn’t REALLY be my kid, only by DNA, but I understand her concern. She has also expressed she feels selfish for thinking this, because she doesn’t want to stop our friends from being able to have the child they want. So she feels torn in that aspect.

• I don’t know what the adoption situation or the sperm bank/donation situation is like here at all. I don’t know if it’s expensive or anything. I would imagine it is, since I believe it is very expensive in the US.

• We haven’t known this couple for THAT long. In the time we have known them, it’s been really great, and there has never been anything to suggest they wouldn’t be fantastic parents, but I mean, we’ve only known them for a couple months!

• I know this is not the most important detail, but one of my thoughts is that part of me is second guessing if I am even the best option for them. I think I’m a generally alright person, DNA-wise. I’m average height, but struggled with weight for a decent amount of my life. Within the last year, I’ve dropped from about 250 to about 190 pounds. In college, I graduated Magna Cum Laude, and I have a relatively good temperament in general, but my mom has some mental health issues (anxiety/depression) and although I’ve never shown any signs of that, I think the kid could inherit that. They could likely get a better candidate from a sperm bank is all I’m saying.

• Financially I believe they could support the child. They both come from a very poor part of Mexico, and generally are not very wealthy, but currently they have pretty well paying and stable jobs in Monterrey (and they have no intentions of leaving Monterrey). Our coworkers wife has even just gotten a promotion at her job very recently. Part of me feels like if they can’t afford to go through the proper channels to get a sperm donor at a clinic, then maybe they won’t financially be able to support the kid like they should, but I think it might just be stupid expensive.

• Last thing that just popped in my head.. we never actually talked about the “administering” of my sperm. I highly doubt they would suggest me having sex with them, and honestly I wouldn’t be alright with that (and my girlfriend would obviously have some concern), but I literally have no idea how we’d go about doing it. How long does my sperm live outside of my body? And how effective will “non-natural” methods be? How many times will we likely have to make attempts at successful insemination? Would I just do my business in a room and then hurry out for them to administer it?


I don’t know what else to say. I am hoping I can get some advice and points of view on this situation. Anything helps, and thanks in advance! I don’t post on Reddit much, so if I start to get a lot of responses, I might struggle to keep up but I really appreciate any and all words of advice on this!",10Jun2018,3
374,"So this is something I have been ashamed of for the past few weeks. After graduating from university I moved in with my girlfriend, I used to live at home all through university and I have never been alone before. A few days back we broke up and she moved out temporarily. She went back to her parents place for the forseeable future and now im left alone for the first time in my life. This isnt a ""my girl left me and now im heartbroken"" problem, I wish it was.

Horror movied were a HUGE part of my life and now its biting me in the ass. I get so spooked at night that I leave the tv on while I sleep on the couch. I bought a heavy duty doorlock and installed a security system so I can get alerted at work if somethings wrong at my apartment. This feels like a much bigger problem than sitting it out and waiting to get used to and I'm in dire need of advice right now. Its only been around 2 weeks and maybe I really have to get used to it?",10Jun2018,1
375,"I'm a student on a medical leave at an elite top-tier university. I failed my first semester and left in the middle of my second semester (withdrawal for every class). I'm not much of a textbook reader. Word problems, in any subject, are super confusing and difficult for me. For instance, I'm taking a condensed summer physics course. Every time I think I have the solution, it's totally wrong because I misunderstood the question. I don't get what the question means. I haven't been diagnosed (but suspected of) a learning disability.

I've made it this far, and I feel like a huge disappointment. I don't think I can survive in a traditional college setting. I'm a computer programmer and human rights activist. I want to become a software engineer or a cyber security expert in the future. I have no idea how to get there. My parents will awfully stop supporting me if I don't make it in this school. 

(note: I'm on a medical leave because I'm malnourished from a severe loss of appetite. I also have soft bipolar disorder)

What do I do? I don't have faith anymore. I can't find my inner motivation. I've struggled with nightmares about failure and suicide.

So my brother and his girlfriend have been together for a few years, and it was only until recently that he started bringing a different girl over. The first time they appeared to just be hanging out and I didn't think anything of it, why would I, he can have whatever friends he wants over. However, a few weeks went by and this same girl, the other girl, was over and I heard them having sex (caveat: I live in the apartment below my brother, with thin walls, I can, unfortunately, hear everything). Then a couple weeks went by again and the same girl (I know because of the car parked outside) was over and she spent the night, the night before his girlfriend came over to spend the night. 

So that is my situation, I was just trying to see what others would do and if there is really any advice for me in this situation. I did talk to my brother briefly saying that he should be honest with his girlfriend and that being honest is the mature and responsible thing to do.",10Jun2018,6

384,"I drank around 10 time my whole life, between 16 and 17 years old. But one time, I drank too much, too fast. On one occasion, I drank 1/3 of a 80 proof whiskey in no more than 30 minutes. I passed out. I remember waking and throwing up, Then, I passed out for 8 hour. 
I would like to know what are the possible health consequences of this episode. I read that alcohol poisoning can lead to irreversible brain damage. And that alcohol can cause dehydration, causing low blood pressure and insufficient supply of oxygen to the brain. Also, that alcohol in large doses can suppress your breathing, causing hipoventilation and low oxygen supply to the brain.
Did I suffered alcohol overdose (poisoning)? Is there a chance that my brain starved of oxygen partially while I was asleep? Any chance of brain damage from this episode, even if it’s minor? I am really concerned. Thanks for reading.",10Jun2018,1
