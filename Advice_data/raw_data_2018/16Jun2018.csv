1,"Hello Redditors,

Sorry if the title was click-baity. I don’t eat actual garbage. 

I do, however, have the same poor eating habits as probably most Americans. I love fast food, I love sweets, I hate salads, and I just became acquaintances with some vegetables. 

I recently took part in a “Biggest Loser” competition among friends, and successfully lost 15 pounds without exercising once. I simply cut junk out completely and ate mostly soup for lunch (because I still hate salad) and granola bars as snacks (which I limited myself to twice a day). It felt good, people were noticing my weight loss, and I was happy with my progress. 

Then the contest ended and I decided to be less strict, because I was quite miserable living off soups and healthy food. I maintained my end-of-competition weight, which is good, but I haven’t lost anything since. Fast forward to today, and the past week I have been struggling a lot. I had Mac and cheese for lunch because it was in the soup section of APB. Sometimes I’d come home and binge on cookies and donuts. Then I would feel terrible and eat super light the next day, which made me hungry and made me feel terrible for different reasons. 

I’m struggling to strike a balance between eating the foods I used to eat every day in moderation and maintaining healthier eating habits. I don’t think I could go the rest of my life without eating a single slice of pizza, and thinking that really bums me out. I wanted pizza today, badly, and on my way to the pizzeria I turned back and went to ABP and got soup. I ate that soup begrudgingly, and felt a cycle of being upset that it wasn’t pizza and being upset with myself that a lack of pizza could upset me. 

If you overcame similar struggles, your advice would be most appreciated. I welcome all suggestions though. I need to know how to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I’ve gone too long eating terribly, and I want to make a change and stick to it. ",16Jun2018,1
3,"She, for some reason chose not to venture into developing healthy interpersonal communication skills. She was a stay at home mom whom literally had nothing to do but sulk about her life. And she sunk further and further into this feeling of helplessness and her solution out was to punish anyone who made her feel weak or taken advantage of instead of setting healthy boundaries.

She does things like blasting the radio and TV so loud so no one else can do anything but listen to what she listens to. And when asked to turn it down she says, ""It's my house!!"" . Obviously true,but very childish if her desire is for harmony. And her solution to conflict of any sort is, ""I want you to move out!!"" when I know that's not what she wants. It breaks her heart. She just wants harmony. She just can't seem to set boundaries and respect boundaries and then when she feels overwhelmed which is inevitable , she goes crazy. 

I have seen her have screaming fits on the ground. She pretends to pass out. She has stepped in front of cars. She has screamed at the top of her lungs after a argument just to get it all out. She has even stopped wearing socks for a time. Boy did her feet stank. And doesn't take care of her teeth. I can see her gums receding so badly I see significant air gap between her teeth. Even our neighbors call her crazy.

I know there is something wrong with her. I'm really not interested in being her therapist but I will do things to ease any drama. I honestly don't want to know what goes on inside of her. I imagine it's the devils dungeon in there.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to deal?",16Jun2018,2

5,"I'm a 20 year old male. I've had this problem for the last six years, and I've made little progress with it. I always feel like people don't like me that much or think I'm weird or a coward and a weakling. A lot of times when I go out with my brother or someone, the employees or other strangers almost always acknowledge my brother or whomever else I'm with instead of me. Even if I'm the one making a purchase!

Like if I'm making a purchase with a cashier or my brother and I are talking to someone, the other person only makes eye contact with my brother, smiles, and talks to him as if I'm invisible and not there. It frustrates me when people ignore me. Why do people favor my brother over me? I'm not a bad guy. I'm a nice guy.

Or when someone is making a purchase with the cashier in front of me, and the cashier is very friendly and smiley to that person, but once it's my turn, the cashier doesn't smile at all and is very cold towards me.

Or when I'm out for a walk with someone, and a passerby only says hello and smiles to the person I'm with and not me. I remember another time I was out to eat with someone, and the waitress only greeted the person I'm with and not me. She said to my friend when she came to our table, ""Hi how are you today?!"" completely ignoring me.

I wish I could get back to the point where I didn't care whether or not random strangers like me or talk to me. This problem makes it hard for me to go out and relax without worrying about people's approval of me and whether they like me or not. I'm so anxious for people's acknowledgement and approval to the point where it's insane.

I didn't always have this problem. It stemmed from when my 8th grade history teacher didn't like me and pretty much ignored me the entire school year. He acknowledged all of his students except for me. I was always so anxious for his acknowledgment and approval to the point where I would stare him down hoping he would say something to me, and he never did. That experience traumatized me because I was usually always my teacher's favorite student, and would always get special acknowledgment from teachers because of that. That was the first time I've ever been treated like that by a teacher. And I still haven't really recovered from that.

I'm trying to overcome this, but it's so hard. Any advice would be appreciated.",16Jun2018,17
6,"I just graduated high school, on to college, and it's only now that I'm beginning to realize that I didn't really learn anything.

7,"I took a class last semester and found myself ridiculously attracted to my professor. 

I couldn’t help but indulge my crush a few times. I stayed after class twice to chat.  Went to his office hours once. And I emailed him a few times. It would always start with some “question” about an assignment, but then turn into some light chatting with possibly a bit of flirting? I may be reading into it. I’m not sure. Every time I would be the one to end the email correspondence because I would get nervous about what to say. 

He emailed me after the last class to let me know how I did on an extra credit assignment I turned in, and again it turned into some light chatting, but I ended the correspondence again because I got nervous. I didn’t even need the extra credit. I had an A without it. I just wanted an excuse to talk to him. 

This was my last semester at this school. (It’s a community college). Today is the last day of finals week, so the semester is basically over. There was no final in his class, so my last class with him was two weeks ago. 

And... I’m still thinking about him. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m totally infatuated, and this is not a normal thing for me. 

I can still use the school portal to find his office hours for next semester. I was thinking about showing up during the next semester at his office hours and asking him if he would like to get a drink with me. But... is that crazy? What if he thinks I’m nuts, just showing up? 

I could email him asking, but I feel like showing up and looking good while I do is more enticing than an email. 

For the record, I’m an attractive 23 year old girl. He’s in his early 40s, and I know he’s single.

8,"Long story short, I am a mentor who works with people that have special needs. Basically, I hang out with them, we interact, and participate in activities. I have a specific mentee that I have been working with for nearly two years now. He is 18 years old and overall we have a great relationship albeit a few issues once in a while. He has made huge progress while having me as his mentor. He values my opinion and I am the only male role model in his life. He has no father. 

On to the actual situation. So, last year we had participated in a worker share at a local farm. We work there 3 hours for one day a week. In return, we get vegetables. Last year, my mentee had issues being in bed when I arrived at his house. 

This year we decided to participate in the same program. He has made great progress in the past year alone, like I mentioned before. I had some talks with him recently about how important it is that he is up and ready to go when I arrive. Additionally, I have been giving him important life advice on how to be an adult/etc. 

So, I put my trust into him as he is now because of his maturity level and his consistency. Yesterday, he rode his bike over to my house and even asked what time he should ride his bike over because he would be staying the night at a friends house. I told him 9am and put my trust into him. 

The next morning he never showed up and did not even wake up until 1:30pm when he responded to my Facebook message of me asking where the hell he was. I was extremely angry and irritated. 

Now, I want to know how I can properly discipline into being up and ready to go. How I can make sure this won't happen again. How to talk with him next time I see him. ",16Jun2018,4

24,"Hello,

So I am a cleaner at a big warehouse and lately I think I may have come across as too laid back. My job is always done and there has never been a complaint, I've actually done tasks that I'm not supposed to do, tried to help around with whatever came my way... In the past year and a half I've only ever been late once and have never missed a day. 

The thing is, my supervisor (who I rarely ever see) told me to cut off on some of the things that I wasn't supposed to be doing and this has led me to take a more laid back attitude. I've been caught being on my Ipod a lot and even sitting in a remote part of the place. The necessary tasks are still done, I've even come to wash the walls now but because of my now laid back attitude I feel that I'm coming across as lazy. I've made the mistake to say out loud to a couple of co-workers that I'm bored (I know, stupid me) and I think it's coming across as really bad. 

I've got the feeling but not the confirmation that people are talking and making me pass for someone lazy. I know the value of a job and this is my only steady income so I'm hell-bent on keeping it, I know the competition is tough. It's really weighing on my conscience to think that people are saying things and making me really anxious. 

It stresses me out and weighs on me like a stone. I don't want people to think that I'm doing nothing but the truth is that it's getting hard to look busy when in reality there isn't much for me to do... No one communicates with me, I barely get a review from my supervisor, all I can do is assume that if there is nothing said then there is nothing wrong but that's not the feeling I'm getting recently. I feel sort of left in the dark concerning feedback. My supervisor does give me a sheet that basically says things that need doing but that's only once every fortnight... 

I do think that I've made myself too comfortable but I don't want to bring it up to the manager in case it sparks something. If they say nothing then... I don't know. I want to bring it up to the manager and tell him that I'm sorry for having been less productive these days, that I'll leave the Ipod at home and everything but what if there's nothing ? 

I know that there's something because of a change in attitude from certain co-workers. Obviously I shouldn't say that I'm bored and all, I've decided to keep my mouth shut. I had made myself the promise to never complain about my job which I've managed to upkeep until recently due to boredom.

There is another cleaner there and I've been told time and time again that she doesn't do anything, shes been there for over a year now, coming in late, going home early, missing days... So I'm thinking that may be I can be let off ? Obviously next week I'm going in there with the intent to clean as much as possible and look as busy as possible... But you know... I don't know, am I freaking out too much ? It's a job and it's important to me, I've got no one and nothing to fall back on. I'd like feedback but constructive feedback, not just a sheet that says 'Today there is a stain in the kitchen' once every two weeks. I'm left in the dark and it's pissing me off.",16Jun2018,1

43,"Hello, this is one of my first posts on reddit, and my first one here, and I have a very serious question about what I should do about my friend.

My friend has depression, is kind of suicidal, and her family is very against her being a lesbian. So, a while ago in the school year, she went to the hospital because she called the suicide help hotline. Before that incident I would never have known, she always seemed a very happy person, so this caught me by surprise. I checked on her often, and eventually she came back to school, but she was kind of different.

When she came back, she was very sarcastic, and snarky, and would talk back to almost everyone, including teachers. I would sometimes ask her to try and be a little less sarcastic, since she started seeking a bit rude to everyone else in class. She soon started holding up classes, and everyone was pretty annoyed at her. I still tried to be very nice to her, since I knew she was going through a lot, she had a lot of work to make up from being in the hospital, she still felt kind of suicidal, and her family was being kind of horrible to get for being gay.

Ok, so this is where things start turning out pretty bad. So I have quite a few friends in school, and the friend I have been talking about seems to absolutely hate the guts of one of my best, and oldest friends. She has her reasons, my really good friend, let's call him Q, is a very smart guy, but is very overconfident in his abilities, and he can sometimes be incredibly socially stupid.

My depressed friend, we can call her P, hates Q a lot, and will actively hate him, she will sometimes just randomly hate on him, and sometimes just fight with him over text. In a group chat lately, P just started insulting Q, A tried to hold his own, but tried to get her to calm down, and when I told her to calm down, she basically threatened to kill herself. 

This is where the question itself comes into question, what do I do? I could try and simply drift away from her, since summer is coming, but there are a lot of issues with that. One major issue, is that she seems to still be suicidal, and I would feel horrible just leaving her, and also my parents know this about her, and often ask how she is, and I don't want to lie to them and say we are still good friends, but if I tell the truth, then I would seem like a bad person. Also, I am friends with a lot of people who are good friends with P, and it would be very awkward trying to still be friends with them, but they are all amazing, and funny people.

Now, another possible fix, is the sarcasm, and other things could be her way to cope, and she could just be going through a rough patch in life, and I could just try and wait it out, and see of things improve, but there is an issue with that as well. This issue has been giving me a lot of stress, and it has been making life a lot harder for me and I'm not sure how much longer I can take this.

Sorry if there are any formatting issues, and also sorry if my autocorrect made some stupid mistakes, it sometimes goes overboard. Sorry for this being so long, and thank you for any possible answers you can give me!",16Jun2018,1
44,"I am at a point where I hate my life. There are no suicidal thoughts or anything like that it just that I have nothing to look forward to or have any concrete plans on what to do. I have not had anything happen or done anything to be proud of so far in my life . I went to University and flunked out after 2 years because I left mid semester (yeah terrible idea I regret almost everyday), failed becoming a pro gamer after I peaked out as a top 10 player in my region of the USA before losing interest/giving up, and have no close friends. My work experience and resume are absolute garbage because its filled with like 5 years of part time jobs that lasted anywhere from 1-2 semesters as well as part time jobs I had while in high school. I cannot go back to University because my GPA tanked (below 1.8 as I was a C's student with a few B's and D's) when I left mid semester and I no longer qualify for pell grant  and other grants/loans for poor people. I honestly have been considering completely moving to a different country and not telling anyone goodbye just so I can erase this dude I created. But I cant even work up the courage to do this. I have no idea what to do or where I am going in life. I feel like garbage and that I have no future. How do I get out of this?

46,"I really don't know which sub to put this in but I'll be blunt and I'm very concerned about my vaginal health.

I don't have any STD's and I have always been redeemed normal, according to my gynecologist. Although, I haven't been checked since last year so I may just do that soon. But regardless, 3 guys have already told me I taste really sour and have a smell down there. 

I've noticed that literally every time I finish eating something, I pee it out and I smell similar to what I just ate, but 10x more potent. I'm really embarrassed to say this too but even after washing down there it still somehow smells bad like I took a shit kind of deal, it's very faint but it's there. The taste is quite sour-ish as well (I checked myself). Mind you, I shower twice a day and clean myself using the Summer's Eve - and I wash myself gently. Even when I pee at work or whatever, I can wipe (front to back &gt;.&lt;) as much as I want but it'll still smell like piss even when I soak the tissue paper with water.

When I masturbate it smells like poop kind of in my clit area and I play with my dildo it kinda smells like it too. I'm not sure what the hell is wrong with me and before I go to the doctor (not till next month since they're booked) I just want an idea of what the hell is really wrong with me. 

Also, I shower after sex. For some reason, the guys I do it with feel a tingle the next day or that they feel like it's itchy for some reason. Also, I guess the anatomy of vagina is like a subtle roast beef, just for reference in case that matters.

Besides seeing a gyno, can anyone tell me what are the some of the best supplements to take for vaginal health? 

My diet isn't the greatest, I do eat a lot of sugary foods, I drink coffee a lot but I feel like it still doesn't explain why I smell this way. I ate out a girl one time, and she wasn't the most cleanest as far as looks goes but she didn't smell nor taste bad, she was definitely bigger than me and her body odor wasn't great but there was somehow nothing wrong with her down there.

51,"So I recently got a retail job, and in the hiring process there was no mention of a drug test. Well yesterday I was told I need to take one. I've been working there for about 3 weeks, and they've already invested a good amount in training me. I've received 2 paychecks already. 

I have been vaporizing cannabis for the last month, and only used about 0.75 grams in that time frame. I am very light and have a super fast metabolism, so I know that I will not hold on to THC metabolites for very long. 

I bought a home test kit yesterday after my shift ended. I drank about 50 oz of water in 45 minutes, and my piss was nearly clear. I passed with a slightly faint, but visible line (50ng/ml cutoff). This would probably show up as a negative dilute result in a lab.

Today I had my test, and since I woke up I've been drinking a good amount of water. Chugged about 20 oz of gatorade 30 mins before my test. My piss was light yellow for the test. 

So here's my dilemma: I see 3 cases. 

1) Negative result, I pass. Pretty simple.

2) Negative Dilute. I will probably have to retest, the earliest time being Wednesday (since the lab doesn't open till Monday, which is my day off, and my shift starts after the lab closes on Tuesday). This will put me at 1 week of no cannabis use. 

3) Positive result. 

If the result is negative dilute, I'll just retest on Wednesday and drink less water, hoping for the best. 

If I fail, then I think I'm screwed. I was in a legal state a month ago, so maybe I can tell them that I smoked while I was there? I know that drug test policies are usually zero-tolerance, no exceptions. Is there a chance that explaining myself could help? If I get a dilute result and have to retest, should I just come clean about smoking in a legal state or try my luck again?

I've met him a couple of times but I really struggle to carry a conversation as I really don't want to bring up anything from school because I wouldn't want him to be reminded of the fact that he dropped out or that he's missing out on anything (he also has some bad memories of the place).

54,"I eat peanut butter often for the protein and high calorie content. I lift weights 6 days a week, so my calorie intake needs to be high. At first glance it seemed very healthy, containing 8 grams of almost complete protein, a lot of healthy fats and low sugar content. But today a friend told me about the anti nutrients in nuts, seeds and legumes. In this case phytic acid. They bind to nutrients and hinder their absorption. Peanut butter and almost all other nuts also contain a fungus called that produces aflatoxin. Aflatoxin is an extremely potent carcinogen, and can stunt growth in kids, which is concerning since I am a teenager myself. I was at first wary of these threats, because how much would you actually have to eat to face negative health consequences? I have trouble getting enough protein. My family is struggling financially, so we don't eat a lot of meat, and protein powder is somewhat expensive.

56,"I'm kinda stuck in dealing with how I view my romantic life. I'm 21, still a virgin, never had a girlfriend, and have only been on two real dates in my life. I've kinda been wondering to myself lately about why I have experienced so little with girls. And the more I think about it, the more I think I'm realizing that I just don't care. Like, all my life I've considered things around dating to be distractions and that I could be spending my time and effort someplace more worth my while. 

I tried explaining this to my older sister (the one who sparked all this self reflection crap) and she said I sound asexual. Had to look that one up but it's definitely not that. I'm definitely attracted to women and have normal, male sexual desires. 

What further confuses me is I still know I want to get married, have kids, and experience all those wonderful parts of having my own family.

59,"Some minor background info, my cousins, “Shawn” and “Al” were basically my brothers growing up. My siblings, them and I were all really, really close. Spent entire summers together, they oftentimes came over on the weekend, etc. 

So to put it bluntly, Shawn is addicted to heroin. I’m pretty sure everyone in the family is aware, but no one ever says anything. Shawn has also had pretty severe ADHD all his life. He’ll stop things mid-conversation and go do something else. He had medication when he was a teenager but it just made him zombie-like so he never liked taking it. He’d sell his prescription and use the money to buy weed, which is what he began using to control his ADHD. And it definitely wasn’t perfect but it was a lot better. At some point he tried quitting the smoking, he wanted to be 100% sober (no drinking, cigarettes or weed) and that lasted two weeks before his own parents begged him to start smoking again because his ADHD was so terrible. 

So like people tend to do, as we all got older we drifted apart. In 2016 I shaved a portion of my head off and would get designs shaved in it. Shawn and I bonded a LOT because of this, we’d meet up for a couple beers and he’d shave my head. We planned out designs and stuff. It was the closest I think we ever were. 

We opened up to each other about a lot and it was at this point that he told me that he’s done heroin. I know for sure he didn’t inject it at the time (though that might have changed by now). The way he worded it made me think he had done it in the past, not that he was currently addicted at the time and still is. Anyways I had a friend that was doing a report on former heroin addicts, he asked me if I knew anyone, I stupidly named Shawn. Since then Shawn has been distant. I really fucking hate myself for that dumbass mistake. He confided in me and I was careless. He immediately stopped hanging out with me and only ever talked to me at family events. 

So my job is helping to prosecute criminals. I know what an addict looks like and I can see in Shawn’s eyes that he’s addicted to heroin. He’s gotten worse over the past 2 years. My entire family is worried he’s gonna end up overdosing but nobody ever says anything to him. And when they do say something, they always say the wrong stuff that pushes Shawn further away. 

Shawn texted me earlier, apologized for being a stranger lately and said he missed hanging out with me. I need advice on how to rebuild my trust with Shawn and bond with him again. I feel like I’m treading on very thin ice, and that the wrong move could end up sending Shawn spiraling. 

I’ve noticed the mistakes my family has made when approaching Shawn’s addiction. And I’m trying to avoid making those same mistakes. It seems to me that everyone only focuses on the addiction if they’re not playing ignorant. And I think Shawn wants someone to help him tackle his inner demons, or even just acknowledge them. And mainly acknowledge his worth as a human being. 

So I think the best strategy is to get him to begin opening up to me again, and rebuilding our trust before broaching the addiction. 

Any advice for this? I’m aware I’m not a professional and I don’t have any experience here. But I do know for a fact that an addict will never change unless the addict themselves want to. I can’t force him into therapy or rehab. Even if I did, it wouldn’t help. He’d relapse immediately. 

TL;DR cousin has heroin addiction. I’m an idiot and made a stupid mistake that made me lose his trust. His addiction is getting worse every day. Recently he texted me wanting to reconnect. Help me navigate this?

I need mainly advice on how to word things, what stuff can I say, etc. ",16Jun2018,1
60,"Hi,

I'm teenage girl looking to break out of my house to do stupid shit with my friends. 

The plan is that i come home from work and pretend that i'm tired. I'd tell my parents that I'm going to sleep, i'd lock the door, and wait until the sun starts to set. They won't bug me if they think i'm sleeping after a long day. My plan from there is too escape through my window which is on the second floor and leads out to the front yard, and walking from there. 

I should be able to climb back up to the window after because I'm good at that stuff. If worst comes to worst, I could wait till it gets unlocked to let my dog out in the morning and then pick the lock to get back into my room (which i've done before). 

Unfortunately, my window has a permanent screen and i'm not quite sure what to do about that. I don't know how i can remove it. One option is to cut it along the edges with an exacto knife and somehow reseal it after. I was hoping the way that I reseal it could be inconspicuous, but if I have to I could duct tape it or something and act like I accidentally broke it or it detached on its own.

Is there some way to remove this screen? Are there any holes in my plan? Please don't tell me not to break out, it's happening.

DISCLAIMER this is a FIRST WORLD PROBLEM! My problem is, I just graduated college and have been looking for work, thing is, I haven’t REALLY been putting as much effort as I think I should because if I’m honest, I doubt myself tremendously. I don’t believe in myself and it scares me so much. It makes me really sad because I want to believe in myself and get a great job, and go on dates, and really live a life that feels full and secure... but I’m stuck feeling so powerless. I feel accomplished when I apply for jobs but when nothing sticks I feel like maybe I’m not good enough. And the thing is, I don’t think anyone really knows how insecure I feel... people around me say “push yourself” and “do better” and I either reject that or try to do better but give up. 

I feel like I’m suffocating in my own failure, my peers are moving up, getting full time jobs... and I’m still behind. I feel so stupid for even having to write this post but I don’t know what else to do. I thought of therapy, but would that help?  What can I do to silence these thoughts? Why do I feel like this?

65,"So back story: In June 2017, I bought new phones for myself and my wife. Bought them directly from my carrier. So almost a year has gone by and I have been assuming that both phones are paid and clear. I have not been charged a payment until just last month when I moved. While checking my account, I notice that they think I owe 21 more payments for the phone. This is just one of the two phones. 

So after multiple calls, and confirmation that I did indeed pay off both phones at once, they tell me that in October, they issued a refund for one of the phones. So now, I'm expected to pay for the phone again. 

So this doesn't sound right to me. I never asked for a refund, and I have no recollection of seeing a refund. On top of that, my status has been consistent that the device has been paid in full up until May 2018 where I got the charge. 

So I look through my bank statements from October, and I see that there is a deposit into my account that looks like it's from my provider. So this is three months after I paid for the phone, and I genuinely have no memory of receiving this money. And back then, I was making so little money that this sort of refund hitting my bank account would have definitely caused me to question things. 

So it seems to me that the provider made a mistake and gave me back the money I paid for the phone even though I didn't ask for it. And they allowed the status of my phone to be completely paid off for almost a full year before I was able to learn all this. 

It definitely seems like a hardship to suddenly have to pay another large chunk of money for a phone that I have been living with assuming was paid in full for a year. The phone is a year old now and I'm essentially having to buy it as if it's new. 

Is there any thing I can do about this? I certainly don't want to be unethical, but this all feels like a mistake on their end that is peanuts money for them and half a month's rent for me. It's frustrating because if I had realized at the time that this sort of mistake was made, I would have been insistent that the money go back to ensure that I didn't end up in a situation where I am now and apparently owing all this money for the phone.

74,"        Hello Reddit, I am a human bisexual female. As a teenager, I acknowledge that things are constantly changing and that I’m basically a walking chemical imbalance. I am and always have been very in tune with my sexuality. To get straight to the point, despite my attraction to both genders, I don’t have an discernible attraction to anyone. 
        I feel that I’ve never fit in mentally with my peers, I’ve always felt more mature and free thinking. Nobody, male or female, in or around my grade really seem like a formidable lover. All of my friends have these passionate crushes for others, but I feel like I’m missing out on a big part of being a teen. I know that relationships (especially teenage relationships) aren’t everything, but I feel an odd drawing to them. When I really think about it, I’ve never even felt romantic urges towards even attractive celebrities, really just...well, lust. 
        I feel a large factor of this inability to form crushes comes from my flawed mental health. Pill after pill, session after session seem to have never dulled my raging anxiety/depression, which somewhat affects my social interaction. However, I wouldn’t consider myself shy. 
        So, Reddit, I ask of you for some advice. Rather it be prior relationship experiences or just a total shot in the dark, I’ll take whatever I can get.

75,"One of the few days I can think of atm to earn money is sell some of my crafty things at the local farmers market. I know it don't be much but if I can help out by buying a few small things for the house I'm ok.

The fee to sell is $5 per day or $50 for the season (i plan on doing it day by day). Since I have no money I would need to ask my mom for the money. I have no issues paying her back when I sell things.

But she has times where she birches and whines about me going along and doing things, even if it takes very little time. I don't mind giving her $5 for gas, or .at me making a thing for her in return since she's doing a thing for me. Just not sure how to get her to agree...",16Jun2018,1
76,"I haven’t cried in the last 4 years, but a lot of things have occurred in these past few months. I was just listening to music and a few tears got out but he heard me and walked in, turned the lights on and immediately got infuriated. How can I avoid this? Also, I don’t really think the crying stuff is a problem, I think this is more about just getting past depression and being emotionally played with. How can I move past these emotions?

84,"I am posting this question on her behalf because she no longer sees any solution to her predicament. My friend (19F) lives with her parents as an independent, but has no way to live independently as her mother prevents her from leaving home. Her father just rolls with the punches and will not stand up for his daughter. The way she makes it out to me is that her mother will fight with her, saying that she ""ruined her life"" and that she will ""no longer support her"". She's also told me that her mother threatens to call the police and lie to them about my friend hitting her. Most recently, her mother has reclaimed the car that my friend was using (which is still under the mother's name, but is never used by her) solely to continue to terrorize her at home. Since she has no transportation, my friend can no longer find a job, since she can't make her way to any interviews. She's been saying that all of this is making her want to commit suicide. I understand that since she is no longer under 18, her mother cannot be tried for child abuse or anything of that matter (I think), but I have been thinking that there has to be some way to remedy this situation. She's told me that her mother can't be reasoned with, so anything like that is off of the table. I have recommended calling the police, but she says that she doesn't want to do that, and even then I'm not sure that that would be the best course of action. She is planning to move into and apartment with her friend in August, but that may not happen now because of all this. I hate to see her like this and talk like this. I'd really like to help her out, any advice on where she can begin?",16Jun2018,1
85,"I live in a ghetto type of neighborhood, where everyone around me speaks Spanish, drives lowriders/ford trucks, and sure enough, we all have dogs - myself included.

Recently, my front neighbors got a beautiful German Sheppard. And he keeps jumping their front fence (their backyard and front yard are connected). A few times as I was going out, I almost ran him over. The only reason I didn't was that the truck had a rearview camera, and I saw him in time to just wait for him to move. 

Today, as I was grabbing the trash bin to return it to my house, the dog barked and charged at me full speed. The only thing that seemed to stop him was that I yelled and stood my ground. 

The neighbors know their dog gets out often, and on a few occasions when I was stuck in my truck (I have a little 7-year-old girl with me and didn't want her to get out of the truck with a dog outside) have called the dog back in.

Normally the reason I haven't said anything yet is that they're very intimidating. Tattoos on their arms and faces, loud fights that the whole neighborhood can hear, and sketchy cars coming and going.

87,"I am a 20 yo guy with 2 elder sisters who are both in their mid 20s, the eldest one is engaged and the other one is married with a year old son. 

My mom and dad are really caring and both are working. My mom works and lives overseas while my dad lives with me and my eldest sister. Where I live we don’t move out of the family until we are married although one of my sister moved out and chose to live with my mom cause she got a job offer there.

My mom comes back for a few months every year to live with us then she goes back to support our family. My parents are pretty successful and I feel blessed to be their son. I have received everything I ever wanted. It’s that kind of feeling when you get what you want but you still lack the feeling of being loved but they wouldn’t do all the things for me if they didn’t really loved me right?

My dad is serious person who never shows love but he does everything he can to make us happy. He use to verbally abuse us so much for every little thing, he kinda still does but not as much as he use to. 

Everything was going great and easy until my sister moved abroad to work or maybe I was too young to realise it back then that there were so self-centred.

After my other sister, In about 3 years my eldest sister moved to live with my mother as well to work there which she did for about a year then she left that job and couldn’t find any other job that would suit her so she came back again. 

My other sister as always be a little selfish but I had the best relationship with my eldest one as she was with me for almost my entire life guiding, helping in every way my parents couldn’t. 

When she came back a few months ago, she changed so much. I do realise people change and when you reach a time in your life, you have to think for yourself cause no one else will, but it gets kind of annoying when everything someone talks about is for them and them alone. Its like they wouldn’t even care if someone died. Now everything she does and says is for herself and the most annoying part is she tries to act like she is being nice and sweet whereas she is just trying to get her work done.

The same goes for my other sister who came back for a ‘vacation’ from work telling us she came back so that my family could some time with her son cause the last time we were with him was when he was only 3 months old. She lived for about 2 months doing absolutely the least enjoying her ‘vacation’ and even fought with my dad and sister for various reasons. 

I just don’t know what to do in these situations anymore. Every time I behave like a slave and still do everything for them when they come back home and all I get is disappointments. I miss them a lot and I really love them but they don’t really care anymore and just want to use me to get their work them. There are so many things that I haven’t shared as the post is already long enough. I have no problem with my parents but my sisters are draining me and it has almost took most of my last 2 years during which one of my sisters got married and now my eldest one will get married as well at the end of the year I don’t know how long I can go on like this.

I even tried talking to them about a month ago when we were together alone about how they have changed and how selfish they have become but all they did was feel sorry and they are still the same.",16Jun2018,1

89,"Ok so some back story, I am only 17 and my boyfriend is 16 we've been together for a little over 2 years, I live with him so we're quite comfortable with each other. He is a bit of a hermit crab so he doesn't really come to any social get-togethers with me (which is fine I really don't mind, I understand). However a friend that I've met the last semester of school is celebrating his 16th birthday at his house he invited me, my boyfriend and one of my other friends to his party along with some other kids that I am acquaintances with at school. My boyfriend has never officially met this friend of mine. So earlier today I got the invite and told my boyfriend about it, sort of asking him if he wants to go with me or not. He responded by saying if I'm going to go, in a rushed tone. I told him that I would go only if one of my other friends were going (I said this because I could tell that he was a bit uncomfortable). He said are you sure sometimes people can be stupid at teen partys and he doesn't know this friend very well and what he's capable of.(mind you this friend it's not intimidating at all so this came to a surprise for me especially since my boyfriend never mentioned something like that about this friend before). So I was trying to reassure him by telling him who's going to be at this party (very mild people) and how his parents are very religious and uptight so I'm sure nothing bad is going to happen. He finally told me that its my friend that he's worried about so then I realized he's afraid of this friend coming on to me. Which is ridiculous because half of his friends are girls but I understand my boyfriend's point since he has never met this guy. However my boyfriend is uncomfortable about me going but he's not stopping me his words to be exactly. This is where I'm torn because I want to go and hang out with my friends but I don't want to make my boyfriend feel uncomfortable. He's even considering going which I told him he should if he feels that uncomfortable about it, but I know he doesn't want to go ... so I'm stuck on what the right thing to do is. What do you think should I go with the result of him feeling uncomfortable? Or should I not go and possibly regret it?",16Jun2018,1

93,"It is actually a friend of a friend  (let's call her N) who needs it. The mutual friend (call her H) first messaged me and asked me to get it for N because I am a patient at a clinic and I can get it for free. But in order for me to get it, I need to see a counselor in the clinic and lie to their face about why I need the plan B pill (I am already on birth control and take it regularly). I am worried about lying and I also feel like the whole situation is kinda shady. Because N has never had sex before. She doesn't even have a boyfriend right now. I don't know why she needs it... And on top of that, H will be giving N the pill next time they meet which is going to be 2 WEEKS from now. I don't understand why she would need the pill 2 weeks in advance. Especially since the plan B pill only works effectively within 72 hours. If N is planning to have sex why doesn't she practice safe sex, she could use a condom or spermicidal lube or a sponge... so many options? A plan B pill isn't supposed to be used as contraception. And it is only single use! The whole thing seems kind of suspicious and I feel strange going to a clinic and having to lie to the counselor about it. 
N is also being super shady about it and refusing to tell H and I what she needs it for. I'm not sure if I should even get it for her, considering I will have to waste an hour of my day or more waiting in the clinic and lying to a counselor. 

I don't wanna let H down but I also don't want to go so out of my way to help N (who I have never even met) given that this is something either of them could do by themselves. 

I also feel like I need to help H because I don't want her to stop being my friend... although if I am being honest, I have known her for 2 years and whenever I meet her she is with her boyfriend (her boyfriend is one of my best friends) and barely pays any attention to me and only seems to talk to him. She only ever talks to me when she needs something from me. Nevertheless, I have a need to help others, even if the person I want to help has never helped me.

99,"i have been dating my boyfriend for roughly six months now. i am currently wrapped up in the “power struggle” stage, meaning i am finally starting to take my partners true personality into account. he, however, is not in this stage and has possibly moved on to the next. i am finding it hard to personally do so. 

he is constantly trying to prove himself around other people, and i mean *constantly*. 
i will break his behavior up into three parts- 

1) he’s terribly aggressive and rude when competing for something (video games, answering a question during class, etc). he goes out of his way to talk about his accomplishments, for example today he walks up behind me and yells, ”guess who got a perfect score on the final exam!”

2) he is loud and obnoxious in public, constantly (i presume) trying to make others pay attention to him. things like dabbing, pretend fighting, bickering, actin like a *fucking child*....

3) he is also really rude in general, constantly degrading OTHERS (not me) for seemingly minuscule things (i mean things like mispronunciation, being incorrect, etc) he claims that he is having “good fun”, and that he people he makes fun of don’t care (when in reality, he really makes situations uncomfortable and undesirable) 

because of his annoying and rude behavior, i have been avoiding him. he has recently confronted me about my distant behavior and i couldn’t own up to it. i made up some bullshit excuse instead of telling him upfront that he has become *undesirable*. he goes on to tell me that he will ultimately give me another chance to “love him again”. i am finding it hard to do so because he hasn’t changed his behavior after the confrontation.

this may be derived from his lack of self esteem, which he has even with his immense amount of accomplishments. this is honestly something i can’t understand because i myself have low self esteem and i never go out of my way to bully my classmates.

he’s a great guy in private, really. he might add a snarky comment in here or there, but otherwise he is sweet and considerate. but when he is out i public, he is evidently annoying. i know i should break up with him, but i need to at least *try* to improve his behavior. how the *fuck* do i do this??? thanks....

101,"(m 16) First off I want to admit online relationships are stupid and I put myself into this situation.

 Basically last summer I met this girl online and got her snapchat, found out we were the same age and started talking. To sum it up we started video chatting and texting a lot. We both got super close and literally would text for hours every single day. It got to the point where we would flirt a lot and say stuff like I love you. There were times where we both decided not to date because we didnt know eachother in real life, but we would always go back to firting and I guess kind of dating. At the time I really liked her, but did not know what to do. It was at the point where she was down to date, but I had to be sure, and the truth was I was not 100&amp;#37; sure if I wanted to do it eventhough I kind of loved her. We ended up getting into some bad arguments that left both of us hurt, and they were somewhat my fault at times. One day she said she went on a date with some guy and I became depressed. She said that it didnt mean anything and that she was just doing it one time to be nice. I sorta got over it but it still bothered me, so I mentioned this girl I talked to and she got mad about it. We would constantly argue over things like this, not daily but it hapend way to often. It got to the point where she lost her feelings for me but still wanted to be friends and honestly that had me heartbroken. One day she texted me that she cant deal with me anymore, explaining that I made her depressed with all the feelings and made her cry every night. This made me feel awful and I tried my best to fix it but she decided to end it for the better for both of us, as she said. She blocked me in late october of last year, so its been awhile. For the first few weeks I was so fucked up and didnt know what to do, but overtime I got over it. I didnt think about her a lot and it didnt control my life, but the truth is I cant forget. Sometimes I just remember it and regret it all and it just makes me feel like shit. And the truth is I miss her, she was amazing. I dont know if I want to talk to her again, or if I even can because she blocked me. Maybe I didnt get closure, maybe I want her back, I dont know but I feel like I will never forget and it wont stop bothering me.

102,"At 11:30PM a delivery man called my phone saying there was delivery in front. I check the door and there he is. He says he’s holding $21 worth of sushi from a nearby Japanese restaurant. I tell him it’s not my order (several times) and he leaves. 

A couple minutes later I get a call from Grubhub telling me that there’s an order to my door. I tell them that the food is not mine, since I don’t use Grubhub. I hang up and I Google Grubhub terms — turns out you need to pay in advance in order to order food from Grubhub. 

So someone is literally paying to send food to my door. (Keep in mind this ISN’T a mistake because they used MY phone number as a contact number and had my address right.)

I call Grubhub and have them check all past orders on accounts linked to my phone number. They tell me there’s a couple (inactive) accounts with NO order history. That means someone didn’t order/register with my number, rather, they added it as a contact number or referenced it as a contact number in Special Instructions. I can’t get any information out of the order rather than initials of the person that ordered, and those initials fit NONE of my friends’ names.

104,"About 10 years ago my mother and our family moved to a new city so that she could begin attending college.  A few years later after the move, my dad decided to go back to school and finish his degree as well.  He then went on to a Masters program while my mom was finishing her Bachelors.  This was all taking place across approximately 7 years, by the end of which I was just finishing up high school and beginning to get ready for college.

Once I began college it became pretty obvious that my problems that plagued me in high school weren't going away.  Regardless, I continued using the fact that I was gay to disconnect from the people around me, avoid social situations, and bury my sadness using video games.  It continued to affect my grades for years and during the last semester of my Junior year of college I crashed.  Drowning out my life with video games took it's toll and I ended up failing every class and flunking out of college.

It's been about 1 year since then.  During this year I moved back in with my parents.  It took about 6 months after I failed out of college to stop playing video games in order to ignore the problems that were happening in my life.  As fate would have it, a static charge ended up frying my laptops internal wireless network card and ethernet connector.  I could use the computer, but it couldn't connect to the internet.  I eventually got an external wireless network adapter which gave me the internet back but I still can't really play video games on this computer anymore because it only runs on a wireless connection now.

Anyways, it took about another 6 months of half-hearted attempts at finding a job in our extremely rural hometown before I finally got my first job at the age of 22.  I've been working at a new local grocery store for a few weeks now and once it opened I was assigned to the produce department, which made the job actually enjoyable for me compared to all the pre-opening stuff that I was doing beforehand.

I'll have an estimated income of about $16k after taxes with no expenses to worry about.  It's not good, but considering how low I was before with no job at all, I really feel like I've made a solid step forward.  My mom makes about $30k and my dad makes about $40k.  They are both in default and are having their wages garnished.

The debt is huge but wouldn't be impossible to tackle if my dad's money factored in at all.  He's a verbally abusive drunk who shames our family once every few weeks or so, getting plastered, running our families name through the mud by behaving horribly in public, and blowing thousands upon thousands of dollars in his most recent gambling stunt (he got multiple paychecks to hold him over for the summer from his employer).  It's like this every few weeks, and it's been an endless cycle dating back decades, or at least since I was very little.  The only reason I'm even sane right now is because my mother is a rockstar who keeps our family together and up to this point has been taking all bill responsibility on by herself.  I only found out about their financial situation a few months ago, which even now is crushing me under the weight of it all, so I can't imagine how my mom must feel.

I recently met a guy I really like a few months ago.  During my free time I've taken up digital art as a hobby and he's really interested in me showing him stuff even though I'm still just a beginner.  I've also started to take it seriously in the sense of putting about 4 hours towards practicing after work during the week and about 10 hours for each day on the weekend.  I want to somehow turn it into a career eventually and I wasn't in a desperate rush for cash until very recently so I thought I would have time to make it work.

During the few years I struggled in college, I was studying in computer science and got a good amount of coding practice in.  So when the grander financial scheme of things was made aware to me, I started thinking maybe I could start practicing web development and get a better paying job, even though it's not necessarily the career direction I wanted to take.  Especially since I wanted to take art seriously and find a way to make it work, it just doesn't feel remotely feasible if I'm going to be able to help my mom out of this situation.  I'm not even sure if I can help my dad yet because he's always trying to sink himself lower and take us all with him.

I don't know what to do and I know I'm rambling but I feel like I just had a few really positive things happen in my life which are now being crushed beneath the weight of my families long term problem of my dad being a drunk and my parents (although mostly my father) being financially irresponsible.  I love them both, but I don't know how to feel about all of this suddenly being dropped on me just after I was trying to get back on my feet again.

My mom's debt is $115k of student loans (debt collection + accrued interest included).  My dad would only give me an estimate of $100k+ but my mom told me that it includes all sorts of bank loans, credit card debts, and a lot of stuff that is  really high interest.  So in other words it's a problem that I don't think I can handle delving deeper into, or necessarily even try to attempt wrapping my head around taking a path towards helping him fix it, it's THAT scary.  I'm currently at $26k in student debt which I think my job will help out with.

She's met a friend at her new work. Which is great. I'm glad she's finally making a friend, something she's always had trouble with in her life. Her friend is friends with one of my roommates. She texted me that she was staying over Sunday as well. For some reason my brain read that as a joke and that she was inviting herself over.

However she meant it literally. ""I'm not coming over for you."" X and Y and I are going to have a sleepover."" This is going to be at my apartment that I share with three others.

For some reason, reading the ""I'm not coming over for you."" Felt like a slap of ""fuck you"" rejection. Which I think is what really bothers me. But what also bothers me is the idea that she will be literally outside my door with my roommate and her friend, and I'm just not supposed to interact with her. She didn't say I couldn't interact with her, but from my perspective it's heavily implied. For some reason this makes me really uncomfortable, and I honestly don't even want to sleep in my own house when she's over.

Honestly, I'm going to be mad if that is the case, and if she knocks on my door wanting to sleep in my bed with me after a night of not interacting at all with each other.

107,"I really need advice about how to best help my girlfriend. 

Background: I am 19 years old and am going to be a sophomore at Uni, my girlfriend is 18 and is heading off to Uni herself this fall. We met over the internet a year ago due to our shared love for aircraft/ aviation and discovered that she already wanted to attend this university. (I want to make this clear just so it doesn’t give the impression that she is going to the same school as I do just because of me.) (I’ll use the name Allie as a fake name for my girlfriend)

My girlfriend and I have grown closer and closer with each day, we have the same interests, hobbies and really just enjoy/ get comfort out of being with each other. As I spent more time with Allie, I became aware of the dysfunction in her household, in particular: her mom. Her family is upper middle class and live comfortable lives, but Allie is becoming more and more distressed and frustrated with her mom as time goes on. Allie and her mom haven’t had the best relationship since middle school but has gotten increasingly worse since then. Her mom is very impulsive and selfish (words I don’t use often), she wants things done when and how she wants them done, no matter how inconvenient, my parents have been made aware of this on multiple occasions when her mom calls her at my house screaming through the phone. Her mom is very verbally abusive to Ally, making it to the point she hates to go home. Her father knows mine from way back and loves Allie and her brother but always caves into his wife and sides with her on every issue. She told me it got to the point a few years ago that she became suicidal. I want to make another thing clear: she does extremely well in school, getting a cumulative gpa of 3.9. She is also a happy/ spunky girl, however her mom’s erratic behaviour is really taking a toll on her. She has generalised anxiety disorder (I have as well) which is keeping her from getting her driver’s licence so I have to pick her up when I want to see her and whenever I go to get her, her mom is always yelling at her for one reason or another and ends up making her tear up. Allie hasn’t worried about her safety at home, and hasn’t been physically abused in any way, but is still finding it hard to deal with her family nevertheless. I feel so helpless in this situation and hate to see my girlfriend being hurt and humiliated. I am on good terms with her parents and they really do like me, so I really am trying to not do anything that would tarnish this but at the same time I am desperate to help my girlfriend get some relief. If anyone could give me any kind of advice, I’d appreciate it so much!",16Jun2018,1

TLDR first;
Masters thesis is not enjoyable and gives me panic attacks when I think about it. I have a good job in the field I studied for and am happy with it. Would quitting and moving on be worse for my mental health/happiness or would fighting though the anxiety be better? Really subjective but I’d love any personal experiences/ insight. Thank you in advance!

——————————
Let me start with saying that I have been trying to convince myself for the last couple years that quitting my thesis is the right choice for me, but haven’t been able to. I’m looking for advice and if anyone has been in a similar situation.

So I am in a blended bachelors/masters engineering program, with the option to get my bachelors and forego the masters at anytime now. I went into the program because when the time of the end of my bachelors classes was coming up, I was not getting any interviews for jobs and thought the masters would help. I have completed all the classes for both as of 2012 and all within 5 years. The only thing standing in my way is my masters thesis, but I think I was exhausted burned out from school at this point. 

I accepted a job offer my last semester contingent on me getting my masters. I got to a point in my thesis that I realized I needed to enlist the help of an electrical engineering student or teach myself a full new engineering discipline.  On top of that, my support structure of friends was suddenly gone after graduation. I started to panic that I wouldn’t finish my thesis and that fed into depression and inactivity. I would try to go and do some work on my thesis, but it would feel like I was battering at a wall with my fists.

I ended up having the job offer rescinded because I wasn’t able to finish my thesis which added to my anxiety and depression. I took a break from working on my thesis after that, and was then diagnosed with anxiety. I stayed in the town my college was located because leaving would feel too much like failure, and ended up gaining a lot of weight. During this time my dad was very supportive (he’s kind of a tough love guy but would always say he understood what I was going through with anxiety) but my mom made it clear she didn’t understand why I was having trouble, offering advice like “just go to church” and “praying helps”. I had stopped believing in Christianity a few years before and I think she knew, so the advice felt flat and not really genuine. I could be wrong on that. I love with my mom and am not mad about this, but at the time it kind of really hurt. 

I ended up getting a job, and met a girl who is now my fiancé about 6 months after I took a break. Then about a year and a half after taking the break, I interviewed and took a great job offer at a place right in my field of study. Since then, we have 2 dogs, we’ve been able to buy a house, we are engaged and I am happy. 

My degrees are still in limbo though and every time I think about going back and working on my thesis it’s like hitting a brick wall with a panic attack. I can go to my college and in a couple days opt out of the masters and take my bachelors degree, but I’m scared this is admitting failure and I’m not sure if that would be worse or trying to fight through the anxiety and work on it. I have seen the benefit in the masters classes I have taken, which have directly helped me to become a top performer at my work. Career wise a masters would help, but I think I could always go back and get a masters later (maybe not one with a thesis requirement though) and I’m not sure it’s worth the stress and anxiety. 

I guess what I’m asking for this subreddit would be if anyone could offer advice or insight into what decision would work better for my happiness. Kind of general but anything is helpful. ",16Jun2018,1

110,"Hi, I am new to reddit and this sub, but I wanted to ask for advice regarding my friend (I'll call them Sarah). Recently Sarah has told me about how her father abuses her. She once had to go to the ER from a wound inflicted by her father, who even tried to stop her mom from taking Sarah to the hospital. At the ER the doctors suspected that there was child abuse involved, but the mom defended the dad. Anyways Sarah has talked to me about never feeling safe, having depression, and self harming because she wants to feel in control of something in her life. I am very worried about her, and just want her to be happy. I want her to call someone and try to fix this. However, she told me that her sister once tried to call the authorities on her parents years ago before but they believed her parents over her sister, and it only resulted in her sister getting beat more. She said that she didn't want to end up like that. She also said she didn't trust her school counselor (I didn't pry for details, but I suspect it has something to do with her parents finding out). The other problem is college and money. If she alienates her parents now, they might not pay for her college or her sister's college and just cut them off financially. Is it better to just wait a few years until she goes to college and won't have to live with them and be able to eventually cut them off when she's financially independent? It just makes me so mad to feel powerless in this situation and just let her dad get away with harming her like this, but at the same time I don't know how I can help her.

112,"I am posting this because I am desperate for a solution at this point. I am a college student who is living at home for the summer with my mother who has been undergoing cancer treatment and generally has minor issues dealing with emotion, and my younger, 18-year-old brother with Asperger's who is figuring out college proceedings.
In recent months, my brother has become extremely aggressive, sometimes even violent against my mother and grandmother. He has to get what he wants when he wants. Granted, the things he wants are usually not frivolous, but he obsessively and aggressively asserts that everyone bend to his will whenever he wants. Of course, this causes problems with my mother, who has her own anger difficulty which is worsened by recent cancer treatment. They often get into screaming matches, and my brother cannot at all be reasoned with. He ends up threatening and cursing us out. I try to mediate but often get yelled at as well when I say that his anger is an issue. Granted, my mother and I have said negative things to him at times in the heat of the moment during his meltdowns. 
Of course, as to be expected, he usually acts as though nothing has happened the next day, but the sequence tends to repeat itself every single day. Obviously, he cannot think that he can act this way, as he is 18 years old. 
I feel terrible because I know that there is more I can do to help both of them, and I know that he is probably suffering more than anyone, and does not understand how he causes us to suffer. He has had struggles with anxiety and depression in the past few years. The thing is- for the past few months, He has refused to take any medication or see any doctor. I know he needs help besides us just being nice to him. He is 18, so I don't know if there is any way to force him to be treated. I apologize for the long post.

114,"So I moved from a negligent household, where I rarely left my room and rarely left my bed due to depression. I'm able to leave the house in my new living situation, mainly due to work. 

I bike or walk to get around because I can't drive. When I first moved here, I could travel just fine, but as time has gone by I feel like I'm getting weaker and weaker. Walking a block is too much for me, partially because of a currently undiagnosed illness (I've been through examination upon examination and they still haven't found what is wrong, basically there is a pain in/around my left ovary, but it appears to be normal on ultrasounds, and my x-rays were normal as well) and partially because I just feel so weak. 

I used to be able to bike around staying on the 5th or even 6th gear, but now that's too much for me, if not nearly impossible. I have to keep it on 2 or 3 or it is too difficult.

115,"I joined the military when I was 17 as a way of moving up the socioeconomic ladder. I've lived below my means and have accumulated a healthy amount of savings and a wealth of opportunities that will become available when I exit the service in a few days. I feel fortunate to be where I am right now, and I want to make the best choice for my future. I'm currently considering 2 options:

I applied to Columbia University back in December thinking it was a long shot, however I received my acceptance letter in early March. After accounting for the GI Bill and the Yellow Ribbon program, I still have about $20000/yr in tuition and fees that needs to be paid, but between a $3600/mo housing allowance, a VA work study, and frugal living, I could probably bridge that gap and maybe contribute some to savings.

So, I can forseeably graduate with an Ivy league degree with no debt. The problem? I don't really know what I would study, and I don't want to be flip-flopping majors when I'm there. I've always been wary of College due to the opportunity cost of being out of the workforce (lost wages/experience), which was a major driver of me joining the Army in the first place. I also don't know if going this route would better support my goals (I currently imagine myself  in the future creating a business that manufactures campervans eventually expanding into campervan rentals along the west coast.)

That brings me to my 2nd option. I have a job offer in San Francisco as a plumber's apprentice starting at $20/hr, increasing incrementally to $40 over the course of 4 years. I would also use the GI Bill at a local community college,  taking night/weekend classes and studying Engineering Technology and anything trade related to building out campervans. I would be receiving a $4300/mo tax-free housing stipend. If I lived out of my personally built campervan, I could save quite a bit of money over those four years that I would have instead been in school.  I spreadsheeted it out, and after accounting for moderate expenses and taxes, I could have between $350k - $400k at the end of those 4 years. That seems like a nice amount of seed money to start a business, and I would have spent that time learning technical skills that would be readily applicable  in that same industry.

You can probably tell where I'm leaning. I just want some reassurance that turning down an Ivy League to train as an apprentice plumber and go to community college isn't as crazy as my family and peers make it out to be. Getting into Columbia is an amazing opportunity and I feel kind of shitty turning it down when other people would kill for it. Am I missing something?

118,"Hello, I'm 16 years old and my dad stole $1,100 from me last May when I was 15. 

I put the money into my bank account to save it, and two days later my dad transfered the money to his account. 

I confronted him about the matter and he guilt tripped me by asking, ""Do you like having water and lights on""?

This is not the first time he has done this, he is simply attempting to justify his actions and avoid the situation.

To give some background, he is 58 years old and divorced.

My mom left him because the large amount of drinking, smoking, and emotional/physical abuse towards her. For example, he threatened to shoot her one night while drunk.

He started drinking and smoking when he was about 16 himself.

He was in college for 12 years aiming to be an engineer. My family would continuously pay for his education although he was constantly failing classes, while partying for 12 years until he reached the age of 30.

He eventually got a bachelors in industrial technology/shop teaching. 

Currently, his sources of income are from a construction worker job (remodeling homes), selling pot, and leasing a room in our house.

He makes about 4000-6000 per month I estimate, but he can't seem to pay me back the money he stole from me. 

If it was not obvious, he has a history of financial problems.

He consistently makes wreckless decisions, and as a result has wrecked multiple cars and has 3 DUI's to date; as well as a breathalyzer on his steering wheel. 

My family is constantly enabling him and giving him breaks. For example, my uncle loaned him a large sum and has him on a payment plan.

I am thinking about setting up a payment plan as well, but not sure how to confront him about it.

He recently was injured in his achilles tendon and requires surgery and worker's compensation for 3-5 months.

The money problems will be worse during this period while he's only receiving 2/3 of his income.

119,"Tl;dr: I know it’s more practical to move back home financially, but i worry what it would do for my mental health 

My bf of 4 years and I are living paycheck to paycheck in an cool city.  I’ve always wanted to live here, but I thought it was too expensive. Tested it out, and indeed it is. We ended up here on a whim (it’s 3000 miles away from home lol). We can’t afford to really enjoy being here. I do really enjoy the things we have been able to do, but I haven’t enjoyed constant stress about bills and having enough food.

My bf can go back to his job in our hometown where he makes what we both earn here put together. And rent is cheaper there. I would make a few dollars less per hour because the minimum wage is lower. 

I want to be able to go to school, and I think that it would be easier back home because I could afford to have a part time job. 
On the other hand, I don’t think we can ever get ahead where we are. 

I am aware that everything points towards home. There are some big drawbacks though. I’ve burnt bridges there,I don’t want to see people that I know, and I have a history of addiction and depression that stem from this area. I do have faith that I can live happily there if I try, but I have attempted to before and things went south. 

Some key things I will do differently:
-Not stay with family (we need our own space and its not worth our sanity)
-Move to a different part of town (to reduce likelihood of seeing the ppl I don’t wanna see/ this issue gives me a LOT of anxiety tbh)

Regardless. Currently i am 20. Turning 21 This year and live with crippling anxiety and depression. Of course there are the good days but majority bad. Ive never worked a day in my life and ended up dropping out of my last year of school due to having panic attacks everyday.  Even though i was still passing every class well.

Which leads me to now. I have no job, No money. Apart from governement beenfits. I hate where i live and i dont even want to live in this country. (I live in Australia) I feel somewhat embarrassed typing this but. I have an online girlfriend for over year and a half. Shes my go to. And no for those that assume catfish. We skype 24/7 and ive talked to her parents before. Anyways.  
Problem is she lives in the USA. And i just have this swelling feeling over my head that ill truly never actually get to her. Shes the one thing that gives me happiness. All the stress keeps building cause of the government now cracking down on me starting to refuse the certificates from the doctors or Psychs to try and keep me out of there system stuff. And starting to pressure me into things which is just making my head so much worse. I still live at home with my parents, they have a look of failure in there eyes when they see me. I hate being here and wish i could get my own house but once again.. Money is the issue. 

So. I dont want to type a shit tonne. Although my inner depression does want to. But Reddit i ask you. How do i live to get to my goals. My Goals are somehow making an income, moving out and moving over there. Living there in San Antonio. Having a stable income etc. Becoming a citizen there, doing weekly datenights etc.. But, How can i achieve this when i have so little money. I barely leave the house because i cant without being stressed. Working and even actually getting the courage to apply for work is completely devastating for me. And with every passing day the depression around it all gets worse and worse as dates and things get closer. And no this isnt just about love. Although she is the one thing that keeps that smile on my face even on the worse of days. But if i was to go there and things went bad. I would still stay there. We all know the stigma of online dating. So i aint walking into this just being an idiot. I genuinely want to live in the USA for different reasons then just those. However i aint going to deny those are on the top of the list.  


And Well Reddit. I have no idea how im possibly ever going to achieve these things with how bad my conditions are. The only thing im good at is Basically Anything and Everything to do with computer/technology . My heavy interests are gaming cause well.. Who doesnt play games when they have a mental illness lol. But the whole atmosphere of working etc just gives me so much stress. I would be fine doing something from home. But there's no oppurtunities here. And i know how hard it would be to actually be able to live in the US..   
Sometimes i wish i could just enter the lottery and win. Money is one of the biggest factors for my mental health.

Gosh, encounters with my mother usually go like this: 

1) There was this one time that I told my mother that this cashier gave me an attitude when I said “free light rail pass,” and my mother went on about how stupid I am and how I don’t know how to talk to people.

2) I was telling her how she should be proud of my brother for going to a good university, and she told me “enough” and how no one is going to ask me for anything except to become independent. All she needs from me was for me to be independent. I was supposed to be independent at the age of 18, so she really just wants to stop giving me money. (By the way, I am not independent yet because of me having a mental illness from ages 18-22; I am 23 now.)

3) My mother yelled at me so much when I didn’t want to lie to the social security administration for the upteenth time for a little extra money.

4) There was one night where she twisted my words so much that I was so upset, so I texted my aunt about what my mother did to me. I remember being so heartbroken when I saw my aunt delete all of my texts.

124,"So my girlfriend is constantly having her self esteem lowered because her un-emphatic and selfish Aunt keeps making her feel like any decision she makes is wrong.(Title Above)

 I need to remind her that she isnt doing anything bad and that she can make some of her own decisions. One of the big problems is the constant berrating and shouting whenever this happens. Dont get me wrong, her Aunt still loves her, but since she never had her own child she obviously has a different approach and ends up being very inconsiderate when she lets her words lose. Saying things like ""Ive given up on you a long time ago"" and then brushing it off as a jest like a total BITCH. Sorry, but who the hell says that? 

In case you were wondering my girlfriend is an A class bookworm and all around obedient daughter, but whenever she wants to go out with friend (without her Aunt to watch her) the Aunt just shows such obvious distaste and hurt. She ends up being somewhat against her decisions and eventually selfishly shouts at her and tells her things like ""You only want to do what you want! You know youre just a young lady and etc etc we know whats best for you and youre a totally worthless etc for not wanting to do what I want!"".

You know I try my best to be patient with the Aunt since she somewhat raised her while the (pretty cool) Mom is working in Japan, and Im still pretty respectful, but after seeing my girlfriend cry so much I really just want to lay a big **F$CK YOU** to her face.

Honestly, the worst part is that they instilled a complex within her that basically involves putting family above all. Which is okay, but ended up putting my girlfriend in denial about *feeling* angry against her Aunt. She's knee deep in sh#t in a moral dillema in deciding whether she has the right to get mad, or if she's in the wrong for feeling angry towards family.

125,"I have two younger brothers, 23 and 19 respectively. I don’t worry much about the youngest one, as he’s really mature for his age. But my main concern is the middle brother (M23). He’s at the age of an adult but acts immature. It’s been a problem for years, I thought over time he can improve but it gotten worse and no clear signs of improvement. So I wanna share this for help. He spends most of his time playing computer games, like the rest of us and is a fun person to play with. He likes watching cartoons, never tired of the same jokes and follows the news closely, keeping updated on the world. 

On the surface, he’s a fun and cute brother. But unfortunately people remember him more for his immaturity. 

- He fights a lot with our mother. Our mother is quite a short tempered nag but means well. So when her angers gets in the way, my brother retaliates back with words that hurt my mother. I told him to apologize but he doesn’t want to, he quotes it’s not fair unless she apologizes first. 

- He also fights with the youngest more mature brother. The youngest brother often scolds him about his behavior like a strict older brother but it always end up in a quarrel because he is unable to reflect on himself, often blaming others and talking about “fairness.” 

- Worst of all, we never had a heart to heart talk with each other, he never talks about his regrets, feelings or answer any concerns we ask him. Every time I try to softly talk to him and provide a listening ear, all he does is complain about others and never once said anything about his own behavior. I fear he lacks the ability to self reflect and think about others feelings. 

- He thinks empathy and compassion are weaknesses. He thinks everyone’s words as a personal attack, unable to rationalize it as a self lesson or control his feelings. 

- I know deep inside him, he is very insecure about his true feelings. He’s afraid that if he grows up, it means admitting to his own mistakes and “losing the fight.”. 

Sorry that it’s really long, but I want to give as much insight so you guys can give the best advice. How do I help him grow up? I tried hard and soft methods no use. I fear age will catch up to him and he is unable to get along and get himself in trouble. ",16Jun2018,3
126,"This is probably just me overanalyzing, but occasionally I do wonder if I have some kind of weird antisocial thing and if it's an issue. I just don't know why I do this. So:why do I dismiss potential friends and don't even feel like making friends? Am I a jerk?

I'm 18 and my childhood/schooling were a bit unusual. I was pretty isolated. I went to public school for the most part but I lived far from school and my dad didn't allow us to have friends over anyway. Only hung out with my brother. Then I ended up having some issues with a lot of stuff, alright whatever, went to three different high schools then dropped out and have been doing better things. So I don't really know anybody around here anymore...I recognize people but they don't remember me, since they haven't seen me since we were 14 and back then I was a freaky gremlin anyway.

I guess I've just noticed this pattern with myself and I don't know why I am the way I am. I can't make friends. The only people close to me are my boyfriend, my brother, and my mom and stepdad. In my free time, the only person I'd like to hang out with is most preferably my boyfriend but I also enjoy hanging out with my family. I don't get opportunities to meet new people often, but I don't make opportunities, either.

I've just noticed that in the past with potential friends, which hasn't even been that many times, I blow them off, or I feel bored/like I'm trying to force it. Even now: my mom tried to ""friend-matchmake""(aka set me up but with a friend) me with her coworker's daughter. I hung out with her once and she said she'd like to hang out again, but I don't want to...I was trying to be conversational but she's not much of a talker, and she was on her phone for the majority of the time. So yeah, no. At work, I can joke around with people, but that's it, I haven't made any real friends.

I don't care about me not having close friends, to be honest. I'm happy with my life as it is, I feel like I have plenty of people who love me and who I love. But my concern is that there's something wrong with me for that, and I guess it's because I've read many times and heard from other people that it's ""strange"" not to have friends. ",16Jun2018,1
127,"So I don't want to go into the whole entire story/history of my relationship, Lets just say as of the past 3 days I'm definitely done and need to get away from my ex/partner. I live on my own and am not dependant on him first and foremost so detaching is very possible for me.

Thursday night we had a domestic dispute, basically we were out at dinner and he started questioning me about why I was still friends with a certain girl - (like I mentioned theres a history there, long story short he's very controlling). Anyway, as he asked me that question I could tell his mood had changed, I stood up for myself by saying please don't speak to me in that tone and didn't want to answer his question. He then started calling me a liar and yelling at me in public in the restaurant with other diners just staring at us- He got so aggravated he asked me to fuck off. I had my things keys/backpack etc at his place so not exactly sure where I would go at that very moment, especially the fact I didn't have a problem, he did. We both got up from the table though, I was chasing after him to the car and in the elevator of the restaurant he shoved me and kept saying to fuck off and that I was dead to him.

I got into his car and said I'm going to get my stuff and then I'm going home I refuse to argue with you.

He started driving the car and yelling at me again I don't remember the words or what the argument was exactly- but nonetheless was always my fault or my wrong doing. He was speeding in the car, driving dangerously and all of a sudden pulled over the car, He punched me close fist on the arm (he weighs about 100kgs and is very built, I'm literally half his weight and size) at this point I screamed, burst out in tears and told him that he was disgusting and a scummy person for even touching me, I said he deserved to be spat on, as you can tell I also was so aggravated not only did I look and feel so belittled and degraded I was just devastated that the man that I love would hurt me the way he did. As I said those words about spitting on him (which I didn't) he grabbed me so tight and shook me and said ""Spit on me, come on do it, and I swear to god I will kill you right now"".

This is the part when it got extremely out of hand, The previous punch was hard but not enough to leave damage on me to the degree that I had marks or felt bad pain- My arm was tensed and I definitely blocked him the best I could. So this first hit wasn't what effected me the most, He laid into my head with a closed fist punch directly on top of my head- he knocked his fist downwards. I had my arms up and hands shielding my brain basically. His punch was so hard I actually saw a flash, Ive had sports injuries to the head before but never encountered anything like a flash and it went black for me. I was definitely dazed for a few seconds but then alert again then I just broke down sobbing in the passenger seat.

We pulled up to his apartment and I ran upstairs to to get my things and got myself an uber- he went straight for cigarettes to smoke on the balcony. I told him he would never see me again and that I didn't want to speak to him and that he needs to get professional help and just said my goodbye was final.He really had nothing to say to me at all, no remorse no acknowledgement of wrong doing. Of course it was my fault in his eyes.

I took myself to the hospital that evening and explained I was just having really bad head pains and extreme headaches. They didn't do a scan because they said perhaps my injury wasn't so bad seeing as they can't feel a lump or bruising. Yesterday I showed my discharge letter to my GP and I broke down and was just really honest with her and thats when I finally got some kind of help, she enlisted me into a program for victims of domestic violence and got my prescriptions for pain medication and a ct scan referral.

It's Saturday now and my headaches have not subsided, the worst part is today he contact me threatening me and saying he would expose me? Like I don't know exactly what he means by that? Its obviously left to the imagination because thats what he wants - for me to think oh no what will he expose of me I'm such a horrible person. Its ironic because throughout his abuse I have told nobody and thats where I Really fucked up. Im writing it here now to finally feel like I've told someone, It my first step to getting the courage to actually say it to another person.

Not only did he threaten me like this, He messaged saying he would call his friend to do something. I know his friend is a bad guy, a real degenerate that probably is a criminal but who knows, my point is I'm not sure what his threats meant, but yes I am paranoid now for my safety and I guess my question is, Do I tell the police? What would happen If I report it? Will they come knocking on his door? I wanted to really think long and hard about it, Because theres so much at risk if I do go to the police but theres also so much risk if I don't. In my mind I was hoping this could play out like we didn't have to ever bother each other anymore and he would move on and not try to punish me with his constant ways if we were over.",16Jun2018,1
128,"Please read the lot of it.

I am a 25 year old guy, and I have never asked a girl out before, therefore I have never had a girlfriend. I have just never been able to do that. I have no problem conversing with a woman about non-relationship-related topics, but I can't bring myself to express any sort of sexual interest in a person if I am talking to them. I guess you could say that I have no-damn-clue how to get into a relationship.

Now, this girl I have known for over two years is very special to me, because we have lots of things in common; we're both majoring in fields of science, both looking to work for NASA (she already has had an internship for a while), we are both total NASA-science-junkies, we're both artistic, and we're both huge fans of The Beatles. In our physics class, we were in the same lab-group together for two semesters in a row (we get to pick our own groups), and sitting next to each other, we would both help one another with physics problems.

The problem with me is that, in the past year since we've gotten closer through teamwork, I never once told her that I think she's incredibly beautiful, or that from my perspective, every single thing about her is perfect, and that I want nothing more in the world than to be with her (before I knew she had gotten a boyfriend of course). Sure, I have always daydreamed about what it would be like to tell her my feelings, but that dream remains only a fantasy. Now that we graduated from our JC, I am afraid I'll never see her again. I am literally crying right now as I type this. I wanted so badly to be together and I can't let it go, and thinking about her all the time, is painful (I used to think about her constantly before too, but without the pain and tears).

I know, morally, I should forget about her, and go on with my life. But it absolutely kills me to think that, if I had actually asked her out before, while she was single, she might have possibly said yes.

I wish there was something I could say to her at this point, but there's no use, because nobody's going to leave their boyfriend, just because they find out that someone likes them, right? Is there something I could say to her? I feel like if I say something it will ruin any chance of her even wanting to still know me. Then that ruins the chance of her considering me if she ever breaks up with her bf, sometime in the future. I know these thoughts are insane, but nonetheless it is what I think and I can't un-think it. Please help me.

129,"Hi I'm 22 years old and have been flying as a form of transportation for most of my entire life with little issues. I live in a city with a major airport and it was always easy for my family to take trips and flying was usually how we would get there.  After a flight from USA to Japan, I came home and everything changed. I think it may have had something to do with the Malaysian airline flight that disappeared that completely shocked me. It kept me up at night and I couldn't stop worrying about how much terror the passengers onboard must have experienced if their plane had gone down.

The trips I go on in which I fly are mostly with family where my option is either don't go or fly and I'd obviously rather be with my family but I am losing my ability to cope with the fear. 

I've flown internationally a few times since the fear has gotten worse and am currently abroad about to take a flight home tomorrow back to the US and I don't even think I'll be able to sleep tonight. Before flying I get extremely sick and panicked. I can't stop vomiting and shaking. My heart is racing now just imaging having to go to the airport tomorrow. I cry and curl up in a ball during take off and landing. I've tried small doses of anti-anxiety medicine but haven't had much luck because my fear usually overrides whatever the drug is capable of achieving. I know it's mostly in my head.

My biggest fear is the plane crashing. I also know it's extremely improbable and everyone has given me statistics but that hasn't always helped. I have this repetitive vision in my head of the plane going down and I experience the worst agony and horror I've ever felt just before my life ends. I just can't shake it. I don't know what to do? Does anyone else suffer with flying anxiety that could try to lend me any last minute advice? :-/ any pilots who could perhaps let me know that it's going to be okay or any tips for meditating throughout the flight? I would be so grateful for anything that helps, even someone explaining the physics of the plane can help me a little bit. I'd be so appreciative, thank you.",16Jun2018,2
130,"Yep. My dad invented MyFitnessPal years after it was originally invented. I don’t know how his is better or different, but he claims it is, yet there is no proof when I’ve asked for it.

I love him. He’s well meaning, but he’s constantly trying to hit it big with that ONE IDEA that’s just going to “take off”. What he lacks in work ethic to make his dreams happen, he makes up for in arrogance, ignorance, and delusion.

I know there will likely be hurt feelings. I’m just not sure exactly how to phrase what I feel needs to be said in a way that will minimize the damage while crushing his dreams entirely.

I know that sounds bad, but he ONLY talks about this shit. About himself and his BIG ideas that NEVER come to fruition. Now he’s spouting his bullshit to my kids and my wife.

I don’t want the kids to rely on grandpa to “take us all on vacation” when the dude is always “waiting on checks to come in from clients”. They’re smart kids, I don’t want to have to tell them that grandpa is generally full of shit, but well meaning (but, also... still full of shit), but they’ll figure it out eventually. I hope my oldest already has. 

For my wife’s sake, she just needs a break from her sweet ass (in reference to both the gentleness and kindness of her demeanor and my fondness for her posterior) having to nod-smile her way through endless pitch meeting after endless pitch meeting. 

I don’t know how someone can be SO “busy” and accomplish SO LITTLE. 

I don’t know how to approach this situation. 

I just want him to be a grandfather to my kids.

TL;DR: My dad’s an unreliable, narcissistic, arrogant, willfully ignorant asshat who thinks he’s going to “hit it big” with “one big idea” but lacks the work ethic to complete or accomplish anything so he jumps from one idea to the next.

134,"My intention isn't to offend anyone and I am sorry if I do. 

So I am a 19 year old girl (my birthday was yesterday!) and I have always struggled with my weight. When I was 17, my mom decided to take me to my doctor to talk about what to do and how to lose weight. So she would take me monthly and some months I would lose weight and others regain it back. She would get annoyed at this. (Rightfully so.) (Though, in my defense and not as a crutch, it is harder to lose weight when you have an eating disorder.) So after a while the secessions got longer like 5 months and six months and I would dread going. Just to feel even worse about my self. Now she was right about me being fat and I was uncomfortable because she was right. 

Follow up to my two most recent secessions. She put me on Antidepressants (citralopam) for weight loss. It apparently can suppress hunger. So, I went to office 6 months ago and she gives me the talk about weightloss the typical eat right etc. But then starts going on a rant about Jesus and God. I'm thinking to myself, okay.. I know many religious people and maybe it's just a weird day. She then continues for 15 minutes on how I should learn about God. I politely explained I don't believe in God. She then kinda keeps going and I tell her ""You're making me kinda uncomfortable."" She keeps going and tells me to read the bible etc so I say ""okay."" Now, I went to a christian school and not trying to put anyone's beliefs down, religion isn't my thing, nor do I think it should be discussed with your patient... 

Unrelated, I then got a bad sickness and went to another doctor (I wanted to wait a few days because my appointment was in 3 days but my mom made me go to the clinic so I said reschedule my appointment with the other doctor so naturally she rescheduled ON MY BDAY!) I can't drive yet due to awful driving anxiety so she takes me to my doctor's appointments.

Fast forward to yesterday, I went to the doctor's nervous! I had gained some weight and was like ""uh oh."" She comes in and tells me I lose 10 pounds. I tell her I don't think that is right and that I think the other clinic had made a mistake but given how I never look at weight scales it could be correct. I told her all of this and then told her my new symptoms how my meds were working etc. As I am explaining this she is sitting in a chair across from me and after I finish asks me:
Doctor: Do you have Autism?
Me: (In shock and uncomfortable confusion) No....? What makes you think that?
Doctor: The way you talk.
Me: The way I talk?
Doctor: Yes, it's nothing to be ashamed about.
Me: I don't think so, I have never been tested, but have had people ask.
Doctor: (Begins to explain how her son has it for like 10 minutes.)
Me: You're making me kinda uncomfortable.
Doctor: Do you mind physical contact?
Me: Not really...
Doctor: (Comes up to me and gives me a hug while telling me more about Autism.)
Me: (Kinda feeling really nervous and uncomfortable ask her) What does this have to do with me losing weight?
Doctor: It could help if you got to know yourself better.
Me: I'll take the higher dosage of Citalopram... (Trying to end the secession.) 

So we eventually leave and I bring my mom in for the scheduling. The doctor (actually a nurse practitioner we have basically no doctors in our small town) brings my mom in and explains everything. She then tells my mom how she thinks I am autistic and my mom agrees. (My mom does this with pretty much anything so I am not too suprised.) At this point, I'm super upset and start tearing up. (One thing you should know is that I want to go into neuroscience. I am trying to get my degree in it. It's been my passion from a very young age and I have done brain games, eat more brain foods, and study the subject constantly. I just love neuroscience.) I know I shouldn't be embarassed if I have autism, however, from my point of view and someone who loves the brain, it's hard to cope with being what many consider ""mentally disabled."" I try so hard to make my brain as efficient as possible and I don't like hearing this because it makes me feel bad about my self. It feels like I failed and that I am broken. (When I was younger I actually studied autism and found it interesting, but I prefered it from a professional point of view rather than a patient, if that makes sense.) I digress. So after I start crying we go to the car and my mom tries to cheer me up and I tell her I'm really sad because I want to go into neuroscience and I am always trying to better my brain and hearing things like that really just hurts me. She takes me to the bank drivethrough and deposits my money and we go the Casino. I won $60 but still feel really bad about my self. (That feeling lasted the rest of the day and until now.) 

I have had people ask me if I was autistic before. It hurts me, I won't lie. However, upon doing research, I really don't see it. Yes, I get hobbies and do full research and have fun with them. Maybe even considered ""excessive"", but does that really make me autistic? My social skills could use some touching up. I don't like parties. I prefer staying at home with a good book. I sometimes look away during eye contact (staring at someone freaks me out) and that's about it. I am completely self aware of other people's emotions (most of the time), and I have few, but loyal friends. To me, it sounds like introvert behavior rather than autism. I called my father and told him all of this and he told me it seems like it is time to change my doctor and that I 100% do not have autism. (My mom raised me and disagrees.)

In a month, I have to go back and check in with my doctor and I am not looking forward to it. I am nervous about what she'll say next... Not just being autistic but the random religious rants. I would also feel bad if I left her. She has been a good doctor for years, but these past two sessions (about a year) has seemed to start going downhill...

1. Should I start seeing a new doctor?
2. Should I be tested for autism?
3. If you or someone you know is autistic, how has their life changed because of it?
4. If you are autistic, do your college/employers need to know or can you keep it a secret?
5. Is this normal behaviour for a doctor even if I told her I was uncomfortable and asked her to stop but she refused?

I am sorry if any of this offends anybody. My intention isn't to hurt anyone's feelings. Or even make autism/people with it look bad. I have met autistic people and they were really sweet. It's just from a perspective of someone who wants to go into neuroscience I feel bad about my brain and know I shouldn't, but I feel I failed with my self.

135,"Hey guys, using a throwaway just for to be on the safe side. If it helps I turn 16 in July. 

I haven’t lived with my dad since 2015, and have only visited him a couple of times since then. 

He essentially pushed me outside the house and locked the doors one evening because of a disagreement on religion (explanation is a little irrelevant). This was in 2015 of course. 

He’s always had problems with anger, and drinking as well. He would be just nasty towards me and my sister too much and the stress in that household was just too much, and being being essentially kicked out was sealing the deal. 

Like I said, we have spoken numerous times and I’ve even told him how I felt and he’s responded in the forms of letters and sometimes texts. I do understand throughout my life I have become a bit of an annoyance, in the sense all teens do stupid shit and I would  assume piss their parents off. I believe a resurrection is possible but there’s a couple of problems. 

I’m not too good at communicating with him. Often times I’ll completely ignore his texts, and not to be a douche or whatever, but they’re pictures of old memories with him saying “don’t you miss this”. I suppose I just get uncomfortable and can’t really find the words to say. 

Other times he tries making plans and they consist of me staying the night at his house. As much as I would like to do that, i’m just nervous of what may happen due to past experiences in him drinking, being ugly to both me and my sister (who goes back and forth between my mom and dad, but not to the severity of how he was with me in terms of ugliness, which is putting it nicely), etc. 

My biggest concern really, is the fact that I haven’t lived with him in 3 years. Don’t get me wrong he’s my dad 100%, however it’s just hard to see him that way when I haven’t really maintained a conversation or been in his presence longer than say 20 minutes. I may sound selfish saying that but I really don’t know how to put it into better words. 

Overall, I guess i’m just looking for advice from you guys to maybe help me get over this nervousness I have. I truly do want to fix things because him and I used to truly be extremely close. Anything you guys can say will help out tremendously. 

Also I’m on mobile so you’ll have to forgive me for any formatting errors or spelling mistakes.

I’m planning on doing a TIFU post and want link a video on my YouTube account as evidence. 

Earlier this week I had posted another TIFU story, which was about me getting accused of blasphemy in the Middle East whilst in flying on the staff travel account of my friend who is an Arab pilot. 

Basically I don’t want my public moaning about the poor treatment I received to come back on him in anyway because employers can be really funny about that, especially in the ME, and if anyone’s to blame for the f*ck up, it’s me and me alone.

I don’t think she could bare to kill an unborn child.  Her parents know.  Actually, she wanted to tell her mom sometime soon.  I had to leave on a trip and I told her to tell her mom right away before I had to leave, that way if she had to confront me or just talk to me I then I’d be available.  I’m just scared... shitless.  I don’t want to ruin anyone’s life.  She’s so young and I feel bad but she tells me it isn’t my fault; it’s a mistake made by two people.  I know that.... but I can’t help it.  

Anyone with experience, is it possible? I know it’s hard... I don’t want us to break apart from an abortion but I also don’t want us to tear apart if we have it.  I’m lost, and I feel like I made a mistake although I don’t resent her or our experiences and the time we had together.  ",16Jun2018,1
144,"Hey Reddit. I’m a incoming Sophomore at HS, and I need help bulking up before the start of the new school year.        

I’m turning 16 in October, but I haven’t really hit puberty yet (ie. no armpit hair, no deepened voice, not a lot of pubic hair). I play baseball for my high school, and luckily, my talent was able to make me a starter, even though I’m the smallest on my team. For next year, I really want to be able to bulk up and get faster (I’m slow) so I can continue to compete in baseball. 

Additionally, I want to bulk up to help my self esteem. I don’t wear shorts and only wear a hoodie because I am insecure about my arms at school, even though they’re not terribly skinny, you know how people can be. 

Anyway, here’s a summary of what I want before the end of summer vacation...

Become a faster runner
Bulk up to help appearance 
Become stronger to help baseball performance

About me: 16 in October, late bloomer, 115 lbs, just shy of 5’9”

149,"(This is kinda long and confusing, sorry! I know, my grammar sucks) TLDR at the bottom
Sounds like a middle schoolers post. I know, but we're both in our early 20s.

So here's the story. I've been somewhat interested in this girl since high school. We hang out quite often within our friend group and get along very well. We're both sarcastic and tease each other. 

Just a few months ago, we've started getting closer.Our friend group had a small bonfire and after a few drinks and the night was getting late and cold, the girl I'm in to, another girl, and I cuddled up with a blanket and our legs were intertwined. All I thought at that time was ""this is great! Two girls cuddling around me.""

A few months later, we were all together for winter break so we all got together again and we were watching a movie. I was sitting next to her and got bold and started playing footsie with her and she responded well with it. Eventually we were fully cuddling with her head on her shoulder and when I tried to get her to hold my hand, she slightly shook her head to say no. I was disappointing but it kind of made sense since we were with friends and we aren't dating.

Leading up to this point, it sounds like I have great chances with her right? Well I'm kind of a straightforward guy and I bluntly asked her the day afterward by text if the cuddling meant anything, but she just replied with a firm no and that she thought I was a great guy but it didn't mean anything. 

Disappointing, but I've had rejections before and knew that if a girl wasn't interested then that's that. Respect her wishes...

Fast forward to summer break. Again some of us got together and we decided to stay over at a friends place. We all got somewhat tipsy/drunk and I was flirting with her a little but we had a lot of skin to skin contact and the mood was pretty good. At one point people started to go to bed but I lightly convinced her to stay and talk with me and another friend. She came back and sat on the same couch as me, with a blanket covering us. As we were settling my hand accidentally (really!) touched her hand and she grabbed it. We held hands as me, her, and the other friend talked for a while until the friend went to sleep. At that point she started to get up but I convinced her to stay and talk some more. We talked and eventually started cuddling while still holding hands. Somehow we ended up spooning and I was rubbing her arms and legs. She didn't say or do anything against and it didn't seem like she was uncomfortable (She isn't a shy person so she would've stopped me if she didn't like it). I took this as a sign that I could go further but I was stopped at a certain point. I understood and we just kept talking. Eventually we were both so tired so she went to sleep elsewhere (Since we both didn't want the others to know), however, just before she left I asked for a good night kiss on the cheek and she did (nice!)

The morning afterwards, everything went back to normal. We had fun and all and we all went home. 

From then to the present I've been so confused. The whole thing with cuddling, holding hands, and kiss on the cheek makes me think she's into me....

However, I'm currently off doing an internship and can't hang out with her for a little bit so I've been trying to hold a snap streak with her and get talking with her more and she replies to my snaps/texts but it usually ends with her stoping the reply and conversation dying (although my conversations aren't super exciting, just small talk). This makes me think that she really isn't into me. 

Another thing is that I'm thinking she just wants us to stay as friends? Or maybe doesn't want to get in a relationship? or maybe she doesn't want to be in a long distance relationship (Since we both go out of state)?

All these thoughts are going through my mind at 1:30 AM and the past few days. 

Am I overthinking things and she is into me? Or my other thoughts correct and she isn't into me or doesn't want a relationship? Someone help me sort this out. 

TLDR: Me like girl. Cuddled with girl and asked if she likes me = no. Later cuddle, hug, hold hands, and get a kiss on the cheek with girl. Now confused and needing internet strangers advice.",16Jun2018,2
150,"So I have bipolar disorder and autism. I currently live in Canada with my family and I’m 22. The girl who is involved in this situation is 20. This also happened in January. Well I mentioned I have my illnesses. These illnesses cause me to have trouble reading people and controlling my emotions from mania to depression, I also trust people fast. I do not have many friends and get quite lonely. I met this girl in the summer but didn’t talk to her again till January. What happened was we were talking and she started talking to me as normal people would asking to meet me and I was in mania at the time and I let her know at the beginning of the conversation. She was aware when I’m manic my decision making is very bad and impulsive. So as we were talking she started flirting and then said if I give her some money to help her for New Years she would send nudes. Of course I stupidly did. Eventually she started asking me to buy things for her and she’d pay me back or send nudes for me. I’d buy something and I’d never get paid. I’d sometimes get a nude but by the fourth but I didn’t want that stuff I was foolishly thinking she liked me. So she kept saying she loved me and would get me to drive 2 hours to drop money off in her car sometimes and I’d get nothing. She would get me to pay off people so they don’t beat her and after I requested never give me receipts for things. I kept going between depression and mania frequently. I feel gross and guilty for taking the nudes but at the time was really lonely and wanted to feel wanted. She then started bleeding me dry of money saying if I didn’t pay her I was no help and that she would kill herself or move away. In the end I just gave up and told her to go away she then started harassing me for weeks to the point where I changed my phone number. Then she tried emailing me 3 weeks ago and I didn’t reply. In 2 months she took almost $10,000 from me because I opened a $5000 loan to help her which I’m still paying back. I never got a single cent back and I deleted all of the stuff she sent me. I also deleted the messages out of shame. It’s probably stupid but should I bring this to a court and see if I can get my money back?",16Jun2018,1
151,"I don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start off describing my life. Born to a third world country, forced to go to a school where the only mean of getting a high-end job is through earning a scholarship (which in itself is a hard feat due to it only being awarded to 10 students and also the fact of corrupt politicians making sure their kids get it.  I'm born Catholic, but I've just given up believing as the relgion is just too much for me to handle, why let people suffer if you have the power to stop it. 

I hate that I have to eat, I hate that I have to excercise, I hate having to remove waste products and I hate having to talk to people as the conversation will always be one sided. I also hate that your life and phenotype  is determined by the genes you inherited. I hate that we are forced to hace a sexual preference and gender.

My mum tells me that life is a blessing and that I should thank the lord and her for bringing me into this world. (I'm called a miricale child in the family as when I was born either me or my mother had to die in order for one of us to live. But the eventually found a way). I hate this, why should I thank you? Why should I be greatful to be in an existence of pure misery and hardship. Everyone else has it better except me. I don't owe my mum a signle god damn thing. She felt horney one day and the result of that was my conception. I didn't ask to be born and I didn't asked to be brought into a world. I'm not smart I'm not fit and I certainly don't have any wisdom. Girls don't like me, Men don't like me. My teachers hate me and my parents just give me everything, I hate it. No one thinks of me. 
I just want all this to end I can't stand it. I don't like existing.

153,"Over the past few years, I've developed a serious case of misophonia. It was originally set off by both hearing and seeing people eat messily/with their mouths open (still drives me insane in just about anyone), but it's recently advanced to other sounds, like typing (I have my headphones in blasting music just so I don't have to hear myself typing even as I write this out), or my dog licking herself, or even just people speaking in a certain way. It's gotten to the point where I avoid eating so I don't have to hear myself swallowing. The mere thought that I might be making the kind of eating noises that annoy me makes me feel sick and puts me off food. I'm constantly on edge. People are starting to notice that I don't eat much.

155,"Okay so this is a long one and I'm still having anxiety about this situation so it might get jumbled. For starters, my husband and I are living in two separate states for work reasons and not for separation reasons. 

A few weeks ago I got messages there days in a row, one on pinterest, two on fb messenger, and one on instagram from 3 different woman saying that I need to know my husband is cheating on me and attached screen shots of text messages from him to them. Within those screenshots were photos of my husband but I know that those pictures were sent to me cause I've seen them before. The ones from Pinterest and fb were the exact same messages in the exact same order with the EXACT same time stamps so *ding ding ding* that was a red flag for me. The only thing different were the selfies apparently sent back to my husband. So I called him and told him that I think our Google photos/accounts have gotten hacked. So we deleted all of our social media and changed the passwords on pretty much everything. 

What I didn't know was that before I deleted my Instagram my family members were getting messages saying that I was being cheated on and I needed to know and that they needed to make sure I knew because I wouldn't believe them. I can't find any of the people that sent those messages. And I deleted my social media before getting any screenshots *shoot me* because I didn't think it'd get this out of hand. 

NOW, I am living with my parents while my husband is gone with our 2 year old daughter and my parent punched me and told me that I needed some sense knocked into myself because Im stupid to go back to someone that is cheating on me. 

I need advice because I feel lost and I don't know what to do. Ive already talked to my husband and his friends, and his roommates, and they all tell me he's not. I've tried to tell my family that your Google account can be hacked? Is that not true? Is it really that secure? Help me. ",16Jun2018,1

163,"So a little background story:
We live in an abuse household and my sister is the only person that I see as family. Sure there is my dad and my little brother, but I would say that I just like them. The abuser here is my mother. She has beaten us since we were children ( 6y/o). But here I have to say 'it isn't as bad as it was', she mainly beats my older sister because of things does she does (like throwing her dirty lingerie behind the bookshelf/ keeping them in her purse/hiding them somewhere in her closet etc etc) and I have to admit that I completely can't stand that 'disgusting' side of here and I know that what she does is wrong and my mother has every right to be angry HOWEVER I would/will never tolerate her beating me sister. You shouldn't beat someone else no matter what they have than. My sister is not a dream child you would like to have I get that BUT my mother isn't any better!! Once she has beaten me with a tree limb and I had purple bumps on my arms, she she has intentionally squeezed my sister's open burn wound, she has beaten me because I stood up for my sister, she has beaten all of us because she was angry at my dad not coming home .. and a lot more. Because of all the abuse at home my sister and I grew really close and we to this day sit in our bedroom and talk about everything, analyze my mothers behavior, I tell my sister not to keep pushing her/ give her advice, we talk about my mother a lot, I tell my sister that she isn't right as is not my mother BUT what my mother does is still wrong etc. What I want to say is that we have a strong bond.

Up to my problem:
My sister wanted to borrow money and I gave it to here because why not? After some time she gave it back to me. But then it started she asked me for 5$ a few times a week I gave it.. she asked for 60$ 
Because of her driving lessons (my dad always gives her the money for that but she just doesn't pass the test and retakes it so she needs more money and she doesn't want to ask my dad for it (SHE STILL HASN'T PAST IT)... she asks me for money all the time even today I gave her 40$ for something!!! I'm stupid I know but I can't say no
The funny part is that she has a job where she earns money and I don't, I just save up every $ that my dad gives to me (for that I don't eat when we take a break in school). 
It PISSES ME OFF that she keeps asking for more
She borrowed over 150$ from me, it may sound like nothing to you but that's money I need to save up and takes 1 year to reach! Even though I keep saving (and starving at school) I currently have 280$... just because my sister keeps asking for money I can't say no to her
Best part she asked me if I can buy her a freaking Michael Kors bag for her upcoming birthday in August because she is aware of the money I have.
I want to cry.. I feel like she uses me.. I know that she loves me (she tells me that I'm family for her) but I feel used. 
I have prom in July (17th) and I have to buy my own prom dress and the invitation which btw cost 9$ per person 

My questions:
Am I overreacting? (At the end of the day she is my sister)
Should I keep giving her money? (She tells me every now and then the amount of money I have given her and that she will give it back soon)
How to I tell her no? (In case you think I should not give her money)",16Jun2018,1

172,"Okay, kind of a silly title, but I couldn't phrase it any other way. Let me explain; I see people on Facebook or wherever posting about the stuff they get up to, and they seem to have a great time - but it's always the same. Everybody is always posting ""omg going out tonight!!!!"" or ""at the pub with the lads"" or something thereabouts, and I don't understand.

So, for me, I'm posting stuff like ""really enjoying Throne of Blood"" or ""this \[experimental techno\] album is really cool"" and I am laughed at? I don't really understand. It's like, I'm actually different from probably 90&amp;#37; of people (I must emphasise FROM MY EXPERIENCE) yet I have no friends, and people usually avoid me and I've come to the conclusion this is the reason.

If I were to give a quick comparison:

\- Week (them): Work or University

\- Week (me): Work  


\- Friday night (them): Going out getting drunk and being racist  
\- Friday night (me): Watching artsy foreign films and reviewing them for a massive blog I'll be releasing soon  


\- Saturday night (them): Going out getting drunk and being racist  
\- Saturday night (me): Playing a video game and reviewing it for a massive blog I'll be releasing soon  


\- Sunday night (them): Complaining about their hangovers whilst watching football with their girlfriends  
\- Sunday night (me): Usually bored out of my mind with nobody to talk to.

Why is it that we're at a point in society where if you're interested in knowledge, learning, culture, history, etc. you're shunned from said society, yet when you enjoy getting drunk every Friday/Saturday night and having one-night stands (then coming to me about your problems like I care, guy or girl (yes, this happens more than you think)) you're accepted. I'm dumbfounded by how this works.

So I guess my question really is; ""How can I become like everybody else even though I hate it but it seems the only way to actually have a fun time of life with people that maybe want to talk to me for more than thirty seconds?""

And I start to slip, start to think that maybe I could learn to like him. That maybe it's time to stop fighting and see the good in him...

He didn't touch me or anything like that, and I don't think he meant for it to be creepy (he doesn't really understand boundaries, and there was only one bed) but I told him not to and next thing I know I'm waking up next to him.  And I told my sister about it and she told him off for it but every time I try to bring myself to like him I think of that and all the stupid shit he's said and done and I just can't do it.  I don't know if I should talk to him about it or not, I don't know if that would help.
And I don't know what to do, because he's replaced me and I'm fighting for nothing. I've never felt so alone as I did in that hospital, I wanted so badly to tell someone how I was feeling but it had always been my sister I'd tell so... there was no one now. I don't know what I'm fighting for anymore. I just want to go back to when my sister and I would tell each other everything, but I can't because now she only tells him. I miss her.",16Jun2018,1
177,"So they dated in high school, which was fucking 5 years ago and he still can’t get over it. He was abusive, both physically and emotionally. He slapped her a couple times near the end of their relationship, wouldn’t let her talk to guy friends, etc. 


He used to try calling/texting her from different phone numbers that weren’t blocked, but that stopped about 6 months when she threatened to go to the cops if he tried to contact her again. In the beginning he was mean, then after a year or so, he turned apologetic, and remorseful. 


He still has an Instagram dedicated to her though. He posts weird ass shit like the exact time it’s been since they split up, stories when they were together, “All I want is a happy life and you”, “5 years ago I made this to share my feelings, then realized you saw and used it for jealousy which backfired, and I lost you forever now”, among other things. 

He also had a post like 4 months ago, saying “it’s been 5 years, it’s time for me to move on and actually commit.” Since then he’s made his account private, but he still updates his bio.

About a year after they broke up, he started working at the same outdoor mall that she did. One time, he came up to her when she was waiting for a ride after the mall closed, and said “hey”, and she said “why are you talking to me”, and they said a few more things, and he left her alone. He used to show up at her house right after they broke up. 

Should we go to the cops? I have a conceal carry license and am way bigger than him, so the only thing I worry about is when she’s at work. She doesn’t think he’ll do anything",16Jun2018,1
178,"Hi!
I've been friends with a woman since the past month. I really enjoy her company. It was yesterday that I texted her, 'It's really good to have you.' It was platonically said. But she took it the incorrect way. The reply which I got was 'Have me? You don't have me.' Call me innocent or idiot, but if I would have know that it would lead to this, I wouldn't have texted her that. Now, it seems that she has lost confidence in me, but honestly I don't understand what's really wrong in saying that. I may be terribly wrong, though. She stated that, 'Previously, I thought that you were good with words, but now I think that you aren't.' Now she says we should not talk. That too is unclear, whether she meant it to be permanent or just for the time being, as she didn't reply to this question. Another question I wanted to ask you guys is, is 'Ask me something.' a weird question? She said that it was weird and misunderstanding and pointed this out when I was trying to convince her that she didn't take the 'Have me' issue correctly. Now, I'm at my wits end on how to gain her trust again. I think calling her will further make the issue more complicated.",16Jun2018,1

-She hated me because I did some things.

-She’s a hard one, and very dominant.

-She treats me both crap and good. Mostly good but mostly bad (really weird.)

-I do have feelings for her. But my mood decreases when she says something that hits me QUICK. She always hits me real deep when I’m with my bros or something. Sometimes days get broken because of my mood - because of her and me being angry at each other.

-EVERYONE including some part of me tells me to remove her from my life. I told her that we’re just friends but that lasted for 2 days. Sometimes I’m like “fuck off id rather date x”. Is our relationship unhealthy? I’m so so confused why she broke up after 3 days and still loves me",16Jun2018,1

182,"There is a guy I met back in school. first day of secondary he was in my class. We were never really friends, and it always felt like he didn't really like me. I was a cocky prick, he was kind of narcissistic.  At one point in school he even asked if I wanted to fight him, I never really know why....

Anyway - 15 years later, I have now done graphic design studies for 4 years, I am unemployed, and he is now running his own influence/media company. Our paths have crossed many times and he even liked an instagram post the other day. I am in a tough spot and we have multiple mutual friends. I think its only a matter of time before he starts asking me to get involved with the thing he is doing. But truth is I don't really want to and I don't really want anything to do with him, which again he will probably take as a slight towards him, but its not really. Im just scared of getting involved and not being able to back out. Making my life hell on earth.  He is pretty powerful nowadays and I am a nobody basically, Maybe we could benefit each others lives? Maybe he could ruin mine.

But I just don't want it, I want to go back in time, not even get involved with graphics and just get a simple job. 

I feel like my life is heading towards destruction and don't want it. I feel like I am in a vulnerable position now and don't really know what to do. 

Hes not the kind of person you want to get on the wrong side of, he is tough, he used to fight a lot back in the day and he has a lot of power. 

I just dont want to be anywhere near him honestly and just want to go and live in another country and start a fucking fresh, but I cant. 

The worst part of all this is, I have made countless mistakes in my life and I am sure he has something on me that he could blackmail me with if I choose not to comply with him in the future. 

Its honestly this kind of situation that makes me understand why people would want to kill themselves",16Jun2018,1
184,"I’m 26, and even I’m astounded at how’ve I’ve held on for this long and put up with all of the crap that my family has put me through. I live in the SF Bay Area, where it’s more than normal to live with your parents practically until you get married because of how expensive the cost of living is out here. That’s no difference with myself; I live with my family, even at my age.

Growing up, I’ve always taken the emotional insults of my parents, telling my brother and I how stupid or worthless we were. No matter how highly we performed in school, things were never enough. I was never allowed to participate in any extracurricular activity, go to any sleepovers, talk on the phone with friends, use text message, or anything for that matter. I strictly was raised to just go to school and use the computer for even additional homework that my parents assigned us. Needless to say, my brother and I were exceptional in school, but not in our parents’ eyes. 

Any slight misstep out of place led to a severe beating, which consisted of a wire hanger or bamboo stick lashed allover our bodies with sure scars and bruises to show. What would count as a misstep? There were no definite rules that dictated if we were right or wrong. One day, parents would say that we’re lazy, and need to help with chores like washing dishes or taking out the trash. The very next day, we could be facing lashes for having touching the dishes in the sink, as we have no right to be able to touch said dishes. So my life has been a constant tiptoe of avoiding trouble, even if I would not know what could possibly get me in or out of trouble that day.

As a kid, one parent worked during the day and the other worked ar night to be sure that there would be someone watching us 24/7. In a perfect situation, you would think that was sweet and ideal for young children, but that only maximized our potential of being insulted or beaten for any living moment of our lives, and on top of that, it meant fhat someone would be sleeping at odd hours of the day, and because we were not allowed to leave the house, we had to live in silence as much as possible.

Fast-forward to now, a lot of these things may not apply to me anymore since I’m out of school and no longer have to have a guardian on my watch at all hours, but I am still heavily bounded by rules and are pushed heavily conservative ideals that I don’t believe in. I am 26, and I’m still not allowed to stay out past 11p, see/meet any “boys” (or, even worse, seek the companionship of a woman), drink any alcohol, express an opinion about something that ny parents have never considered, take a side in a sports spectacle, cook a meal that I wasn’t ordered to do, eat a cuisine other than the 5 “approved” cuisines, drive past a 20mi radius from where I live, sleep at another individual’s home, and so so much more. If their overly unnecessary rules weren’t enough, I can’t have an opinion of my own. My family is strongly against LGBTQ people and rights, and expects myself to agree. They are also racist and discriminant against all non-Catholic faiths. In fact, they spend most of their days making racial slurs about individuals, while also pinning people’s “animal-like” or other negative attributes to their religion. Even though I’ve been raised listening to these sort of brain-washing sort of thoughts, I personally feel strongly against them even though they would beat me should they found out the way that I had felt. And trust me, I’m not an individual that hasn’t stood up for myself for my rights and my beliefs, but I have certainly faced consequences.

I have a decent career going on for myself right now. It’s pays pretty average for San Franciaco, but I also still have to pay for school loans, an auto loan (because my super old car recently broke down and had to be replaces), and other expenses. So in my financial situation, I don’t have a lot of money to play with. I badly want to uproot my family and break my ties with this toxic family that I have. The familial situation is so bad, that I’ve literally never met an extended family member. I literally only know my immediate family due to broken relationships that my parents had caused long before I has been born. I don’t want to look back and am potentially looking into getting a second, and possibly even third job to financially support myself to do so. But has anyone else out there break off ties with their family and start out new?

189,"Hey everybody. It's really hard for me to come to terms with my realization, but I read a few ""are you in an emotionally abusive relationship"" and I checked many points when looking for an abuser. I don't even know where to start, but I feel really ashamed I could be doing things that would make my partner feel trapped in our relationship, or could even still be with me due to Stockholm syndrome or whatever.    

I've been in a relationship with my boy for 2 years (I'm 27, he's 20). We met in a dating site, grew attached really fast, and we started living together a couple of months later (he had to move for university, and we didn't want to break up).  We have a lot of affection for each other and cuddle at each opportunity.  
Now, a lot of our time together is mostly gaming, working on assignments etc. We don't go out often, partly due to having a very small income (I work part-time and attend a master's program, he studies undergrad) and partly due to us being...well, couch potatoes. However, the few times that I want to go out, he will almost always refuse, for a few different reasons. He will go out with his fellow students occasionally, saying he needs to socialize because he feels ashamed they got the nickname ""recluse"" for him since he says he often refuses their invitations. He also spends a lot of time studying with a few fellow students at their homes. We live in a small one-room apartment and otherwise spend a lot of our day together. Also we don't really have sex anymore, maybe once a month and that's about it, there is always a new reason to refuse, like, pain here and there, stress, assignments, not in the mood etc, the pool of excuses is constantly growing.    
 
We argue often. Usually, it's because of a very random thing, like I will say something that happened to me, and he will say ""i don't think that's the way it is"". It's all good until that point, I feel like he's invalidating me. I've got a pretty short fuse, but my coping mechanism is trying my hardest to get him to stop talking to me, because I get out of hand when I lose control (it has happened to me like 3 times in my life?). He always refuses to stop talking, and it just goes on until I do something that really shocks him and makes him stop (a heavy insult, or sometimes I just can't hold it and beg on my knees for him to stop). Then I just don't want to talk to him for long times, hours, because I need to cool off, but he always tries to fix things after, like a few minutes, which makes me more upset and me not wanting to talk drags on indefinitely.    

This is the situation that goes down every time we argue, it's almost what you'd call textbook. When I'm ready to talk again, he will start off by saying it's my fault and I should try to see things clearly, and think about how we're partners, not enemies.    

Now, this is the part I feel guilty about. I'm the one that always loses his cool first, and derail the situation from a simple argument to a fight. The derailment refers to me wanting to cut communication so that I can calm down. However, I feel like him wanting to solve our issue is him actually wanting to get me madder so that he can be in the right after our fight. I mean, it does put him in a higher position than me that he speaks so calmly while I'm flushed and keep telling him to stop talking.  
I don't know what to do.  
I wouldn't have thought I'm an abuser but reading other people's experiences made me anxious about locking him (and me) up in a bad relationship.  
Any advice for my situation?

 Recently I was diagnosed with Ambivalent Attachment Disorder, which explained a lot. Basically I am depressed because I am lonely and I am lonely because I can't trust anybody. The only time I was truly happy was 6 years ago, when I was 14 and had a girlfriend. Now I see why after 5 months of bliss and love I suddenly did not have feelings for her anymore, she became attached and needy, she loved me, she was surrendered to me and I could not accept that. 

Soon after, 1 year of depression and 5 years of anxiety followed. 

The Gods know I have tried, and I have tried hard, but women will always do minor things that will involuntarily upset me with shameful feelings which I will fail to control, sending me to my spiral of depression. 

I cannot be attached to another human being, but I have always had high libido. Thanks to the gods I am not in financial danger yet so hookers are an option.

194,"Hey everyone. I was hoping to get some advice on my current situation and a situation I am going to find myself in in approximately 5 months from now.

So I am a 25 year old guy living in a suburb of Orlando, Florida. I live in an apartment with 4 other people, live in a room that isn't even a bedroom, and work part-time from home as a graphic designer. I have a bachelor's degree in graphic design and do not have (and can't afford) a car.

In approximately 4 months I will no longer have health insurance, and in December my lease on this apartment ends. Also, of course, I have student loans that I will eventually need to start paying off.

For reasons that are far too complex to delve into here, I can't really leave this apartment until my lease ends in December (unless an absolutely *amazing* opportunity presented itself.)

So anyway, I need serious advice. In December, when this lease ends, I need to be living cheap somewhere else (open to anywhere in the US except the Northeast), have a full-time job &amp; health insurance, and be living in a place that allows me to get to my work without having a car. (The job does *not* have to be related to by graphic design degree.)

Oh, and in addition to this, the *absolute minimum* amount of money I would need to be making in this new job is $20,000 yearly (obviously I'd love more, but that's the minimum).

Can anyone offer me any sort of advice? Where should I look? How can I find a job before moving to a new location? As the title suggests, I'm very close to being screwed, and I'd really prefer that didn't happen. I'm open to any and all suggestions.  Thanks.",16Jun2018,0

His sister is (32/f) is dating a guy in his thirties aswell but lives downtown. He owns a bike and that's it understandably since he lives and rents a place in the city.

My family has two cars one van and a smaller car . My family usually drives them. I prefer not to drive currently.

Guys, I'm just really lost in this situation. Idk how I'm suppose to feel, idk what I'm suppose to do with the little information I have. I just dont know.

A few days ago my bestfriend and I go check out this bar/club. while we were waiting in line to get our drinks this guy approaches me which isn't anything unusual. He starts up some small talk then offers to pay for my drink. I was hesitant at first then eventually say sure. I say thank you to the guy, grab my drink and make my way through the crowd of people with my friend. And that's the last thing I remember. 

I woke up four hours later in a hospital bed. Then I black out again I'm in a car with my boyfriend driving home. I black out one more time and its morning. 

Apparently our uber driver thought I was ""too intoxicated "" to be taken home so he took me to the hospital. I dont remember much from the hospital other than waking up and asking where I was. 

The next day I asked my boyfriend what happened.  He said I was ""really fucked up"" I was being mean, slurring my words, falling over. Which I am really confused about. I only had two drinks the whole night I was out. And I've never blacked out forgetting hours and hours of events. If I black our from drinking I'll usually remember some of the night, even if it's just bits and pieces. 

Another thing is, I have bruises on my thighs and back of my legs and my left shoulder was/is in pain. The bruises look like handprints and that scares me. 

Do you guys think theres a possibility that I was roofied or something similar? And if so what should I do about it? I've been crying because I'm scared that something might have happen or someone did something to me. 

My boyfriend thinks I just drank too much even tho I told him I only had two drinks. I drank on an empty stomach so he thinks that might have played a role in my black out. I tried to tell him it didnt feel like a normal drunken black out. 

I showed him the bruises and that seemed to make him worried, but he doesn't know what to do either.

208,"I'm not quite sure what to do. I've been friends with ""closefriend"" (CF) for almost 40 years. We aren't quite close like family, but she is one of the few people who I consider a good friend. When we lived near eachother and both had young kids,  we saw eachother often. Our families went to the same church, we had kids a year or two apart who carpooled to school, and were always on the others invitation for holidays and events. With empty nests, we continue to stay up to date through regular email and occasional visits (we live about two hours apart.)

So the problem... I was recently sent a link to a home made video of her daughter (FD) and some man playing around naked together. FD is an adult so whatever, i should just forget about it, its not my business. But first, this man is not her husband. Second, i sort of doubt FD knows this video is posted online. And third, FD actually states her real full name in the video. Wtf? I'm not sure when the video was made, but within the last few years.

So i knew FD had gotten into drugs, been arrested, and went to rehab. This of course put a big strain on the marriage, but her husband was a huge support. When CF told me all this she was in tears. Between this and the problems with her other kids (4 kids, all over 25, all have/had drug and alcogol problems) she is an emotional wreck. FD was the good one. Married to a great guy, 2 beautiful healthy kids, and was a seemingly happy stay at home mom.  Then the drug thing happened out of nowhere. Her husband sold the house to pay for everything and FD was living at a sober living home after a 30 rehab program. 

So, do i just forget about it? It could harm any career or job FD gets and worse. I mean, she said her real name! Should i send CF an anonymous letter/email? I want to at least tell FD in case she is unaware its online, but I don't have any of her contact info. And the cheating part... i don't know the details of their marriage, but thats definitely not her husband. Shouldn't he be informed? What if it causes a divorce because he didn't know?

What would you do? If you have questions for clarification just ask and I'll try to answer.",16Jun2018,8
209,"I'm dealing with alot of stress currently as i found out i was illegally adopted (practically stolen) by my adoptive parents and have since moved to live with my birth mother (I was abused by my adopted family and they stole around 40K from my biological great uncle). This ties into the trip i took to the Hospital. I don't remember much of yesterday morning but my mom says that I woke up screaming in pain, I remember going to the restroom and vomitting and having uncontrollable pain in my gut, then i remember vomitting in my moms car on the way to the hospital then i remember being at the hospital and getting seen but I started vomitting and \_\_\_\_ed myself and i got really upset and everything touching me hurt (the blood pressure reader and the thing they put on my finger). The nurses think that I either ate something, am having unbearable stress, or someone drugged me at my work. I passed out twice on the way to the hospital and i normally get food poisoning as i have a weak stomach and because of that I avoid eating out and ate the same things my mother did, and she didnt get sick. Either way i have changed my diet to hopefully start healing and the nurses sent my vomit to get tested. I just don't know where to go from here, im still feeling nausea the day after so i doubt its food poisoning and im beginning to really consider my anxiety lately and try to make peace with the fact that i \*may\* have been drugged.

210,"I noticed I often have headaches but recently I always get the tension/ sinusitis one.  

There are several types (caused by periods/PMS, being too tired, dehydration, stress, migraines etc) but this one is the most common.

I also feel like my nose is blocked and my face feels tense near my eyebrows and on my nose or on the forehead.  My mouth always feel dry so I drink water all the time (even when I am at home) amd it ease the pain a little but it restarts quickly.

I suspect I might I have a sinusitis infection caused by allergies  (probably), is there a way I get rid of it quickly without any medication? 

My temples are pretty tense too, I get in general at least 6-8 hours of sleep and I generally eat 1-3 a day. When I go out I tend to feel a little foggy/tired but I thought it was dehydration because it ceases a little when I drink water...

What can I do? (A few years ago I had a sinusitis infection that caused me some problems)

211,"Back story: her dad and my mom got married when I was 7 and her dad legally adopted me. We share no blood but she is the closest thing I have to a sibling and we were fairly close growing up, despite a 16 year age gap. 

I'm not sure how to start this, but I hope that you can understand between ramblings, and it's super long so I really apologize (\*\*there is a TLDR at the end, but doesn't provide as much information\*\*). My sister and I were fairly close growing up, but as I got older, she started to flake more and more on me and what not. I never really cared because I held her on such a high pedestal. Flash forward a decade, my sister has two children who are slightly older than my two children. The only difference is, she's separated from her husband and I'm still with mine. While I had my children, I was away from home and a stay at home mom. She is a general manager at a very popular restaurant in our hometown (hasn't always been, thats been recent, but she's always been in a very demanding position within the restaurant). Anyways, when she had her second child, her husband's mom and step dad moved 3 hours to our hometown to be closer to the children and help out as much as possible since my sister's estranged husband is an executive chef. 

When I had my children, my family was stationed in Germany (now we live 6 hours away from my hometown). I didn't have family around, nor did I trust anyone to watch my kids unless we went home to visit (which were very few and far between). My sister, who is now in her mid-40's, relies on my parents so much to babysit that she doesn't know what the struggle is to live somewhere and figure out childcare for herself. My parents have told her time and time again since my dad retired to only use him as a last resort when it came to babysitting, especially since she always asks them within 12 hours of her needing care - which I find incredibly rude. He doesn't have the patience he used to and quite honestly, her kids are absolute brats (she doesn't discipline them very well as she always wants to be the 'good guy' when they are staying with her). She didn't quite seem to care and would call on my dad to watch the kids every time she needed a sitter. Him being the dad he is would never let her fall on her face or be in a position where she was struggling, just as he would do in a heartbeat for me, so he always said yes. It became apparent that once she started relying on my dad to watch the kids when it was her estranged husband's days with the kids (isn't it sort of a rule that since it's his days to watch the kids, it's his responsibility to find childcare, too?). 

Now that my mom has developed a pretty bad knee problem, my dad refuses to leave my mom by herself for very long (with good reason because she can hardly walk around and has trouble doing normal tasks). Wednesdays are my mom's day off during the week, so thats when she and my dad like to spend time with one another and run errands. When this first started happening, my sister flat out told me that my mom being injured has been an inconvenience for her because she has to try to find other means of someone to watch the kids (which is harder now that the kids are out of school for the summer). She even said how it was silly that my dad wanted to be with my mom. I asked her why she didn't ever ask her husband's parents to watch the kids and she told me how they are staying with a grandparent right now because one is dying and needs 24 hour care, and she even added that they take turns watching the parent. I asked her why they couldn't come to the house to watch the kids when they aren't watching the grandparent and she didn't have a single thing to say about that. I didn't want to mention how one Wednesday, after my sister called my parents asking for them to watch the kids, they ran into her mother-in-law while shopping. The following weekend was Mothers Day, and they never heard from my sister, but instead learned from my niece that my sister made a dinner for her in-laws, without bothering to even call my mom. Yes, the same in-law that never helps with the kids.

Anyways, recently I went home to visit for the first time since we've moved months ago. I tried to call my sister for 3 weeks trying to plan a day while I was up to hang with her and the kids and the only time she ever responded was to ask me if I could help her with a present with her boyfriend. It really upset me because whenever I am around her, she's literally ALWAYS on her phone, and when I am texting her, I see her on Facebook but I can't even get a response from her.  So without planning anything with her, I drove home with my kids to visit for 4 days. The first day I'm there, I actually hear from her and she asks what our plans were on Tuesday (we had arrived home Monday afternoon). I told her I had no intentions of leaving the house because it was such a bad drive between traffic and getting lost, etc. She sounded disappointed but whatever. I wasn't about to put in extra effort to see her when she literally makes no effort with me about anything. I invited her over Wednesday night for dinner since we were having crabs and had a few people over anyways. She gladly accepted. Fast forward to Wednesday night, she, my mom and I are standing on the dock behind my parents' house. She turns to me and asks me when we were leaving. I originally planned on leaving Thursday morning but decided to stay until Friday morning because my kids had no quality time with my parents (we had guests over every single day I was there and it was exhausting). She asked if I would watch her kids Thursday from 10a-4p. Clearly annoyed, I told her no because my dad and I were going to do something with the kids and I only extended my trip so that way they could have time with my dad. I was about to lose my patience with her because both times I visited home while we were stationed in Germany, she did the same thing to me, asked if I would babysit her kids because she couldn't be bothered to find someone to watch them. I had to cancel our plans to go to the zoo and various other places, plans I had with my dad for over a week before I flew home. I approached her about it last time and she said it wouldn't happen again. She does this with my step sister, too. My step sister visited from out of state and stayed with her. My sister had a babysitter lined up but then cancelled on the sitter saying 'my sister is here, I dont need a sitter anymore' without even asking my step sister if she would watch the kids.

So I was clearly pissed off, that this is happening yet again. I stormed inside and slammed the screen door. I didn't want to spend my last day home babysitting kids, who my kids dont even like being around. I heard her say (because I was still within earshot) 'well I wasn't asking her to babysit, I was asking if Dad would'. And it pissed me off even more. I quickly told my dad everything and asked him to please say no because my boys wanted to just spend time with him. He said he would, but then she quickly came in the house, pulled him aside, and started crying about how she doesn't have anyone. My dad obviously said yes, because again, thats just how he is as a dad. I was about to just yell at her and call her everything that everyone else has been wanting to (at this point - both my parents roll their eyes when they see her call because she only ever calls because she needs them). He kept trying to talk to me and I couldn't even look at her because I didn't want to put my dad in a bad place or make dinner awkward for everyone. I was so angry. I didn't even say bye to her before I left. 

I had a talk with my dad the next day, before her kids showed up, and told him everything how I feel. He said that he's going to talk to her about him being taken advantage of and everything but eberytime he does, my sister literally just does not care enough to listen. She looks at my parents (and the rest of our family) like they're just free babysitters, without taking into consideration that we don't want to do it. I had a whole text/paragraph of things i wanted to tell her, but now I'm second guessing whether I should say anything at all because a) I dont live in town anymore so my parents would be the ones dealing with her drama, not me, b) it would ruin my relationship with her or hers with my parents, and c) I'm not the one she constantly takes advantage of. My dad was okay with my saying something, my mom, too, but now I'm on the fence about it all because I just get so much anxiousness wondering about the consequences.

However on the other hand, I'm thinking, I'm the only one who sticks up for myself against her. Maybe if she heard it from someone else, she'd finally grow the hell up and learn to stop relying SO MUCH on my parents. Maybe she'd finally get the hint that everyone else enjoys their days off and vacations just as much as she does. What do I do?!

TLDR; my sister takes advantage of my parents when it comes to babysitting her kids, doesn't care about my kids spending time with my parents when I'm visiting from out of town/country, and I'm not sure if I should finally stand up to her.",16Jun2018,1

My brain calmly responded with, ""Oh, I should just swerve off the road and make it 21 like me."" I didn't feel scared or nervous at the thought.

218,"Hello, so a bit of info about my relationship with my family, I am not the most social person when it comes to family. Don't get me wrong, I love them and respect them all and we talk when we sit down together, BUT I:

- don't call them or text them just to chat up/share a funny story etc. (even with friends I just text to schedule a drink or something)
- don't discuss my problems with them (neither with my friends), I like to solve them myself

So back to the topic, my brother was recently diagnosed with cancer (as I understand it seems to not be serious and is easily treated), mum was crying all the time constantly talking about cancer even to this day. I messaged my brother in the following few days as I wanted to wait a bit, because in my head I thought everybody was messaging him and stressing him out which would drive me nuts. So basically I said I'm there for him and that he shouldn't worry too much and to be positive as best as he can, messaged him a few more times before his surgery.


He is now recovered from surgery but is waiting for further tests. Mum seems to still be acting weird all the time, urging me to talk with him and ask him to go out for walks (we never did this and it seems to me I shouldn't start acting different because in my head it would make him feel weird and that I'm only doing this given the situation he is in). My brother and I chat when we're together and I joke around with him and try to make him laugh and bring a bit of humor to the situation. He seems normal just a bit down sometimes, I really don't want to talk to him about the illness because honestly I wouldn't want people constantly just repeating conversations with me about the illness if I was in his situation. 

My family is saying that I'm not a good person because of not socializing and being more empathetic with him. This makes me feel like a piece of shit, like I'm an outcast and some kind of fucked up psychopath, but my view is that we should act normal towards him, we should try and keep his spirits up and not just fucking talk about cancer all the time. Am I wrong for thinking like this??

**Please try to read the whole story**

**TL;DR - Brother got cancer, family says I'm not offering enough support nor enough social contact , I was always a bit asocial with my brother and feel that it is not good to force more talking with him now just because of the illness (i'm trying to interact normally with him and joke around with him like we always did, but cant help feeling like something is wrong with me because of my mum's comments)**",16Jun2018,7

221,"My retired parents want to move to our neighborhood (my wife and I are in our 30s) and I really, really don't want them living so close by. What should I do?
Background: My parents are good people-- never abusive, extremely kind, always well-meaning. Nevertheless, it would be an understatement to say we never got along in my teenage years. The fighting was nearly constant, and by the time I moved away for college the very sound of my mom's voice was like nails on a chalkboard for me. We continued to fight intermittently throughout my 20s, mostly on the phone (I lived in other states and didn't go home very often). Finally we started fighting less in my 30s, and nowadays we mostly get along well and everything is (generally) peaceful. I see them once or twice a month. 
But: being around my parents still makes me *extremely* tense. It's not their fault, but it's like I'm getting constant flashbacks to our many years of fighting-- I get so tense that just a few hours in their company leaves me feeling drained. And the slightest disagreement makes me want to scream at the both of them. (My mom remains rather judgmental &amp; nitpicky-- the usual mom traits, in other words.) I love them, but the sad truth is that I don't want to see them more than once or twice a month.  
Now they're retired and they want to move to our neighborhood. I tried to explain to my mom--pretty clearly and gently, I thought--that we would love to live closer to them, but that living *that* close would be too much for us. But she thinks we're going to want and need her help when we have kids (as we're planning to do) and it sounds like my parents are planning to move close by anyway. Very typical of my mom: she generally assumes she knows what's best for others regardless of what they claim they want, and what's best for others--in her view--is usually more of her. 
What should I do? I don't want to ruin my relationship with my parents or to be cruel to them, but having them in my neighborhood could make things even worse. Either we keep avoiding them to maintain sanity (surely very hurtful to them) or we grin and bear it, which would probably result in my (and possibly my wife's) losing our minds...

225,"This is a very long story so I'll try to shorten it. I just got out of an abusive marriage with a man I had two children with. He was brutal throughout most of the divorce, basically showing that he hasn't changed. I believe most of his abusive tendencies come from his mother because his mother has been abusive to him since childhood and puts him down all the time when it comes to his dreams and whatnot. Another side note, he lives with his mother.
Anyway, we had this idea when we were together that there was this particular city that we wanted to move to. Obviously, we never did. But now, he is bringing up that idea again but he will only go if he can take the kids, which poses multiple problems. 
I was granted residential custody of my children. He has had them for the past few weeks because I've been too much of a depressed mess for multiple reasons to even get myself out of bed. I told myself that as soon as I get a new job and get into therapy, I will be good enough to get my kids back. 
This city is about 2 1/2 hours away from the one we live in now. I would either have to make the trip to see my kids or move down with them and just live in separate housing. 
And finally, I don't trust him. I know this would be a good move for him but it will only be him and his buddy living with my kids, with an occasional babysitter for my youngest, as my oldest will be starting school. He doesn't have a good past. I don't know what to do. What would you do?

226,"Tomorrow is my 21st birthday so, as is traditional in the US I made plans to go out drinking with friends tonight after we go to a local festival. The festival is an hour away in a larger city and my friends insist the bars are better out there. 

The thing is, I made plans to get breakfast with my parents tomorrow followed by going out for Father’s Day/birthday drinks. I DO NOT want to be hungover and tired on my birthday but if I go out with my friends than I probably won’t be home until 3 am and then have to go out for breakfast at 8am the next day. 

I fucked up and I don’t want to do it.  But as an introvert I have a rule that I don’t cancel plans entirely. My friends are also my ride to the festival and I know they REALLY want to go to those bars anyway. Ideally, I’d rather go out for a drink or two in my hometown and be in bed by 1 but I don’t want to be the party pooper who cancels out. I tried that idea by framing it as “then nobody is DD” but the DD doesn’t mind so now I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be selfish and ruin the plans for everyone else, but I also don’t want to be tired and hungover on my birthday.

I’m still going to the festival today, but can I convince them to leave early? Should I look at getting a ride home early? Would it be lame not to drink on my 21st?",16Jun2018,1
227,"25M in Canada to start this off. I have very little educaiton out of high school (4th class power engineer certificate, family forced me into a trade and I never went into it after school) and worked my way up to a store management position with a Telecom company in Canada. I've only been with the company for 3 years but I feel like my life is at a stand still. I've even moved to a new city but my job is the same thing every day. It pays pretty decently (40k salary + commission, avg 55k/yr) which is why I'm hesitant to leave. 

My hobbies don't have the same effect anymore, I can't focus on games and I haven't touched my guitar in months. Even the gym which I was passionate about going to for the last year and a half is getting stale if I switch out routines or not. I've thought about school but don't want to commit 2-4 years of my life to something and wind up hating it. I'm consistently in credit card debt (something happens, put 2k on the card, takes 4 months to pay off, repeat) and my savings outside of work accounts are non existent.

I've got reps working for me with plans on what they want to do and jobs lined up by their parents for 6 figures straight out of college. I feel like I'm not living up to my potential and like I'm just drowning trying to figure out what I want out of life.",16Jun2018,1
228,"Hey guys. I need some help/advice/whatever. This is my second summer living up north and like last year, the mosquitos are trying to murder me. My arms and legs are still covered in little scars from last summer, and now I have new bites and scabs from scratching. My self esteem is really starting to take a hit. 

Do you have any advice for me? Maybe how to get my scars to fade? Or how to repel the insects without having to bathe myself in a high concentrate deet until late September? 

And please don’t tell me not to scratch. I try. Really. But I have SO many bites that it’s just too much. I have a clump of like 5 bites on one ankle.

229,"So, the thing is: most of the time I feel disconnected with the real world when talking to friends and family. I'm a 23 M and when we're talking I see their worries and problems and think ""oh well, this is absolutely nothing"".

They complain about doing their taxes or finding a job or some crisis in their relationship and I can't relate to most of that, since most of my worries are in some existencial level, things like ""What is my purpose in this world?"" or criticizing capitalism. Or trying to find the most absolutely free way to live life. 

I don't see any problems with my way of seeing things per se, but in those conversations people tend to be a little unconfortable or annoyed by it. It bugs me a lot because I don't relly know what to do.   


Your advice would be appreciated. ",16Jun2018,0
231,"I’m not a 100% sure this is the right sub for this, so let me know if it’s not. But I really want to get this of my chest and maybe get some advice and just talk to someone about this.


I feel like I’ve been going on and off on a huge ego-trip for the last two years or so. Ocassionally interrupted by periods of depression and more surface level self-loathing. 


And some moments of wholesomeness, too. At those times I’m being myself but not worrying about it and I experience a fair bit of positive emotion. I get a glimpse of normalcy, or my ideal self, I guess. How I feel I should be all the time. Very frustration when I notice I’m leaving that state.


I’m a bit of a narcissist, although I don’t think it’s very apparent to others because I’m quite introverted. I want to be great and amazing. I feel like I am great also, in a way. Or that I’m entitled to being great. 


Admittedly, as I’m writing this I’m already ego-tripping a bit in my head about how I may come across to you guys. It’s awful, I know. Really makes me want to punch myself in the face. Because the things is, I feel this way because I actually hate myself so much. And I can’t handle it, so I’ve created mental loop-holes for myself in which I feel more okay. And that has now become a problem in and of itself.


I feel really guilty and ashamed about this whole ordeal so I don’t want to talk to anyone about it in real life. And I’ve seen some memes referencing some of these things so I thought I’d share.


What are your thoughts/advice?",16Jun2018,1
232," Hello.  
\-  
I am currently in the situation of desperately struggling at home at the moment. I have several mental health issues such as aggro-phobia and Bipolar disorder to name a couple and i am being given financial help by the government. I live with my parent and while i struggle very much to ever mention this to my counselors as i don't want to get them in trouble, they are very emotionally abusive and it causes me awful distress. After a long bout of testing/balancing medication i am able to keep my mental state relatively balanced, as long i am isolated from others. I think a big part of why i struggle with other people is because of how emotionally abusive they were throughout my childhood and a lot of the lies they have told me. I struggle to believe anything my parent tells me and this causes major issues as they make an effort to turn my family and their friends against me. they regularly play a victim and people believe them. I don't usually care what people think but i worry that her friends are going to lynch mob me one day. Even my grandparents who love me dearly don't view me as they used to. I have heard my parent insinuate things about how awful i am to them. My grandparents are one of the main reasons i have not committed suicide. I am of age to move out and might be able to manage financially if my disability payments weren't going on rent currently. I would do my best to be able to look after myself, but i have a pet who i couldn't bare to part with. My pet calms me down greatly and really keeps me grounded. I often worry that my parent will try to get rid of my pet against my will as they have done in the past. Crying and begging doesn't help. I have in the past convinced myself that due to my position i deserve this abuse for living at home and that i should put up with it but i am really struggling lately. There is also a matter of inheritance, there is a house in my family that was originally coming down to me and i would love to live there some day, but it was changed that it will be in my parents name when it is passed down so i am almost certain it will be sold, maybe if i stayed and put up with this i could have some kind of future. There are no shelters for men in my country and if i were to get somewhere supported by the government i'm sure they wouldn't allow my pet who i need and feel responsible for ( i could never leave him with my parent). So i am left with the options of going to live with my grandparents  or learning some coping mechanisms to help deal with the situation at home. Moving in with my grandparents would feel like i was massively inconveniencing them. They are retired and meant to be enjoying what is left of their lives so dropping all my problems and my pet on them would be an awful thing to do. I have booked an appointment with my counselors but i don't feel comfortable being as open there as here due to the relative anonymity. So i have come to ask if anyone has any tips to help me deal with my parent while i live with them or inform me of any other options I may have. ",16Jun2018,1
233,"i'm in a moral dilemma right now, so i matched a girl on tinder and things got off at a good start and we wanted to meet up the next day, she lives in a small town away from the city but was able to get a ride to the city(i wont be naming any real names or locations for privacy) we had an awkward  40 min meet up where she said almost nothing and was on her phone almost all the time and i did all the asking but she only answered with yes and no and vague answers. later she wanted to come to my place  (i'm 18 so i still live with my parents so it would be even more awkward) and i was down or that but she went away to meet her friend before we got there so nothing happens. the next day i got a snap from her saying that she was running away from home and trying to find a place to stay, if she couldn't  she would kill herself. This kick me into over drive and i tried to talk her out of it, giving her the locations of an abuse shelter, suicide hot line, and my phone number if she just wanted to talk this out. keep in mind this is three days after i matched her on tinder. this went on for about an hour before i called the suicide hotline myself for advice on what to do and they told me i couldn't do anything more, at least not for that night. now i wont go into any details of what happend to her but from what she told be in was bullying and a lot more and tried i to sympathies with her and get her perspective. the main problem is that she doesn't want go get help with facing these problems. our conversation went on for about 2 hours and was me mainly trying to get her to seek professional help instead of talking to me,  a guy she barely knows but she refused at the 3 hour mark she stopped responding and i lost my patients for this.

the next day she sent me a snap saying that she wants to cuddle again. i´m just so lost, was she doing this for attention and if so its so fucked up but i want her to get help but i cant give it to her. ",16Jun2018,4
234,"I say ""seeing"" extremely loosely. We aren't together. We are borderline dating. We met within the past few months. We work in the same shopping centre in different retailers so it makes hanging out easy. We've been on a few dates. We are holding hands, quick kissing on the cheek, using pet names, sending x's and kissy emojis, talking constantly etc.

She is a little older (I'm 19 she is 24) which has admittedly made it awkward to approach her with any serious talk about being together, but it was going to happen at some point just based on how flirtatious we've been.

It is super early in but it was going extremely well. We've been talking about getting her passport and taking a trip overseas. Like honestly it's ridiculous how good it's going.

I must have jinxed myself somewhere because yesterday I found what seems to be her boyfriend.

She is from a small town in another state and moved here maybe 4 years ago. I've only seen her house in pictures, but paying for Uber's I know she lives in a local suburb. She says she lives with two dogs, her cat and her gay housemate.

I found the boyfriend in the comments of a year old photo flirting and saying things a boyfriend would say.

It's a year old comment though. There hasn't been anything I could find since. Her page says she is single... why am I worried? He is obviously an ex.

I'm worried because she is in his current display picture. Mind you that photo as well is over a year old and there hasn't been an update since. But surely when you break up you change your photo of you and your ex. Right?

My heart sunk into my stomach. I went full Facebook stalker mode and almost wish I hadn't. His cover photo is the dogs she has shown me. His relationship status says he is with her still, he works at a bar in the area she lives. He is from the same high school from the same small town she is from. He moved here to my state around the same time, quite obviously with her. At least 15 of her family members are still in his friends list. From the looks of things they began dating in 2014 around about the same time they both moved here.

Like there is nothing in over a year to suggest that they've been together and her profile (save from the odd comment here and there from ages ago) is free from anything to do with him... but why has he not changed any of this on his Facebook profile if they had broken up?

It doesn't look like he is overly active on this profile. He posted a photo back in july last year and liked a birthday post someone had left him this past May, so it's possible that he just hasn't got around to updating his profile. But I feel like that's a big leap.

I'm really bummed because I really like this girl. I feel like I'm being lied to but don't want to ruin anything by bringing it up the wrong way. I don't know how to approach this.

How would you ask her about him? Do you think it's the housemate? Would you be comfortable dating someone who lives with her ex? What would you do if they are still together and she just hasn't mentioned it? Should I be thinking homicidal thoughts?

I need your help random strangers from the internet. Because right now I just want to cry and watch cartoons.",16Jun2018,1
235,"I got together everyone’s checks 1 month ago and I realized in our pool tip we were missing 160. I said to my boss there’s a mistake with the booking and left a note with all of our tips and the math left in the safe, I write notes because he’s never there and that’s how we communicate.

I was at work he pulled me into the back room and threatened firing me for going behind his back.

Pretty much it ended with me crying and him telling me not to discuss tips with others because I make 60% and they make 40% and they will get jealous, in that check yes I had high tips and nothing was taken from me but it was taken from the others. I haven’t checked again since that day because he was so aggressive and I listened to him.

But 2 days ago I checked my tips for my personal tips and I’m missing 70. My friends came in on my birthday and tipped me really well because it was my birthday. I asked him about it and he got mad again pulled out his laptop took my check and pointed out the fact that he gives me overtime .. as if that’s the reason I didn’t get my tips.

Idk what to do.

Yesterday he said today he’s going to have me sign something because I won’t stop asking about tips..

I don’t want to sign it I just want him to be honest and I don’t want to fight with him. I love my job but he’s wrong for what he’s doing. ",16Jun2018,264
236,"\[24 M\]

Just looking for some advice on how to cope with the fact that I missed out on a lot of stuff because of my family. I don't want to say that I would have been perfect without them, but the things that they put me through (I won't go into details) made me choose a life that I didn't really wanted. They made me think about their problems and not mine, I could never really communicate with them about MY problems, we had a lot of issues while I was growing up (alcoholism, depression, suicide attempts, a lot of money issues, fights, arguments), they made me feel responsible for them ever since I was 13-14 years old. Because of that I was never like my friends. They seemed always so carefree and could enjoy things. I didn't go out that much, I didn't have a real girlfriend until 23 y o because I was always sad and worried (I had a few flings, but nothing serious). I am sorry that I had to feel like an adult when everybody was carefree. Apart from that, even though I worked some through college, earlier that 99&amp;#37; of my friends, I still couldn't afford almost anything, because I had to support the household.

I hate myself now for caring so much for others instead of me, because they never once tried to think that I might not be ok. I always tried to talk to them, but they always thought that it was just a phase and it will pass.

I started detaching about 6 months ago, and it felt great. I went on trips, I got a girlfriend, I was a little bit less worried with everything. But now it got to me that I missed out on a lot of things. And it got me so bad, I can't even focus on school work or work properly. Please, if you have any advice, please let me know.",16Jun2018,2

Whenever she goes out clubbing she tries to make her cheat on me, she cheats on her boyfriend too whenever she goes out. She goes to my girlfriends work, but doesn’t see her there that often. She also is on my girlfriends college course and uni course. Which is why my girlfriend doesn’t want to cut her out her life, because she’s on her course and won’t be mates with anyone or something like that. But she’s so toxic and she is literally just a bitch. Am I wrong for arguing with her to cut her out her life or is that the thing she has to do.",16Jun2018,1

242,"I've been struggling to come to terms with not ever receiving any acknowledgment of a 'breakup' from him.

FOR CONTEXT:

Here is how the ""Breakup"" happened: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/8o3f6w/i\_texted\_him\_to\_break\_it\_off\_and\_gave\_him\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8o3f6w/i_texted_him_to_break_it_off_and_gave_him_one/)

This is what he was like: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/7twzrh/my\_23f\_date\_24m\_nagged\_me\_on\_my\_first\_visit\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7twzrh/my_23f_date_24m_nagged_me_on_my_first_visit_to/)

We were LDR and had found each other on a dating app. I got really attached in the 2 months leading to when I visited him. He seemed like everything I had been waiting for. The trip wasn't all that amazing, but he kept me hooked by promising to fix things. I stayed.... for too long. Now, he walked away and left me with an abundance of questions.

I remember once he was listing his exes and said a girls name, and paused to tell me she lived in the same city as me. I don't remember why he said they broke up, but even if I did--I don't believe she could be a terrible person. She lives 10x a nicer life than he does, seems very happy and active. She's a dancer and just graduated college in a marketing major. They were long distance too, and dated 3 years before he met me. I think they were together for less than a year. His string of exes were all pretty much between 6months-1 year.

I know I have to find my own closure and accept that it's over. But I struggle to understand if it was just me who he treated this way. I never could fully grasp who he was as a person. He did a 180degree flip on me. I was looking forward to him coming to my city, like I had visited him. It never happened. I don't know if this was his plan all along. I don't know what triggered him.

If I could gain anything from her (by messaging her on fb) that could help me accept that this whole thing isn't my fault, then I think it's worth it. Worse case scenario, what could happen?

I know this sounds very odd and maybe not the right thing to do, but I'm unhappy right now. And knowing there is someone in this city who could possibly understand me and could maybe relate to what happened eats me away. She and I have about 40-50 mutual friends on fb. I've never really met her, but she seems like a good person.",16Jun2018,0
243,"I live in the suburbs and my street is moderately busy during the day. But yesterday morning, I forgot them on my door lock. The next morning, when I went out, I found them on my door lock. There is also a storm door in front of my door but you could see them if you looked for it.

244,"So about a week ago I had the biggest eye opening experience of my life at a party, (on many different substances). When I almost got with the girl of my dreams and then found her fuckin some other dude in a tent....., The sight I walked into sent my mindset barreling down to the phsycopathic tendencies my alcoholic father stitched into my brain. I waited for a car to come by on the high way to jump out in front of it to end it all. But just as I flinched to jump, the memories of all the good times I had with her and all she taught me in life went rushing through my mind. and to take my own life at that moment didn't feel right for some reason. Someone or something told me I have to go and find her to get this figured out. So I did. And now after talking for a while and figuring out what we both want from each other was the best choice of my life!, Talking is the best medicine in life don't stay quiet!. But now that I got that out of my way I feel now as though I can't be stopped and I can do anything I want In life, but now from being depressed for years and finally getting out to see all NEW FACES and COLOURS, it's very overwhelming!

250,"When I was younger my Mom had full custody of me, but being a single mother didn't leave her a lot of time to be with me after school, so eventually she allowed my dad supervised, and then later unsupervised visits with me to help carry the load. He was an alcoholic and used to verbally abuse me when he'd been drinking. It was a tough situation but he would always get back on the horse just in time to keep me around. One night when my Mom picked me up from his house I was crying uncontrollably. She kept asking me what happened but I refused to tell her, saying only that I never wanted to see or talk to my Dad again. And I didn't. And we moved on. I moved on. I forced myself to forget, and pushed the memory as far back as possible, until even I didn't have a clear grasp of what was real.   

Fast forward a decade or so later to me ""losing"" my virginity. I was with a boy I trusted in my room and everything was going well, until suddenly I started to see flashes of that night with my Dad. Images and feelings started to boil up and I had a full fledged panic attack ending with me naked in a ball on the floor and my Mom coming in to discover my secret guest. That was when I told her what happened for the first time. I didn't want to press charges, I wasn't even sure if what I was remembering was the truth or something made up. I was confused and for the first time in over ten years my Mom brought up the last night she picked me up. I had no recollection of that moment until that point. She told me that she and my godmother always had doubts about my safety around him, and that they both knew in their hearts what really happened that night but never brought it up in hopes of sparing me pain. I was furious. They knew, and never did anything ? They knew, but never said anything? They knew but never allowed it to be my truth?    

There were many breakdowns after that. So many times when I doubted my sanity, doubted my memory, doubted my worth, doubted my safety, and my family. Every time I would try to push it down it would find a way to bubble back up - mostly when I was blackout drunk. After years of therapy and long, tearful nights, I finally decided that I was going to confront my dad about it. I don't have any social media, so I went on my boyfriend's Facebook, found my Dad, and sent him a message on Facebook. It was a personal, thoughtful message. I didn't accuse him of anything, just said enough to where he'd know without a doubt it was truly me, and asked if we could meet to discuss our past. His response was heartbreaking. He told me that I wasn't his daughter, that he had a new family now - a wife and kids - and didn't want to talk to me. He ignored me, and with that took any hope of validation with him. Can you imagine what it's like to have the memory of a 20 year old rape but have no proof? To believe that you've been sexually assaulted but not truly remember it? I'm so confused, and go back and forth between blaming myself and blaming him. Did i make it all up, or is he just being the cowardly bastard he's always been?     

This leads us to present day. I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years and he's amazing, but ever since trying to reach out to my Dad I've been very standoffish. I don't want to be touched or cuddled and the thought of sex literally repulses me. Not sex with him, sex in general. I dont even masturbate anymore. Even seeing sex scenes on TV and in film makes me uncomfortable. He's been super understanding throughout our entire relationship, but I can tell he's reaching the end of his rope. I don't want to lose him because I can't be physical, so I suggested maybe he seek his physical needs elsewhere, thinking that would make him happy, but it didn't. He says he loves me and only wants to have sex with me, but every time we try I get flashbacks and end up crying. I don't know what to do. ",16Jun2018,3
251,"Let me introduce myself. I’m a husband and father of two young children. I am also a special education teacher or 23 years. This time of the year, my stress  level is through the roof. I teach middle achool learning disabled children who I give 110% of myself to day in and day out. This doesn’t mean that all is amazing at work. They still are pre-teens/teens and will try every moment of every day to keep you on your toes. I am also a loving father and husband. I give 120% to my family, they are my whole world. I come home after tutoring two special needs children after being a full time special education teacher and either play with my kids then pass out from exhaustion ( or on the most difficult days, just pass out.)  It’s June and it’s been a really difficult school year. 

My wife has been “retired” for three and a half years. She worked in an office for 20 years and when we lost outlet baby sitter for our toddler son, we decided to pay someone to watch him would cost about as much as her salary and she left to become a full time mother and homemaker.  She food shops, does laundry, cooks, and chauffeurs my children and her sisters kids to and from school daily.  She also has a denied addiction to her phone...which I feel interferes with daily chores.

This morning I was awoken by my son, who wanted breakfast. He told me, “I tried to wake mommy, but she won’t wake up.” This is the weekly routine. It doesn’t matter how exhausted I am, I have to wake up to take care of the kids on the weekends because she refuses to get up till she’s ready. Even during the week, I spend 15 minutes going back and forth between my wife and children trying to wake them up. If I didn’t wake them, the kids would miss school.

Anyway, now to the reason for my title. This morning I woke up, and realized how much of the house was in shambles! I tripped over toys, there was food stuck to the dining room table and chairs, there’s stuff littering every surface of furniture (chairs, wall unit, table tops, the ottoman). I get up and out of frustration begin angrily cleaning. Raising my voice at my kids to clean their toys up and how it’s not fair that daddy works two jobs to support them and they can’t even keep a clean house. My wife wakes up and puts it all on me for “yelling”, and starts crying that I don’t think she does anything during the week. On top of that, I decide that the responsible thing to do is stay home and organize the house, but my whole family is mad because we have been “trapped in the house” and it’s the first weekend we can go out.

Is it me???? Am I wrong for ignoring everything for weeks on end then blowing up??? I feel like I work two jobs and the least they can do is make sure the main living areas (kitchen, dining, living room) are clean when I get home.  

Btw, my user name does not denote my personality. It was used for an email I entered contests with.

253,"This past week was one of the most stressed and tired I've been this year.  I'm taking summer classes but I've been very stressed because of alot of factors: 

1) The class is one that I've failed many times so I'm really scared I won't pass so I've been studying for about 7 hours every day after class until 1:30 am and I wake up at 8.  

2)  My mom is going through chemo/radiation for her cancer and she constantly asks for me to do things for her around the house so it stresses me out in the sense that she has some manic episodes some day.  

3) I'm really scared about the future.  In 2 weeks,  I start another class which runs for for 7 weeks so that means 6 hours of class, 5 days a week for 4 weeks.   Then after I finish these two classes, I have one week of ""break"" which is being used for jury duty.  Then the following week, I start classes again at my university.  I have failed so many times and failure cannot be an option for me right now. The week before this past one, I had finals for my university and I just got off a really bad quarter so theres been no break for me.     

After school yesterday, I just stayed in my bed and slept for 5 hours. hoping that would cure my condition.  I don't know what I should do....I literally cannot function properly at this rate.  ",16Jun2018,2
254,"basically, i’ve had a crush on this guy for all 3 years of high school so far. we were close freshman year, he got a girlfriend, she broke his heart. same thing happened throughout sophomore and junior year. he is the most genuine, smart and funny guy i know and it literally pains me to see him heart broken. he has thanked me for being a good friend and bla bla bla. we’ve recently started talking more again and actually hanging out in the same group and my feelings have 100% not gone away. I started noticing everything i say or post or like is connected to how he would think about it and what he would see, i came to the conclusion that it’s not healthy so i deleted everything (except reddit lol). but i feel so disconnected from my friends, it’s the beginning of summer and i don’t want to loose contact with everyone before senior year. Part of me says i shouldn’t give a fuck and try to be happy away from social media, but the other desperately wants to keep in touch with him, even if he’s just seeing my posts.

255,"TLDR:Brother hits me, take away his toys. Sister says Im mean, dad threatens me. Brother gets toys back, lessoned not learned. I am the bad guy. Behavior continues...

So today, my younger brother (3) kept yelling and screaming and throwing toys while my father was sleeping. (He works night shifts) I kept trying to calm him down but then he starts hitting me with toys. I take the toys away, keeping them out of reach. He starts hitting me hard to get them back. However, I explain he has to be nice and quiet to get his toys back. My sister (12) is in the room too, on a laptop with earbuds. All she hears is him whining. She insists I give the toys back, I explained he shouldn't learn that things are just handed to him. She feeds words into his mouth like ""Daddy said to give my toys back."" (Bullshit. I knew he was sleeping and knew they didn't go to him.) I refuse, ""He needs to learn to not hit people to get what he wants."" She tells me that he's just a toddler. ""Would you rather have him be spanked like we were when we were his age then?"" She's silent. I tell her to mind her business and go back to whatever KPop she was listening to. She refuses, saying she wont go until he gets his toys back. i tell her ""Have fun standing there."" As i casually eat my PB sandwich. 

10 Minutes past, my brother woke up my dad and told him I stole his toys. And my sister telling him Im being mean. Dad storms in, saying hes taking 'my toys' aka action figures and collectibles. I dont react besides getting up to wash my plate. My brother mocking me and laughing ""I GOT MY TOYS HAHAHA I GOT THEM HAHA"" over and over. I go to my room and lock it. Pissed off that they promote this behavior. This is not the first time they behave in this matter that I am the bad guy.

I had a family member come to me with their addiction to meth this morning.  They haven’t told their family yet but they came to me because I’ve been reaching out to them after I noticed something had to be going on.  I’ve tried to be emotionally supportive and tried to talk it out with them and what steps they need to take, but I’ve never dealt with this before so if anyone has any advice or suggestions. I would greatly appreciate it.

So some more info:
Their addiction is crystal meth
Their immediate family will not be very supportive of the situation
Their immediate family is not well off, money wise, due to another person in their immediate family with a terminal illness
They are in debt from college (failed out due to drug use) and lost job (also related to drug use) so they are broke and immediate family can’t help.

Does anyone also have any tips or suggestions to deal with these, as well as something hopefully free/state covered or something?

I’m the youngest of my family. I was always told I was the accident, my parents had my siblings take care of me, and I only had myself really all of my life. I don’t consider myself weird but I guess I’m at least a little different because I have a hard time making &amp; keeping friends. I care about everything way too much. As soon as I remember sad memories from my past, I can break out crying immediately. It seems like the feelings of all my experiences my entire life are built up inside of me and fresh in my mind at any time. Ill just start thinking about my lack of friends or companionship growing up and feel so fucking bad for myself. I want to go back in time and give myself purpose or friendship in any way possible to the point that I burst out crying when I think of those feelings I experienced as a child. 

Everyone tells me I need to stop overthinking, things aren’t as bad as they seem, I need to let go of the past, etc. I try so hard sometimes and in the past it has worked, but it seems like I’ve become even weaker mentally than I was before and it seems like I can’t even help myself sometimes. I have obsessive thoughts over things that affect me negatively in any way and it’s really fucking hard to control them or even ignore them. 

I just want to be able to wake up in the morning and be excited for the day ahead of me, not miserable and reluctant to get out of bed. It feels like I’m just a person blessed with misfortune and no matter what, I’m gonna have a shitty day if I get out of bed because my entire life has been one major disappointment. I don’t even want to bother trying to have good days anymore but I know there has to be some way to let go of shit and just move on with a weight lifted from my shoulders. That’s all I want, to just not feel the pressure from my entire upbringing and life in my head and on my shoulders all day long.

270,"Posting from a throwaway.  Pertains to Oregon.  Not sure if this should be here or /r/legaladvice.

If an employer publishes a salary range, is there any requirement that the top amount be achievable?  My position is salaried and union-represented.  Same employer about 20 years, with the department 15 years, senior classification 10 years (roughly the time we went salaried).  Let's say the salary range is $50,000 - $75,000.  If you're at max, and if you've been there long enough, you're eligible for a special salary, let's say $80,000.  Annual COLA at union contract anniversary and 1.5&amp;#37; additional on employee anniversary.  Being salaried, there are no step increases.  Let's say I'm at $60,000.  During contract negotiations, the salary range tends to change but the employees stay at the same point.  If the salary range moves to $55,000 - $80,000 and the special salary moves to $85,000, I'd still stay at my $60,000.  They don't adjust employee salaries when they adjust the range.

Is there any requirement on the employer to make the max and the special salary achievable?  Upper management has tied the hands of the line managers limiting their discretion on additional raises.  Assuming all stays the same, I could expect to reach max in around 20 years.  Several other senior people are around the midrange as well with no reasonable prospect of achieving the top of the range, which means no chance to achieve the special salary, regardless of how hard we work or how good we are at our jobs.  Yesterday I just heard of one person who supposedly gets the special salary; he's been there much less time than me (hired in 2012 or 2013).  I don't know how he got it unless he negotiated a high salary to start.  My colleagues tell me the way the game is played, you quit, go somewhere else for a couple of years, then come back.  Or move to a different department and come back later.  That's not my way and I can't play those games well.  I also like most everything else about the environment.  It just seems like, if an employer is going to advertise a range, the max needs to be achievable somehow.

Am I off-base?  I've talked to the union and they seem sympathetic and ""we'll work on it in the next contract"", but this kind of thing can stretch out a long time.  Lest there be any questions, I'm a good employee, well-respected in my department, tend to be a first-go-to person for many problems.  My managers like me and respect me.  I've never been subject to disciplinary action. ",16Jun2018,0
272,"This is a bit of a long story, but my parents have always been good to me, a little harsh, but always good to me and were good to people I brought home.

276,"Hello, I’m going to cut straight to the chase. I have a degree in public health that I completed in Canada, and I have been offered a job in UAE specifically Dubai as a public health analyst. The salary is 22,000AED which is roughly $7500CAD. My accommodation is going to be paid for, so this excludes rent. I went over the contract agreement, my brother in law who is a lawyer went through the contract with a fine tooth comb and said that this is a solid offer. 

It’s a new country, new language (my Arabic is very colloquial and broken) and kind of new culture (I’m Muslim but not Arab). I can’t get this same compensation here in Toronto where the same job requires a Masters degree. Plus, I have a couple friends who moved to Dubai a couple years ago so I won’t be totally lonely. 

Here’s the issue.

My parents are guilt tripping the fuck out of me. My parents are 54F and 62M, and they’re aging. I have a younger sister that’s 17 but she’s not responsible. Admittedly, I help them with everything. I do household chores, clean, cook, book doctors appointments, and help them. And trust me, I love my parents to death. I was lucky enough to have a wonderful relationship with them growing up. They’re the coolest people I know, but ever since they heard of the job offer they’ve been really down. They keep saying how I’m leaving them and saying the house will be so empty. My dad said his heart hurts, my mom saying that I’m her baby. 

I just feel so guilty and there’s knots in my stomach. I originally wanted to ship my car but I’m going to give it to my sister so she can take over for me. My parents are well off- my dad is a chemical engineer and my mom runs a business from home, it was never about money. But it was more about how I cared for them and tended after them. They keep saying they’re old, making outrageous “what if” scenarios, like “what if I fall down the stairs” “what if I have a heart attack and nobody is home” etc etc  

The job starts in September but my parents keep encouraging me to apply to jobs here even though Toronto’s professional job market is over saturated and competitive.

She did things that made me think she liked me such as playfully hitting me when I said stupid things, always sitting next to me, taking selfies of herself with my phone, and doing this weird side hug thing. 

I lost the chance to get her number on the last day, but then thought, “Fuck it. She has an Instagram, so I’ll just make one and message her.” And that’s exactly what I did. At first, she didn’t really know it was me, and our conversation was very subtle. She took long periods of time before responding to me, and then finally she asked who it was. And I told her. 

She said that she figured... and then after that it was just message after message after message. When it seemed like our convo was dwindling down, she sent me pics of her dog out of nowhere, and we started a new convo. 

So a couple of things I want cleared up:
1. Moments after she found out it was me, she said something along the lines of wanting to hangout with the *gang*, meaning she wants to hangout with our friend group. Since I’m sure she does like me, what’s the easiest way to just ask for just us two to hangout? 

2. At this point in time, we haven’t talked since yesterday. The last message was sent by me, but it wasn’t a question. It was just me reacting to something she said. Since then, we haven’t spoken to each other. I’m not sure if I should be the one to start the new convo, and if I do, what’s the best thing to say?

289,"My work experience has been sort of abnormal so lately I've been a bit confused as to how I'm supposed to fill out job applications.

My first job was a regular job at a restaurant. I worked there for 2 years from ages 17-19, so I don't have any problem putting that down.

My issue starts with my work history after I quit that job. I had to leave because my mom came down with a serious illness all of a sudden and I had to feed her, dress her, drive her to appointments, give her therapy...etc. 

It was suggested to me that I apply to get paid by the government to be a caregiver, but I was never able to do that because my dad doesn't trust the government and he decided to just give me a few hundred dollars a week.

This leaves me with a bunch of standard job application questions that I'm not sure how to fill out. Do I list my dad as my supervisor? It feels so awkward to do that even though that's all I really have....Also, he no longer pays me since my mom has gotten better, but I still have to drive her everywhere, get her groceries, and drop her off at doctor's appointments, so do I still count this as my current job even though I have no income? And if I can't count this as my current job, what am I supposed to put for start and end date? I don't even remember when I stopped getting paid. Also, I know it's frowned upon to put family as references, but since my dad was basically my employer, isn't it also sort of odd not to put my last boss as a reference?

I don't really even have an official record of the work I did to help my mom...It's not like I got a standard W-2 form or anything.

What do I do? Every time I sit down to fill out an application I just feel so ridiculous and lost....I'm 25 now and the only 'normal' job experience that I've had is 2 years of restaurant work and sometimes I can't help but feel foolish.

And this isn't to say I don't love my mom and that it wasn't worth it to care for her. I just don't like the situation that all this has put me in.",16Jun2018,2

Why I'm here: their excessive PDA in our common living area makes me unbelievably uncomfortable in my own home and I was wondering if anyone had any advice as to how I should approach talking to them about it.

I'm not some single cynical monster, I understood what I was getting myself into when I moved in and have happily lived with them for almost 2 years but it's reached a point where they're just too comfortable with me and something has to be said. Let me give some examples:

1. I have frequently walked in on her straddling him on the couch and making out in our joint kitchen/living area, just today, while I was in the kitchen, she had her legs wrapped around him with her dress hiked up while he was on top of her.  I'm no prude but this kind of scene has become a usual occurrence and makes me feel so awkward that I end up abandoning what I'm doing and leaving the room for a bit. Not to mention the privacy of their bedroom, complete with closing door, is a mere 3 metres away. I don't understand how I'm the one that ends up being more embarrassed in these situations or why they think it's okay in the first place but here we are.

Showering together- which is not a problem usually as they have an en-suite bathroom and it's none of my gd business, except for the fact that I am privy to this information because they regularly leave their bedroom and bathroom door open while they do so. Earlier this week I heard her shout across the flat ""baby are you gonna come take a shower with me?!"" These are things I don't need to know. I've started closing their bedroom door when I notice it but they apparently haven't taken a hint. 

Am I being ridiculous? How to do I broach this subject with minimum embarrassment/resentment? I'm thinking I just bring it up with her casually, as she's the usual instigator of these things? ",16Jun2018,1
293,"tl;dr This woman that got rehired has been giving me strong vibes, but when iv asked her if she wants to hang out she always gets uncertain about it (when other people are around). I really like her but i don't know if she's into me and maybe i'm reading this wrong

Story;

- 6 months ago i met this girl, she's a little socially awkward in the sense she doesn't express herself and hates emotions (sometimes it seems like she has none) i befriended her and we hung out
- We were in my house and i think she wanted to have sex but i didn't make a move because i wasn't 100% sure
- She got laid off, but came back around 2 months ago
- When i go to her area most times we have a ball at work, we get each others sense of humor, we're almost always on the same page on a subject, love talking to her she does stuff like only calls me by my name, laughs really hard at my jokes, calls me hilarious, maintains eye contact with me for 30 seconds to minutes at a time also often her lips are hardcore pursed when we talk, she calls me her superman when i help her with stuff.
- But sometimes she gets weird when its just me and her, like she she'll walk away from me and walk back to me as if to avoid me, or sometimes she insist we wait on one of her friends when im trying to have an engaging conversation with her, and sometimes she'll ignore other guys if i'm talking to her
- 2 weeks ago i started asking her if she'd like to hang out, she told me ""what would we do"" and i said ""lets go ice skating"" and she relied ""iv haven't been ice skating in awhile"" and we kinda agreed but didn't set up a date
- Around the same time she broke her phone, so i lost her number, iv told her to give me her number and she told didn't know it ""i believe it since nobody had her number and she can't bring her phone in"" but 1 week ago i ask for number again, she told me she still doesn't know it until finally saying ""well i think i know it"" and i said forget it, it's cool, i don't know if i believe her here. 
- We don't talk everyday but when we do we still have engaging conversations 

Today during break i went to her area, we talked and i brought her a coffee and also brought up if she wanted to hang out after work, to which she said ""i don't know maybe, i have to get my boys ready for summer camp"" (she has 2 kids, i also have 1 kid but nobody at work knows) She ask me how my area was and i tell her its sucks but whatever, its a good work out so i don't mind, then she giggles loudly/awkwardly at that for some reason. Slightly off-handedly she tells me she can't wait to get her boys out of her hair but that she ""wasn't sure what she was going to do"" so i bring up that we should hang out if we get out at the same time, break ends.

At the end of the day i ended up walking with her with a group of friends, i got along with the friends and made them laugh more then her if that means anything. As all of us are walking i sort of go ahead with her and whisper if she still wanted to hang out, she looks down and says she she couldn't, she had to do laundry, i asked her if i could at least get her number then and she she said something about leaving her phone at home? asked her if she wanted to use my phone and she said no its ok, asked her if she's sure and she says ""YES"". And i feel like i'm bugging her for her number even tho last week i straight up asked her ""you still haven't given me your number, like do you even want to give me your number? or am i bugging you.."" which she said in a low sad tone ""i don't mind if you have my number.""

Anyways i proceeded to get along with her friends well as she kinda lingered, somewhat quiet sometimes staring at the ground all mopey before saying goodbye, as i left i recall her getting more talkative and playful. I just feel very annoyed by her right because she's acting like i'm bothering her when she's giving me all these vibes. But to be fair I should add that she's socially awkward and has trouble expressing herself.

Not sure what i should do. I really like her, and i think she's giving me signs but at this point any attempt to get her number or just hang out outside of work she gets all uncertain and i feel like i'm bugging her, yet she gives me nothing.",16Jun2018,0
294,"Backstory.

I have this guy (we're sort of friends - not close). And he says some weird gay stuff to me which are discomforting. The more weirder part is he targets me only to make his gay comments out of all our friends like every time. it's like his mouth is programmed to say my name when a weird thought comes to his mind. i am always like careful around him and i don't know what makes him more comfortable to target me.

He asked me about my view on gay people. I just told him, i don't have a problem with them.  as long as one keeps their d\*\*\* in their pants and stop waving it to me, we're good.

And one day when he was drunk with this other guy ( i don't drink or smoke) he was like, \*\*\*\*(myname) do you wanna have anal sex/let's do anal. i even have that on video because i was filming them while they were drunk. i should probably delete it.

He says he is not but i think he might be and just hiding it - i never asked him. just what i gather from what he speaks. 

he often said that he sometimes hires like a prostitute to just let them sleep in bed with him and do nothing and he seems happy about it. i mean that's weird and he says the prostitutes like him and i am like dude it's because you give them free money.

This other day we were eating these lengthy rolls (there was a third person) and he is like \*\*\*(myname) how do you like having big things in your mouth. Ughh that is so gross and i am like dude it is just food. 

The worst one was this. I had just came from the shower and he and three other people were in my room. i have my boxer shorts on and i am applying lotion to my legs and he is like ""you look like a sexy newlywed (beautiful) bride in a lingerie"" 

Aaah. Now that was fucked up. 

i just awkwardly laughed it off and he is like ""yeah blah blah bla"" trying to make his comment more clear.

\*\*\*\*\*\*these are just some of the things he does or says. I can't write them all.",16Jun2018,1

298,"Hey _____,

I’m really sorry for everything that happened between us. You gave me many chances to change, but I wasted them. We both thought my main issue was my bad mindset, but it turns out I had been living with untreated chronic depression for the past decade. You never deserved to be blamed for my problems. My life had been hijacked by the black dog of depression, and I’ve only recently regained full control of myself. 

The end of our friendship served as the first wake-up call for me to do extensive soul-searching. I discovered I was making a bunch of poor lifestyle choices, but changing them never fully solved my troubles. The second wake-up call came in March. One day I was walking through campus and suddenly felt lightheaded and indifferent to everything in life. I could barely feel my footsteps. I got really scared that if I was alone, I would’ve committed suicide, so I immediately went to be with my _____ crew. I completed a bunch of online tests, and discovered I likely had clinical depression. A month back, my doctor diagnosed me and prescribed some antidepressants. After taking them for a few weeks, I’ve seen a huge impact and I can finally be my cheery, enthusiastic self again. 

The only thing that remains is the lingering guilt over everything I did. Whenever I lashed out at you, I always felt extremely hurt and ashamed afterwards, because I knew you didn’t deserve it. I knew something was wrong with me, but I didn’t know what. And because I didn’t know what, I didn’t know how to ask for help. You became my primary support system for a disease neither of us knew I had, a burden you never asked for. I’ve never seen you this mad at anyone before, but I know I deserve it, because none of this is an excuse for the way I hurt you and betrayed your trust. I’m sorry you had to deal with all my bad behaviour. I’m sorry I made so many lame excuses for it in the past and wasted the chances you gave me. I’m sorry I went from motivating you to succeed to being a burden in your life. 

I truly want to thank you for seeing the good in me and opening up to me when no one else would, eventually leading me down this path to change and recovery. Being best friends with someone as kind and pure as you was a privilege I didn’t deserve. You were the first friend that truly cared about me and first person outside of family that I explicitly said I cared about and loved. If I were to see you right now, I’d want to give you a big hug. I can’t imagine where my life would be, or whether I’d even still be alive to write this, if our paths hadn’t crossed two years ago. However, I realize that truly caring for someone means respecting what they want. I crossed the line many times during our friendship, and I understand why you wouldn’t want to be friends with me again. So I’ll leave it up to you to decide if I deserve another chance. If you decide it’s not worth it, I respect your decision.  

You’re an amazing person and I know you’ll do great things in life. I’ve never been more proud of any friend. I hope one day I’ll be able to board a plane and have you in the captain’s chair. Life itself is a lot like a flight. There are periods of turbulence and strong winds, but it’s navigating through these challenging situations that makes us appreciate the blue skies ahead. 

I see myself in many roles. President of _____. Future CEO of RBC. But the one I enjoyed the most was being a bae friend of _____. Thanks for being my light in the darkness. Sunrise has finally come, and I can’t wait to experience a wholee neeewww wooorrrlllldddd. Please be a part of my world again.

When i tried to tell a girl I truly loved that I do,she said the it's better to be only friends. My only problem is that i cannot put ly thoughts into words and i can't talk to people a lot or tell them how i feel. I tried so hard but i couldn't.

300,"I'm away from my home for a month as I study abroad. The place I'm at is beautiful and I think I'm doing a decent job in getting myself to go outside and explore a bit.  There isn't a day I haven't gone into the city by myself or with others.

The problem is when I get back to the flats.  At least three of the girls are always chit chatting with each other and everyone else seems to be able to glide in and out of conversation with ease. Sometimes I can do it too, but many times I come into the room and the conversation just seems to halt.  Awkwardly, it seems to me.  I wanna try and be friends with them, but at this point (with two weeks to go) I feel so alienated from them and I'm not sure what to do.  They all go out for drinks sometimes and talk guys, and the one time I went on a pub crawl with them (school funded event), they were all talking guys and actors and who's hot and who's not.  I don't keep up on those sorts of things, so it was awkward for me.  It wasn't super bad since I was actually able to just be there and listen (which is sort of my role anyways), but here at the flat it's just...worse.  The silences, the stilted conversations...  it's killing me from the inside out.  Also, I did manage to join them on a trip to a well known tourist site; while everyone else was helping each other take the perfect selfie, when I asked someone--anyone, really--to help me out, they took 2 photos as opposed to the 5 with the other girls and gave me my phone back as quickly as possible.  I don't know why, but it feels kind of terrible.

I did try to remedy this once.  I made waaay too much food and I figured anyone around the flat would probably appreciate a cooked meal.  Figured if even there wasn't talking, food would be a nice peace offering to get more communication going through the flat.  It wasn't super fancy, but I was proud I'd made it.  Instead of jumping on free food (pasta, broccoli, and cheese), everyone said 'no thanks' and microwaved chicken nuggets or something like that.  Even though I didn't make it with them in mind, the rejection stung and it pushed me into the thoughts of 'my siblings wouldn't have even let me get a plate before hopping in line'.  It just sorta made the homesickness worse.

I only have two weeks to go, but I just wanna be able to enjoy all my time here and make memories I can look back and say 'aw hell yeah, I studied abroad in London and it was *fucking fantastic*!'.

So my question is this--is there something I can do to make my situation better?  I can't fake an interest in selfies and parties and boys I don't know, but I'm also not sure if there's a way to compromise that I haven't tried yet.  I'm sick of crying.",16Jun2018,1

306,"I've not had a great relationship with my neighbors. To me, they don't seem like the nicest people and have done weird things like ringing my doorbell at 1am.

A recent wind storm damaged our shared fence. About a week after it happened, I thought I hired a guy to fix it. Said he would be by the next week, then never showed. 

Another neighbor told me he would help me fix it, then took off on a trip and has been gone for three weeks.

I knew my neighbor wanted it fixed and I hired a handyman that said he could do it. He came by yesterday, looked at the fence, then said he had an injury and couldn't do it for another month.

The neighbor came by today and said she would just have her brother fix it, but would I split the cost. As I've fixed a number of fence issues with no pay back from any of my neighbors, my reply was - well I've paid to do a number of repairs to the fence. Here's the history that I think affects this. Last year I had a guy fixing the fence. He took down a section and get dogs for out and she spent an hour searching for them. She said the fence broke because of the guy I hired last year didn't do it right. Yet everyone in the neighborhood had broken fence parts from that storm. I think she's still mad at me for her dogs getting out last year.

When I replied about how much I've spent, she blew up, so in the interest of keeping peace I said ok, I'll pay. She replied she didn't want my money, I was a bitch neighbor, could go f**k myself, etc.

He usually texts me right when he gets up to tell me good morning. 10:45am rolled around so I texted him to see if he still wanted to go to Home Depot. He texts me at 11:50am to tell me ""Hey babe sorry I can't go to Home Depot today""

I texted him after to ask if everything was ok but got no response. A couple hours later I called him. No answer. I texted again to see if everything is ok and asked him to please let me know. His grandma is sick so I asked him if she is ok or had passed. It's 3 hours later and no response.

309,"I dated my boyfriend(19) for a year. And then we broke up in December. It’s been a rollercoaster of stuff. He’s silenced himself from me twice and then has come back into my life twice. He is military and LDR. 

I (20F) recently got a message and call from him where he poured his heart out to me. He told me he regrets our breakup and that he loves me and only would be happy being with me. I’ve been hurt by the situation so I don’t want to jump into anything. But he says how he wants to make things right again and eventually be with me again in the future if I would allow that. 

He’s in another country at the moment, so we don’t get very often to talk except through messenger. And that’s another reason why I’m just trying to see where things go. When he talks on the phone, he’s casual but somehow mentions that he loves me during the call. (It’s been only a few days since he came back and admitted how he feels since our no contact). But when he texts he seems very nonchalant and almost like friendzoning. Like he won’t mention any feelings whatsoever, and calls me dude and man a lot. Which we always did when we were dating too, but something just seems weird about it..? 

I don’t want to put myself in a place to get hurt again, but I do love him very much. It’s just weird how he’ll go from pouring out his heart to basically putting himself at a distance. Any advice on this? Thanks so much! ",16Jun2018,4
311,"Hey, reddit, I know this isn't exactly a big-tier problem but I'm kind of stumped at the moment. Basically I've recently started a new job, working late shifts in a store and it's the type of place where there's a lot of regulars that come in, it's also quite near a lot of restaurants and bars. 

Not too long ago, I ended up serving a guy who works in one of them and, I know it sounds cheesy, but it was such a strange moment! I just looked up and he was smiling at me and I feel like we both kind of caught each other off guard, we were talking way longer than necessary whilst he was on his break and it left me feeling really nice. Every time since that he's been in we've chatted, even when I don't serve him which is what most often happens now anyway.

 I usually shy away from things like this due to nerves but my co-worker friend who I mentioned it to said she's seen him looking at me a fair few times that I haven't seen and even though I'm not sure if he's just friendly by nature (which he is anyway, I've seen) she's encouraged me to at least flirt more with him!

The real kicker is that my older co worker who has no idea I like him or even know(ish) him was watching him and me chat and said ""I think you scored there"", there was a way he was looking at me apparently and I just ughhhhh. Maybe he doesn't but, I just want to chance it.

**TLDR** Is it a turn off for a girl to ask a guy out in this situation when there's clearly chemistry? I've been asked out a few times now by guys I've served and I've actually been on a date with one but I am so shy to actually ask this guy, I don't even know his name!! I just want to at least let him know that I am crushing on him, I feel like it would be a big-deal-moment for me because I'm still getting over dating shyness! HOW DO I DO THIS AND BE SMOOTH?

315,"My mother is an active addict in alcohol. She currently drinks so much. Every 2 weeks she drinks 1 full week. She doesn't drink at home because I get so annoyed and angry when she does. 
She sleeps and overnights for the full week at her friend's house. She also has a daughter that is 9 years old. 
2 years ago childcare took away my little sister from her because there was an accident. She was drunk at a party of her friend. 
She lost her fucking finger because she was so drunk and didn't know what the fuck she was doing. They called an ambulance and they took my sister. She already had child care on her ass since I was 7. She was already an addict back then and this was the final push for them to take my little sister away. 

Here's what makes her literally retarded:
She says to the child care that: 

""SHE WILL STOP DRINKING AFTER THEY GIVE HER BACK HER DAUGHTER."" That's literally braindead. Literally retarded. I told her this. ""You should first improve yourself and stop drinking for at least 3 years before they'll consider giving her back. You've been connected to child care for 12 years now. 12 years and you think that by saying ""ill stop after  you give me back my daughter"" will work? You tell me every day that you will stop drinking, yet you can't. You make promises every time yet you lie. You can't be trusted. That's the harsh truth. I'm not talking with emotions. I'm talking with my brains and with logical thinking."" 

Here are the facts:
• She currently drinks around 7 days every 2 weeks and overnights at her friends house. I'm home alone and quite lonely. 
• All she says is ""I want my daughter back"" yet doesn't do anything to do that. She only complains and doesn't take action. 
• She thinks that child care hates her And that everyone else is an angel and that only she is a devil. 
• She thinks that everyone who disagrees with her hates her (maybe she has borderline? I heard from a friend that seeing everything in good and bad is a symptom of borderline?)
• I tried helping her but all I got were lies. I tried bringing her to a psychiatrist. She lied about the appointment. She lies about everything.

I'm at lost at what I should do. 
I feel sad because I can't do much more. I lived with her too long, she probably won't change. She wants someone to hold her hand while doing everything. I can't do that. I have work/school etc and beside this I don't want to hold her hand. She's 45 and not 12. 

Can someone give me some advice? I'm at loss of what to do. I don't want to boast but I have a very high IQ and EQ. My dad is literally retarded And my mother just thinks retarded.

I'll tell a little about myself,I am a 16 year old male student currently in summer vacation. I have above average fat but I have no  fat rolls or anything like that,a little built from a year of constant exercise. Brown eyes with short black hair side-swept,I have a few white hairs on my head,3 of which are very visible and my skin is not white but a very bright shade of hispanic.
Now I'll get to the problem,this will be a long read so get comfy and get a drink if you want!

I have had very few friends in my life,I had about max 1-2 friends who later broke up with me. One year ago I was literaly forcing myself around people,trying so hard to interieact or have  a fun conversation which often ended rather cringy. I noticed that last summer and stopped forcing myself,I've become more self-confident,quiet,calm,I become a person I always wanted to be,alone and happy. I have become really close friends with 1 person that we'll call Brad for now at 10th grade. At the last month of 10 grade I got too stressed at my final math exam. The exam didn't go well and Brad noticed this,he said ""Chill out homie we'll play some Battlerite tonight it's just a stupid paper."" in a joking tone. Out of anger I quickly grabbed and pushed him away,then he told me to get a hold of myself. After that day I tried to talk to him but no response,I later found out that Brad was secretly a very emotional person (!).

And after that,I spent an entire month and a half sitting quietly in my chair reading a book or looking at the others waiting for someone to come and talk to me because I couldn't make more than 6 sentences a day and I was bored to hell. I couldn't talk to anyone because I had nothing interesting to say. I hate small talk and don't get me wrong my social skills are good I've proven that many times but I just don't know how to get real close to people.
Almost every time the reason I made friends was because we both played the same video game.

But in the last year,I've changed my only hobby (gaming) to expand to few more. I've adopted literature,religion and exercise as new hobbies.

This summer I got into a job recommended by my uncle,which required you to be a hotel guide and as the corporation's business model customer hapiness came before profit. I had to make honest and geniuene friendships with people I know nothing other than their phone numbers and names. I was forced to go to places I hate (night clubs,yes they let me in) and trying to not look serious but be warm and friendly. I could not handle that job so I had to quit it. I hate noise,I hate that heavy smell of cigarettes and I hate forcefully making myself smile and acting friendly. I was told that I can't live like this,I was told I MUST have friends and I MUST socialize frequently. I hate socializing,I have no social media accounts,I have like 2 online games and I have no friends in either of them. I have literaly nobody outside of my family. I'm just tired of talking to people and trying to make friends. So I thought that maybe if I became beautiful,maybe if I took extreme care of my body,work out even harder to get ripped,chew even more gum to make my jaw more refined faster then people will start coming to me instead of me having to go to them. This can't fail right? People worship beauty,if girls can make friends with people just because they are hot and pretty so can men right? So can I,right? I don't even actually care if I havefasdfakdrariernd actually you know what I don't even know if I can become a proper person I didn't ask to be like this,I was always like this. I am naturally serious because god decided to give me this face and this voice. I never enjoyed socializing with people,meeting with new people,going out to parties of clubs or anywhere.I don't enjoy going out on crowded places. I fucking hate talking to people I don't know. Is it impossible to live alone? I just want to live alone and I don't want to have a friend ever fucking again. I just want people to talk to me so I can tell if they can actually see me or not.
If I have no friends then I can't have a good job,is this true?
If I have no friends then I will be a failure,is this true?
If I have no friends then I will never get a girlfriend,is this true?
Will good looks attract people to me?
I also want to thank you for reading so far,if you actually did!

327,"Hi!

I’ve quit multiple studies, multiple jobs and currently in a new job I do enjoy. My biggest inspiration is Tai Lopez and I’ve started one of his courses the create your own Social Media Marketing Agency, I really enjoy it and have spent the last week all my time on it. 


I really want to continue with it and proof to myself I can do it, I can proceed with something and not quit it. The benefit is I can do it while I’m still fulltime working so there’s no big alarm when it might not work out since I still have a job then.

Though I’m scared to tell my parents, girlfriend and family. Like eventually I would tell them if it’s going well but I have to tell them earlier since I have to legit register my business and get a business bank account and of course they will hear me making phone calls are scheduling meetings.

Something is holding me back from telling the world while on the inside my desire is very big to achieve my set goal.

How do I deal with this? It’s really bothering me.
Like I’m scared to share my thoughts and future ideas/plans.",16Jun2018,1

329,"So back story I’ve applied to a diner so I have work over the summer. And as I got interviewed the lady basically told me I can start orientation as soon as possible to which it’s pretty much a confirm yes towards working for this said diner. 

So I start orientation the next day only to have waited for about ten minutes before another waitress came up to me and said
 “yeah sorry our manager is busy with scheduling fix the air conditioning to the point where she forgot your orientation/training was today. So let me get your name and number so we can get back to you about your orientation”
In short idk if that’s an indication of a post hiring rejection since it’s generally thought when an employer says “we’ll call you” is often a rejection but in this case it’s very confusing since I have no idea when they’ll call me.

330,"So recently I was moved to a new place for a job which I lack the skill in and the interviewing person knew me that I have zero skill on the position but offered me the job which interviewer is my uncles friend. As of my current work status I’m not able to work on the tasks and taking help to complete the work, but wasn’t able to deliver it on time and the higher management is kind of very senior level who expects the work to be done on time. Due to my undelivered tasks my uncles friend is taking the work on him to complete it and the bad reputation of not completing the work was on him which he is trying to cover me up to help me. 
On order that my uncles friend who’s helping me is my team mngr with no team. And even I paid him for the help he’s doing. I can quit and look for other jobs because I don’t want to keep a bad reputation on my uncle or his friend in the workplace. 
I asked him if he can help me to survive for a lil more bit so I can learn, but seems like my mngr is over pressured one day and shouted at me for that I can’t cope up with the work. On the fair side mngr is getting money for help and wants me to work and deliver on time but which is I lack and present progress slowly. 
All I was having was to bear the stress and also a bad reputation to carry from my mngr and also to my uncle, who thinks I can’t get things done on time. 

Other peep might quit, but I don’t know I’m like fire me when you have to and until then let me stay here for something to learn.

331,"I won’t admit I’m a perfect employee but I have a toxic boss. Loves to gaslight his team on how he doesn’t micromanage yet he’s constantly telling me what to do. 

Anyway, I dislike working for him, I’ve spent the last year telling myself he needs time to adjust to our ways but he’s bullying other employees as well. It’s really demotivating. So much so he wrote me up yesterday and asked me if I even still liked working there. 

What am I supposed to say? No?

Anyway, what do I tell a future employer about why I’m changing jobs? I’m applying for new jobs in a few weeks and making a concerted effort to move on. But I struggle with having justification on why I want to leave without sounding like I’m a risky hire. 

I have solid references from previous jobs, so I’m not worried about that, I just want to have a canned response that’s not about my work environment being poor or that my boss is disrespectful of his employees, it could be taken the wrong way. ",16Jun2018,1
333,"So in my government class, I asked this girl if she wanted to be in a study group with me. She said yes and brought in another girl.

We did the same today but I've got a problem.

340,"I met a guy on tinder and we hit it off instantly. We talked everyday for about a week before meeting up just because we were busy. Everything was going well when we met up and he was complimenting me so I really don’t think he was completely uninterested. Without going into too much detail about our date, there is just one thing that really bothered me that he did and I am just wondering if this is normal or common. 

I should say that he likes to joke around a lot but, throughout the time we spent together he would bring up other girls very often. Either girls that he fucked or girls that he has dated. It would be different if I was asking him about girls and bringing it up myself but that was not the case. He would also make this joke about how every girl is his ex, for example, we went to a restaurant and he said that he dated our waitress as a joke. We went to a grocery store and he said “thank god you chose this cashier because I’ve dated the other two cashiers working right now”. I understand that it’s a joke or he’s trying to tease me but it seems strange to do that on a first date...

This guy is clearly a bachelor/womanizer and I’m not mad about that, I’m just annoyed and kind of shocked at how much he brings it up. Is this normal or a red flag? 

I would love to hear a males perspective on this! Is this something guys do to brag/show off? Or is he just not interested in me and doesn’t care about my feelings? ",16Jun2018,2
341,"I'm a seventeen year old female. Most of my experience babysitting is with family members, so I've never had to worry about this before. Here's the story-

I've been babysitting a ten year old girl for about one month now, since her mother and her moved to the town I live in. Her mom, from the start, was very nice and accommodating. She bought food specifically for me and even offered to pay me whenever she got sick and couldn't work. She seemed to be very attentive to her daughter, talking to her and knowing her likes and interests. From the start, she seemed to be the kind of person that would go out of there way to help another person. But her daughter has said differently.

Her daughter was also very nice. She was polite and a little bit quiet when I met her, but she couldn't stop talking once she started. She told me all sorts of stories, a couple of which I easily passed off as exaggerations. She told me long drawn out stories about how her cat protected her from shadow figures, and how her cat was once possessed. She told me after another week that she could talk to animals and that her mother had gotten angry and thrown their cat against a wall.

Being familiar with bad home situations, I could pass it off when she told me that last part. Maybe I'm not suitable for the job, but I didn't tell anyone because she asked me not to. Not only that, but when watching their behavior, the cat seemed to like being around her, and it seemed like she cared about the cat. Like I said, she was completely nice when I was around.

Yesterday, I was talking to her daughter while we were drawing when she asked me this- ""Have you ever been worried your parents were going to kill you?"" My response, beginning a little bit jumbled because I didn't want to lie but there are things that have happened that I couldn't explain, was ""I don't think so. Have you?"" She began telling me about the things her mother would do to her with a completely normal expression on her face. She could have been telling me about her day or another one of her stories.

She told me that when her mother was angry, she would grab her by the back of her neck and squeeze. She told me that she would hit her and kick her and throw her to the ground. She said that she was afraid her mom would choke her to death.

Throughout the entire conversation, she kept telling me that I couldn't tell anyone, and in order to get her to tell me some of it, I had to pinky promise I wouldn't tell anyone. 

But I should, right? She says her dad knows and tried to get custody but couldn't. She also said that someone called CPS once but she was afraid to tell anyone because her mom was there. She also asked me several times not to call them myself because she was afraid of what her mother would do.

That afternoon, I was talking with her, and her daughter was there, and I'm not even sure what exactly she said, because it was such a normal thing for parents to say. Something jokingly about spanking her or beating her- it flew right over my head it was so normal to me. Except afterwards, she was hugging her daughter, and she told me that she didn't really hit her or spank her. She felt like she had to say that specifically.

I feel like I should also mention that I found out about her from the internet. She was asking for references, something I took to her being a good mother. Not many I've seen have ever asked for references. Like I said, she's been so nice, and even proved to be somewhat overprotective with her daughter. I know from personal experience that that's how the most convincing abusers work, and that I definitely shouldn't do nothing about it. I just can't figure out what to do.

I live in the states and the state I live in tends to be partial to mothers in custody battles, and her dad already seems to know. Calling CPS didn't work and got her into trouble the last time. If I called, not only could she lie but because I'm a prevalent figure in her daughters life and she just told me, there's a possibility both of them would know it was me. And what if this is just one of her stories? She didn't seem the least bit emotionally involved in what she was telling me, and the things her daughter has said about her in the past don't add up.

I can't just leave. Not after what she's told me, and I'm worried that whatever I do will just make things worse for her, or maybe even put myself at risk. I've thought about waiting to see if she says anything else about it, or trying to get a recording of her saying it. 

I've also wondered what it would mean for me if an investigation were to occur. Would I be contacted? Would I have to make any kind of statement? I'm worried about what will happen, and I don't know what to do.

We hung out everyday after meeting and we're on the same page about a lot of things. I felt a very strong connection with him. I've never felt that strongly about anyone before or after.

Well, while I was single, Travis had a girlfriend. She lived across the world and they had only met once. I was young and immature and decided to tell Travis how I felt about him. He told me he couldn't tell me anything that wouldn't disrespect his relationship.

He tried to bring it up another time, but I brushed it off out of embarrassment.

I brought it up another time after and he seemed annoyed.

Well, eventually Travis became single...I happened to be just starting a relationship. He told me not to date the guy, but I never got a clear answer on why (and he went to school with him, so I figured he just didn't like him).

Anyways, timing was never right and we never ended up together or talking about it again.

We both ended up in long term relationships and lost touch the past 3 years.

Well, now we are both single.

Whilst finances played a big part in this (I couldn't afford to move out), I feel I could have done more but didn't because it was cheaper to stay at home and save up, the catch-22 being the longer I stayed at home, the more money saved therefore the less likely I would ever need to rely on my parents again.

I have my first dr appt in two weeks and will likely have confirmation on just how far I am.   I also just started a new job at a factory and I've been there two weeks now.  I like the job, and do well at it. Many compliments on my work ethic from my shift leader and co-workers. Everyone is really kind and helpful. I meet my deadlines and I exceed the required number of parts per shift. In general I have confidence in that I am learning quickly, and have heard great feedback.   

A little info about my situation  :   this agency ""employs"" me for their 6 month probation period (I get paid by the factory, not the angency) and then the factory can then decide if they want to hire me or not after the 6th mo. If the factory then hires me I then have a one year probation with them. A bit much , right ?  I mean after half a year they should know if you're  going to work out, but why not add another year?? , but I digress.  Now don't get me wrong , they don't have a reputation for dinking ppl around. In fact , I have heard that  in the past year they hired a couple /few people even before their 6th month was up. Also, my brother in law works there and got hired and does well. Basically,  they want you to show up everyday and do your job, meet your numbers. Easy enough. Also worth noting,  my husbands Uncle  also happens to be the plant manager. He did not get me the job , I do not see or deal with him. I do not report to him and he is rarely on the plant floor.  There is no favoritism. A few people know he is my Uncle in law due to the small town living, bro in law working there etc. It should also be noted that the brother in law is not nephew to the plant manager. My brother in law is from a different marriage.  No one at work knows I am pregnant, including hubbys Uncle.   

So my delema. Who do I tell  and when? Do I tell both the angency and factory at the same time? Can they /will they let me go once they find out I am pregnant ? Any advice on how to convey my dedication and desire to remain an employee ? Do I tell my Uncle in law ?

I decided to take a little break from school and find a part time job so I have time to decide on what I want to do. Its been months now and not one person wants to hire me. Ive tried volunteering so I can have something to add to my resume, but still no luck. I feel like its harder trying to find a part time job than it was taking intense courses like Statistics and Calculus. Who knew it would be this difficult. At this point i’m undecided if I should keep trying to find a job or make up my mind faster and go back to school already. I just feel like i’m losing time since i’m not currently doing anything and its giving me anxiety. ",16Jun2018,9
355,"I got a new cat for christmas and she has been amazing! However I still live with my parents and my sister. My sister doesn't like my cat (her reasoning is that cats are gross) and sometimes makes claims like ""that cat was in my room and I kicked him to get out"" and they make me infuriated. I threatened to call the police if she kicks my cat again, however I would like to not call them as shes still family. Im not sure what to say to my sister currently, my parents just scoff at her and brush it off.",16Jun2018,2
356,"Let me preface this with an apology for any shocking grammar, a bit stressed right now because of the following dilemma.

I’ve been good/best friends with his girl (let’s call her CB) for almost two years now. Last year in April she met LC and they dated for a year before breaking up a few days before their anniversary (I believe). The breakup was decently rough, he told her he just didn’t love her anymore but still wanted a relationship, sensibly she decided to call things off to save the heartache. Problems started when she realised she is still pretty in love with him - as much as you can be in love with someone who doesn’t want you. Even after breaking up, LC constantly asks her for favours or to borrow money and so on - in my opinion that isn’t really on. 

After her birthday (in April), she started going out clubbing every Friday and Saturday, getting absolutely trollied each time. Three weeks ago she went out and met this lad, GM, and they stuck together for the evening. The week after she coaxed me into going out with her, GM and GM’s friend (massive mistake, wouldn’t rate it). At the club we ran into LC where CB realised she really, absolutely, definitely and most certainly wasn’t over him. Attempting to make LC jealous she again made out with GM constantly, it was obvious it wasn’t working and I think GM started to realise she was just sort of using him to make LC jealous. 

Last week it all kicked off. CB messaged me saying GM didn’t like her and that upset her, then one of her best friends (SP) told her that she was into LC and the feeling was mutual. That upset CB and led to a long evening of her binge drinking and abusing both SP and LC over text. She fell out with SP (obviously) but said that her and LC were cool and he understood why she was upset.

Yesterday CB found out that SP and LC are seeing each other, which upset her and led to another evening of liver-killing binge drink. Today she found out that SP and LC had hooked up, causing her to slap SP. As much as I understand why she did it and if I was in the same situation I’d have probably slapped both SP and LC, I think it was wrong of her to do so and I told her that, which I think pissed her off a bit. 

I’ve offered her advice throughout the past few months on this clusterfuck of a situation but it seems to be going unheard and I don’t know what to do. I feel like she’s slowly drinking herself to death as each time she drinks, she drinks far more than the time before. I’m also worried that this is going to make her spiral into a depressed state partially combatted with alcohol, leading to alcoholism. I have no idea how to deal with this, and as CB has now fallen out with all of her friends over both this situation and another irrelevant situation I feel I’m the only person she can really talk to and the only person that could help and it’s really stressing me out. 

What can I do?",16Jun2018,2
357,"It is frankly very annoying and pissing me off to the point I want to punch him in the face. He's so intense and never stops talking about how there is no god, just always mocking people who have different beliefs than him. Not a single day goes by without him going on a rant about religion. 

On a side note, I am also an agnostic atheist. I understand his views. But, damn, I don't need to yell it and annoy everyone else about it.

Wish I had never come back to live with my parents.",16Jun2018,30
358,"TL;DR: I found a dead baby mouse stuck to my mattress and don’t know if cleaning the outside will make it safe to use, or if I should just sell it and buy a new one.

I’ve kept this mattress and box spring in a storage unit for the last 3 years. I haven’t used it because I moved in with my SO back then, but now we’re splitting up and I’m gonna need my own bed again soon. I don’t think that the mouse could have been stuck in there for longer than a few months, since I temporarily switched storage companies within the last 3 yrs and moved everything back in with the original one about 3-4 months ago. Unfortunately, the mattress was stored unwrapped this whole time (I know) and the mouse was directly touching it when I found it. You could faintly smell dead mouse as soon as I pulled the mattress away from the box spring, so the idea of sleeping on this thing soon has me pretty grossed out.

I realize the most obvious answer would be to get a mattress cover; but I find them to be uncomfortable and annoying with all that plastic-y rustling. I wondered about trying some Woolite spray or something on the outside of the mattress, but this is my first time dealing with a dead-mouse-in-my-stuff situation, so I’m not sure that it would do much besides remove any residual dead mouse smell. 

It’s a pretty new mattress that I bought at wholesale price, and it’s super comfy, so I’d rather not have to sell it. Have any of you experienced a similar situation, or have scientific reason why sleeping on this thing wouldn’t be gross or unsafe? I guess I’m just afraid that if cleaning the outside wasn’t thorough enough, that I’d risk infection/disease, or at the very least, never get that dead mouse smell out...",16Jun2018,1
359,"Hello, everyone! I am 19 years old, living at my family's house for the summer. I use the internet a pretty solid amount, for many things such as video games and entertainment, but also for communication with friends and learning more about the world. 

My mom is getting fed up with the idea that me and my two younger sisters can spend an infinite amount of time on the internet, and is setting up parental controls on our router to limit our time and access on the internet. While I can understand her frustration, I disagree that setting a timer and restricting certain websites is the solution.

 I am planning on writing a paper about my thoughts on the subject and giving it to her tomorrow. I was hoping to get some thoughts from you lovely redditors for me to consider and possibly use when voicing my opinion.",16Jun2018,1

361,"Throwaway because my boyfriend is on Reddit. Also sorry for this book!

My boyfriend (Nick) and I live together. We have been together for three years and in those years we have been through *a lot* of hardships and challenges. Recently, Nick's brother came into town and Nick took him out for a night. I wasn't asked to join, and that's fine, but he didn't even tell me what their plans were; they just left and Nick asked me to pick him up from his father's house the next day. I was upset and admitted to my boyfriend that this made me insecure (from not knowing what his plans were) and jealous because he hadn't invited. I also told him that this was because of my BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) which makes me extremely insecure and puts my emotions on full blast.

This event started a depression in me that I can't understand/explain. 

The week following that weekend, my boyfriend was going fishing with my brother almost everyday. He was almost never in the house. He did invite me to go, but fishing is not something that I'm interested in and being depressed I knew I wouldn't be in a fun mood and would probably ruin their's. I opted out, stayed home, and played Sims. The next weekend my dog (Max) got into a fight with another dog and was bleeding profusely. The vet said they couldn't stitch it up and to just keep it wrapped, clean it, and change the bandages. 

Well, Nick's friend Shelly came into town and wanted to come over and smoke with Nick. Personally, I didn't care. When she came over I was busy running around the house taking things out for dinner and making sure Max didn't take off his bandages. I was berated by Nick for being antisocial and weird and not hanging out with them. The next day Shelly wanted to go to the beach. Again, I didn't want to go. Mostly because Shelly is skinny, pretty, and looked amazing in her bathing suit and I am pale, chubby, and just generally unappealing to myself. But, I didn't care if Nick went. 

The following week, Nick and my brother were doing all kinds of things everyday. They went to the beach, to the lake, fishing, you name it. I stayed home and played Sims. I would play all day, stay up until about 6 in the morning and I'd sleep for a few hours and repeat. I was in the same clothes, hadn't showered, and my hair was starting to dread up. 

I didn't come to bed at night. We hadn't had sex in however long. We didn't cuddle. We didn't even really see or talk to each other. These were the things he had pointed out to me. Today, I woke up at 9 in the morning, slept in the bed with him and asked him to cuddle, watched him play video games, actually made a point to get dressed in nice clothes and go out. When I asked him why he barely even said a word to me today, he told me that he was accustomed to not seeing, talking, or really even being with me. 

I asked him if he wanted to fix it because I had finally pulled myself out of my depression and he said that he was 'just chilling' and that he was already used to it and now that I was finally ready to not be depressed he couldn't just jump back into how things used to be.

I don't know what to do to fix this. It's like we're together, but not. We've been through worse than this and I don't want to throw three years away over something that I didn't know how to control. How should I talk to him? How can I fix it? He doesn't really want to talk or put in effort and I don't know if that's my fault or his. 

Tl;dr My boyfriend and I are barely in a relationship anymore after my deep depression for almost two weeks. I pulled myself out of it and am actively trying to make up for lost time, but he says it's too late and he doesn't want to try.",16Jun2018,1

366,"I recently found out that one of my really close friend's boyfriends is going to propose to her (yay!). When we were talking about what type of ring she would like, I asked him how he was planning on doing it and he said he wanted to do it outside of the restaurant where they first met. I think the sentiment of that is really sweet, but the restaurant they met at is on a very busy city street with outdoor seating and I know that my friend will probably prefer somewhere more private so that she can really take the moment in (and not be emotional in front of strangers). Would I be meddling too much if I said something? He had said that he had been picturing the proposal to be there for some time, so I don't know if he's that open to other people's opinions, but I also feel like I wouldn't be doing my job as her friend if I didn't at least express that sentiment. If I did say something, I don't want to come off like I think he doesn't know her or crush his idea, but she did say that she doesn't really want family or friends there in the moment so I think that she probably wouldn't feel comfortable with a lot of strangers being around too.

367,"Alright so let's backtrack few weeks! So a girl that I really like that was in my class suddenly, out of nowhere offered me some help with a school project. We never really talked that much during the 2 years that we went in the same class so when she asked if she could help me it felt really special. and I don't know if it was because she was being nice to me or if she likes me... I gladly accepted the help anyways and we started talking a bit (mostly about school stuff) . Anyways fast forward to yesterday when we graduated and she was around me a lot and we talked  some more.

370,"So my fiancee and I are on vacation in a city a few hours away from my hometown. We have no family here or anyone who really knows who we are. We are staying in an airbnb, we have used lyft to get from where we are staying to the town center to eat and go out etc. We have had a really nice talkative couple drive us into the city on two separate occasions, both of which they picked us up from our airbnb and took us into the city. At first they seemed like a nice talkative couple who enjoyed making small talk as do I, but on our second ride with them into the city they started asking oddly specific questions like what kind of car do you drive, what time / how do y'all usually get back home from the town center, etc. Me being the naive person that I am took it as friendly conversation. 
I basically divulged to them that I come from a wealthy family, we at from there, and that we were staying alone in an airbnb, which is in a rough side of  town. The way they reacted and whispered among each other and asked oddly specific questions about our wealth/status has us worried about our safety. Are we being paranoid? What should we do?",16Jun2018,1
