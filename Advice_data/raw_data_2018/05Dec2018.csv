0,I’m moving to nc in a few months to start a new chapter in my life and it will be my first time living by myself without roommates and I don’t know anyone in the area. I’m not sure how to go about making new friends. I could try to make friends with my new coworkers but I feel like friendships with coworkers stay in the work place. ,05Dec2018,1
1,"I'm a senior in high school, applying to college currently. My family makes just enough money to where I can't get grants, but not enough to actually pay for my college.

I'd love to go straight to a 4-year California State University, but I'm afraid of going into debt.


I could also go to junior college, then transfer, but I don't want to stay where I live.

What's the best option for me? Should I suck it up for another 2 years then transfer to a CSU? Or should I follow my heart in the moment and end up in debt?",05Dec2018,1
2,"I was put up for adoption before I was born. When I was 9 years old adoptive mother passed away due to heart complications, leaving my dad with my younger brother (1 years old),  my older sister (13 years old), and I. He worked a lot, so he wasn’t around as much as I would have liked. 

I went in search of my birth mother, and soon got in contact with her. We had a very good relationship from the start. I started spending some weekends with her. One weekend when I was 10 years old, she and the other kids were taking a nap. Her husband was hanging out with me in the living room. Basically he started touching my chest and pulled out his penis. Saying that I looked some much like my mom when she was younger. At this point I was really uncomfortable so I went into my moms room and curdled up next to her and started crying. She woke up and was asking me what was wrong. I told her what had happened. She was upset with her husband, but she was also 100% financially defendant on him. She did not leave him. 

Since that happened I never spent the night, and limited my time over there. I was always super uncomfortable anytime he was in the room, or sitting near me. She used to make me give him hugs and tell him I loved him. But how can I love someone who would do something like that to a child.  I also had some suspicions as to where he has treated his daughters the same way as me. 

In recent months, I’ve been talking to my BF about if we get married I don’t want her husband at the our wedding, and I wasn’t sure how to tell her that without hurting her feelings. But I also held some feelings of anger towards her for not doing anything about the situation.  So I had slowly begun to distance myself for her, I usually go over for Thanksgiving, but I didn’t this year. I hadn’t talked to her since October. 

Over the weekend she passed away very suddenly, and I feel very bad that I wasn’t able to see her one last time. Her husband has kept me updated throughout everything. I will be attending her viewing and memorial, but he also wants me to come over for Christmas to see their kids. 

I never really spent much time with them, mostly because of what happened to me years ago. They were homeschooled and have very little social skills. At times it felt like I was hanging out with a group of toddlers. Their ages range from 15-19, so they all still live at home. The oldest works in the same place as their dad. The whole family is always together. Barely ever leaving the house. 

I feel very bad for them, since they spent their entire lives in that house with her. She rarely left the house either. Part of me wants to be there for them, since this is something I’ve been through before . But I don’t want to be around her husband. 

Am I wrong for not really wanting anything to do with them after this? ",05Dec2018,1
3,"I don’t know why, but it’s so difficult to be around lots of people. Because of this I’ve started skipping meals (which I have to go to my University’s cafe to eat) and skipping classes. I still do my work for my classes but sometimes I can’t find it in me to leave me dorm, it’s as if I get scared and start getting nervous. I’ve run out of cup of noodles since I don’t leave my dorm on the weekends or days I don’t have classes.

For the last two weeks I’ve only been eating a meal a day. Usually dinner. Yesterday I ate breakfast and I haven’t eaten today (it’s 4pm) but I’m hoping to go get dinner soon. I feel like a child and I can’t get a grip.",05Dec2018,1
5,"My sister is a teenager and I share a bedroom with her. A few years ago, she started feeling the need to arrange every single thing in the room before she was able to fall asleep. Even if she is extremely tired, she always finds the time and energy to put all the items in the room in their specific places, which are determined by her. She demands that nobody even touch anything she has already arranged. For example, if I accidentally bump on something or if I need to use an item, she will get upset and get up in order to fix it (if I try to move it back to its place myself, she will tell me it's wrong).

This constantly creates minor arguments and is becoming increasingly annoying. There are times when I feel I'm not allowed to use the things in my room after a specific time. Also, there are some nights I really need to rest and when I demand she turns off the lights she dismisses me and continues arranging the room.

Recently, I found out that she organizes compulsively a lot of other things too, such as her school books, which she always puts in a specific order by size (both in the shelf and in her bag).

I don't understand what causes this need of hers, and when I try to talk to her about it she says there's no specific reason she continues to do it. How should I approach her? And, in addition, what may be the cause of this behaviour?

6,"I'm an arts student, age 22, male, and I've got good future prospects overall. My all means except one, I am truly thankful for my current life. 

I have baggage that has made me avoid getting into a relationship up until this point (quick summery; enduring past sexual assault, chronic illness, abusive mother and step-father, mental health, drugs, being transsexual + discrimination, and other). 

The person in question has his own baggage too, more specifically being the past relationships he's had (quick summery; rape, lifelong illness, abusive father, drugs, mental health, crazy ex-boyfriend, being gay + discrimination, and other).

We are both at the point where we have overcome the vast majority of all that, partly in due to our relationship and our genuine love for one another. Only problem is, our spoken love is completely platonic. Neither of us is looking for a relationship and as far as I am aware he is not in love with me in the way that I am with him. 

Regardless, we are very close and have helped one another overcome many of these issues. 

I'm thankful for our brotherhood, and that we trust one another more than anybody else, we get compared to an old married couple, or brothers, depends on the person. Because of this, I know he needs me as an emotional support in hard times, and I don't want to hurt him by coming out to him about my feelings for him as it has the potential to pressure him to respond in a way that makes us both happy, which may not exist. 

It hurts all of the time in this dull and heavy way, and I can't not think of him. I can't sleep and I don't feel like eating at all. Whenever I am working on my art, it's him that I think about instead. My art feel so fake and lifeless now compared to my thoughts of him. 

I tried talking about my feelings to other friends outside the class, but it only made it feel even more real. More painful.

I feel immensely guilty for how I think of him and how I fantasise about a real, romantic, sexual relationship between us. We have been honest about everything to one another, but I have been keeping this a secret from him for months now and only recently did it creep up on me with an intenseness I can't help but submit my days putting thought to.

I want to be honest with him after graduation, that way we won't be obligated to be around one another and we can think it through whatever he feels. I am just seeking advice on how to deal with this pain.

9,"So, I was walking home earlier and I passed this person on the street. I smiled at them for a second (people are generally friendly in my town) and then smiled at their dog as they passed. As they walked by, they asked,""Wanna wipe that dirt off your nose?""

I have to be able to see if my gun goes one direction, where are my feet at the time of the movement, or when I swing by sword, does it go over my head or below.  I know this is the most first world ""problem"" ever, but I will sit there all night trying to figure out some of the movements in a game and play maybe 10 minutes.  Only recently I started to think that maybe this is a problem.  Is this a form of OCD?  I don't believe it extends into real life things, but sometimes I will think about movements people make as well as mine - just in a lesser form.  I'm not sure how much and how else to elaborate, but I am happy to if it helps.

17,"Hey Guys,

I’m not really sure what to do here. I’m 25-years-old and currently living with my single mother. In June, she decided that she was desperate to relocate. But, she didn’t want to do it alone. I feel like I’m responsible for making sure she’s not alone, so I quit the job I’ve had for 7 years and relocated to another city 3 hours away. 

She BEGGED me to go. Now that we’re both here, she’s treating me awful. She doesn’t have any friends in the area and relies solely on me to keep her happy. I can’t do it anymore. I have clinical depression and anxiety. I can barely keep myself moving forward and I’m tired of carrying her. I’ve been helping bridge the gap for her financially for years. She can’t live here without me because she can’t afford it. Yet, she doesn’t seem to want me around.

I feel pretty trapped. She expects me to fix her life and make it better to compensate for all the wrong that’s ever been done to her. I have two brothers. They both assume that I’m gonna take care of her forever so they don’t have to do anything. If I move to another state, it’ll cause her extreme financial hardship and she’ll claim I’ve abandoned her.

I also don’t date or have a social life because I don’t feel like I can just leave her alone and live my life. She’s judgmental and very co-dependent on me. She thinks of me as a “partner” and said I can’t leave because she’s too old to date now.

Hey   I am currently in 10. grade at a German high school and I'm having   trouble to start conversations with people from my class or course.

Background   story : When I got into 5. grade I was not good looking and had no   outstanding personality, that is why I did not get into any major groups   in my class and because no one was from my elementary school I had   basically no friends, so I just joined some groups but they never saw me   as a friend more like a group member and I hated girls so I had never   talked to them in class too. All in all I had no friends the only  friend  I had was one who I ''accidentally'' annoyed so much that he  changed  seats.

Fast forward, I quickly  became  defensive to others and that is why I got not much social  interaction  and that is why I became very bad at it and became very  anxious when  doing it. At the end of 9. grade basically in summer  holidays I wanted  to change my personality and my looks : Cut my hair,  washed myself more  often, became more friendlier and helped people.  -&gt; My reputation got  better, sometimes like once in a week some  people even asked me  something, I even began thinking less of my  actions and just accept  them.

Now my problem:

I   am in a situation where I can talk to people in class over things in   class, but I can't talk to them about something other in the breaks,   because I feel out of place. An other thing I have problems with is   start talking with girls I can keep up a conversation with them if they   ask me something, but asking them something other things then '' and   you?'' is out of question. Additionally I cannot look people in the   eyes.

My questions:

How can I get people to be friends, so even they start a normal conversation with me ?

Any tips to look people in the eyes, not something like look at the nose ?

Any tips on how to talk to girls ?

How can I make a conversation interesting ?

Thanks for taking your time to read this post and sorry for an mistakes in my writing, like I said I am German .",05Dec2018,1
19," I just started working at this job in HR (first one in this field). I was really positive in the beginning about it. My boss and I clicked and we seemed to hit it off. We work together in a lot of things- he is the HR manager after all. I took a week long vacation. While I was gone he does my job as well. As soon as I came back from vacation he seemed off. I have been struggling doing payroll and Im suddenly feeling like I'm annoying him by asking so many questions. It just isn't sticking for me for some reason. My orientation date was exactly a month ago today and I'm doing okay and trying my best but i Just feel like some things just don't stick in my mind. And there are other things I do well in. I am new- so. He used to answer my texts right away and now he doesn't. Even exclamation points and smileys aren't there. He doesn't try to hang around me anymore. I know I did well earlier but I don't know. I called him today on his day off and he seemed robotic in tone. I messed something up today and I apologized he just said its ok robotically. I know he is not my friend and he is my boss but I'm starting to lose confidence in myself. I'm starting to feel like he doesn't like me. It all just may be in my head. Him liking me really matters but I feel like I let him down a lot. Some things I ask him and then he will go ""i'll just do it."" It doesn't seem mean the way he says it but I feel really bad because I'm not understanding and I'm really trying hard to. He has a lot on his plate and I ask him if there is anything i can do to make his life/work easier. I may just be emotional and not looking at things right.

24,"I have worked a lot of jobs in various different fields.  I have come to learn what I’m good at and what I need in a job.  I also tend to get bored easily and get too comfortable, I stop caring and eventually quit and go onto something else.


I haven’t found a job I don’t get bored of, so I’ve pretty well given up on finding the job that I’ll love and that will define me for the rest of my life.  Instead I’m trying to rewire my brain to drive me to work for the money I need to pay rent, bills, save money, and enjoy the odd luxury.


So, I’m willing to give up the manual labour life (I currently work in a fast food restaurant) for a few reasons:

1.  I’m making barely above minimum wage and my hours are inconsistent because I’m only part time, so I’m not making consistent money.

2. I am constantly getting burns, most recently sliced my hand with a box cutter, and I’m tired of my clothes and hair smelling like fries.

3. This job has been messing with my mental health, my anxiety is at an all time high because it is very fast paced, we have a high turnover rate so we have very few tenured staff, and a high volume of complaints with our department due to new staff error.  On one hand, when I’m all anxious I have used the energy to pick up the slack at work and be a great employee.  But then I’ve been crashing and sleeping way more than usual because I’m stressing out about work.


After some thought, I’ve decided a 9-5 job would be better for me, easier to stay in a routine, easier to manage consistent finances, and easier to manage daily stress.   I also think it would be better for me in the long run because I’m in a serious relationship where I want to build a good future with this person and be able to contribute to that future.

We start seeing eachother and I fall really in love with him 3 years later I say screw it and leave my family and everyone I love behind for him. After a year of being together in one state we decided to move to another state becuase that’s where his family lives and it would be better for his daughter. Here we are 4 years later and I am depressed as hell. I have left my family and have had no contact with my parents and know no matter what they will never talk to me again. Living in a different state has been very hard for me. I have no friends, we live in my future in laws basement and my career has taking a huge hit I am now making a quarter of what I use to be making.

And he refuses to ever be there for me not once has he said “I know you’re going threw a hard time but I appreciate you” the second I tell him anything the name calling and raising voice begins he knows this will stop it because I don’t want his parents to hear upstairs.

I have terrible social skills, and have abandonment issues, and feel like if a girl is nice to me, they want to date me, which is the story of my life, so imma break this down in multiple sections, and give bullet points to everything.

&amp;#x200B;

* anxiety and high school- I got pretty decent/good grades in middle school, I made it out this trimester with 1 A, all B's, and 1 C, pretty average, but my dad wanted me to get better grades, cause he doesn't want me going through what he had to go through, and learn all his high school math in college, and now he's super successful. It all started with applying, i'm going to a catholic high school, and they require a high school placement test (HSPT for short) and I took that recently, and wait until February for results, and they only take the ones you got right, and round it to a standardized score. I did pretty well IMHO, i didn't finish the math, even though i had like 10 questions left, but I finished everything else, the cognitive section was hard but I got through it. The math, LA, and reading section was easy, but I cant count my chickens before they hatch. The main high school I want to go accepts mostly everybody that applies, which is good, the other 3 high schools all run on the same placement test, and that test only determines where they can place you, but the honest to god truth is that they just want your money, so they'll accept me no matter what, but I cant get cocky. The main school I want to go to is a co/ed school, nice people, nice atmosphere, my guitar teacher went there, and I asked the current teacher if he knew him, and he did, and he said if I went there i would be a great contribution to the guitar program. 
* My shadow (the kid I followed around for the day) was nice, we both played soccer, and he was really nice, the kids are nice, teachers are nice, etc.... but they have problems, drugs, juuling, high school stuff, but I have common sense, and don't want to die from cancer, and its only 20 minutes from where i live. The 2nd school is an all boys school, its a school surrounding the ideology of st francis of acsisi, which is good, they have friars that were the robes, there super nice, kids are nice, the kid i shadowed actually went to my school, so i felt pretty welcomed, saw no sign of drugs or juuling, kids are nice, great choir, teachers are nice, dope food btw, but it is in a kinda bad idea, but it's all gated off, and they pick up from my school that i go to RN, so it wouldn't take long to get there, but it is right next to the sister school of a girl i had problems with that will tie into another point. The 3rd school was also catholic private like 20 minutes away, nice school, only 4 classes, all of them 1 hour and 1/2, so yea, thats dope, nice kids, nice teachers, etc... saw no problems, but idk how i feel about it. The 4th school, oh my god, it was dope, it was a BRAND spanking new school, this year only, they have mass every morning, there are only 12 kids, since its new, my shadow was also named Matthew (which is my name :D) his sister also went there, his mom owned the school, they have teachers from the naval academy that teach there, my soccer coach teaches there, a nun teaches there, they have the same amount of classes my school had, and it was a good atmosphere. But there are certain things i don't like, theres stuff i'm not used too, like mixing theology and math, etc...but this point is heartwarming, they had an open house, and after it was done, i was playing the piano they had, and a girl from the school, sat down next to me, not being told to, just out of the kindness of her heart, which was awesome, I felt cared for, so my TL:DR for this is, i'm having trouble on where i should go, and what would be the best for me.

&amp;#x200B;

* My ADHD- So I've had it since at least first grade, so a solid 7 years now, i've been off and on medicine for focus issues, i've always had issues with focus and looking people in the eyes, and its taken over my life. My elementary years were a nightmare and a clusterfuck and traumatizing, being falsely accused of things i didn't do, being sent to the office cause the teachers didn't know how to take care of me and my ADHD, and being told by my math teacher I had a math deficiency, honestly she should suck my dick, she's a bitch, it's all kinda blurry, but i do remember parts of elementary school. My parents took me out in 4th grade cause i wrote on my locker in sharpie on the last day of school, a kid snitched, and i got in trouble, and was forced to scrub it off, and then my bitch principal took me in, during field day, and made me write down how i will do better in 5th grade, that was traumatic, i felt so falsely accused, and I shouldn't have been in trouble for something small. In kindergarten I told some kid i want to light him on fire (he was black) and told, and they made me scrub the FUCKING floor, my mom didn't believe me, no one believed me, I did pocket lego's, which was fun. I put bags of grapes in my locker in 3rd grade, and my bitch principal, who i really hope dies of ligma or cancer, got on fucking gloves, and picked them out of locker, saying how roaches or rats could have gotten in, i hope she dies. My parents sent me to a school designed for kids that had stuff like mine, and it was a MAJOR turn around for me, i got organized and actually handled by teachers that knew how to work with me ,which was great. Now as of recently, i'm still taking stuff, and i may outgrow it, but idk if its working, my stuff has already been upped, but i don't want to take something too strong....

27,"Throwaway account.

This will come off as mostly venting, but I’m looking for advice on my current situation.

I had the courage to post on r/amiugly a few days ago, and asked for honest opinions and ratings. I would say that they were definitely honest.

Within minutes, I got a bunch of 3s and 4s. I didn’t even get a single 5 or above! I didn’t get a single comment that was positive. I was so beaten by the fact that I was actually uglier than I already believed I was that I just straight up deleted the post within an hour. This absolutely shattered my confidence, and I’m not even a confident person to begin with. I at least thought that I would be alright you know? Slightly below average would be fine, but no. I’m batshit ugly. This has bothered me for the few days since it happened, and idk what to do. I feel like I’m just not worth as much as I thought anymore. 

I guess I thought I wasn’t ugly before because my one ex was a solid 10/10 in comparison to me, but now I feel like she was just blinded by love, and I’m a lost cause for dating now. I don’t even know how I happened to catch my ex’s attention, besides being god awful ugly. I’m sad and stressed and need advice on how I can get rid of this mindset that I’ll be forever alone because I’m a freak of nature. 

Hell, I probably can’t even make friends because I look disgusting. I don’t even know where my group of attractive friends came from! I’m so lost. How did I even manage to get these amazingly attractive people in my life? How did I even attract a girlfriend? I need advice on how I can deal with knowing that I am just ugly. :(


TLDR; Rated in the ugly range on r/amiugly, feels like shit, wondering how I found a 10/10 girl before, questioning if I was just hella lucky to get that girl and she was hella blind for not seeing me as ugly, wondering how I found a group of attractive friends, questioning life itself now that I know that I am ugly. Would like advice on how to deal with my ugliness.",05Dec2018,1

29,"Hi all,

I don't frequent this sub so please let me know if I should post this somewhere else. I have mentioned to my SO that I want a Nintendo Switch for Xmas. So, naturally, she bought it for me tonight. This is a big, corporate mega store in the U.S. Apparently, someone put the wrong sticker price/label/barcode on the box and it rang up for $37. The cashier was not phased and even when my SO raised her brow, he thought nothing of it and even said, ""That's what's on the box, that's what it costs. Do you think it should be something else?"" At that point she was confused and left the store and checked the receipt. 

Well, now she feels guilty and is worried the cashier could get in trouble or she can be tracked down somehow. I think it's her lucky day! If it were a small mom n pop store I could understand returning to the store to resolve the issue. However, this is a multi-billion dollar corporation who probably won't even notice.  

Should we keep the switch without a guilty conscious or return it?

TL;DR My SO paid for a $37 wine rack and received a $300 Nintendo Switch at no fault of her own. Should we keep it?",05Dec2018,1

33,"So I have two roommates who tend to let the dishes pile up in the sink, and they don’t even bother cleaning on a weekly basis. I have reminded them that we need to stick to a strict dish washing schedule given the limited space we have with the sink. 

Of course, that idea went to hell. Here we are before Christmas break, and we tend to have dishes pile up in the sink, the exact opposite of what I wanted. I’ve gotten on roommates about this, and they essentially tell me to clean the dishes and utensils that I need. A polite way to tell me to fuck off it seems. 

BUT! Here’s the kicker, my roommates whenever they do get around to dishes, they try to rope me into helping them out. I have tried getting out of this by telling them that it’s their mess, and they should’ve followed through with my “clean as you cook” routine. They pull the line that I “live here too”, albeit that’s true, that doesn’t make me your made.

So what’s the advice that you’d provide for me? Sadly, moving out isn’t the option. ",05Dec2018,1
34,"Background info for context: i have a group of friends who i sit with at school &amp; my bday was last week. we all normally get each other things for our birthdays. basically they didn't end up ordering anything &amp; told me they would give me cash. one of my friends was ordering something and asked if anyone had something to order to reach free shipping, and everyone started saying that they would be broke bc they are giving me money for my birthday (complaining and everything). this hurt bc i felt more like a liabilty &amp; something that they didn't care about even though i went all out for their bday. i messaged them after 4 days ish to ask them if that was what they wanted to do and they just left me on read.

i was absent on friday and yesterday one of my friends (she's part of that group) told me that they were talking about me saying that i was being too ""demanding"" and had ""a personality change""

before you call me materialistic, it's not entirely about the money - sure it would be nice to get it + it was a tradition type of thing we were doing

the main thing i'm mad about is how they had no hesitations to talk about me. the ""demanding personality"" they talk about is me just asking them a question. i used to agree and go along with everything they said, so why are they so bothered if i learn to stand up &amp; be more invidualistic

my friend also told me that they were planning on confronting me but wanted to do it together. i don't want to turn this into a big scene but i also need to talk to them to see what's going on in their mind. i'm planning on confronting them tomorrow if they don't

36,"So I’m 17, living with both my parents, my mom and I are constantly getting into arguments over stupid things. Every time, she’s the one starting an argument. She asks me why something is happening or what’s going on and I try to give her a response but instead of letting me get through what I’m saying, she tries to interrupt me and make me feel bad for whatever it is I just said. If I openly say something like, “I’m just trying to explain, you’re not letting me.” Or “can I just say what I need to say” it’s always a shot back “I don’t have to listen to you, I’m the parent here not you” or “sorry I’m such a shit parent, my fault” and in the end she always tries to play the victim card by saying IM the one that’s too harsh or that’s being unfair and not listening.

37,"This is just a venting post...


My parents have been together for almost 22 years and married for 12. Nothing bad is going on in their marriage/relationship...it's just when they fight, I hate it. 

They've fought as long as I can remember, so since I was about 6 or 7 years old, I'm 18 now. My dad would drink and always get in trouble with my mom because he would lie about what he'd be doing. God..there's so many things that's caused these fights. My dad drinking, him secretly watching porn, you get the gist. One night when I was 7, they were fighting and my dad choked my mom..actually choked her. I remember her saying ""I can't breathe."" I was crying and trying to distract myself by watching some kids' movie, but it didn't work. 

These fights happened once in awhile for years and I've *sadly* gotten used to them. They fought about everything: Money, what I mentioned up above. 

My dad would get really scary too. He'd buck up on my mom and say ""Fuck you! I'm gonna whoop your ass!"" and my mom would cower in the corner. Once he smashed a plate because he was going after my mom and saw that she was scared then stopped himself. My older sister would have me go to my room while the whole situation went down. I'd cry and felt completely powerless. I was 7 years old, what was I gonna do? I still feel powerless. I can't interject or I'll get my ass beat, I can't stay and defend my mom or I'll get my ass beat. I even got so frustrated one time that I threw a box fan in our hallway just to make them stop. 

It seems as if they don't care about how it makes their kids feel because if it did, they'd figure it out together. I think I've developed anxiety/PTSD from those years. I get very anxious and extremely scared when someone raises their voice, or when a fight is about to happen/is happening. 


I just hate it. And I can't even say what's on my mind or I'll just burst into tears. My mom has even told me in private after a huge fight the night before, to not tell anyone because we'll lose everything. IT'S FUCKIN BULLSHIT...it's not right. Like ""Okay so you don't want me to tell anyone that my dad put hands on you or he'll go to jail and we'll lose everything?"" That's what I've been told my whole life. 

It's not fair that I sit there in my room and cry while I listen to their screams and things flying across the living room. It's not fair that I feel powerless against my father. 

It's not fair.

40,"This is my first time ever buying anything at Best Buy, and I will preface this by saying that the store was busy when I went in. 

With that being said, I don't feel like the way the simpleton who sold me a TV was professional about things, so i'd like some feedback from people on here, especially if you've worked in a high traffic tech store before.

What happened was I don't drive, so I got a cab to park outside for me while I went in to buy a 50 inch TV. 

I found the first salesperson to ask him where the model I was looking for was in the store, and he led me to it. 

There was a TV box already in the middle of the place, don't know what it was doing there, but it was the model I was looking for, so I told him I wanted to buy it.

The guy tells me to push the TV box on the floor towards the cashier so he can ring me up.

I tell him it says on the box you shouldn't push the box around like it's a fucking scooter. Ok, I didn't swear, but I told him it wasn't right.

He tells me it's fine, and pushes the box along the floor to show me.

I tell him to lift it with me or i'm walking out the store.

So we lift it to the cashier, and he quickly sells it to me. No offer of warranty, nothing. Just bup bup thanks here is your receipt.

Had to nearly yell at the guy to convince him to carry it out with me to the cab. 


When I got home the TV and the box didn't seem damaged and so far it's running OK, but i'm worried. 

Now, I don't want to sound entitled or anything. I just want some advice on if I should be upset at this behavior or not. 

The bottom line is I feel like employees shouldn't be handling items roughly and that he rushed me out the store.

Was this scenario acceptable in your opinion? If not, what should I do? It seems like a pain to bring back the TV for an exchange, and I don't know if they will exchange it on the premise that it might not be as durable because of the handling.

All advice is appreciated, even if you think i'm overthinking this. Thanks.",05Dec2018,1

51,"i have three cats - one is my cat, Whitewings, she is 5.
The other two are family pets, they are brothers, about 5 months old.

we adopted the kittens as a family. my brother and dad were especially excited.

my other cat we got when i was 9 (i am 14 now) and she was a family pet but as soon as i was old enough, probably around 11, i took over and i would feed her, clean litterbox, brush her, etc. she really is my baby and i love her to pieces. i would genuinely probably kill myself if something happened to her before her time.

anyway, the two kittens had litterbox problems right away. they began pooping in sinks, bathtubs, and on carpets. we set up 2 extra litterboxes and they go in a room with food, water, a litterbox, and a bed at night because they kept pooping everywhere during the night. 

originally, i was responsible for all three cats, i guess since i was already doing everything for Whitewings my parents thought i could just continue. it was fine, but once school started i was pretty swamped. i would have to wake up early to clean anywhere they pooped &amp; clean all three litterboxes. then when i got home id have to clean the carpets whereever they pooped which took a good 30 mins each time. my dad got upset because i would take too long to clean, so he took over. i DID NOT ask him to - this is important. 

we took them to the vet several times - fecal sample, bloodwork and a physical came up with nothing. they are extremely healthy, according to the vet. good muscle tone, shiny coats and eating well. we also switched to a science diet food meant to help with digestion. we then got some special walnut “cat-attract” litter as well. my dad bought a carpet cleaner to use on their messes. we sank a lot of money into these kittens. we love them.

but then, Whitewings starts acting up. I guess she saw them pooping on the floor, because she then started peeing on the floor occasionally- paired with the fact that she would often miss the litterbox. it’s not that she was pooping outside of it, it’s that she would be standing in it, but sometimes her lil butt would stick over the edge. 

my dad has been getting more and more annoyed at this. he doesn’t want help either. i always ask if he’d like me to do it or if i can help in any way and he always says no. 

the other day he kinda snapped and said he “couldnt keep doing this everyday” and “if they dont start behaving im seriously thinking about giving them back”. 

i honestly don’t know what to think here, because he is a temperamental man and he says a lot of things he doesn’t mean or act on.

i am legitimately worried that one day i will come home and the cats will be gone. i don’t know what to say, because i feel this is unfair. HE wanted the kittens, and he MADE THE CHOICE to take responsibility and is refusing help. 

please what do i do? again, im not sure he is serious about it but still..

We tried over and over to stay away from each other to no avail. It got ugly we were both basically living a double life (cowardice I know)... but it happened nonetheless. I left my s/o  because it wasn’t fair... but the guy I fell in love with stayed with his (I never told him I left my s/o , I didn’t want him to be the sole reason). So eventually he finds out and reaches out to me, he tells me he broke up with his s/o and he wants to see where this goes. Fast forward just one month and he was lying to me to go see her. I found out and told him it’s a no go and I won’t be lied to so good bye. He said ok I understand and I don’t feel the same way anymore. We cried but we parted ways.  I got back with my original parter and he went back to his. (Fast forward one year)... Throughout the past year I felt like there were subtle hints that he was still there emotionally. He would like pictures of me, ask friends about me etc. (We are not friends on any social media) I “ripped the bandaid” but somehow he was still lingering. He and his S/o broke up and she is now happily seeing someone else. He has gone of the rails drinking, hooking up with chicks and partying. About a week ago he requested me on social media ( knowing full well my s/o and I are still trying to make it work) I messaged him why the request and he responded something along the lines of I thought we were cool, guess not. 

I kind of went off about why he was such an asshole and how we are not cool (I don’t regret that he deserved to know)

53,"Hello, I am a 17 year old girl, and I'm living with my 86 year old father, which I've been doing since a very young age (eleven years old). The problem is that I thought until recently that my relationship with him was difficult but a normal way for a parent and child to interact, everybody has problems, right? But when I was visiting my mother and spoke to her about some of the issues she explained that a lot of them are the reasons she left him before I was born, and that they aren't normal and I need to not put up with it. This was such a huge shock to me as I've just been thinking that I need to get over myself and stop being so emotional and spoilt, and now I just don't know what to think. So I thought I'd come on here and try and get some unbiased opinions. I'm not really a very self-pitying person and I am struggling with a lot of guilt in even writing this post, that I'm a terrible daughter for even doubting him for a second. 

1. He gets very heated during arguments and is triggered by the smallest things, to the point where he will throw the nearest object and break it while screaming and shouting at me. I can remember many, many instances of this, the earliest is probably 12 but I might not remember before that. That earliest example is that I was once on the phone with my friend and he wanted me to show him how to cook fish, so when I came back from speaking with her he started screaming at me that I left him all alone with the fish and that I should have said goodbye to my friend straight away, and threw the glass tray with the fish at the sink taps so that everything broke and the fish was ruined. I'd say angry incidents like that happen every few days, sometimes more, even if he doesn't always throw something. Other examples include when I mentioned that I wanted to go to a different supermarket than he wanted so he almost crashed the car, or he broke our phone by throwing it onto the table, and he broke our printer too. All of them were for things I did/said that I didn't even realise I was doing until he got angry. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. He says horrible things to me in all these arguments, last week I forgot to say good morning to him and he went to bed all day, and then came down at midnight and told me that he has no one in his life who wants to be around him (I never go out, I even coordinate going for a walk while he's sleeping, hardly ever see my friends and barely have any anyway, rarely see my mother, he doesn't want me to get a job so I don't, and I spend a lot of my time looking after him? I've isolated myself for him.) that I 'don't even take the time to say good morning' and that he's dying.  And I started objecting to what he was saying and he screamed 'you're killing me, if you keep talking like that I'm going to die, if you want me to die keep talking'. Him dying is my greatest anxiety, and he knows that, so him saying that has really upset me. He also says that I'm a 'selfish, horrible little girl', that I purposely enjoy arguing with him and that I annoy him on purpose. And other hurtful things. He also regularly says that my mother is a horrible person, and goes through all the reasons he has.  

3. A positive one, I think? But the most confusing and guilty one. Every time he gets angry at me I cry or run away, so he spends ages after saying how much he loves me and how he's 'never been angry' with me, it's just his personality, and that he doesn't mean any of the things he says and that I need to just ignore him. He also says that I'm the most important person in the world, and that he only wants me to be at his funeral, and none of my siblings. 

And then when I'm still upset and explain to him how much saying those things he says hurts me, and how it makes me scared to talk to him or disagree with him, and that that's why I avoid him, and then he goes on this rant about how he's a terrible, terrible father and an awful person, that he's just ruined our relationship forever, none of his life's work was worth anything and that I should leave him like everybody else has done, and that he wouldn't blame me. He once said 'I'm going to move to France and you won't have to deal with me anymore', and so I always end up apologizing to him and comforting him and saying that those things aren't true, that he's an amazing father and I love him and will never, ever leave him. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's it, basically. Do you think my mother is right? She's his ex so I can't trust her, and she said I couldn't live with her anyway so I don't have much of a choice in where to go whatever happens. I'm just scared of what to do in the future, and whether he'll be okay if I ever move out.

54,So I was driving down the highway and there was a pair of bikers. Like bike bike not motorcycle. I thought I had enough room to get by them but their cart swung and knocked out my light tore my bumper off and damaged my tire. So at first they said no no please don’t call the cops so we  do anyway ( there was an eyewitness) and turns out they’re from Italy going on a cross country trek. And they also have no insurance what are the odds right?? Anyway no one was considered at fault but everyone told me they should pay for the damages. Now I’m stuck and not sure what to do. They also had the audacity to ask me to buy them a new bike. Any suggestions on cheapest way to fix my car and anything else would be greatly appreciated ,05Dec2018,1

They’re making such a big deal out of it and I don’t know if I should just pay it under the name of my mother or try paying it under my name? The reason I want it under my name is because I heard that it helps you out later when you want to make a big purchase, or really any benefit that may come with that. What do you guys think?

59,"My wife and I have been married for 3 years. I work out of town 5 days a week. I drive 4+ hours back home on Friday night and leave Sunday afternoon having about 22 conscious hours a week to be a home owner, dog owner, brother, son, friend, and husband in the flesh and actually present. I say all that to preface what is next.

My wife treats me like a second rate citizen. I'm not doing enough to help progress chores she isn't capable of while I'm not home like recently doing all these massive decorations for Christmas all while attempting to spend time with a very badly rebelling dog due to lack of attention recently. Then I'm not talking enough during the week to her. She's demanding I take an hour and a half every night to call her. I wake up before Dawn, go to work, work 11+ hours, come into a hotel, shower, eat dinner, go to the gym, shower again, then attempt to stay awake and alert for an hour and a half to talk which gives me barely 4 hours to sleep every night and repeat. I'm neglecting my mental health and me time running a marathon. I had to fight for literally 3 months to beg to get 1 weekend a month where I can do anything I want to do without having to answer to a soul. Not meaning go out and party just do what I want. Not go to her parents and listen to her mom nag about wanting grandchildren. Not go shopping with her and her sister. Not anything I don't want to do, because generally I do it without hesitation just because I'm generally nice and also don't want to argue. I can't find balance because she doesn't want to be balanced. I honestly have been debating divorce but I'm so scared of disappointing her family. I do love all of them including my wife but she is literally draining the life from me. I don't have time.e on the week days period and the weekends are hers or hell. Period. I thought the ""my weekend would help but it doesn't. It made it worse. Now she makes me put it on a calendar and when I ask to do something any other time or express my disdain for something she wants me to do or go to she says "" you have your weekend. Don't ruin all my other days"". I just need an outside opinion and I have zero clue where to get it. She's helped me lose all my friends and family and I just don't know what else could fix it other than divorce. Me being gone can't be easy for her I know. I wish like hell I could be there all the time to help her with anything and everything but the lifestyle and home remodeling she desires and recieves mean I must work like I do and make what I do. Things were simpler when we were poor and played Skyrim in a double wide all night. But her parents hated that lifestyle.  They drilled and preached until she just refuses to live simpler. She wants everything they told her was trashy not to have. We weren't dirt poor. We just couldn't afford more than $50 a month in our savings and we ate like crap and had a fucking blast. I miss her.

65,"In the past couple of months I have been struggling with anxiety and depression that has started to spiral downwards. For the first time in my life I feel horrible insecure, specifically when it comes to my long term relationship.

I have always been an awkward person, but my quirkiness has never held me back from getting romantic interest. Since hitting my adulthood I felt fairly confident in my looks, confident in who I am and what I want. in life and in a relationship. But I am also a very emotional person who feels everything quiet intensely. It's always been a struggle for me to balance everything, but I had it pretty figured out and was happy. 

A series of different things has led me to the darker place that I am now. A toxic work environment, health issues, working through relationship stresses. Ultimately I am now not in a good head space and I am finding it very difficult to maintain positive affirmations and to not let doubt and dread creep into my mind.

I have a list with the goals I want to achieve which are the following:

* see a therapist
* take at least 4 new classes this year (dance, boxing, ect)
* make solid plans to travel 
* apply to new jobs each week

A lot of these things require me to be in a better financial situation, and I am trying to ride out the next month or so until I am able to make it happen. I don't want to fall into a deeper rut and not take the steps I need to, but staying positive and motivated to break out has been very difficult.

For anyone that has gone through a tough spot in their life, what things did you do to help life you back into being confident? I am willing to entertain any idea, big or small.

I mentioned I was going to break up with him, but I haven't had the chance. Either way, he and I are literally only superficial online friends. Hell, we watch Harry Potter online. Just maybe friends.

He said to meet him at his hotel. Well, i respond with, ""okay, sure, we'll have much fun"". Him, mentions Tinder saying he's gonna have to use it instead. Well I just laugh and say lol. Guys are hormonal AF so it doesn't surprise me. Welll.. he adds on unless I'm interested... 

I say no. I'd meet up with him as friends thats it.

Blah blah, goes on asking me to join tinder so we can match, says it'd be great then asks me if i realy wouldn't. 

My response was, long distance relationship doesn't work, he's leaving, i might catch feels, among other reasons, plus i dont know whats going to happen at that time.. single or in relationship..

Says no emotion will be involved, i say so just sex, he says sure, i have a hotel so why not.

I guess I should explain the situation. I've had a PS4 for about a year now and this is a guy I've probably been friends with for about 4 months. We had a conversation like three nights ago because I'm a bit of a natural flirt, whether I mean it or not. But he admitted that he thought I was funny and hot and stuff and it kinda flattered me. So last night I asked him if we were dating because afterwards we started acting a lot closer, much like how I would see a ""couple"" acting. And after we did he sent me a picture of himself because I had never seen him before and asked. 

I've talked with a friend of his who's given me this whole speech about not hurting him, too. And it makes me feel even more distressed about the whole situation. 

He's a great guy and all. He's funny and makes me laugh, we get along great. But I just can't deny that I have zero physcial attraction to him whatsoever. Maybe if he lost weight, as shallow as it seems. 

If I'm not, how should I break it to him? Could I even bring up the age difference since I'm 18 and he's like 23 or 24? Please let me know whether I am justified to let him go and please help me come up with some sort of statement. Should I be honest in my reasoning?

I obviously have to protect myself and didn’t believe this fully. 

Soon after we started texting (about 3 days) he asked me out to go get lunch. I accepted and we ended up going to get my nose pierced too so it was a little unconventional but a lot of fun. We hugged goodbye and later that night, he asked me out again. We went to go see a movie so it was a little less exciting but still fun. I expected him to kiss me as he was dropping me off but he stopped in the middle of the street so it wasn’t possible. 

Then thanksgiving came and we both got really sick so we hadn’t seen each other in over a week, until yesterday. We went to go see another movie and get dinner after. He didn’t try to initiate any physical contact during the movie or after.  At dinner, he was flirty but a little timid. When he dropped me back off at my car, we hugged goodnight and he invited me over the following day, I couldn’t so I suggested Wednesday, and he was just as enthusiastic so I accepted. Still. No. Kiss. 

I’m just confused. I obviously like spending time with him/ and him as a person and I see potential in where this could go. It’s possible he just be majorly shy/inexperienced and doesn’t want to scare me away or that he’s just uninterested but why invite me over if you can’t even kiss me? 

We also only text on snapchat which is a little annoying to me but I understand because I also use it as a main form of communication. He’s also insisted on paying for everything, including lunch on the first date.

Also this post is gonna be long, will do tl;dr.

Anyway first off, I'm currently \[23/m\]  I've had a writing hobby going on three years now. Those three years ago I stumbled across a website called Royalroadl whilst looking for stories similar to Re:Monster. (I know it's a terrible story and I got bored of it quite quickly). This website was filled with first time writers and the like so I thought I'd give it a go. After my first chapter release I couldn't believe how well it went and my story only gained in popularity after that. I had terrible grammar and didn't really think the story through, but my story was always being described as quirky and fun. I've always wanted to do something related to my imagination, at first it was a comic book author/artist, but after 3 years of art in college I felt as though I had hardly improved and just sort of gave up, still draw on occasion, but not as much as I used to. 

Writing was something I never thought about until I began doing it. Eventually I sort of fell in with a mini group on the website, a private chat for stories that were outside the norm for the site. Mine was very much inside the norm, but they welcomed anyone into the chat. 

I was having the time of my life, college was ending and I was definitely at least going to pass if not better I was loving writing this story and a few side projects including a Star Wars fanficiton and one of the writers I spoke to told me that I could probably make a living out of writing. Nothing special, you know a small living made off of kindle self publishing, but I've never really cared about being rich or anything. I hadn't even thought about publishing before that, but after thinking it over for several months I decided on it being my end goal to start living off writing before I was 30, it was the first real goal I had in my life and I was happily pursuing it.

Of course that's when things began to fall apart as they always do when your lifes looking up. I met a girl. Or more accurately my Mum and her friend from work decided to play matchmakers between their kids. We got on really well and had a lot of similar hobbies. She was shy and I was shy, but eventually we started dating. Of course it was only after dating that I found out she had depression and severe anxiety issues. I've talked about this girl before, so I won't go into too much detail, but basically I was hardly allowed any freetime, between working after finishing college and seeing her I got a few hours free a day at most. So that time was mostly spent relaxing, playing games watching youtube that kind of thing.

To top it off, writing the story had become a bit stale. I started writing it in a daily diary format in the style of Re:Monster and other such stories. In the story the main character had one year before a disaster struck. So I had at least a whole years worth of days to write out. The problem was the off days, the days where nothing happened. They were difficult and exhausting to write. 

This combined with my lack of spare time meant I released about four chapters last year. I had become fatigued and burnt out on life, my now ex/gf was getting worse and more abusive. I just couldn't deal with much of anything anymore, just sort of drifting through life. 

I ended up breaking up with her in February of this year. Fast forward to now. I'm much better, although I feel as though I'm still recovering  from the relationship in some ways, I barely clean my room and don't really try and do too much to advance my life. I'm also a little bit scared of dating women even though I really want to be in a relationship.

However, after a rocky half a year, I've started to release about 2 chapters a month. I'm writing a lot more regularly, on top of that I'm taking better care of my body and exercising regularly. Like I said other than my room and stuff, I'm doing better.

The problem is people have lost interest in my story, I used to get a dozen or more comments per chapter, now I'm lucky to get two. I'm still slowly gaining new followers, but it's really lowered my desire to write. I used to look forward to releasing the chapters, seeing what people thought of new characters or events or if they found the comedy bits funny. Now I feel down when I release a chapter.

The problem is I promised myself to see this through to the end as I have never done so with pretty much anything before, and I still on occasion get messages from people saying how much they love my story and it makes me want to carry on. 

On top of all that, I feel as though my writing is getting far worse, I make so many mistakes and for a while I was learning how to use grammar 100% properly but I sort of gave that up for this story. It's a pretty mediocre story to begin with.

I still love the world, I still love my characters and all I want to do with it, but I don't love writing this story anymore. That's not to say I don't love writing, I still feel passionate and happy when I write, just I barely feel it with this one in particular.

The problem is, I'm working full time, I have friends and obligations, so I don't get much writing time. I spend all my writing time on this story, but I think I might enjoy myself a lot more if I moved on to another one.

Also as some extra info. Most of my family is supportive of me, my Mum thinks it's a good hobby, but she says I should look for a real job and not count of becoming an author (I work fulltime at McDonalds, to keep me going until I finish this book). Of course I'm not really expecting the book to even do well, I'm not naive, I'm a nobody with a relatively mediocre story. I've always told her that if it fails I'll figure out what 'real job' to get. The rest of my family seems fine by it, my Dads supportive as he wanted to be a writer when he was younger.

Anyway, after all that, on to my question. Should I just stop writing this story all together? Concentrate on it like I have been? Or put it on the backburner so I can see if I can reignite my passion for it whilst writing something else? Any advice would be appreciated! Also sorry about the long post.

Tl;dr: I enjoy writing as a hobby, but after a bad relationship and a tiring style of writing I don't know whether to give up the story I'm writing and move onto one of my other ideas, or to keep it going.

Also I know my grammars probably terrible in this post.

I have both of my arms covered of meaning and my inner demons. The specific tattoo that she copied is a tattoo that means the most to me. The tattoo for the day I clinically died from an overdose. It just says '18 minutes', simple tattoo. But it also has a clock showing the time I came back which she also copied. She didn't notify me before she got the tattoo and I never even told her the back story. I'm having a hard time forgiving or forgetting. I already said my peace but I still feel angry.

After I did she told her friend to do the same and I told him I didn’t feel comfortable with him touching my girlfriend’s thigh and she just responded with “Don’t listen to him it’s my body and I asked you to”

and then he proceeded to touch her thighs.

I was then visibly upset/pissed about it and just looked out the bus window trying to ignore her and she started laying her head on me and holding my hand kind of as an attempt to calm me down.

90,"This is going to be relatively long, talking about what happened and how I’m feeling now. If you mind find another post. 

I’ve always had depression. When I was 7 I threatened to kill myself. 8 I kept cutting myself. Then I stopped for a while. At this point I was living with my mom because my dad was always working. From what I saw she was a good parent, but when she got angry it flipped. She would yell, push me and my siblings around, threaten to break our things, even if we bought them with our own money, she would take our money ect. My brother has autism so he got it especially hard. She would yell at him for almost nothing. A few times she shoved him up the stairs face first and he would hit his face, and he would get a lip bleed or nose bleed and she would act all surprised. “Oh I’m so sorry, here, here’s (insert something special)”. One night he accidentally broke something, and she took him upstairs. 2 - 3 minutes later I hear the loudest shriek I’ve ever heard. At that point, my dad just got back. We ran upstairs at top speed to find my brother with half of his face horribly bruised and bleeding. She said he fell off the top bunk and hit his head. Skip ahead an hour, and the social services are knocking on the door. My mom gets pissed and tells me not to say anything. At this point I have no idea what’s happening but I say ok. Skip ahead even more and we’re in the hospital, getting my brothers face checked out. My dad tells me to pack the stuff I want to bring and put it into a backpack. I do said task and get in the car crying. We’re in an apartment. I make 2 friends, very good friends. We’re forced to move again and my 2 best friends, probably ever (at the time) are long gone. Another apartment complex. At this point my mom was taking ALL of my dads money. She wasn’t getting her mental health taken care of and she refused to take a polygraph when she was arrested. I was in 5th grade at the time. I made some of the best friends ever there. I still talk to them today. They supported me and helped me but it wasn’t enough. I supported them out of depression and into success and better grades. As of right now they are still treading on the bridge I gave them. My grades are still terrible. I have no friends exept them but we were forced to move out of the district. No friends in this school. What do I do

How do I build myself a bridge like I made my friends. How do I think better of myself. How do I not despise life

He just failed his drivers test for the second time and all he can make is excuses. Both my parents spoil the hell out of us and he is not thankful at all and is not caring at all of anyone but himself. He just got his first girlfriend who he doesn’t want to have meet my parents even though my mom is a literal saint and welcoming to everybody. What doesn’t help is I can tell his girlfriend has the same pessimistic and unmotivated attitude that he has and I don’t believe she is good for him. He has no goals and doesn’t want to do anything except play PS4. My parents are trying to get him into an expensive film school because that’s one of his only hobbies  but even still that isn’t enough to motivate him or get him to actually set some goals for himself. He’s extremely perverted and gives off bad vibes and I am certain he’s been addicted to pornography since a very young age which I believe can be one of the many causes for his worsening attitude over the years. He’s slow and is never in a hurry, he will make me and my dad late every morning. He has no sense of urgency or care for others and only cares for himself and it ends up effecting others. His failed driving tests are because he doesn’t care at all and won’t listen. I am worried for his future. We’ve grown up with a silver spoon in our mouths and I don’t know what he is gonna be like when he graduates and is in the real world I am scared for him. He couldn’t give a fuck about anyone. He can never compliment anyone or say anything good at all.  I love my brother and I don’t want him to end up homeless because that’s what his life looks like with the way he is going.

And I visit them fairly often. We watch movies, play games, etc. We share a lot of common ground and I don't consider it different from any of my other friends. And they don't treat me any different from others they interact with. They have never harmed me in anyway or made me feel uncomfortable.

99,"I am at the cusp of breaking from codependency. That being said, my last (and all that came before) relationship is testing my patience and logic. I’m not sure what to do with myself outside of work and I have Extra time off this weekend. 

Here’s the situation: I moved 3000 miles from home to follow my heart and have been on a heartbreak adventure ever since. 

For the last 3 years, I’ve gone from a very stable, social, high earning and fully independent and contributing adult to a hospitalized,  catatonic mess. Becoming disabled at 26 in what felt like my prime is still a pain point for me. I lost a lot, mostly myself respect and dignity. It’s been a struggle identifying as myself ever since. 

Like many, I lived beyond my means and had a rolling credit card balance and other debts that I blissfully made minimum monthly payments and thought noting of it. Even with fantastic benefits, cashing out 11 years of 401K-minus penalty, selling high ticket items, relocating by necessity. i, a college educated non-addict was homeless. The point is I have no place to go, no credit or money or family to lean on. 

I have 3 days off and are in MUCH NEEd of rest, perhaps fun and sleep! 

I’ve been wanting to take myself on a vacation but never feel the money is justifiable. 

I proposed taking the vacation with my ex as a fresh start. We split the cost and just make fun memories. There is also a work end of year party that I want to go to. Solo or with my ex-I’m unsure? Mostly solo because at the spring party- we fought and I was in a bad mood. With her because I’ve only worked there since the spring party and I half- hate the company, my job and most of the fuckers who work there. But I had some fun toward the end last Party. Social gatherings like this don’t come by often. Where it’s semi-easy for me to acclimate.

Then this guy from work, that I just met last week, invited me on a road trip to 2 other states-this weekend!

I was on the phone with a client and his cubicle 2 rows behind me-the call escalated and I was being yelled at to which I had to reply, “there is no reason to yell at me, I understand you’re frustrated-I am trying to help you”. I did my job well, but hung up the call, burst out a frustrated “CUNT” and tried not to scream or cry- it was a mean call and this guy stood up and with the most sincere eye contact “you handled that really well, you did everything right” 

Today I was too tired and sick to work from more fighting with my ex that resulted in my having to leave at 11pm and sleep in my car- this happens a few nights a week...

He messaged me to say hi and see how I was. He said “I wish you could come with me, take a break from all the noises in life-you seem like a nice person in need of a vacation.”

So now the dilemma-cancel my hotel and go on this road trip? Rekindle with ex? 

The medical bills, stigma and actually physical and mental complications form the original disability drain me every single day- the aftermath of all the trauma that’s ensued feels like a shitty reward for escaping with my life; and just barely.

101,"Not sure if this may be selfish to post and to think, but I've felt depressed for the last couple months. I grew up quiet and timid. My eldest sister lives and works abroad. She invited me to travel across the world on my own on an all expense payed trip to open my eyes. It worked and it was the best experience of my life. When I came home to my boring home town i got myself a summer job, one I still have now while during school.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that I don't know what I want to do. As of writing this I feel bored. I want to go out and do something but most of the time that's unfeasible because of where I live and what my schedule's like. School doesn't interest me like it used to and I look forward to going to work because at least it's something to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes feel like just walking forever without stopping. Worries forgotten and woes left behind, I could finally feel peace. Walking around Asia or Europe and just existing without thinking is something I need. Is this just wishful thinking or is it something I could actually do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired of the stress of life and the entrapment I feel. I've talked with my family and friends and they understand what I'm saying but not how I feel. I just want to get away; to spend the money I've saved on a one way ticket to forever-land and be gone. Is it just because I'm young and naive?

It backs up to a different neighborhood in which a year ago the house that is diagonal from our back yard sold and the couple who bought it has a 40 something year old son who is a registerd sex offender and labled a sexual predator that lives with them. We have never met him or his parents that moved in.  The house next to theirs backs up to our backyard in which we know them and our kids climb over the fence and play with one another.

Today this guy who is the sexual predator shows up to my front door while my wife and kids are gone. I answer the door and he tells me who he is and where he lives. He then tells me he spoke with the neighbor next to him (who we know) which backs up to our house and she was speaking with my wife about giving my 5 yr daughter a toy that he got and just has to have a picture of her with it to send to the marketing company he works for to show that it got to the right demographic.  I told him they werent here and began asking questions about the company and where he lived.  In telling me why he needed the picture, he said he just needed a picture of my daughter and would just make up the reactions to it because he already had played with the toy and seen what it does, (though it was still in packaging as well as in a sealed clear bag). All sorts of things started running through my head and it didnt give me a good feeling at all and I ended up grabbing my phone to record the interaction rather than my gun.  

After asking more questions about the company and where he exactly lived, i asked him if he was a registered sex offender. He replied with yes.  I then told him there was no way in hell he was going to take a fucking picture of my daughter and to get the fuck off my property. He said ok and left.

Earlier today my[F/17] older brother[M/22] asked me to borrow $175. He recently got back from a trip and he's low on finances.

The roommates are perfectly fine but one roommate asked if her friend could sleep on our couch for three days because she had gotten ""jipped"" out of a living situation. Pretty sure all of us said yes, or at least some version of yes, because the guest ended up sleeping in our roommates room. Well this ended up being longer than three days, two weeks to be exact. I'm fine with it, I'm usually not home anyways. Well I was fine with it until I had a pretty revealing conversation with the guest. She was supposed to move into her new apartment on Monday but, surprise, she got ""jipped"" again. Well we got to talking and she was talking about potentially staying all of December. This time she got jipped because the apartment complex didn't have the paperwork ready in time so she said they wanted to up her deposit to double what it currently was in order for her to move in that day. Well she completely cut ties apparently and was now seeking a place to live again. I found this all out when she back to the house I'm renting a room in by herself, without the roommate she is friends with. Also the first time she got jipped, I found out during the story, the ""landlord"" wanted her to pay her deposit in amazon giftcards so she did, and when she got to the house the homeowners said they had no idea who the landlord she was talking about was. This all seemed really sketchy to me and instantly got me spooked. I hit up the roommate to see if she was actually going to let this girl stay with us all of December but no response. So I messaged the landlord who said he would take care of the situation and told my roommate she had to make the guest leave.

122,"Hi all, 

I am a senior at a liberal public university that is pretty diverse. I study nursing here. I come from a poor economic background, and have paid for school all by myself except for the 3k in debt I currently have. I will graduate in 4.5 years, and unfortunately, all of my scholarship only last 4 total years. Thus, I am expected to shit out about 20k for my last year of school. 

&amp;#x200B;

My nursing school provides good scholarships that I will be applying for in January. However, I only qualify for about half. 

We just received an email from a scholarship committee basically saying, ""we are handing out money, apply to get it"". I open it, and the number one criteria is that you must be African American. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am super frustrated. I get what people are trying to do. African Americans, in general, experience greater levels of poverty, thus these committees are trying to provide them with opportunities to get through school. In that process, I am being left on the fringes. I am not black, and I am poor, and I am being told I can not apply for certain scholarships.

I am considering approaching this to the head of the nursing school. I think I can approach it with an open mind, and just facilitate discussion. I am looking for input. I want to know if I am missing important information here. I would love to hear input about this topic and discuss this before I go to the Dean, as I want to make sure that I handle this properly.

Leaning towards the FBI (HRT), would keep me closer to home for the most part. Right now I am deciding between getting certified as a paramedic (got accepted to the program, starts 09JAN2019 ends MAY2020. Or I could begin working in the oil/fishing industry starts 18JAN2019 (have jobs guaranteed 100% in both if I choose) and traveling to see gf and other parts of the world during the off seasons. My partner of 6 years works for an NGO in Africa and finishes up Spring of 2020. Plan on going to real school and live together again AUG2020 while she gets her graduate degree. 

My dilemma is this. If I decide to do the paramedic program, great. A handy little add on to my resume for the people I want to work with, not neccecary, just trying to stay really competitive. If I have that cert I have fall back (Fire, LE) and can still work a summer fishing season to make \~20k (MAY-AUG2020) right before I go to school. But thats all I will have to my name is that 20K and not much more in savings. Additionally I would not be able to see my girlfriend at all (or just very briefly due to travel/time constraints) during the medic pipeline. Which would be stressful to say the least. Not a deal breaker as we have discussed but just plain shitty. If I go the other route and work oil &amp; fishing two seasons (minimal COL on the oil field &amp; fishing) I can pocket around 100-110k before AUG2020. Thats a solid chunk of change to be starting school with. And I would get to travel and spend a lot of time with my girlfriend. 

So the real question is money vs  medic certification, whats better for immediate and long term happiness. Im just super lost right now.  All advice/input is welcome.  If you need clarification on anything just let me know. Hope to hear from everyone.",05Dec2018,1

129,"Problem: 2 out of 3 of my coworkers believe that I stole an idea from 1 of the 2. They’ve been throwing hints excessively during work (I’m saying excessively because I actually caught them when I usually don’t.) 

What I Did Do: I searched for research papers on google that would solve our problem. I found one and sent it to our boss and all of my coworkers. It was a general search. I specified nothing when it came to possible solutions during the search. I just searched the problem.

What I Think He Thinks: He mentioned a “possible” solution to me, dealing with a specific variable, and I took it and ran with it without acknowledging that it came from him.  (But I “Literally” don’t listen when he talks. Not on purpose, but because it’s hard listen. Therefore, the aforementioned perspective might not be true. This is just me making assumptions based on hints thrown.)



Hints Thrown:
1.) [Said by Coworker] Hey (Insert Name Here), didn’t you just tell us that the problem was linked to (insert variable here).

2.) [I walked in on this one.] Yeah, and I was saying that that was your EXACT idea about (They changed the subject to another experiment as I walked in.) 

3.) Not a hint, but the person that I was supposed to have stolen the idea from started greeting me dryly every morning. Hostility is in his body language.
 
I guess I should list off all of the pertinent information in order for you all to understand the dilemma.

1.) I’m a research scientist, and I work in a group of 4.
2.) I’m on the “spectrum.” (So my auditory comprehension is low. I usually just nod and smile because people usually get annoyed after you ask them to repeat something for the fifth time.)
3.) As a result of #2, I don’t know how to handle most social situations.
4.) I’m not very good at explaining my reasoning. Especially when it comes to emotional responses.
5.) Animosity towards me or anyone else in a room physically hurts me. I can’t help that it hurts. I can’t describe how it hurts. It just does.

Question: I don’t know how to smooth this over. I don’t know how to explain to them that I don’t listen because I don’t want them to know that I’m on the spectrum. I don’t know how to tell my coworker that I didn’t steal his idea without belittling him. (I’m starting to think that they don’t know how google works because if they did, they would already have had the solution to the problem. Plus, they would know that I wouldn’t HAVE to search for a specific variable in order to find a solution.) If I have to explain how google works to them, it would be with an attitude because I’m already angry that they’re angry at me. I’m also angry at myself because I have no idea how to handle the situation. 

What would be the proper path to go forward on when it comes to resolving this issue?

One of the girls in the group, who we'll call Meg, I consider to be one of my better if not best friend. Meg tells me a lot about her life and what she's going through, and just by talking to her everyday i've seen very obvious signs of depression, anxiety, and even anorexia in her. I love her to death and want to help and support her as much as i can but there's only one problem. She's a major bitch. Not only are most of her problems caused by her own apathy to most of what's going on around her, but she uses me as a personal therapist and refuses to talk to anyone else. I struggle with anxiety and depression caused by ADHD myself, and can't be a therapist for a seriously mentally ill girl like I am now. I told her i was gonna tell her mom, but she threatened to stop talking to me if I did and also I know her and her mom arent and never really have been on the best terms. I thought about just calling her mom anyway and risking our friendship for the sake of her health, but i'm not sure how that would end up and the potential results scare me.

135," So I'm on this Discord server for fandom reasons. Most of the people there are really chill, and I consider myself to be friends with a decent portion of the active members, but there's this one member that ticks me off. For context, the fandom is very left-leaning, so they're fine with this person and completely accept them. Thing is, I think that this person is an attention-seeker who is trying to take advantage of the kindness and acceptance of the server. Their identities are:

\- Non-binary (they/them pronouns) (I will be using these to make sure I stay in the habit because them constantly correcting me is annoying)

\- Asexual

\- Cupiromantic (that’s what it says on their blog) (meaning wanting a relationship but not feeling romantic attraction)

\- Psychopath 

\- Has anxiety (and selective mutism and panic attacks as a result)

\- Has fibromyalgia

\- Has PTSD which is triggered by fire (even though they draw and post shit with fire in it at times)

\- Is pagan (and will leave a convo if Christmas is mentioned too many times even though that should be expected considering the server is mostly made up of people from Western countries)

\- Is impoverished

\- Grew up on a farm

\- Lives in Australia

\- Claims to have had a bad childhood where their parents didn't let them get treatment for their supposedly fucked up spine

\- Walks with a cane (though I can mimic one of their selfies that was meant to show how messed up their leg is)

\- Is blind in one eye (but is still allowed to drive and can apparently drive heavy equipment too.)

\- Is in a university (not gonna say which one partially because I don’t know and partially because the server would hunt me)

\- Is a big Steven Universe fan

And one last note to seal the deal...

\- Has 5 Tumblr accounts where they complain about all of their problems (which I will not be linking because it’d get linked back to this thread and I’m one of the only Americans on the server)

And my problems with them are:

\-  Gets ""triggered"" when someone mentions fire or smoke and forces everyone to put TW FIRE before each “triggering” post in bold (I'm a Californian and I sometimes complain about the fires here)

\- Often invades normal convos by complaining about their issues

\- Complains. Constantly. About anything. 

\- Claims to not get offended by anything, gets offended all the time 

And my reasonings for thinking they’re faking it

\- Cupiromantic is a MOGAI term and I don’t trust MOGAI (MOGAI is the source of the neopronouns and over-specific identities we all know and love)

\- Picked identities that are easy to fake

\- Constantly making conversations about them

\- Contradicting claims (blind in one eye but can still drive heavy machinery, triggered by fire but has drawings of fire and has posted pictures with fire in them on their main Tumblr, feels no romantic attraction but has an online gf)

\- 

\- A reason why they might fake it is because every time they complain about something everyone on the server becomes sympathetic. If you ask questions you seem like a dick, though that’s just a problem with the community

Everyone on the server seems to love them, including all of the chill people. My (irl) friend and I (my friend lurks on the server, I’m an active on it) are very suspicious of them. She says I should call them out for their bs, but I don’t want the people on the server to get pissed at me and potentially ban me.

There is this girl I work with and I think she’s giving me signs to make a move on her. I’m clueless when it comes to these types of things. So I need to know if these are signs are a cue or are they playful gestures?

First, She grabs me a lot. This includes Always giving me intimate hugs from behind, pressing her body onto me with some force and refusing to let go. Grabbing my arm frequently. And even rubbing up against me the same way cats rub up against you when they like you. 

I only work at this job once or twice a week. So I come in to help them out when they are gonna be busy. And I usually always end up getting stoned or buzzed to the point I shouldn’t drive. (I don’t)And she always offers to give me a ride home or even spending the night at her place. And she says this in a seductive manner, giving me this smirk. But I can’t tell if she’s joking or not. Why would she offer this every time this senecio arises? Also one night when we were all talking at the bar at the end of the night. And I had just come back from a party at another bar. Which had these badass cupcakes I was telling them about. She looks at me and says do you want another cupcake. While motioning outside with her eyes as of to say, let’s get outta here, wink wink. (She’s always mentioning sexual innuendos to me). Awhile later again telling me I could come to her place, as she put her head on my shoulder.  

But I don’t wanna make a move and have it jeopardize my relationship with her and my other co workers since we are all really close. I know a simple hug or a polite gesture to drive me home doesn’t mean she wants to do me. I just think that there is some type of sexual tension between us and I need some advice. Or tell me what you would do in that situation. Plz my Gs, help a brotha out.

I have no idea if she sorted this out with work but she hasn't gone out most of last week and this week. She does travel a'lot and can do some work but she is taking a long break from going out. Im scared she will lose her job. 

When she is depressed her speech becomes all most impossible to understand. It's the saddest thing i have ever heard and im always sad seeing her act like this. I'm mad at myself for getting mad at my mom. She just seems so helpless and im wondering why she can't do anything she has the strength. We're running out of food and i've been eating very poorly.

Been talking to someone on discord for a few months now. We're good friends and I haven't had a good friend as him in awhile it seems.

Somewhere along the line I figure out he's kind of into traps and girly stuff, and I would always jokingly call him a thot or something. We ended up what seemed like was jokingly flirting a lot but one day I found out that he ""would love to continue"" but was starting to get serious with another guy. This surprised me a lot, but I understood because I was never open to any feelings or anything but I thought the flirting would be kind of a hint.

Apparently they broke up like an hour after anyway, but after I confessed that I felt like I had feelings it wasn't reciprocated. Apparently he doesn't feel for me that way, but is still interested in joking around and flirting. Lately I said I'm okay with that, but I was hoping I think in the back of my mind that he was falling for me too. I was reminded today that it's nice to flirt but he isnt interested in me that way. ""but with everyday i think i get more sure that i dont like you that way""

Should I tell him I just want to talk less so I can move on or just do it? I feel wrong about the whole thing, because I still am not even sure if I'm gay really. I think I was interested in the flirting with a girl almost, and I still don't have any interest in any guys I see in real life either. No attraction or anything.

145,"TW: Pedophilia and exploitation

I'm currently a high school student in the Midwest United States. I go to a very small school, about 200 people in the middle and high school combined. A few years ago a superintendent was fired for blackmailing and exploiting many boys. He would get nude photos of boys and blackmail them to send more, threatening to ruin their school career, their chance at scholarships for sports, or release the photos. He is a pedophile. He was fired, had his teaching license stripped, but was never charged because the boys were scared to go to the police. Personally I think he deserves to die a slow and painful death in prison with all the other pedos, but that's besides the point. Now he is getting a doctorate at a local-ish University and has written a book. I am scared that he is soon going to be in a position where he can hurt even more people. Some of you may write this off as small town gossip, and I understand that, but I am being dead serious.

15 minutes after parking the car, the whole building was evacuated, fire department arrived to douse the smoke and fire.

When everyone was allowed into the garage 3 hours later, to our horror, my wife realized that it was our Audi that had burned down.

The insurance company (who have been very helpful) did a joint inspection with an Audi technician, and the fire analyst said that the fire started near the oil filter, but could not determine the exact cause for the fire. They did not find any evidence of tampering/ something like a cigarette butt starting the fire.

Insurance is prepared to pay depreciated price for the car (And said it will not affect my premium). Audi said that since they could not find the cause of the fire (why am I surprised that Audi was not able to find a cause), as a courtesy, they will match what the insurance company is going to pay (in return of them getting the car).

I was really hoping for Audi to take more ownership here. Because, I keep imaging what if this had happened in our house with 2 small kids in them. Or if my wife was driving with my kids in it.

150,"So in 2016, a college flatmate, who is (still) a medical student, secretly urinated in a food product which I unknowingly used.  


I should probably add some additional context: I was suffering severe depression at the time and was contemplating taking my own life around the time I found out about this. Looking up various methods of suicide, making plans etc. Since the incident, my mental health worsened (mainly for other reasons, though finding out about this publicly in the middle of a stressful exam season did not help) and I was sectioned under the mental health act last year. While I hadn't spoken to him about this, I had asked him about organ donation with respect to committing suicide in a hospital (i.e. whether my body would be kept as evidence by police). He was therefore aware, to some extent, of my state of mind.  


The incident itself came following a situation in which he was being incredibly petty about the heating, which came to a head after a number of months with me searching his room in a fairly bad mood after he'd hidden the thermostat on a weekend in December when it was around 10\*C. I had asked him where it was, he simply replied with a laughing emoji. I left his room in a state of disarray (no damage done) because he was being an arse.  
 

Following this, he forced me against a kitchen counter with his body (he is considerably larger). Then there was a lot of other petty stuff like barging past me in corridors. He'd also try and belittle me as much as possible in front of other people. Even before this incident he had done other questionable things, like resting his hands on my thighs etc. This was done in jest, however this made me uncomfortable (which he appeared to enjoy).  
 

A few months later I found out through accident that he had urinated in a food product I had in a shared fridge. This was at a time when I was basically preparing to leave the country on my savings and kill myself if I failed my exams (due to other circumstances I won't mention here). Not to mention the risk of passing on an STD or some other infection (he slept around a lot at the time and claims he didn't always use protection).  
 

I made the decision to confront him about it, and I filmed this confrontation as evidence of a confession. He admits in no uncertain terms the offence and his face is shown in shot. Not much remorse, really. He downplayed his behaviour and he was just sorry to have been caught. He later tried to leave me to clear all his crap out of the house at the end of the year.  
 

I wasn't sure what to do about this at the time and have had a lot going on since.  
 

Do you think such a person should be allowed to practice medicine? Would you want this person as your doctor? I'd be interested to know your opinions on what I should do, as well as any legal options I might have available to me. I'd like to think people improve with time and should be given second chances, but I'm not so sure this is wise. There is a disciplinary procedure, however I don't want to instigate this if it leads to nothing and simply inflates his ego.

However, he complains every night about how much he hates brushing his teeth. He also refuses to use toothpaste except for toddler training toothpaste, which is basically just sugar. We have tried nearly every toothpaste available and he refuses to use any of it. 

At this point, my parents make him take a shower every 2 or 3 days and have almost completely given up on making him brush his teeth.

She tried to convince me not to pursue a career in music, and explained that it was because I am not musically gifted in the same way that I have a natural talent for math and physics. She also said that there is not a lot of money in music and I probably won't be very successful. I was pretty shocked because for most of my life, she has encouraged me to pursue whatever I was interested in. She is an Indian woman, but this was really the first time that she fit the stereotype in my eyes. I didn't get mad, but I was curious to learn about why she thought those things. I explained that nothing was set in stone, and that I might end up choosing not to pursue music. I also explained that if I do want to pursue music, I am willing to work hard and accept a lower salary.

I can't wrap my head around not comparing myself to other people.

159,"So basically I am doing okay financially but do relatively live pay cheque to pay cheque. Recently my dad gifted me a bit of money and I am very appreciative of it and would like to spend a bit of it getting a tattoo that is meaningful to me and that I have wanted for a while.

The problem is my dad asked me not to tell anyone that he gave me this money. He has 3 other children that are my half siblings and much older than me, I also have two half sisters on my moms side, my mom and dad are not together and haven’t been for most my life but I am close with all my siblings and both my parents. 

The thing is that most of my family is aware of how I am doing financially and know a tattoo is not in my current budget. Do I not get the tattoo? Do I wait until after the holidays (keep in mind that it would likely take me a few months to get the tattoo with wait times for a consultation and then the tattoo it’s self), do I have to explain how I spend my money to anyone?

160,"Im a senior in high school in new york, im of legal age to drop out and miss school without getting cps called. This whole school year and all of last year and even though it's my last year i just cannot take this anymore. Every day i have to skip classes because the moment i go to class i hear kids talking about me and making jokes about me and the teachers do nothing about it, ive talked to my school councillor and she said she spoke with my teachers but nothing changed so i stopped going to those classes. Along with that i have suspicion that because my mom went to this school and was such a bad kid they think im a bad kid too so they treat me like im a criminal like her, all the teachers talk down on me including the staff and when i talked to the councillor about maybe switching schools or going to online school or even getting my GED her and my assistant principal lied to me saying that they don't allow kids to do that until they've failed senior year and even after doing my own research about it and even looking at the schools guidelines and knowing people that dropped out even before senior year at this school they still say that im not allowed to. At that point i was going to school like every other day and skipping a few classes and then my grandma got a call from the school saying if i miss another day they'd call cps regardless of my age, and well they did and this is when i learned they shouldn't have done that and i AM allowed to drop out if i want to. I talked to my principal about the school calling cps and he completely changed the subject when i said my age and when i brought up switching to an online school he said ""i dont know those even existed"" Then he said, ""oh kids that do that don't normally go through with it and succeed"" So now im being lied to by everyone at the school just because the damn school rating goes down if i leave. Now with my parents my grandma is fine with anything i do because she knows even if i get my GED i can still go to college and live a successful life but my mom is completely against anything other than me getting my diploma, she said i could switch schools or go to an online school as long as it was free and i had to look into it myself. So getting my GED is out of the question and there's absolutely no online schools in new york, i will absolutely fail if i stay in this school and i can't stand being treated like this by the people inwas told i could trust. I barely have a single friend and there's no way she can help me, if there's anyone out there that can help me please even the smallest piece of advice on what i can do will be amazing.

168,"Hey all. 27 m here, my brother, 29 m recently got married. Lets just say my brother and I are not close. We never chat online, even in person, at family parties we're not even near each other, and if we are, we never talk. Thats fine, I do not really get along with him and he use to argue with me a lot in the past.

We come from a Pakistani culture, which for those of you do not know, is a fairly conservative culture (not super conservative but conservative) and marrying someone not Pakistani or from a Pakistani culture, is not like horrible, but just something people don't do. And my parents being old school Pakis, who were born in Pakistan, and now US citizens (emigrated about 30 years ago) still hold true to those values.

Long story short, my parents have 'accepted' that my brother was dating a Korean culture when he was teaching English in South Korea. But I can tell times where they (my parents) argue with one another, and it may be related to the fact that their disappointed with what my brother did.

While I probably would not marry a South Korean culture, this is a free country, and my brother can do whatever he wants. Its just that Its hard to me to speak to my mom now (who I really am close to and love dearly), I do care about my dad, but we both were never close as I was never close to my brother. I can tell my mom has some form of depression, probably not clinical, but shes definitely low recently and has been for several months, and probably due to the fact that my brother was (is) marrying (married) a korean culture which is not what Pakistanis do.

Just wondering what am I suppose to do? I know most of you will say just ignore it and try to talk to my mom about it, explaining what I don't want my brother's situation to interfere with our relationship. The only problem is that I can tell my mom is upset and its hard for me to talk to her or do anything with her because she harbors these feelings of sadness. 

I can't do anything about it and it just makes me frustrated, because I'm not close to my brother, yet his situations and how its related to my parents is certainly affecting my relationship with my mom. Whenever I talk to my mom about it, it ends up that my mom plays the 'victim card' and says 'Its all my fault whats happening' blah blah. So instead of understanding what I am getting at, she just refuses to get it and just acts helpless.

Any advice?

169,"I am going to be starting college soon and I hope to attend a veterinary program after my bachelor that suggests about a 3.3 GPA or higher to have good acceptance odds. With this being the case, my studies will need to be my #1 priority.

I want to persue this dream and make a better life for my family than the stressful paycheck-to-paycheck life I've been a part of for so long. The issue is that I currently work a high stress full time plus extra hours job that I don't believe will be sustainable during my schooling and our finances aren't bad to the point that any of our utilties will be cut off but they aren't great either. 

Here is a breakdown of my current bills.

* Mortgage - 560
* Home Isurance - 60
* Furniture Financing - 60 (balance: approx 600)
* Power bill - 235
* Internet - 80
* Car Insurance - 120
* Car Payment - 420 (underwater: Loan is 17.5, value is 14.5)
* Gym Membership - 40 ($20 each for me and my wife, cheapest available)
* Spotify Family - 15
* Amazon Prime - 12
* Credit card min.- 75 (total balance: approx 1100)

**Total: 1677**

My wife's takehome pay is approx 1700 a month. My current takehome pay is similar. 

I intend to be working part time, but my pay definitely wouldn't be amazing and I haven't included the money needed for food, gas and other small expenses. Just curious as to how much grants + student loans will help me out in this case and what I can do to help my situation. Some of the bills will go away once paid off, like the furniture and credit cards. I need to attend school to better my situation, but if I follow my dream, it seems like we will be on the cusp of losing everything if we have any unforseen expenses for the next 8 years with our current financial breakdown...

I have applied for FASFA but am awaiting a response. College I'm going to is about 6k per year.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Once I hit puberty at 12 years old men in my family began commenting about my body, most if the women in my family are curvy, I'm not. They would tell me i was sick, disgusting, unattractive, needed to binge eat cheeseburgers because I was so flat chested like a wash board. This has stayed with me, I'm 23 years old now. I was just becoming comfortable in my body, I was slowly starting to be able to look into a mirror without feeling disgust and resentment.
Then I found out my husband was cheating on me, I saw the nude photos of his ""best friend"" that he took and ones that she took and sent to him. Now I'm back to loathing the way I look, I dont have boobs, theres nothing there but a nipple. Its gross, and I cry a lot about it.
I cant stop comparing myself to this other woman. I'm disgusting compared to her, she's prettier than me, has the perfect body, she's like a size 3 in pants, about 5 ft 4 in. Maybe a c cup, zero stretch marks no cellulite. Shes everything I'm not, shes perfect, no acne scars, small nose.

I want to start a GoFundMe for a boob job for myself in Hope's that it will make me feel more confident and better about myself. But I feel like it's dumb of me to want to start a GoFundMe for this when theres people out there who are in need. But I'm hurting so much right now, everything my family has ever said to me about my body keeps hitting me and going through my head, they said I would never be able to keep a husband and make him happy unless my body looked a certain way.

through the course of my 20 years on this earth i’ve had awful relationships with men. 

before you ask, i have an amazing father. respectful, loving, kind...picture perfect father. no daddy issues here. 

when i was 11 i was assaulted. i had a boy (16 yrs old)  pin me up against a wall and he put his hand up my shirt and put my hand down his pants. i didn’t realize what had happened was bad until about 4 years later when i got to high school. that realization that that was wrong killed me. 

in high school people thought i was a slut. i’m tall, blonde, have always had big boobs. but i’d do everything in my power to cover myself because i was very self conscious of how big my boobs were. i didn’t have my first kiss until junior year of high school. i had a boyfriend. we kissed like 3 times. he broke up with me and spread rumors that he dumped me because i was bad at giving head. i was in marching band and was dubbed the nickname “slut of the band”. no girls wanted to be friends with me and guys only wanted to hang with me because they thought i’d do stuff. 

i dated a boy first semester of my senior year. i gave him one blowjob and never did it again because it scared me. he later burned me with a joint because i wouldn’t have sex with him. i was so insecure though it took him cheating on me to break up with him. 

i then dated another boy the summer going into my freshman year of college. i thought we were going to get married. i gave him my virginity. he then threw it away by cheating on me his first week in college. he then told all of his friends he broke up with me because i was a bad girlfriend and made him wait too long. 

i got to college and went on a tinder date with a boy. (i know. bad idea but i was naive) he drove me to a secluded lake and held me at gun point and told me to have sex with him. i told him i have chlamydia (lie) so he would let me go. scariest moment of my life...or so i thought

in april of this past year, i started talking to the “perfect guy”. we hit it off. finished each other’s sentences. had everything in common. i got a little too drunk one night and for some reason decided i wanted to have sex. for the second time in my life. it hurt so bad that i asked him to stop. he told me to shut up. that he was almost done. i was sobbing but he wouldn’t stop until he was finished. then he ghosted me while i thought i was pregnant. 

lastly, i thought i met a really good guy. set up by mutual friends. hit it off. hung out probably 10 times over the course of a month and a half for like 4-8 hour periods. he would kiss me and tell me i’m perfect. a couple saturdays ago, he came over and hung out like everything was normal and left and said “i can’t wait to hang out with you again”. fucking ghosted me. 

i don’t know how to say this without sounding egotistical...i’m not clingy or annoying. i hate snap chatting and texting, so i don’t blow up boys phones. other than having morals, i like dude things (outdoors, video games, sex jokes, etc.) by societal standards i am pretty. i don’t think i am but people tell me otherwise so i guess i’ll believe them. i go to church, like to play sports, and am motivated in my college and work. 

it’s hard for me to keep on believing that i’m just finding shitty guys. i don’t know what i did to cause this negative male attention. i’ve been assaulted, raped, and kicked to the curb. any advice on how to change what i am doing wrong or any advice in general? i feel like i’ve hit my lowest of lows.

 Anyways, over the years she has had a few hallucinating episodes, but its declined. However, she has had pretty persistent delusions. She was so insistent on her house having mice, she thought she could smell them, hear them, etc despite multiple exterminators telling her they found no evidence of entering, damage or droppings. So after about a year of this delusion we come to her new thing: she is insistent the neighbor is out to get her. She thinks he has drones to peek in her windows, that he lets his dogs out to bark in the wee hours of the morning to bother her, and she even thinks that this dude is wandering around her property at all hours throwing rocks at her windows or something.
To sum everything up, how can I get her to stop without hurting her feelings?
I've tried convincing her it's not real, telling her what the sounds she's hearing actually are, etc and she doesn't listen. She ""knows"" what she's hearing/seeing. 
I know better than to feed into it and play along, it'll only scare her more, she's already talked about calling the cops and I think she did already. I don't want to cause trouble with the neighbor or the police for having to deal with this.
I've been trying to just say yep and try to change the subject when she talks about it, but she gets sad and upset that I don't believe her.
So please help me out guys, how can I preserve my mom's happiness and mental health? What can I do to fix this for her, how should I be responding?

I've done everything I can to take care of my teeth with brushing and flossing and all that but with genetics and a medication I was on, my teeth are just naturally not great. I have a gum abscess, many chipped teeth, and I'm pretty sure my chipped off front tooth also lost the root. 

I just feel embarrassed but I need to do something. I'm getting married next year and I can't imagine not smiling with my mouth open for photos like I've been doing the last few years. I miss eating corn on the cob or any not soft food without fear my front tooth will fall out. My fiance keeps telling me that I can't be the worst they've seen since I've never smoked meth, which is true, but I'm still just terrified.

Any words of advice? I go in tomorrow at 7 am. I'll update if need be if anyone else needs to see how it goes for their own similar situation. ",05Dec2018,1
192,"Throwaway account so she won't find me 

I've been friends with this girl for about 11 years, we grew up together and I see her almost as a sister. She barely messages me, and leaves me out of things she does. I haven't done anything with her for over a year. She has a whole group of friends that I know but don't really like. She visited America for a competition, that I only found out about because it was in the newspaper. I still care a lot about her, but have started distancing myself from her. Recently she asked me when I was free from work and if I wanted to do anything, but I made an excuse so I wouldn't have to see her. 

Her birthday was this week, and when I asked her what she did, she said that she went out with ""her friends"". (I was never invited). I also found out she's had a boyfriend for about a year that she never told me about. In response to that she sent ""Whoops"". I haven't replied. 

I'm wondering if I'm just being clingy/jealous or if she is really being a bad friend? Is this a good relationship?",05Dec2018,1
193,"During my gap year, I raised a litter of kittens. I got them all adopted into families, and my family and I adopted one of them. He's my cat and I adore him, but he's legally my mother's. Currently, I dorm at college but go home often.

&amp;#x200B;

I came home today, on my BIRTHDAY no less, to find my mom has put a shock collar on my kitten. The collar has multiple settings, vibrate and shock, and she uses it with a remote to keep him off the counters since I ""didn't teach him manners"". My mother often used physical pain as punishment in my childhood, so it's a direct affront to my morals that she's frightening if not harming a creature I raised and love. My mother is a toxic, explosively violent person, and I myself do not feel safe in that home, not to mention my kitten.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of bringing my kitten to college with me and/or cutting off contact finally, but the logistics are difficult. I know I can get the documentation to bring him to college, but that's a process that takes weeks. I'm also worried about the consequences from my mother, either emotional or legal. I'm also worried about being financially cut off.

194,"Now hear me out because the title isn't what it seems. I am in college and currently in the midst of a final group project, requiring working every day for 8 hours on end to complete. After cutting up parts with the members, we all did our respective things. I took a massive portion and did everything, and had a write up. Now my writeup wasn't the best but I planned on taking all feedback and rewriting the work. However, to my surprise, two of my teammates had completely rewritten all my work. The issue is I said I wish you had given me feedback instead of rewriting my work so I could do that. I promptly took up work on another section where I did a page, and one of the other members had rewritten it as well. With the work essentially divied up I constantly asked if I can contribute more and do more for the project, and the members would say no don't worry about it, majorly because the fact that the previous sections of intro work bled into further items that required knowledge and basis of idea of past work, so essentially if one hadn't written the previous part no point or way to go forward. I showed up to all the meetings, gave feedback, and put time in however I still feel guilty. I know this isn't my fault, however the way I see it I basically was not able to get any work done because my teammates literally wouldn't allow me to. Considering we have peer evaluations as well for the work I feel very stressed, and even apologized in the groupchat for my lack of work, I clarified that I put in the effort I just wish the output had been more high quality. But the thing is if it wasn't I gladly would have rewritten it. I really am angry that I have to play the part of the person who did something wrong, when essentially I was absolutely fucked by these other people and it really angers me that things worked out this way. I am dreading when these peer evaluations open up, but I am not quite sure what to do. This is majorly stressing me out because me not doing well on this case is the difference between passing and retaking a hellish semester.",05Dec2018,1

197,"My brother purposefully lost his job (17$ an hour!!!) two nights ago. He has been kicked out of my parents house due to not following rules, paying his bills, not taking care of his room or the house, not being able to keep a job, doing nothing but playing video games all the time, etc. several times, and he’s always apologized and said he’d do better and they allow him to stay. 

He is 21. He’s never even tried to move out of our parents house. He doesn’t want to.... When he purposefully lost his job the other night, my parents finally came to their breaking point and told him if he doesn’t have a job interview in the next 24 hours, he has to leave. To a motel or sleep in his car, they don’t care. With his history of irresponsibility, blatantly ignoring them, even stealing money from my mom on occasion, and not being able to keep a job because he hates working... they are done. I can’t really blame them. Anyway, he has thrown several fits over the last few days because of this. He sat in his room playing video games all night and filled out a couple apps online. That’s it. 

**Its worth mentioning he is on the autism spectrum but he is extremely high functioning. Has impulse issues for sure but certainly knows the difference between right and wrong. 

TL;DR- He took 48 Zzzquil (Benadryl or diphenhydramine), around 4000 mgs of Tylenol and 600 mgs of ibuprofen this morning at 3am. It’s now 10:30pm. We found out what he did this morning g around 11pm. He was hallucinating, not making a ton of sense, and very forgetful while speaking with him this morning. What he took and the amounts could cause some damage but his life isn’t physically in danger. I made the mistake of telling our older brother about it, and now he’s threatening to call an ambulance to get him admitted to a psych ward if I don’t. My mom and I don’t think this is a good idea at the moment for 1. The amounts he took aren’t causing him any physical danger of death or anything and 2. He has no insurance and the medical bills from a psych ward stay + ER trip would be Astronomical and he just lost his job. 

We don’t think he should go to a psych ward at this particular moment in time. We think he should sleep it all off, and talk to us in the morning and we will get him an appointment with a psychiatrist. 

I don’t want my brother to call the police/an ambulance over this. Whether this was for attention or not, my older brother thinks our younger brother needs to be in a psych ward. My brother can’t pay for that without insurance and it would absolutely ruin his credit and we don’t believe a psych ward stay is currently necessary. 

I don’t know what to do here. Take him to the ER? Have my brother do it? My parents will be so upset with me if I do. And I don’t think it would be particularly beneficial for him at this time.

atmy daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism?
can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls?
what reason do they have to put them together? They can easily separate boys and girls buy taking the boys of another gym class and putting them with the boys in the gym class doing the swim unit and the same with girls

Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a339wp/mom\_wants\_some\_of\_my\_grant\_money\_am\_i\_overreacting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a339wp/mom_wants_some_of_my_grant_money_am_i_overreacting/). Thank you to everyone that replied. I read all of the comments. 

Turns out my mom felt that saving most of the grant when I might not need it since I should get aid next semester too isn't the best idea, since she feels a better plan is giving her some. She's hurt that my first thought wasn't ""Oh I should help my mom!"" and instead I wanted to put it towards savings and god forbid, visiting my ONLY friend (which I could afford on my own eventually, I'm just super paranoid and careful so having some saved as a ""cushion"" would be reassuring.) 

We had an argument today when I got home from work (a very stressful 8 hr shift) and it was not good. I think a lot of it is that she's jealous. God forbid her daughter be financially better off than she is and is wise about her choices. I've tried being reasonable. I told her that I'd even pay 1/3 of each utility payment + my rent. I know I'm being reasonable, but ofc the Anxiety Brain is going ham with these developments. It hasn't been good since she keeps making me feel like shit. I've been crying a lot. 

She told me I didn't earn my grant since it's based on her income. That stung. I'm the one who had to live in the household. I'm the one who had to deal with JW shit that completely wrecked my self esteem and anxiety. I said ""I'm your daughter"" in reply to something she said at one point and that pissed her off too. Not to mention I said ""It's not an award for raising me!"" because gdi I was PISSED. I offered to pay rent and utilities and she still said ""so what, you get to save the money from the grant and your money from your job to do what you want?"" and I just? Yeah? It's called being financially responsible? And I guess I see where she's coming from, because technically i'm getting money because she was broke two years ago, but shouldn't she be happy for me? 

I need tax information for the paperwork, because even though i've completed the FAFSA, I was chosen for random verification. Of course. So I need a tax transcript, and since I couldn't get some proof of finances (like a credit card) because she's so pissy rn. I texted her for her IRS login and ""if you don't want to send it tonight that's fine"" and she didn't reply. She came into my room with a huff, essentially chucked the medicine basket on my bed so I could take mine, and said ""goodnight."" I said ""love you,"" and she just closed my door all huffy. 

I feel like she doesn't want to see me succeed. Or that she does, but only when I'm dependent on her. 

Needless to say, I'm looking for my own place. If I'm going to be paying rent and utility payments based on market prices, I'd at least like to have a place where I don't feel like shit for using money given to me. ",05Dec2018,1

Every time this happens I realize after whatever the thing was that went wrong that I knew something was going to go wrong all day long, its weird because that just sounds like remorse/regret but its not that.

There are certain demographics I simply dont like. Not saying said demographic because I dont want to offend anyone, but they're exceedingly sexist towards women (to the point of being literally disgusting talk about ejaculating in ""A stupid cunts mouth because she was a cheap whore"") and think they're right about everything because their vintage gear from the 60s, 70s, and 80s were the best. They refuse to acknowledge the progress of technology and get hateful when I try to be informative.

The way they are has made me numb. I despise talking to them and I zone out most of the time, especially if they're really chatty. Simple ""mm-hmm""s make up a majority of my conversations with them. When they want to get all upset because their 40 year old receiver doesn't have HDMI ports and they used 80% of their retirement to get a TV that has- as you can probably guess-HDMI ports, I get overly snarky and sarcastic with them.

I am also the type of person who has dozens and dozens of ideas written in notebooks or on files in my computer. I make up game worlds, story plots, characters, fictional creatures etc.

I have a mental illness I can’t pay for

My situation is really complicated. I live in my Dad's house (I'm in my 20s) and where do I begin. God financially provides for my father and that's how I am able to be provided for, also at my job God helps me by blessing the work of my hands. Not bad, right? Well, it turns out my condition is really bad. I have a mental illness that if it weren't for God providing for my medication, my mind would be destroyed, as a pastor at my church put it. He said any time theres someone God doesn't like, he sends a demonic spirit to destroy their mind and removes His Holy Spirit. This has been the case for me where the Holy Spirit won't let me do what I want and is controllimy my life and won't let me have fun. Truth is, I don't want to do God's will. I know He will definitely throw me in hell because of disobedience, but it's much easier for me to do my own will than obey God. I don't seem to have a choice though, because it's either I obey the Holy Spirit and take my chances with Him liking me, or have my mind destroyed by the demons still possessing me. They aren't casted out because I don't want them out and risk them coming back in nunbers if I sin or do what I want, like I am now. I tried to tell my Dad about this, who is a Christian, but one of the powerful tormenting demons told me to shut up and started to attack me. If I make any attempts to contact a psychiatrist or make plans to seek medical treatment and medication to treat the torments, they start to destroy my mind and torment me. The medication I purchased with the finances God provides me with from His directly helping me at my job doesn't work for the torments. It is because this money is originally from Him. I really want to quit my stupid job and move out of my dad's house by taking a student loan and survive on my own, because even the food I eat with thjs money God gives me or even from my Dad's food, which God provides him with, is starting to harm me since I'm not grateful enough for it. I could go to a homeless shelter and get fed there, and seek mental treatment there, but I've never been homeless and I don't think things will turn out well if I do that. I really don't know what to do and am seeking some advice regarding this serious situation, because I have no one to talk to about it.",05Dec2018,1

218,Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 2 years almost and it’s been about 5 months since we have kissed. We used to all the time but it was always just me initiating it. She used to invite me over all the time and was happy when I was coming over. Now I have to ask if she’s doing anything later and we make plans. I think she has only complimented me once in the last year. I always compliment her and go out of my way for her but she doesn’t anymore. It feels like I am the only one trying.

220,I have joined winter guard and it is currently first year doing it. Most of the girls are experienced though there are some new members. We have only had 4 rehearsals and i already feel like I'm falling behind. The teacher goes way to fast for me to understand all the flag positions and moves. Though they give time to work it out I have to asked an experienced girl for help which they give but I believethat I'm a nuisance for them because I'm a slow learner. There are only 22 in the class and the teacher has said by the end of friday he will decide who is on the team.

223,"A little background... my boyfriend and I (both 23) have been dating for almost a year now, half of which has been long distance. We are planning to stay long distance for about 6 more months. 

The distance has made it harder but he’s the most caring/loving person, and I don’t really have any doubts about him as a person. 

However, he is very easily influenced, and it’s very easy for him to slip into things. 
He lives in Europe (I’m in the US) where the drug/rave culture is a huge thing, and I get it, we both participated in it over the summer, but only went to these parties once or twice a month, and did our research about what we were going to take. 

That being said, since I have gone back to the US I didn’t mind him going to a druggie party or two, as long as I knew he was safe and not going out of control. 

The issue arose when his friends from another town came to visit him and party. These guys are almost 30 years old and take stimulant drugs at least 4-5 times a week, and it seems like they never sleep. They definitely have a problem. 
When he went out with them, they ended up taking insane amounts of drugs and drinking tons of alcohol over the course of like 48 hours (but actually took drugs 4 days that week, just less extremely), which ended up in my boyfriend calling/texting me incoherent things and saying the word “hospital” a few times. Needless to say I was terrified. 

I freaked out and told him how unsafe that was and how worried I was about him.
He agreed 100% and was extremely apologetic, and hadn’t touched a drug since (it’s been about 2 months). 

So the current issue is: 
He met some girls about a month ago through these “drug-addict friends”, and became acquaintances/friends with them, claiming to me that they’re normal and cool. 

However, I actually got to meet one of them, and have a different opinion. So one night when I was visiting my boyfriend in Europe, me, him, and two of his close friends were hanging out and about to go out, when this girl called asking if she could come over for a few minutes. 
He said sure. 
When she did come over, she walked past us not introducing herself to anyone, just saying hi to my bf, she went straight for the kitchen, and proceeded to take out 5 grams of amphetamine onto the counter and drying it in the microwave for over an hour, while still not talking to any of us. 

After she left me and my bfs friends all agreed we didn’t like her and just thought she was slightly weird/sketchy. 

All this being said, I don’t know what to do about this, I don’t want to tell my bf what to do and who to hang out with, but I’m also worried about him hanging out with the wrong people. 
The boys live about 5 hours away so he physically can’t hang out with them, but the girls are practically his neighbors.


The guy friends are visiting him this weekend, and want to pregame a huge rave at the girls bar. Just the idea of this stresses me out, but I can’t tell him not to see his friends! Especially if they’re traveling to see him... 
I know he’d do anything I asked, but I don’t want to become controlling...

I have shared my concerns, just not sure how to approach this upcoming weekend situation. Whether I should trust him to spend it with these people or not 

Tl;dr my boyfriend has been making more and more friends who are into drugs and are a bad influence on him. He agreed to be responsible (and has been) after an incident. However he’s planning on spending the weekend with these people and I’m worried. Asking for advice!",05Dec2018,1
224,"Looking for any advice about how to be in this life.

I’m a 20F who feels stuck and without direction to move forward. I (barely) graduated High School in 2016, and tried a semester and a half of community college before throwing in the towel. After convincing myself to try again after high school, this felt like a major defeat and a betrayal of what I wanted for my life. Many of my problems in school came from lack of motivation, and the good ol’ double whammy that is anxiety and depression. 

I’ve done (and am doing) a lot of work to manage both the depression and the anxiety. I’m currently working two jobs that I enjoy (nanny+barista) and living with my parents (rent in the area is prohibitively expensive). I’ve been doing that for about a year now, and I’m feeling stuck. 

I’m really terrified about going back to school because I have no desire to pick myself up off the ground again if I fail, but I think that’s my best step forward. Simultaneously, I have no idea what I want to do with my life or what end goal I’m really seeking here. 

Why did you decide on the path you chose? Was there anything that helped you to make it clear to yourself? Do you have any regrets?

He leaves bruises on her but apparently no one acknowledges them not even her mother or school

Mine ended when my brother went to prison and my dad got kicked out so Idk really how to help her other than to call the police but there's always the possibility not much happens and she gets sent back home to them and they treat her worse because the cops showed

I've known this was going on for a few months and much longer before she told me and thought I had successfully convinced her to tell me if he did it again and that we would call the police but this apparently encouraged her to hide it from me til today

227,"Hello to anyone reading this.

I’m writing on here for some advice or help with the issues I have. 

The issues I am having, although hard to admit are self created ones.
I used to call myself a stoner but it’s past the point of that and now I can barely sleep without it. But this is a problem as I live with family who have no idea &amp; ive being lying about it for around a year now as I’m to scared to come clean.
I have tried on many occasions to quit with the longest I’ve lasted is a week. This addiction has put me in substantial debt and my brain has turned to mush.

Honestly. I tell myself that I do this to escape it all but it is sometimes the only thing I think about due to the worries of now being able to pay back to loans and having our possessions repo’d. I feel lonely without any close friends &amp; my best friend used me for a quick fuck and to fulfill her long desire. I’m currently unemployed with multiple agencies promising work but ultimately failing me. Every day is a new worry and the stress is mounting to quick for me to handle. I feel as though I’ve thrown my life away before it really began.

My parents had a real life when they were my age and I am nothing. 

I’ve never posted anything like this before and I’m not used to being social online but I want to put myself out there and hopeful meet some nice people and get some advice.

232," I am Physician Assistant, fresh out of school. I had three job offers two of them were for the same positions at two competing companies. I loved both the offers and of course I had to pick one of the two ( which wasn't easy). Frankly, I did not even try to negotiate the salary with either of them at all ( as they were so close and way above my expectations).

I started with the one that I chose, one a month ago just to realize that there were a lot of gaps when we discussed the details ( which I did not realize and it was totally my mistake). On paper the offer, the details looked FABULOUS. Things were hazy about how my schedules gonna look like and honestly the answers were kind of grey ( which I am only understanding now). The reality is totally different than what I was told. After starting the job I found out that I am not even given half the hours I am supposed to work, scheduled to work all evenings ( which I am not supposed to), on top of that I am supposed to find my ""Own shifts"" if I am not scheduled enough hours on the actual schedule.

On the flip side, the job that I had declined had a set number of hours, my actual schedule and location and everything else was jotted down. ( no grey area at all). I had declined it politely and accepted the first one.

Now I am in a shitty situation. I am wondering if I could reach out to the hiring manager of the job that I had declined? If yes, what am I supposed to say?

Is there any other subreddit that will be more suitable to post this question?",05Dec2018,1
233,"Hello. I’m in college and I have a few friends that hang out as a group (I’m included). I don’t talk to anyone from high school or even my hometown. I live with my Mom in the US and walk to college. I’m trying to earn my BFA.

That was my preface. Now here comes my problem.

My friends tend to smoke weed, and in moderation most of the time. But the thing is, I hate weed. Not to the point of voting against it or anything like that, but I just prefer to not only be left out of conversations but to honestly have friends that just don’t do it (which is honestly impossible in film because apparently they need it to be creative some times ???). I have some issues due to past friendships/relationships that have left my trust in my friends crippled but still quite hardy. My two best friends in high school smoked weed and I was fine with it until it became a daily occurrence and almost a peer pressure situation (no, I’m not over-exaggerating). I would like to note that I miss them, but we had to go our separate ways. I also had a girlfriend whom I stopped speaking to because of her sudden interest in weed (which then turned into addictions of other things and “experimenting”). I lost my freshman year HS best buds because they ended up leaving me for their weed dealer. I would like to note that I am generally a pleasant person to be friends with and I try my hardest to be the best that I can. I’m extremely honest (not in the annoying way, but sometimes I find it hard to read situations) and quite funny but I won’t go on anymore about myself being a good friend or this’ll end up on r/thathappened. 

Fast forward back to the present day. I have asked my current friends countless times to leave me out of conversations surround the subject or to at least warn me so I can just leave. I told them that I respect them and hope that they can find it in themselves to respect my wishes. Today, we were sitting in our little lunch room thing and we have tables where there’s a divider to the other side of the table since we have computer monitors. The desks comfortably seat three and then uncomfortably two on the sides between the edge and the border. I sat down where I normally do and then they sat on the other side. I asked my friend to grab me some lunch if I paid for his, he did and they all ended up going to get lunch. I stayed and sat there. When they got back my friend - we’ll call him Jeff - sat next to me to hand me the lunch he had gotten me. We started to eat with each other. Then, - we’ll call her Gloria - sat next to Jeff after feeling “lonely” on the other side. Then - we’ll call them Darren and Gerrard - sat by Gloria, crowding that end of the table. I sat comfortably while I just listened to music with one earbud in and ate my cheeseburger. I was quiet since I was eating but they took it and found it upon themselves to start a conversation about weed directly next to me. Not only that, but apparently Gloria and Darren smoked an hour after hanging out at my apartment on Saturday. Now, my mind immediately went to “This bitch brought it to my house!” So I texted her and asked, to which she replied that she didn’t - which I still don’t believe since it wasn’t even their house just one of Gloria’s family member’s house. God bless her soul but man does she have some personality downfalls (intensely codependent, craves attention, mildly desperate, etc.). I said a few non-hurtful things like “I care what you do when you end up bringing it to my house” and “Darren never once talked about it until you guys did it together”. Then I just exited the conversation. I texted her five hours later apologizing for seemingly overreacting and that I truly just want to be out of conversations about it. She then replied that she doesn’t “get over things quickly”. Well, neither do I, so Gloria we will never hang out outside of school EVER again. My trust has been completely broken. I ask one thing of them. Literally one thing. I never ask anything else from them. I’ve made sure of it since the one thing I want is to be left out of these convos and not have them had directly next to me.

So, the advice I’m looking for is a few things: How do I try to get over my hatred of weed? How do I find new friends at school, any tips or tricks? How do I come to terms with the ONLY thing that bothers me? 

If any of you are feeling giving today, is there any tips on how to be more socially aware and/or socially active? I find it difficult but I’m trying. I’m starting to become semi-reclusive and I’d like to not be. I end up cancelling events even if it includes the most mild social interactions. I don’t talk to anyone outside of my friends, my mom, and my girlfriend of almost three years. I would just like to know how to essentially be more free spirited when it comes to these things. 

Any help will be intensely appreciated. I have no problem with criticism, so if you must, fire away! :)",05Dec2018,1

I miss them and my siblings we dont really talk anymore, I play games online with my little brother occasionally and I only talk to my dad about football we have nothing in common other than that so it's hard for me to approach a conversation that isn't about football.

There's a person I work with at my school, as in therapist,  and she knows how I feel and what my family is like so I at least have someone to talk to about it with but she's always busy with other students so I never really bother talking to her anymore.

237,"I have a lot of guilt. I need a second opinion. I'm lost. Ever since I got out of high school, I haven't had any friends. I've done things like cheat, betray my best friends, lie and brag about betraying my best friend (wtf!!), brag about cheating, I've stolen things, I've told lies, shared secrets, and spread rumors. And the people I was friends with loved it, they thrilled on getting evidence and setting me up for failure. Since I have no friends now, that's who the world knows me to be. A sad sack of lying, cheating, filth. That's the impact I've created onto this world. I hate the person I used to be. It keeps me up at night, including tonight.

If there was anyone deserving to get beat up or something, in my eyes it's me. I miss feeling safe and loved, but I was a shitty person when I falsely felt that. Now I'm so sorry I've affected people like that, I have so many SO many regrets. I am scared of my reputation. I am ashamed of my actions. I wish I was the person I am now, years ago.

How can I prove that I've changed?? I can't tell a lie, I could never hurt someone else again, I would never let a selfish desire happen the way that I used to. I'm a completely different person. Basically, I've grown up. I've learned morality, empathy, cause and effect, and why I was such a shitty person. Now I'm starting my own life completely from the ground with no support. I've apologized to the ones I've cheated and betrayed, but I've never given anyone closure for bragging, spreading rumors, shit talking, and lying. That's what anyone who hears of me knows about me. And the old friends I had want everyone to know what a shitty person I was. How do I right my wrongs?

There is one sweet girl that I see often, and I would like to be friends with her. But I'm afraid if she's heard anything from anyone from my past, or if we become friends and they get into contact with her and want to ruin our friendship by telling her bad things, I will lose a chance to have a great friend. How can I prevent this?

238,"My mother died last month. In the days following her passing, I went through her address book, tracking down basically anyone who had any kind of meaningful contact or relationship with her so they can be in the know. She's already been cremated, but at some undefined point, we're planning to have a big gathering so everyone can share what my mom meant to them. We would have had it sooner, but since everyone is spread out over the country and many of them are older people, scheduling problems have arose.

Anyway, one particular person I called was an old neighbor of my family from when I was little up until I was a teenager. He was friends with my mom until they had a falling out of sorts, and because of that fallout she hadn't talked to him in over a decade until she died. It wasn't a major fallout. It was a minor disagreement really, but their personalities and egos clashed, both being very stubborn and set in their ways. Honestly, it was all very silly and unnecessary. My relationship with said neighbor was similar to my mother's. To make it clear, he's a very nice guy. Very intelligent man, generous with his time and money. We had dinner at his house several times and he was a great cook, but he'd a bit pushy, stubborn, and paternalistic. He never crossed any personal boundaries with me, but as a teen, he would try and steer me in certain directions, and because I was younger and because he seemed like he knew what he was talking about, I listened to him largely. As I grew up, I realized that while he had good intentions, I wanted to make my own decisions, and I did, and I'm probably happier and more successful than if I had listened to him.

So all these years later, I call him up and resume communication. I leave a message on his voicemail, and I don't receive an answer for nearly a week.

The day I get an answer, I unfortunately was sick, I had come down with a cold, and emotionally wasn't in the best state to speak to anyone, but I picked up the phone impulsively. 

He's just the same as ever. Very nice. Very intelligent and worldly, kind and empathetic, but pushy and pretentious as hell. If anyone here is a fan of Better Call Saul, he gives off Chuck McGill vibes. Years later, he stillill has that same overbearing fatherly demeanor. He talks about my mom and her health issues without even letting get a word about the last decade of her life, in which many, many things both good and bad happened to her and where she was significantly different than the last time they had met. He still lectures me like I'm his student and he is imparting wisdom on me.I feel a bit insulted by this. I know my mom a FUCK TON more than he ever did, so to have him lecture me was something I didn't appreciate. What's more, with a decade behind me, I feel I am this man's equal or better now, but he's still treating me like I'm a plebian. To make this clear, I'm very sure his heart is in the right place, but I don't want a teacher or mentor in my life. I called him as a friend to inform him about my mom's passing. 

So anyway, I'm too sick at this point to make these issues clear to him because he has an overbearing way of talking, and I ask if we can resume this conversation for another time. He agrees, and I hang up.

The advice I'm asking is whether I should try and contact this man again and pick up where we left off now that I'm no longer sick and am in a clearer state of mind. I feel on one that I want him to pay his respects to my mom, he deserves that and she certainly deserves a big sendoff.

The problem is that my ex works in his lab, which means that he has a good relationship with my professor and might be encouraged to take the class. I do not want to take this class with my ex (for lots of reasons) and it would be for the best if we aren't in the same class (especially a smaller, discussion based one).

Or I can outright tell him that he's my ex, but that might be weird. I've tried to get around this problem by having a friend ask one of his friends, but I haven't gotten a straight answer.

I feel really left out, since he doesn't talk to me anymore, and when we talk it's just about weed, and I honestly sometimes almost start crying during conversations because I miss when we could lay on a couch and laugh about dumb stuff.

She isn’t as happy as she used to be, and she’s very clumsy now and tired all the time. She’s only 8, and I have a bad feeling that once she goes, her brother from the litter isn’t going to handle it well at all.

245,"Since I was 5 manners have been strictly inforced to me and my sister, but now that I am in my 20s I have no idea how to respond to my manipulative bully of a roommate hes about a decade older than me, 200 ibs.

Background: I was a good student in high school and had very nice SAT scores, but in my senior year I had a complete breakdown and dropped off the radar for several years while trying to get my feet back under me (…but I did graduate). I got medicated and it helped with the depression, but it has taken me a long time to come to grips with the anxiety.

Flash forward 

I will be 26 soon, and I am still living at home with my supportive, kind parents. My anxiety problems meant that I didn’t maintain any relationships from high school and I haven’t really made any new friends because I am a bit out of practice and I never know how to explain my lack of experience. It has taken a while, but I am just 4 credit hours from earning my 2 year degree from the local community college. I have spent quite some time working minimum wage jobs trying to tuck away some money and get out of my shell. My anxiety is no longer an impediment to my daily functioning, and I am itching to move out of my parents’ place.

Last year I took a handful of courses at UT Arlington. I lived on campus for 1 semester and HATED IT. I had hoped that living on campus would allow me to segue back into a social life, but I found the campus life was absolutely DEAD. I want to embark on my 4 year degree somewhere that would allow me to have the traditional college experience, so I have tentatively decided to see what it would take to transfer to UT Austin.

Putting admission issues aside, my biggest concern is whether I will be able to fit in ok at a campus that is so heavily weighted towards a younger population. I look very young and could pass as a freshmen, but I’m worried that I will feel like an old granny or be avoided if my real age were to become known. I have built this plan up in my mind as a chance to restart my life, but if I’m being foolish about my expectations, I’d like to know before I dump a pile of money. If any of you who have gone back to school and tried the dorm life as an older person could tell me about your experiences, I would be enormously grateful! Any outside perspective or advice about my situation would be helpful.",05Dec2018,1

248,"I (20 m) know everyone always says stuff like “everyone’s different” and all that stuff trying to make it okay to be different than most people, and I’m not disagreeing with that. I do, however, feel like most people who are my age don’t have very much depth to their thoughts, and if they do, they keep them tucked away from everyone else (maybe out of fear of judgement/rejection).  I too keep many of my thoughts to myself for these reasons, and because I haven’t been able to find anywhere that people talk about things I think about. My mind is constantly flooded with thoughts about the meaning of life, “what if” scenarios about possible explanations for why we’re all spinning on this rock together, and thoughts of questioning what is offered to the public as truths. If i could describe myself in one single word, I would use the word skeptical, meaning that I have a very hard time accepting reality to be what authoritative figures claim it to be, and that I can’t really accept things solely on the “just because” explanation which is most often provided. 

ANYWAYS, that’s kind of an intro on me, or at least a part of me.

I guess I’m here to ask if I’m alone in my thoughts, because that’s really how I feel. I really wish I could change the topics that I connect with, and think of lighter things, which is what it seems nearly all of my peers do. People my age are mostly interested in things like hook ups, drugs, alcohol, and parties. That’s absolutely fine with me, I’m not judging them for their interests and how they spend their free time, but do other people actually have heavy thoughts? I can’t seem to find very many people who are capable of having abnormal conversations, and are okay with new ideas. It seems as if most people are really closed off to the mere possibility that the things they see to be true are, in fact, not true. This post sort of turned into a rant, which I didn’t intend, but I just let my mind sorta spill out, and I hope it actually makes some sense hahaha.

250,"At the very end of May I moved into an apartment with a girl I’ve known since middle school. She’s a few years older than me if I remember correctly. I’m 27 now. I work 55 hours a week at minimum at my job. The job pays pretty decent. When we first moved in she was driving for Lyft and would pay me money each paycheck for rent and internet. The second week in August she claimed business was slow and she didn’t make enough to give me so I got $0 that week. At this time I had a small kitten that had gotten ringworm who was immediately treated, and I also cleaned everything he touched every other day with bleach. One of her dogs, the meanest chihuauaua you’ve ever met, suddenly got some sort of eye irritation. He ended up having an abscess under his eye and needed surgery to remove it.  She claims my cats ringworm was the cause when the vet told her it was a virus that caused it. Ringworm is not a virus. She didn’t pay a dime to me the rest of that month claiming it was my fault because the dog had to have surgery and she had to set up a go fund me to get the surgery paid for. Still she blames me for the dogs eye  

Next month rolls around she she still isn’t paying me money. She now works for a big box pet store and making just above min wage. She goes over her budget and shows me the breakdown of all her bills and stuff which hits zero before she even talks about rent.  Shows it to me and is like 🤷🏼‍♀️ I don’t know what you expect me to do.  Supposedly she’s going to get a raise in a few months. Her sister suggest maybe she clean the apartment for me really good and I said that I could try and make it work for the month just pay me back later. 

It is now December. I have seen $170 from her since that day. During these last few months she asked if her friend could move in with us to help us pay the bills. He has some back story about how his girlfriend stabbed him and he went to jail because of it and is just now getting bailed out and is homeless. I told her absolutely not I’m not comfortable with now.  Now this guy lives here after I said no a billion times. So now I’ve been conned into a third roommate who swears up and down he’ll pay me rent. So I give him all the due dates and amounts of everything. December first rolls around. Nothing. December second. ‘I’ll have it tomorrow’. December third he texts me that the money is in my door when I get home. I was so relieved because my job has been slow with business and I really didn’t have the money to cover their portion this month. My savings has been drained because of them at this point. He left $100 in my door hundreds less than what was supposed to be there. I’m a very calm and patient person but I blew up. I banged on their door and started screaming at him. He claimed that’s all his boss gave him. Since he works in landscaping it has been raining so they haven’t been working much. 

The girl is on the lease and the apartment complex cannot do anything since rent is being paid. I’ve talked to them multiple times. The only way to get her off the lease is for her to voluntarily remove herself by signing her rights to me. Which she obviously isn’t going to do. 
I currently changed the WiFi password because I’m done with paying for everything and them getting to just do whatever. Now they come to me and are claiming they NEED the WiFi. He supposedly  can’t contact his boss without the WiFi because his phone doesn’t have data service right now. I don’t want to give the nrw password But now i worry he wont work at all and claim it to be my fault  

I am sorry for the long read but I really just don’t know what to do anymore.  I had to borrow money from my family to pay rent this month. I promised to pay it back, but honestly not sure how or when I can.  I have $8 to last me until my next pay period.  

Should I give them the new password for the wifi?

254,"It started out with an article about Tumblr banning pornography.  
He said that his friends are personally affected by them.   
I asked him if they were like art models or something.  
He said they were, and I couldn't help but feel super, super insecure.  


We went back and forth on it.  
I just told him personally he can do whatever he wants, (he's an artist himself), I just don't want to know about 90% of his female friends are models, and most likely have already seen them naked.  
He tells me that I have an issue, and I need to deal with it.   
I told him that I just don't feel comfortable, and if I one day meet them all, he's already seen them, and he is an attractive fellow, and the women he is friends with are SO pretty imo. He also tells me, ""Hey, I didn't specifically tell you they were just females nor males."" It doesn't matter. HE DRAWS/PAINTS A LOT OF WOMEN BODIES MORE.  


His Reason: He can't share things that is relevant to him because it bothers me, when it has nothing to do with him at all. He has to specifically hide things or lie from me, and that makes him feel like he's not being free himself around me.  


My Reason: I am super insecure due to bad relationships, being cheated on. I trust my boyfriend, I don't care what he does. If he looks at porn, fine, I don't care. He has a picture of a model on his background? I don't care. He's drawing a naked model? Go for it. I just don't want to know if it someone he knows or works with, and has seen pictures of them in the nude, art purposes or not. It feels weird! And I told him it was my issue and I'm working on it.

256,"I’m 23 and my girlfriend is 22. We have been together for 7 years, both recent college grads and our future looks bright. We are both madly in love and have been since virtually the beginning.

I was planning to propose in a year and we seem to be seeing eye to eye on every important issue except kids.

My proposition: If you want a ring on that finger, I want to be a dad some day if we are able. 

Her proposition: If you want me to accept that darn ring, you need to accept the fact that I might not want kids.

We communicate very well and have the patience to hear each other out, but at the moment this is still up in the air. She isn’t the most motherly person in the world but she just became an Aunt and I see genuine joy in her face whenever they are around and she is always showing me cute pictures of her niece doing funny baby things.

I always told myself that the woman I marry will hit the jackpot. That I’ll give her my damn best and nothing short of it. She is the only girl I want to give my life to, but I’ve also had a desire to one day be a dad for the longest time.

My fear is that if I scare an ambitious young 22 year old woman away with a hard line position on kids, our relationship will dissolve and she’ll have kids with another man later in life. On the flip side, she doesn’t want to be 28-32 and have me resent her for not wanting to have kids.

What should I do? The thought of ending the relationship now over the possibility that she might not want kids just rips me apart. I know eventually my decision to propose will depend on that, but what should I do in the meantime? I don’t want to be arrogant and think “I just need to change her mind” but i am guilty... I want her to see a future with me and a kid and not want it simply because I do, but because she wants to be apart of that future also.

Being 23.. yeah. Kids right now sounds absolutely awful. I don’t want that responsibility now, but I know I will in the future. I have a feeling she is looking at all the negatives as a 22 year old woman... not at the potential meaning and responsibility a child can bring into your life as a 28-32 year old woman.

Where would I meet anyone, how would I get there if i can't drive?

i dont try anything, i think im a waste of space, im awful at everything, no one likes me, could ever like me. I feel like i know what i should be doing but i just dont do any of it and it makes me feel worse knowing that i could be making progress to getting better but i guess i'd rather suffer. I have really low self worth, esteem, and confidence. I dont have hobbies or really enjoy doing anything. I constantly berate myself with negative thoughts about myself. I've given up on new things that I dont try anymore. I really dont know what to do. I've occasionally hit the point of ""I dont want to be alive"" or ""I dont deserve to live"" and thinking like that is scary.

I really dont enjoy anything i do. I work, go to school, and sit on my computer looking for something to do. I dont enjoy any of it. Work gives me a lot of time to think so i think myself further into being upset. School is just online college for something i dont really care about, because i dont really care about doing anything, and it's online so no social aspect at all with it.

264,"The decision I'm faced with is causing me immense distress as I feel as if in caught in a moral dilemma. My mother has been using an account in my name to hide money during a divorce settlement. The bank recently closed access to this account on her end. The account was settup in my name so I could save money delivering papers when I was 10. 

Our relationship:
Our relationship has been far from the average. We have barely talked for the past 4 years. I was told to leave at the age of 15 as I started to ask questions about why my dad left and what really happened. She'd kept alot from us and portrayed it to be his fault when later I discovered that to be false. She's a serial manipulator and when she doesn't get her way with someone she will try and convince everyone else around her and you usually extended family that she is right and try to turn them against you usually by lying. I believe this to be one of the many narcissistic personality traits showing through in her. I have lived out of home and struggled through school. My brother and sister went to the same school and wouldnt talk to me due to the fear my mom instilled in them, our relationship has never bounced back from that. She moved with them when I was in my senior years of school and after that I barely heard anything from them. When graduation came around she acted as if nothing had changed I put up with it at the start then she gave a graduation gift which was a travel voucher for $2500. Which at the time was amazing but not a month later I found out it was in her name an she had taken it back. 

Now back onto the decision I'm faced with currently. Money was still in that account at the time they stopped her accessing it. She texted me last week to tell me she was coming back to the town I live in to see me and she wanted to make up for everything that had happened and that something had happened to her recently that made her reconsider what was really importaint. She also mentioned she had a gift for me. I was shocked. I met her at a local coffee shop 3 days later and she was with a friend of hers, we exchanged greetings and started to chat. 15 minutes in she said we had to go to the bank to close an account in my name as she believed she got hacked and couldn't access her money. Which immediately I knew was a lie. I went to the bank and asked the teller what was going on and with a confused look on his face he said ""are you not here to transfer money out of your account and close it sir?"" I was worried so I said no. I asked for access to the account and left the bank. 

The account has some money in it. I know my mum doesn't have a job and I don't know where the money has come from. I am legally entitled to the money as it is in my account. My mom insists it's hers. I'm moving at the start of next year to attend college and need some money to have some urgent dental work done and I would like the money for the vouchers I was given as a graduation gift but she took back.

On top of that, he is going to graduate early and go to college after the summer, and I’m just supposed to wait around until I graduate and MAYBE get accepted to where he’s going. Plus he’s super over protective of who I hang out with and what I do, because he feels like I’m going to cheat on him or that his missing out on all the fun. It’s really hard for me because I love him, but this isn’t what I signed up for, and I want to be able to have my own experiences, not just wait around for a boy to come rescue me or probably flake on me.

After a few weeks my leg felt better but my chest still hurt and so I decided to see a doctor about it. She didn't know what was wrong so i went to get x rays and they didn't know what was wrong so i went to a physical therapist. Turns out apparently the cart hit me in my 3rd rib and moved the cartilage above my srernum I guess. 

So now I've got this lump right up front on my chest which turns out to be a permanent deal. It's driving me crazy cause if i move too much it'll start to be this annoying numb pain. When i wake up i have it and if i sit a weird way it comes back. I can't do too much also cause it needs extra time to heal because cartilage takes a bit longer than bones and muscle. 

So now i can't work or workout or do anything except deal with this stupid lump. The therapist even said that after physical therapy theres still a chance i could throw a ball or lift something and it could cause some extreme pain. Makes me wonder why I'm even doing PT if it's just going to crap out on me randomly. So now I'm just dealing with the reality that i probably can't do some of the fun stuff i used to do without destroying my chest more. 

Idk i guess this is just a rant but if i dont talk about it then I'm just going to go crazy. Just sucks knowing i can never be 100% again and go a day without being in pain.

On the bright side at least it was only on one rib. I'm also healthy everywhere else which is pretty nice.

I really need some advice or some lending hand. something.

Me and my partner have been together for 3 years. I love them so much and I would never ever do anything to harm them. I can say securely I have never cheated on them in real life.

I also am very hypersexual. Herein lies the problem, I understand that thoughts are thoughts, and I understand that I would never act upon these things. I would never act upon these things because the sex I have with my partner is great, they pleasure me immensely. We are in a good relationship, they are enough for me, is what I am saying.

Sometimes I get thoughts in my head that are about cheating on my partner (sending one of their friends,they are also my friends but by extension of knowing them, a dirty pic or whatever if you want something specific) Yeah, I find this person attractive but I would never fuck them. I dont have a crush on them, I don’t go out of my way to know them. That would be fucked up. They are my partners friend more than mine. I find many people attractive who aren’t my partner but I’m sure that's common, right?

I actually never masturbate to these thoughts, they just pop up in my head as a “what if” or maybe like a scenario? They are kind of “hot” to me in the sense that it’s kind of a “forbidden fruit” to never do this in a relationship, porny (“fake” scenarios always were hot to me in my mind only) but it is mere fantasy. I, of course know the consequences and would never EVER do this in real life and I never say to myself “oh hell yeah I’m gonna totally do that *evil laugh*”

I never really gave these thoughts much time in my mind, but today I have been reflecting really hard and understanding it feels weird and I feel very guilty now. Am I a bad person? What should I do? When I get guilty like this, all I wanna do is tell them these thoughts but I know if I tell them about this one in particular it would open up a can of worms that really doesn’t need to be opened. I don't wanna lose them. I am confused and lost.

TL;DR: I sometimes get thoughts about infidelity in my head, I didn’t start self reflecting on them until recently,knowing I would *NEVER* ever do this to my partner, I should be fine. But my guilt is running with me.",05Dec2018,1

This fall semester I took physics 2, General Microbiology, Biochemistry 1, and statistics. I am passing in General Microbiology and physics 2 but I am not doing too well in stats and biochem. I have had another terrible semester and I think its time to take a break. My sleep schedule has been terrible. I have had a number of days in a row of doing nothing but just sleep, eat, and go down rabbit holes. I am unfocused and I think its time to take a break. 

The thing is that my college advisor thinks I should continue because she says its difficult to go back to college. My parents agree too, and some of my friends. My thoughts are different because I am not focused and have been doing poorly in classes. If I continue I don't think I will be focused and I am slowly destroying my GPA. What should I do and how should I do it? 

Other things to note:

* Want to go into the healthcare field
* Plan to get certified as an EMT while fixing GPA
* Go to University of Texas Dallas
* 5k in school loan
* Sleep schedule is bad",05Dec2018,1
274,"The way my mind usually works is I’ll get hooked on one thing and stay focused on said thing and then after a month I’ll lose focus and move on to something else.


But right now...I just got no idea what to do.

277,"Ive \[21M\]  just finished my second year at uni and got an extremely well paying job who basically gives part/full-time hours at casual rates. I have been saving and had already planned to travel for 6 weeks mid year with my friend, however i think i want to take the year off, work hard and save a lot of money so i can travel for much longer.  

My dad thinks i should stay and study and finish while i am young.. I think if i come back and study i will be more focused and determined to do well, instead of doing what i did the last two years of no motivation and aims.

279,"So a girl from school who I have called out on her bad behaviour came to me and asked what was wrong with me, why I was so mean. I told her what she did and she admitted nothing but expected me to admit everything was my fault which I did not. She wanted to talk about it I said sure but she also said she didn't have time because she had to leave pick a train, so I asked by texts she said she blocked me. I then gave up.

I have just completed chemo
I see my abuser every time I have to go to court (he is out on bail and the court case is dragging)

I have severe, severe PTSD
I am autistic
I currently receive a very meager social grant
My abuser still has all my belongings which I am unable to retrieve (I require a police escort which is easy to arrange and a place to store it all which is impossible - it's all my furniture etc)

What I want: financial stability so I can provide safety and stability for myself and my daughter.

We went to a rave together and we both were rolling mine hit first and I felt like I did something wrong. I feel like I made her think of me differently. And today I messed up with something which probably made her think even less about me. Since I sense that I apologise as much as I could and she says it’s ok but something in my head says it’s not.

282,"I'd like to start this by saying Munchausen's is different from Munchausen's by Proxy. I have no children or dependents and no SO. I would never, ever abuse someone or make them sick for selfish gain, and that's not what this post is about.

 I'm generally physically healthy- unfit, but robust and rarely ill apart from getting queasy from hangovers or eating badly, or sometimes getting a cold. I have some issues with anxiety and was diagnosed with bipolar 1 but my physical health has always been fine. My bipolar isn't really a thing for me anymore and I no longer take medication (w. doctor's permission) because I'm asymptomatic. I'm on break from university and have not been doing any strenuous work or under any particular stress.

I have an overwhelming desire to be sick. When I see someone in public looking pale and tired and dizzy, I actually get tense with jealousy. I fantasise about being feverish and shivering and sweating and getting cold flashes and not being able to keep down food. I just want to be sick sooo bad. Recently, I got really bad menstrual cramps (I normally don't get these) and I was giddy with delight and weirdly loved being in pain like that. 

I've been frightened because recently I've been toying with the idea of somehow making myself sick. I always stop myself because I think it's morally wrong to lie like that and it may damage my health, and it's embarassing I'd even think about that. But I am worried that I might actually go through with it. 

Anyone been in the same boat and have any insight as to why the hell I feel this way? Any ways to sort of get over these feelings? Thanks so much in advance. ",05Dec2018,1
283,"Like lots of families, my dad and I do not agree on a single political issue. 

However, it's been taken to another level in our family. Over the last 2 years, he and my mom have referred to me in very derogatory terms, to the point where I stopped speaking with them for around 6 months (the things they had said to me were nearly unforgivable— telling me I'm an 'ignorant deep-state whore who should be stripped of citizenship', etc). 

But, after my husband's father died unexpectedly and tragically this year, I made the conscious decision to speak to them again and to call it water under the bridge. Family is super important to my husband and I after the hell we've lived through this year losing his father, and they're otherwise loving and good parents, so I'm fine with letting the politics go. Our conversations since we starting speaking again have been great, and there's been a general moratorium on both sides when it comes to politics. 

So we decided to visit them for an extended stay for Christmas this year (we live abroad, so it's a big deal to be able to do that), and we're all really looking forward to it. My mom has apologized for some of her comments, and she has stuck to the non-political agreement.

However, over the last week, my dad keeps wading into the political conversations. I'm not striking back, I'm not egging it on, and I try to stay silent about it— but I feel that my silence is also emboldening him to keep going on rants. It started out as just a comment here and there, but yesterday he went deep into it.

Basically, I had to sit silently as he ranted about certain deep-state conspiracy theories, certain ""drops"", repeated certain claims about pizza place child sex rings, presidents being Muslim criminals, etc. I just took it and said nothing in response, but in all the conversation went on for 20 minutes. I think he could not help himself but to talk about it, it's like he has no filter. 

I told him it wasn't appropriate and that we both know that we do not agree and that I'd prefer we stay away from political conversations, but his response was to say, ""Well, I think we can both agree that you were wrong, glad you've seen the light."" 

I don't know how to possibly make it any clearer than I already have that I'd like to keep politics out of our relationship, and I'm finding it hard to keep quiet in the face of these sorts of rants. I feel like he's trying to troll me into losing my cool, and I'm worried that I _will_ lose my cool once I'm back at home. 

But I can't— I can't go back to not speaking to them, at least for my husband's sake after what has happened to him this year. It needs to be a good Christmas for everyone, and I honestly don't want to hear a single word about politics while at home. 

So...any advice you may have for handling this situation is more than welcome. ",05Dec2018,1
284,"I'll try to make this brief.

&amp;#x200B;

I've come to the realization that I've been ruminating constantly for the past 6 or so years of my life. I've been through a traumatic upbringing, I've gone through an abusive relationship, and I've also dealt with additional traumatic experiences on the sides.

For the past few years I've struggled with maintaining friendships, even just making them in general. My ability to handle my emotions feels out of my own grasp (I constantly worry about anything and everything). I feel that I'm very bad at interacting with people. I'm not tactful, and I tend to speak my mind constantly (and what's on my mind isn't healthy most of the time). I feel like half the time I'm an empty shell, that I lack the ability to feel things on a deeper level if that makes sense. It's so bad that it's affecting me at work, my ability to professionally interact with my superiors and my coworkers.

I've seen countless therapists, I have the knowledge over my own issues.... I know what's wrong with me, I know how it needs to be changed.... but I struggle with being able to do that change because I feel so ""hardwired"" like this. This is my personality, not a great one, this is who I am and I'm in a constant battle with myself from the inside.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm going crazy, and I don't want to feel like this anymore, I don't want a miserable life. I've even contemplated joining a Buddhist church in hopes of finding myself again.

286,"I have always had issues motivating myself to do things i am a bit naive and often times trust people to easily. I recently started to realize that things arent right at home i try to do things and i am met with so much resistance from my family that I have given up.

 My father mostly keeps to himself  and has not had alot to do with me, i am distrusting of him beacuse whenever i open up to him i have ended up being distracted and end up doing more work around the house or anything but what i set out to do.

I have 2 brothers both of which i have trouble connecting with them and have never gotten much help and it has led me to avoid seeking their advice.

I entrusted one of them and moved in and it was the same instance as i had at home i just ended up cleaning and doing things to fix up his house while he planned his wedding then afterwards i was called and was offered a new tv if i returned home.
I accepted figuring i was not getting any help what so ever.
 Years later i am still here doing the same thing struggling with the same things, i cut ties with my brother and limited my interactions with my parents in hopes to figure out what is going on and have noticed they pushed harder than ever to get my attention for what feels like attempts to shift my focus to them and just distract me. 

Then the holidays came around and my brother got drunk and we ended up talking deapite my attempts to seperate myself from him, gave me a gift and seemed fairly angry at me i gotbrhe inpression he was leading up to something and i avoided the topic completely, later i asked my mother what the hell that was and said he wouldn't have done that unless he needed something what is going on, she said well he was going on vacation and wanted me to watch his house while he was away i cant even ask advice from these people and they are asking favors of me, he has children he doesent haft to rely on me.

 Fast forward to now about another few years and im in the same rut, i have trouble sleeping due to frustration im contemplating suicide as an option just to have a way out only seeking the opinions ams advice from fanily who only takes, my mother recently had a stroke and in desperation i pleaded with my father that ill take anything i can get, i even accepted my chances of forming a normal life have past and that i just want to move out and kive alone, my mom then returned home and is making a full recovery. 

 While this is happening my license has expired as i have no money and while my mother agreed she would pay to renew it i felt selfish bringing it up during this time so i hesitated, i started to realize they needed my help with driving about and getting back and forth places as i am depended on for transportation, in anger i have avoided getting it for when they are so encouraging of me it is not my interests my parents are concerned with, they manage fine and act as if they dont need me as much but i have an endless feeling of being trapped regardless.

my father i feel convinced me i cant get a job without one and laughed at me when i said if i haft to i would ride a bike, feeling like he has alterior motives to me aquiring my license, after telling me""nothing is free"" so i am taking the advice and making due with as little as possible and trying to limit what they do and eating little as possible.

On a end note i have always been willing to help and have been their for my family but i am feeling like i am deserving of a life as well, my brothers got to leave and pursue their dreams and made decent lives, meanwhile it feels i am being tossed by the wayside and used at lesiure and thrown back.

289,"So about a little back story before I begin. I've been friends with this guy let's call him Mark since 6th grade ( I'm 28 now). He has also been friends with my husband since elementary school. We also used to live together about 3-4 ago years with a few other people. About 2 weeks ago while we are at work, he asked to speak to me outside. Mark has been one of my closest friends. I can tell him anything and the same goes for him. He told me when we had all moved out of the place we all lived at together, I had left my laptop behind. He told me that he didn't know whose computer it was so he opened and turned it on. Mark told me he didn't see my name on it anywhere ( which is a fucking lie). He then went through the pictures. He found a picture of me with just my face. Then this is where it gets really uncomfortable for me. He told me that he found some naked pictures of me. When he told me that I kinda laughed it off and just honestly wanted to end the conversation because I was so embarrassed. Mark continued to talk about every single picture in detail. Once he was done, so I thought, we both just laughed and I was just going to brush it off. Then he continues with ""okay so since i already embarrassed myself"", he took my computer back to his place and jerked off to my pictures. Now, I'm extremely uncomfortable and have not really talked to him since he told me.  About 2 days after he told me I got a call from his brother too talk about the entire thing. Apparently Mark was not completely truthful to his brother about the situation (he told his brother he only found one picture and that's why I was upset with him). It's really fucking with my mental health and my relationship with my husband. Since Mark told me all of this I have been applying to new jobs. I finally got an interview a few days ago but just found out he fucking applied to the same place and they want both of us. Mark knows I'm for sure leaving the place we work at now and I'm pretty sure he is going to take the same job.  I want to tell the new employers but I also don't want to ruin my chance at getting the job. Yes, we would be working in the same department as a team. I don't know what to do anymore.

291,"Hi Guys,For the past few years when I was in 7th Grade, my mates found a website. Rate My Teachers, which was a place where you can rate and review teachers from different perspectives from good to bad. And they showed me a number of teachers that are part of the school with different comments from each one especially having the realization that some of them were posted anonymously. Some reviews were confronting as some expressed their honesty although including some were indecent and vulgar. I myself intended to publish a review which would eventually receive many downvotes. After completing the second Semester from school and the rest of the students were told to attend an assembly in the morning. The Assembly lasted for a short time, only to know that my name was mentioned by an announcement which they told me to go to the School Office. Thinking I would be welcomed with trouble. Which I was. One of the School Leaders realized that I was caught for rating some teacher's review that suggested it was a personal attack towards the teacher. While true, but clearly it didn't have any vulgarity or antagonized the teacher. All I said is that this teacher displays poor optimism to the class along with thanking you for making me fail. I was requested to remove the feedback I published which needed to be reported and would be removed in a couple of days. If the review were still to come up. Parents would intervene the situation which will not only solve the issue but further escalate it because it was hate speech by the teachers and would receive fatal consequences that can also affect my Schooling. I am suffering stigma and disgrace over this despite having some support from friends who really withstand what the School Level leaders have done. I feel empty and wanting to know what I should do which is to file a complaint or actually speak up and confront others in a way that you're perspective shouldn't be published online. This is just a serious situation I am stuck in. Free Speech in High School is just plummeting as some would think teachers are trying to de-value free speech. Thinking a word for word that gives them a bad wrap suggest that they are being attacked. ",05Dec2018,1
292,"Hi there, I'm 17 and a girl. I feel like this is needed as context, since I'm not an adult that may have the chance of never having to see an ex-friend ever again.

I had a kind of petty fight with a friend recently. It was over me tiredly telling her that I was tired of her talking shit about someone and comparing them to a Nazi and stuff like that. Not necessarily in those words, it was just me saying that I understood that she needed to vent but that when she did I kind of zoned out because it really tires me out (and embarrasses me cos she's hella loud - I didn't say that bit).

Thing is, she's like reaaaalllllly sensitive x100000 and so therefore, I offended her. At least I'm pretty sure I did. She didn't seem happy when I said what I said. Today she saw me enter a room and gave me this look like ""oh it's you, I hate you, why did it have to be you"", I've seen her pull this face before so I know what it means. She hasn't approached me because she's obviously mad, I haven't approached her bc I know that she will run away (literally) and not give a chance to explain myself. If I did corner her (which I won't do), I'd get painted the bad guy after she ran away to cry in the toilet. 

I said something to her once before that she didn't like and she ran away, other people have had this same experience with her, so this behaviour is predictable.

Even if she eventually forgives me, I've decided that I don't want to be her friend any more. Sounds childish I know, but I guess that's the only way to say it.

She is a lovely person but when she's upset with you/when you say something that would mildly upset someone she gets super petty and rude. I've realised that she is too much effort for me. I feel that you should want to put effort into a friendship but with this girl, I just don't care any more. I have to watch what I say; if my opinion is different to hers it's wrong (for some topics, for example comparing someone to a Nazi soldier... loudly). It's like I have to treat her like a fragile piece of china (the pottery).

I know I have come to a pretty conclusive decision but I don't really know if I've done the right thing nor do I know how to feel. I guess I want the opinion of an outsider (lol stranger) who has no connection at all to the situation.

295,"I'm a 19-year-old girl studying overseas right now and my head is a trainwreck... 

I value my two friends as if they're part of my family. They're the second most important people to me in my life other than my actual family. I even ended up taking in 2 jobs a few months ago with long work hours at one point to help one of them with just financial problems. Just a month or two before I departed to study overseas both of my friends came to me and started telling me how depressed they were. Me thinking I was doing the right thing did my best to just cheer them up. I talked them through it all and did my best to understand them to my ability.  When it got to the point I knew one of them was just not feeling it I ended the conversation there and started a new one about something more positive which helped the two of them just wash away some of the gloomy moods they were in. At first, they both were happy and fine with it but in just a few days after they both messaged me and told me they wanted to ""talk"". 

The way I was addressed by them was not in a very normal way than usual. The message I got that time was ""We need to talk..."" and ""Get IN THE F\*CKING CALL NOW"" It was obvious to me they were mad about something but I haven't done anything at least, in my opinion, to have them this angry with me. When I got home from work and as soon as I joined the call they wanted me to be in I was greeted with a ""We know you're trying your best to help but you're just an outsider. You know we both haven Depression, Suicidal thoughts. What you're doing for us right now is NOT good ENOUGH."" I was pretty conflicted after the whole call ended with the two of them. I pretty much sat there for the rest of the night just thinking about what could've I have possibly said or done wrong to have them be this upset with me.  

The next morning I wake up to yet another unhappy message from my two friends and It was later then followed up by a ""Btw we're bipolar and I'm starting to think you're bipolar yourself because you keep trying to distract us from us telling you our f\*cking problems"". These type of messages and calls continued on and off for the next month. I started getting so tired to the same outcome that I just started soaking up everything at that point apologizing to them every time and my own depression that I'm doing so hard to fight off is just slowly creeping up on me. Just when things couldn't get any worse I was then told by another friend and with evidence about my two friends just taking a huge shit on me in a ""Private group"". Reading everything they had to say about me was a pretty degrading experience for me. I've been told by others that the two of them were basically using me as a punching bag. I know it's a very stupid decision but I stayed with the two of them and currently still are somewhat. One of the two later on just started wailing on me left and right telling me how if they hadn't met me...or if I hadn't come back to talk to them they'd been better off in life. I at that point was already worn out and just tired from working and just everything that has happened so far. It was really my last straw. I'm not the type of person who likes to just let depression get the best of me but after I was able to excuse myself I pretty much had a meltdown. My own self-confidence is deteriorating at this point that I decided to just give in to my parent's demand to study overboard for a while. 

I told my two friends how much I cared for them and how it'd be difficult for me to get back to them if anything bad happens but I wished them well and to call my number if an emergency were to happen. Low and behold It hasn't even been day 2 of my day in a new place where I'm trying to get myself settled in. I get a message to join the call at a specific time and when I did I guess one of them didn't hear me and was talking to a bunch of their other friends. ""Once this b\*tch joins the call I'm going to go all out"". I, of course, decided to just keep quiet until they realized I was here. The same conversation from the previous times came back and ended well with the same results as last time except for this time I'm having a very bad meltdown that I had to be sent to the ER. It's been at least a month now that I have been away from them. I received another message today from one of my friends about how they were falling apart from me and how they really just need me to I guess... ""Help"" with their problems. I've pretty much tried everything at this point...I've recommended them to see a professional, to listen to songs they like, talk about it with me to take some things off their chests, act like a complete idiot in order to make them laugh, I've even wasted a good portion of my own savings at this point..I don't know how to help them if everything I do wrong is literally everything they're telling me that I should be doing...To get straight to the point, Am I really doing something wrong here can anyone please give me some guidance because I'm pretty close to just losing my mind over all this... Should I have just left them from the first few red flags or am I just that bad of a friend?",05Dec2018,1

297,"So here is a little back story, I've been friends with this guy named ""Mark"" for over 10 years and same with my husband. My husband and I have also lived with him and a few other people about 4 years ago. I have been working with Mark for a couple years now. We've had our ups and downs at work but in the end we always made up. For the passed few months things have been going great at work with him...until now. About 2 weeks ago he asked to speak to me outside. I can literally tell him anything and same goes for him. Well, I could have gone my entire life without knowing what he told me that day. Okay so, we go outside to smoke a cig and talk about what's on his mind. Mark starts off by asking me if I remember leaving my laptop at the house we all lived at (yes, I'm an idiot and forgot my laptop when I moved out). He told me when he went back to clean up the place he found it and didn't know whose it was. So he opened and claimed to me that my name wasn't on it (which later I went back and opened my laptop and my name was clearly on it). He then told me he went into the pictures and found a picture of just my face. This is where it gets uncomfortable for me. He then continued with I also found naked pictures of you. He didn't stop at looking at one, he looked at ALL of them and went into detail about it. So now that I'm feeling awkward and super weird at work, he continues with ""since I already embarrassed myself"", my heart just fucking sank. I already knew what he was going to say. Mark told me he took my laptop back to his new place and jerked off to my naked pictures. I'm in shock at this point and I don't really know what to say. I just was to run away from him. He was supposed to be my best friend and now I can't even look at him. I told him the next day that I'm just super weirded out and I just need my space. Since then I've been applying for new jobs to get away from him. I just had an interview the other day and it went very well. I get a call back and they want me to come in for another interview. I'm thinking great I'm finally going to be free from this. WRONG! Mark applied for the same job and they want both of us (we would be working as a team). I mentally cannot handle it. I want to tell the new employers but I don't want to ruin my chance at getting the job. My mental health is now at an all time low I can't handle it anymore. I'm not eating or sleeping.

Almost every night he explodes over the smallest things and then goes on hour long screaming rants about things that have nothing to do with what happened. For example, his girlfriend will have a go at him about how messy the house is and he will explode about how he does everything around here and how she's a 'controlling slut' and that he hopes she dies in a car accident or that he should get her jumped and that she deserves to be in agony for what she does to him or she'll breakdown into tears, although he has never gone off at me and when he's not like this he's calm, clear and collected. 

He, his girlfriend and I think he has bipolar or something and I always tell him 'see a doctor' and he says he will. I've been telling him this for over a year and he has been like this for a very long time but is the worst right now. He has never even gone to see a GP or therapist about this. Sometimes when he argues with his girlfriend, he'll say that she doesn't try to help his mental illness and only makes it worse, and she'll scream at him to see someone, to get help, and he'll just reply with ""yeah right"" as if it's out of the question or an obserd suggestion for someone with a 'mental illness'?!?!??

Seeing as I used to get picked on at school a bit and feel for the lad, I offered to take him to my local climbing wall to see if I could give him some advice/confidence while his mum sat and had a coffee or something.

308,"I hate this sentence but - I have an idea for an app/online service. It's an idea that I've developed as part of a degree I was studying; I've given it thorough thought, run the idea by potential user groups and clients, discussed it with lecturers/professors with experience in the industry and the feedback has been very positive. Whilst I'm fully aware of how most of these ventures go, I'm confident this idea has some potential and I want to give it a go.

There's 2 problems though. Firstly, I don't have the knowhow to develop such an app/service. Secondly, I have absolutely zero budget. I'd hope to get some investment down the line but I'd need some sort of half working model before then. Currently I work as a freelancer in a related industry, and I know what it's like to be asked to work for free, or to be told that I can expect returns down the line - it's not promising in the slightest. So how do I get this thing off the ground?

Learning to build it myself isn't an option. I wouldn't know where to start and even then it would take far too long to get to a point where I could develop something. I need someone who is willing to get involved.

How could I find someone who might be willing to help? I mean an actual business partner who is willing to invest their time into building this with me.

330,"Basically I need an outsiders perspective on my situation besides family and friends obvious bias towards it so i'll try and make it quick..

&amp;#x200B;

I've know this girl for a very long time, we met in a bad situation in both of our lives when I was pretty young and and she's 7-8 years older than I am so she's basically like a big sister to me. 

Two years ago she had her second child, the other is three years old. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've almost always been there for her and her family financially for whenever they needed things, (paid for her husbands vasectomy, paid for groceries, diapers, formula, and just lots of ""here and there"" things, and consistently had to lend her money. At the time I was a student and was getting a fairly nice income but can no longer sustain that because I quit my job, funny thing is I stopped seeing her a lot less when I couldn't lend her money anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

She has asked me to babysit for a few months while she goes back to work and I agreed not fully knowing the amount of work it was looking after two infants.

She severely underpaid me during that time and made me pay for my own transportation, was making around $883 CAD after bus pass was bought. Hours worked were 8:30-9:45 PM mon-fri

During that time she still asked to borrow money and sometimes stiffed me half of my pay because she was behind on bills, which I didn't thing was fair to me at all because my rent was almost more than half of what I was being paid.

I recently had to quit because it was taking too much of a toll on my mental health and it was too difficult to be around her family when I just felt as if i'm being used all the time. Since then, it seems the only time she initiates conversations with me is when she needs someone to watch her kids. She never gets her husband to watch them because he has no idea how to parent..(thats a whole other story)

&amp;#x200B;

The main problem is that she NEVER offers to pay me or offers to pay for transportation to get me there, I'm running low on my savings due to being a student and can't throw money around all the time getting an uber or bus there and not being compensated at all and EVERY time its on very short notice.

&amp;#x200B;

Its frustrating to have such an overbearing sense of guilt when I say no to watching her kids because I love them as if they are my own but i feel like she uses that against me in some ways. I've been saying no more recently and been hinting that I can no longer afford uber rides etc. but she still asks without giving any offers..I just don't know what to do or what the right thing to do is.

But we would also facetime and call every once in a while. She lives clear across the country in California while I live in Kentucky, we have never met. Anyways we talked for about 3 months.

Anyways we would have serious talks about our future together. Well about four weeks ago she went on vacation and I wasn’t sure if I shoulder text her, call her, etc., since I didn’t know what she was up to or what she was doing. When she came back I told her it was nice to get back to being normal and she got really mad at me for not calling her once while she was on this trip. I tried to patch things up and it seemed to get back to normal for a little bit. But it still felt different and more strained. She also got very upset at me and started telling me how she was unsure of what my intentions with her were since I hadn’t flown out to meet her yet. I did mentioned meeting a few times, however did not purchase a plane ticket, and for other reasons things just didn't seem to work out. She did get very upset about this and started mentioning how she felt like she was forcing me to do things now that she had brought this up.

Things again started getting different. Her texts back replies would take longer, her overall tone in our conversations also started to change. I called her a few more times and the last time she mentioned how things had changed. How whenever I use to call she would get excited and it changed to her now being nervous.

Anyways I called her about 5 days ago and told her that I didn’t want to make her nervous when I called and posed the idea of taking a break from one another for a week or two for clarity reasons. She agreed to it. I also even mentioned that we should make a pact to talk to each other in a few weeks but we didn’t set anything in stone. We haven’t spoken since that point in time.

I just feel like I made a mistake. I obviously miss her, it’s hard not to miss someone after speaking to them so much for the past 2.5 months. But at the same time, I’ve never met this person. I guess I’m just trying to figure out if I’m the bad guy here. I don’t know if I made the right decision in asking for a break, definitely miss her, but know I wanted to give her space as it seemed like she need to work things through.

I talked to my sister and she told me that if she wanted to reach out to me she had my contact information and would reach out to me but otherwise I should just leave things be.

I guess I’m just venting. Did I make the right decision here? Should I have flown out sooner to meet her? I guess I’m just venting.",05Dec2018,1

I’m currently 6 months into my probation. Everything’s been good so far except one thing that makes my mind go crazy. Back the first month I was on probation I was doing weekly drug tests at the drug classes. I did not know that included alcohol. Basically the 2nd or 3rd test in I tested positive for alcohol. I met with the guy in charge at the drug center and he said he would just write a letter to my probation officer saying the levels of thc are dropping.

I’m in college. I’m the youngest in class. 
My class is filled with people ages 20 and above. 
It’s a private college so that’s why people of all ages join classes. 

I have a bunch of friends who are really attractive, good looking. Popular kids. They’re in their 20’s with the oldest being 24. 

I’m friends with them but somehow I don’t feel I fit in. In high school, I never had friends. Was the most bullied kid in school for following my dreams that I once had. 

Whenever I’m with them, they don’t let me do stuff that usually friends let you do. They joke around but they’ll call me gay and shit.  

But at the same time, whenever I need advice. They’re there to advice me. And sometimes they make fun of me being slightly overweight and they’d say “fat fuck” 

but they always encouraged me to go to the gym regularly but I personally only want to work out once a week until I finish up college. (In 5 months time) 

I’ve tried smoking and I drink. I started drinking when I was 14. Not an addict or anything, I just tried it and I liked it. Haven’t touched alcohol till now. 

I’ve been trying to ask them to buy me a pack and a can of beer but they don’t wanna help me out. Recently, I’ve been doing a lot of school work where I study till wee hours of the morning. Now that it’s all over, I want to let loose a lil. But when I ask them, they don’t wanna help me out. 

I’m not doing this coz it’s cool but it’s because I actually like smoking and drinking. (I tried my first stick from them) 
They treat me as if I’m their child or something, or like a lil bro where they wouldn’t want to see me get hurt, but hurt me anyway and let me do some things but not let me do some things anyway. They make fun of me and console me at the same time. 

I’ve never had friends before. So I don’t know if this is the way friends act. My interaction skills with humans are absolutely terrible in all honesty, probably because of my social anxiety and awkwardness. I’m like this because I’ve been confused about a lot of things in life. 

Also I’ve never had any siblings. I’ve been an only child all my life. 

I’m actually unsure if my friends are friends or if they are something else. I feel a lil weird sometimes too because I’m the youngest. They are all 20 with one being 24.  

What do you guy think ?

First…

Most people have a monthly income. They pay all their bills and whatever is left, they then set aside a portion and put it in their savings. Wrong!
The correct way to save: Monthly income, set aside what you want to save and then whatever amount you have left, you use that to pay your bills and spend as you choose. Savings comes first.

339,"Hi guys, I am dying of embarrassment right now and am unsure of what to do. I would rather tell this to a bunch of strangers on the internet than my friends.

So backstory, me and this guy have been going on dates and flirting pretty heavily for the past few weeks. It was also the second day of my period and normally I would wear some safety shorts underneath my pants to ensure that my period did not leak. However, I was busy in the morning today and did not think about it. I chose to wear these unfortunately thin, long, flowy black and white striped pants. They looked good with my outfit but if blood were to leak they would definitely show.

The meet up went down really well. We met and decided to chill at my apartment. I enjoyed the company and didn't really think too much about my period and the pad situation, changing it maybe 2 or 3 times in total during the day. However, my efforts of changing had been in vain. After the guy had left, I undressed to find that the entire backside of the pants were stained with a light shade of red. The blood had seeped through. Maybe it was the positioning of the pad or my movements during the day, but at some point during the meet up, blood had started showing on my pants. 

I have guesstimated that it had to have been during the last two hours of the date as that was when I had last changed it. I do not know how this has happened but I am ashamed and embarrassed. I feel like my date definitely saw something as I was moving around a lot in the apartment, showing him my butt. He did not say anything about my pants situation but I'm not sure I would have said anything either. 

I do not know what to do. Should I bring it up with the guy or let it be. I don't know how to even face him on our next date (we agreed on another date shortly before he left). Any advice would be greatly appreciated in this trying time.

TLDR: Blood from my period seeped into my pants during my date. Not sure if he saw it. ",05Dec2018,1

341,"I’m extremely stressed out right now. My boyfriend and I used to work together for the same demolition company and he left many months ago (I stayed). He goes to this new company where he’s doing snow clearing and surprisingly it hasn’t snowed much. He’s been off for nearly 3 weeks straight and will not go on E.I. (Government gives you money to supplement your wage loss) because his father told him he will be denied due to him having a class 1 license (semi-trucks). 

My company (his old company) has offered him a huge raise to what he was originally making there AND to what he’s making doing snow clearing, bought a new semi with him specifically in mind to drive it as well as a new end-dump truck for when he isn’t hauling the machine around to different job sites. And he still said no. I personally think it’s because he wants to work with his dad, who is doing snow clearing at the same company. My feelings towards his toxic family is another issue, but it would take too long to get into...

We make (together) over 100K a year and yet we somehow manage to struggle paying for all of our bills despite having just 2 cars, a 1 bedroom apartment, and his crippling gambling debt. It shouldn’t cost as much as it is, and I’m constantly giving him money. 

I’ve given him money for his car countless times and I just recently found out that he’s somehow $900 behind on his car. I had to pay a full months rent on my own which is literally my entire paycheque on a bad pay. I’ve paid our phone bill in full this last month as well and I have no idea where the hell all the money I gave him has been going. I suspect that he’s paying money to his parents because they are apparently ‘struggling’ since we moved out of their house. They like to bully and intimidate for money (his mother has assaulted me because I owed her money for rent before) and I think they’ve been harassing my boyfriend for money. 

My paycheques are completely spoken for before I even get them and it’s to pay all of our expenses, I don’t even have money for my prescription medications anymore. I’m panicking and I have no idea what to do. I’ve confronted him and asked him where all of his money is going but I don’t believe anything he tells me. He’s always put his psycho family first and now I think we’re paying the ultimate price for it. I’ve had my car repossessed before I got my class 1 license and I know what it’s like to struggle and I know exactly what I should have done differently, and now I’m watching my boyfriend make all the same mistakes I was and he absolutely refuses to listen to me. 

I’m trying so hard to regain my credit and it’s been working but now it’s plummeting again because of him. I’m so angry but I don’t want to make him feel like shit like his parents do and I just don’t know what to do. I can’t qualify for any loans (I don’t think) and I can’t ask my parents for help because my dad is the only provider for him and my mum and I absolutely cannot ask my boyfriends parents for help (been down that road before, they literally had me to the point of wanting to kill myself so I didn’t have to deal with all the stress and drama, and I got assaulted and abused by them when they helped me with my car).

344,"Hey yall i'll try to keep this brief.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a group of friends that I am very close to, we have done almost everything together as a group since high school (26/M). I have been depressed since I was about 22 and they are aware of this. Mostly we talk online together in chats or play games together. Whenever we hang out in person there is a lot of drinking and drugs - its rather normal for us. 

It is almost a guarantee now when we hang out in person that I will have some degree of mental breakdown. It only happens when we are together as a full group - but it will always happen. Last weekend for friendsgiving I couldn't handle being made fun of (common) and I had to leave early. As soon as they think I am out of earshot they rip me to pieces. They are supportive afterwards as individuals but as a group things become very hateful.

I've decided that I need to get rid of that toxicity in my life. I want to cut those relationships off but I have nowhere else to turn really. I do alot of the things most people suggest when they are depressed, I work out at a gym with a coach, I volunteer at an animal shelter (I walk dogs) and i'm trying to improve myself as much as I can. Its still not enough.  


How can I get rid of people who have been near the core of my life for the last 10+ years? I've tried ghosting on them but I can't stay away for too long, my lifestyle seems tied to them.",05Dec2018,1
345,"So I'm coming close to graduating high school, within the next 5-6 months actually and I'm not sure what to do. My college is paid for and I'm getting money back, so I'm not worried about that. I want to move out and live with my boyfriend and rent an apartment with him, but my mom wants me to live at home. She says it is financially better and she'd let my boyfriend stay/sleep with me.

The issue is though, I don't want to be stuck at home for the next four years, I want to move out and start a home with my boyfriend. The money I get back each semester should cover the cost of rent, so the only money I would be out on is for groceries and such. The only pro I see of staying with my parents is keeping that money that I get back. 

I really don't know what to do. I want to move out and live alone with my boyfriend even if its a little costly, but I know it'll cause less financial stress to stay with my parents. 

I can clearly see which is smarter, but I'm leaning towards my happiness over money.

I am currently a contract engineer with a well known company, however my contract ends in February. So I started looking around at new opportunities and I was offered a salaried position with another large company down the road from my current company.

It has benefits and is a more secure option than doing contract work, not fully knowing if I will be hired on full time at my current company. I spoke to my boss and he really wants to keep me around but there is a spending and hiring freeze until sometime in January.

I mostly just end up sitting around bored, watching YouTube or Netflix, or having them play in the background while I scroll reddit.

i was looking into other degrees and found a cool double degree, and i can transfer my existing units to minimise the time. so it'll only take me 3 years to do, and i'll get 3 degrees. or i could do a single and finish it in 2 years (transfer units as well. and get 2 degrees). or i can just deal with life and work full time and get paid/experience.

356,"Me and a girl have been flirting for a few month and we’ve made eye contact a lot and and laughed at each other’s jokes. Last week I added her on snapchat and she added me back. I haven’t sent her anything yet because I’m scared but this Saturday I’m going to send her something while I’m with my friends. Or maybe tomorrow if there’s something funny to send. 

Anyway, this week in school we have theme week. We basically get random classmates and all the people in the school that are the same age as you get sorted in to new classes for the week and in the classes we get groups. 

The girl I like didn’t get the same class as me which was sad but I didn’t think much of it. Not until one of her friends said that a special person was in a class. I think the friend meant that someone was in the girl’s class and the name of the person was a name that could be a boy or a girl. I haven’t seen her walking around with a guy so I hope that it was a girl they meant. What makes me scared is that both yesterday and today she went to the other side of the halls instead of going with her friends as usual. She does do this sometimes and every time I get super scared but it turns out that she met up with some old friend or something. If it is what I’m fearing I’m going to get sad and mad at myself for not taking a chance. 

With this week where we aren’t going to see each other much and I’m too scared to send her anything I’m afraid she’ll meet another guy and get together with him.

358,"Basically he broke up with me two weeks ago because of an addiction. Or at least that’s what he says. I do not have any doubt about that of course because who in the right mind would lie about something like that just to break up. When he was breaking up with me he claimed he still loves me and he could never stop, which I most certainly believe. We did not have any issues. Yes of course, there was the odd argument but we were not fighting much, it was very rare. His family liked me, my family liked him, no issue there either. We had great chemistry and really connected. He trusted me with things he would never trust anybody else with, including his addiction which nobody except me knows about. As a matter of fact he even got my birthday tattooed on him. So i mean it just really shows. Also not to mention when he was breaking up i made sure if there’s anyone else. i asked if he cheated he said that’s one thing he’d never do and i asked if he’s in love with someone else and he said not even close and when i asked if he lost feelings for me he said no and that he could never. 

As I said, he broke up with me due to an addiction. Cocaine to be exact. I wasnt aware of this until the day he broke up with me. I knew he did it previously but only once and it was at a party about 3 weeks prior but what he did not tell me is that he has been addicted ever since. When he was breaking up with me that is the reasoning he used along with another one that I'll tell you later but basically he thinks I can do better than a ''junkie'' boyfriend as he says and that I deserve someone who can take care of me. I told him this would not affect me and I only have the intention to help but he stood his ground and claimed that he can do it on his own. To my knowledge, he has no informed anyone else about this nor has he seeked help from any outisde sources. 

The other reason is that he is moving away next year to another country to join the military. He says it would be too difficult to breakup in a year because he knows we would grow even closer therefore he is doing this now. I can see where he is coming from but at the same time i do not understand. 

A few days after the breakup i was very emotional and begged him to talk to me so we can work this out and talk. However he kept dodging the conversation so I eventually apologized for my behavior. I have not contacted him since and i’m not planning on it either. i don’t really know what to do honestly.

A few days ago however i went out with some friends and broke no contact by messaging and I wasn’t exactly sober.  He asked if i’m ok and i asked him if he misses me. He said all the time and that he’s been smoking pot trying to forget about me but it’s not working. He even said he loves me and always will. We talked he next day and he helped me out with something but suddenly he’s acting harsh again. He said he wants to talk face to face but that he stands by his decision of our breakup. I don’t understand what’s going on and I’ve no idea what to do. This situation is messing with my mind and I really need some stranger to tell me what they think and what they think my next step should be.

I honestly just have been so focused on not offing myself between school and work that making the payment didn't really cross my mind. I know that's lame but, it's the truth.

I work at Pizza Hut rn and make about $1000 usd a month on check + ~$100-300 in tips a month. My car payment is $429 and we pay $300 in space rent. I also pay for my car insurance ($229.) I also pay for my phone bill. We won't have food money this month from my check (due to reinstatement fee and this months payment), but we can go to the food bank and I can use my tips after I pay the bills to buy a bit.

Is it even worth it though? I could easily buy a beater car that runs well for the $2000 and just not have to worry about paying $429 and instead pay like, $200ish. But then I am paying a debt on something I don't even own anymore. I'm tempted to say fuck it and just work on subsisting right now until I can finally pay off the car and my medical bills.

367,"So my relationship with my parent is massively screwed up.

My father is retired now. When he worked he started a company with was successful. I grew up working for the company ( not really voluntarily) until I was in college and could get out of working for it. I just staying at school during the summers and took classes.

My mother has always been difficult. She has anger issues (which I also have) and she is manipulative. As an example, every girlfriend that I would bring home to meet my parents, she would make some cutting, snide remark which seems like an attempt to ruin each relationship. One girlfriend bought me a Guess brand watch, so my mother says, 'Oh you obviously don't know my son at all!' (Because I was not a name-brand type person.) I guess I had a hard time standing up to her and would rather just ignore her for a few months. She has done much worse things (things that I find unforgivable) to my siblings and their spouses. But my father is blind to the fact that my mother is a manipulative, passive-aggressive, manic-depressive wreck.

My parents have always been very strict right-wing religious people. Until I was free not to, I went to church multiple times each week. My father was a deacon, etc. In my parents view, they brought us up perfectly (certainly much better than their parents brought them up). Growing up, my family had money and my parents paid for our college education. My father wanted me to major in business but I majored in philosophy, which he detested. I had planned on attending graduate school, but I never did. I had a crisis when I was at college and spent my college years trying to figure out what I believed in now that I didn't believe in right-wing Christianity any more. After college I worked retail and then in an office. I was always able to be my rent, and now I am actually somewhat financially successful (in my opinion; apparently not in my parents'). 

Over the past ten years, my relationship with my parents had gotten a little better because I had been overlooking our extreme differences (they are still as aggressively right-wing religious and Fox News-spouting as ever). But when Trump won the election, I just said fuck it. I just can't take the extreme hypocrisy between their support of Trump and their belief that they are good Christians. It's absurd, and I can't explain to them why it is absurd, and they can't understand why I feel that it is absurd. So I just totally bailed on the relationship for a few years. 

My parents have always been racists. When I was a kid, my dad told me not to listen to popular music because it was nigger music. I once said that the good guys won the Civil War and he said that I shouldn't say that. (He would deny all of this if I brought it up to him.) I came home crying from my new school at first grade because my best friend was black and I knew that dad hated blacks (turns out he was Filipino; I didn't know the difference at that age.) Anyways, I take my parents' embrace of Trump to be just another example of their racism and religious hypocrisy. 

So my father calls me this morning and tells me that I'm a selfish asshole, etc. I just said okay, fine, and listened until he hung up. Apparently they are in a big fight with my sister and she wrote them a long angry email last night that made him angry, so he called me to give me a piece of his mind. He still thinks he did they right thing by voting for Trump. My rejection of him probably just strengthened his views. He also mentioned that he paid for my college education and demanded to know what I was doing with it. (I am pretty successful, I have a net worth &gt;1MM and work from home, but I didn't say anything.)

TLDR I don't speak to my parents any more, because the gulf between us is overwhelming and I don't have anything to say to them. They are very angry about this, but I don't really have any desire to repair the relationship, because they are quite adamant in their political/religious/personal stances, which I find abhorrent.",05Dec2018,1

Plus, some students got to repeat the test because it did not save their answers (we did it on a computer). Most test takers think the test and the conditions were unfair. We did the test in class (counts 70% of overall grade) and I know I failed, it was a tough exam. I just don't understand why we were not given 90 minutes (how long the class usually lasts).

He would drive her home from work even if she refused constantly and would force sexual acts on her, and even rape. This continued for months out of fear for her life and job.

376,"Background: My best friend (lets call her gummy bear) and I have been friends since 2nd(ish) grade. She knows practically everything about me, and vice versa. I have this pet peeve of people replying with just “k”. It’s isn’t a huge pet peeve I just let them know that it bugs me and politely ask them to not do it again. Stupid pet peeve I get it, but it’s not the pet peeve specifically that caused the issue. 

ISSUE: 

Gummy bear and I were texting, I had asked her what she was doing tomorrow, and she said going to her boyfriend’s at some point but probably not till around 5. I replied oh nice. She then asked me why I asked, I told her I was just curious. I was debating if I wanted to ask her out to lunch or not, but a lot of factors in the household wouldn’t have been able to ask now, but rather last minute. She said okay, so I said my typical yep. Now her pet peeve is “mhm” and I text that a lot to everyone, but purposefully avoid me saying that to not piss her off.

Her next response was the dreadful “K.”.  I replied with “why did you k me? Its not like I mhm you...” Her response pissed me off. She said “lol, just fishing for a response”. I said “well thanks because I’ve been in a bad mood all day :) night”. She said “well so have I... I didn’t mean to piss you off I was just bored.” 

Ive been ignoring her since (this happened Monday). Now I don’t have many friends I literally spend all of my time between 3 people (my boyfriend, Gummy bear, and my other best friend (lets call her sushi). 

Yesterday I told sushi what was going on, and then she had brought it up casually to Gummy bear, and then I get a Snapchat saying “hey sorry about last night”. I knew she hadn’t apologized all on her own, I don’t even think she knows the damage she has done to me.  

First of all, I cried the first night because the fact she could just casually “fish for a reaction... [because she] was bored’”, hurt like hell. Real friends don’t do that.  I also started losing trust again and it took me so freaking long to regain truth when my ex cheated on me and lied to my face (but that’s beside the point). My mind started wandering doubting my own relationship because if a best friend of 10+ years can turn on me, why couldnt my boyfriend. I knew it wasn’t true but my mind goes everywhere. I broke down crying last night hanging with my boyfriend because I know the thoughts aren’t true but they kept haunting me. 

I just don’t know what I should do... I don’t think it was a heart felt apology, but the longer I wait the less easy it will be for me to forgive.. am I going insane or overreacting? ",05Dec2018,1

378,"I’m a 30 year old woman with stage 3 breast cancer. I was diagnosed last summer at the age of 29. I went through fertility preservation, chemotherapy, radiation, and breast reconstruction. I found out during my breast reconstruction surgery (August 2018) that I still have cancer in the lymph nodes lining my sternum. I am now back in radiation and will be taking oral chemo and having additional surgeries (at least 2, possibly 3) in 2019. 


Through all of this I have been working full time, I have good health insurance, and I’ve been applying for grants and support from organizations. That being said, I still have about $25k in debt racked up and am expecting to incur a similar amount in 2019. My sister-in-law is setting up a GoFundMe for me with a goal of $60k. I need the money but I still feel weird about asking people for help. Especially since I’m an adult with a decent job and I should be able to take care of myself. I don’t want people to think that I’m greedy or begging for something I should be able to handle on my own. I just feel so helpless. 


Does anyone here have experience with this kind of situation and can give me advice?

380,"I am a 21 year old guy, my job is in a small office with mostly family, 40 hours a week, I want to make some new friends because while I love the few that I have, we have differing interests and we have very conflicting schedules so they are usually not avalible at the same time I am and when they are their not interested in the same things I am.

Some people have told me to make friends at the gym, but that doesn't work because most if not all the people in there have headphones on signaling they would rather not be bothered. Other people tell me to meet people at a bar but everytime I go to one everyone's kind of sectioned off and doing their own thing with their own little group.

381,"My flatmate isn't really a bad guy or anything but god damn does he not leave me alone. He's always in my room although he has the bigger room, he always gets his stuff and decides to work or eat in my room even if it gets too crowded with my friends he'll still be in my room trying to get some work done.

What bothers me even more tho is that he's gotten very comfortable with space and my friends. he doesn't have any friends at all. He always rushes into my room the moment my friends come over and automatically thinks he's invited when we're going out and we'd feel to awkward to tell him not to come.  The person who really can't tolerate him is my girlfriend, because of how comfortable he is with our space, we rarely get time alone. He has this thing where he's like a fact machine or a history teacher, he never ever shuts the fuck up about different historical facts and shit. sometimes my friends and I would be watching a movie and he's start talking about something random and would not shut up, to the point where no one is listening anymore but he would continue talking nonstop. Movies aside tho, I cant seem to get him to shut about random history lessons I didn't ask for. 

So there's this thing that mainly annoys me is that I never get to hangout with my friends alone anymore cause he is always around. We were all okay with him but at this point its intolerable. When it's just me and my GF we usually get rid of him by asking him for some privacy as if we're gonna frickfrack. But when my friends are over I can't ask for some privacy for obvious reason so we can never come up with a good enough excuse to get rid of him. 

There are way too many flaws with this guy but I'm not gonna mention them because they're irrelevant to this post but one thing he does is that he's always looking for a girlfriend and wants a perfect girl. I really don't wanna get into detail here but there a shitload of some Incel situations that arise from this, including him falling in love with everyone and  / or talking about close female friends of mine like their sex objects (e.g describing how big one of my female friends ass is while me knowing how sensitive she is about her weight). He also asks for girl advice over and over again but the moment I start giving him advice he stops listening. 

I have many more example to give but I bet you all get the idea of what kinda guy he is. He is my age (23) but he acts like a 16 year old. we're both students in a Mediterranean country. He's American and I'm an Arab. He always talks mad shit about people of this country we're in and about Arabs in general but can't accept anything being said about his own country. that aside he also hates on all other white people who are students in this country as well. 

All that aside, he's not that bad of a guy and he's pretty reliable. but I just need him to get off my ass and give me and my friends our privacy. I also need him to go out and get his own group of friends. I have a few friends coming to visit me this winter break and he's basing his plans based on plans I'm making with those friends and I cant't have that. 

I know the best option is to talk to him about it but he's kinda difficult especially that he thinks everything is cool. I need any tips and advice I can get for when I talk to him or how to get him to leave me alone when I'm with friends.

TL;DR: Flatmate always hangs out in my room and doesn't leave me and my friends alone.",05Dec2018,1
382,"Probably stupid question and answer probably is no. 

Some background: I’m in a close friend group where all my best friend’s have known each other since elementary school. I came into the group around 9th grade (I’m the only guy in the group) and we have all become as close as siblings. I’ve known them for about 6 years now. 

My friend group goes to universities around the country, but I have one friend who has stayed in town going to a local college (I go to a different uni that’s also local). When we all left for college I wasn’t the closest of friends with her but we got along well. Over time we’ve gotten closer and hang out a few times a week. 

My friend has a little sister (we’ll call her V) she’s two years younger than us and is now in university across the country. Before she left and now when V visits home V, I feel like we have this great connection where we can just chat for hours on end. When we’re away we always text through social media. Also whenever we’re just in a room alone we find ourselves somehow almost always getting close to each other, sometimes we chat and our heads are like a foot away. (I’m not taking a ruler and measuring the distance but somehow we just that we both just get closer when chatting alone. 

Now before I go any further I don’t want to sound like some asshole creep creeping on my friend’s little sister. This has been going on for a while now and I’ve been telling myself obviously “no this is a bad idea stop it. Don’t be an idiot” and I’ve been trying to ignore this “whatever thing” that we have. 

I feel like I’m starting to second guess myself. I’ll probably regret talking to her about it (if I do decide to) and maybe I’ll regret not talking to her about it. Only time will tell for the latter. If I do talk to her about it and her sister finds out then she would probably murder me for good reason.  V will be back in town in less than 2 weeks for the winter break. 

Should I bring it up with V in private or just try to   keep on ignoring whatever we have?",05Dec2018,1
383,"My girlfriend and I recently broke up (roughly 3 weeks ago). It wasn't a messy breakup, it was mutual. After her parents found out about us, they hated me and she wanted to keep me a secret. Because of this, I barely got to see her, maybe one hour of the week, and that's only if I drive to her school while she has a gap between her classes. Needless to say, it took a big toll on not only me, but our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. I'm doing a good job with moving on. I told her maybe we had a chance in the future when she has more independence, but I'm realizing that not being in a relationship right now feels great. I'm not looking for anything serious.

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine, we'll call her Maria, got word of me and my girlfriend's break up and wants to have sex. Nothing serious, no strings attached, no ""so what are we"". I'm not gonna lie she's absolutely gorgeous and someone who is very sought after. Now, I think I have moved on from my girlfriend, but I'm certain she's struggling heavily. She calls me many nights crying and asking for comfort before she goes to sleep. I haven't had sex in about 7 months (my girlfriend was scared of unplanned pregnancy) and this could be the end of the drought. But I'm also afraid of hurting my ex, she's an amazing person, it's a shame the feelings got lost because of circumstances outside of her control. What should I do?

393,"My brother fell for my best friend a few months ago. I introduced him after he moved back into my mother's house. 

For some background information, my brother had severe MDD and PTSD and his lashing out threatened my family's mental health especially mine so he lives with my father, our father. He is my only full sibling. He was gone for about a year and a half after us trying to get him help going through therapy, family base and meds and support. He was just sick. Recently he moved back after my father brutally attacked him in his sleep. 

We've dealt with abuse from my biological father all my life but he's always got the brunt of it. 

Back to the present, my best friend met my brother and he liked her. He tried to make her like him for months doing nice things, making her laugh, hanging with us, texting her. He really fell for her. And after a week of them dating she broke with him. She got an eviction notice the week before and I offered to help pay what little I could afford. She told me not to tell anyone and then broke up with my brother. She didn't tell him she was stressed and kind of left him hanging. 

He was broken hearted but it had only been a week of them being together so it wasn't so bad. He had a small episode because of flashbacks of abandonment and then a few days later she took him back. She texted him saying she wanted to try again. 

He took her back saying he only would if she tried hard to make them better. She didn't. 

She left the other day and he's devastated. His flashbacks are so bad he's barely functioning. She just texted him and then refused to answer her texts. When I called her mom answered Don the third try and said she was having a panic attack. Then she said she'd tell her I'll call and we hung up. 

She told him she loved him and all this even before they started dating. He bought their anniversary gift and it came yesterday. He can't even face her at school. He's having a flashback at school. I don't know what to do. Her excuse is she lost feelings but why get back with him? She says she's sorry a million times and that she didn't mean for anyone to get hurt but he told her and only her about everything going on inside his head. 

He feels he isn't good enough for girls, for his own family. 

She wants to be friends but how can I even look at someone who knew what she was doing? My own bestfriend who I offered to pay part of her rent, offered for her mother to use my car because they couldn't afford to fix her own, who my mother bought homecoming things for because of their budget, who cleaned my room because I was too depressed to do it at one point.

395,"Recently, my father pulled me, my brother, and sister all in his room to tell us something our mother did recently that bothered him. He said that when she was dropping him off at work (his car is in the shop) she told him that while she went to go visit her sister and she knocked on her door, her boyfriend came up to the door with a hard on. My mother proceeded to still walk in, and her sister was wearing lingerie. They were in the living room. Her sister told her, “Wow, you really know how to bomb a good time.” My mother popped up over her house unannounced, which is why this happened. My mother was bothered about it, so she told my Dad. Our Dad told us at first he didn’t really think about it, but then he thought about it some more and got bothered. He told his coworkers about it, and they told him that what our mom did was not right.

My Dad was saying all types of things like, “I can’t believe your mother would do something foul like this. If this is how it’s going to be, she is going to have to move on. What your aunt’s boyfriend did was f&amp;cked up.” My brother said, “She should’ve been like, oh I came at a bad time, I’ll see you guys later. She should not have proceeded to walk in.” My brother and father both said, “I do not want to see our aunt’s boyfriend again after doing some disrespectful s&amp;it like that.” My brother said, “I’m going to have some words with our mom.” My sister and I just remained silent.

When my mother came in for work that night, my father did not come to see her in like he usually does. The next day, my mother and I was at home. My brother called her and began to curse her out and say things like “That was some f&amp;cked up s&amp;it you did the other night. You think that s&amp;it was okay? Acting like a h&amp;e.” My mother got a little emotional and had to check him and say, “Hey! This is your mother you’re speaking to.” My father called her and had some words with her. She began crying and told him, “I made a mistake. However, I told you this because it did bother me and I confided in you. I don’t like how you went behind my back and told our kids this. I don’t appreciate my son calling me and speaking to me the way he did. I don’t care about my sister’s boyfriend, I went to go visit my sister at a bad time.”

To see my mother get so emotional was hard to see. I told her, “I just think from now on, if you want to visit her or anyone, you need to call beforehand because situations like this will happen. And you also could’ve been like oh I came at a bad time, I’ll see you guys another time.” My mother agreed. She told me that her sister was literally right there speaking to her as she walked in, which is why she proceeded to walk in.

I don’t think my mother wants my aunt’s boyfriend, I just think she made a mistake. I think all involved were in the wrong. I don’t think my Dad handled it appropriately. I don’t think he should’ve told us about it or his coworkers. If it really bothered him, he should’ve talked to our mother in private. I definitely think my aunt’s boyfriend was wrong because who answers the door with a hard on in the first place? My brother calling and talking to our mother the way he did was inappropriate.
What do you guys think about all of this?

**tl;dr: My mother went to go visit my aunt unannounced, and my aunt's boyfriend answered the door with a hard on. My mother proceeded to go in.

396,"My friend (lets call him Ben) and I have been friends for around 10 years. We dated when we were like 10 for a few months and then broke up because we were kids and had no idea what being in a relationship meant. 

We became close friends, in fact, I think too close for comfort. I have a boyfriend. I’ve been dating him for 5 years. I have absolutely no attraction to Ben, at all, I am not physically attracted to him what so ever and I honestly don’t think his personality is all that great either. I haven’t enjoyed being a close friend of his for a very long time. Every time I’ve tried to cut Ben out of my life, he’s some how made my life miserable. I tried the good old fashioned block, he messaged my boyfriend begging him to ask me to unblock him, messaged all of my friends that he had added on social media to ask me to unblock him. I did eventually because it was humiliating. A second time this happened, he asked his mother to text me and beg him to be his friend because she was afraid he’d hurt himself or something. I am Ben’s only friend. He has no acquaintances, no other people he talks to. I’m the ONLY person. I have always thought that was really weird. I encourage him to make other friends and told him it’s imperative that he does that, because it’s not healthy that I’m his only friend. He practically forces me to talk to him, and only him, include him in things my other friends want to do with me, and it’s exhausting, or else I’m subject to his mental abuse and passive aggressiveness for however long he decides. My friends really don’t like him, and he doesn’t have friends of his own, so when I’m not talking to him he’s all by himself.

But it gets worse, in two different scenarios in the last year he’s admitted he’s had feelings for me more than a friend. I don’t like him like that. I have a boyfriend. He knows I do. and even if I didn’t, I would never feel that way about him. I barely want to be his friend sometimes. Before it was clear to me that he had any sort of feelings about me,  we had made arrangements to have him move in with me and my boyfriend because he wanted to get away from his side of the country. I want to retract that offer because I’m starting to understand how bad of an idea it would be for someone who “previously” had feelings for me, if not, still does have feelings for me, to live with me when I have absolutely no desire to be with him. 

I don’t even know if I should continue to be his friend at all. Am I leading him on? Should I just stop talking to him completely? What do I do? ",05Dec2018,1

My problem is, he's a shy dude and always on his phone in class. Another problem is that he sits on the other side of the room and he's always with one of his friends. I've told my friend and she suggests that I make casual conversation with him, but I just want to know if he actually likes me. I kind of want to be rejected just so I can stop making up whoever he is in my head. I'm not a very outgoing person (I only have one friend) so whatever advice you give me, I'll take.

At that moment I was already in relationship, so I didnt really care about stuff like that.Few days later I broke up and thats when I started paying attention.

403,"The title probably seems like a no-brainer, right? Let me explain further.

My boyfriend and I broke up back in September. It was amicable at first, but has since not been so friendly.

A year ago around this time, he confided in me his darkest secret, that he made me swear to never tell another soul. Besides, we were in love and expected to be together forever.

When he was around 14, him and his mom moved to a new state. He became depressed, obese, and lonely. His mom made quick friends with the local priest. This priest had a son. He would have been.... around 5 or 6?  
I'm gonna call the ex Mark and the boy Phil.

Mark began to babysit Phil. I wasn't given a timeline of when it started, but he told me he would sit him on his lap to watch tv or play video games or whatever, and put his hand down Phil's pants.  
He insists he didn't do anything else. No pulling off of clothes, touching himself, showing himself, etc.  
But he said this went on for a couple years. Maybe once a month? He was very uncomfortable sharing the specifics like that.  


What's worse, he's still very close with Phil and the priest. His mother is best friend's with the priest, talking and seeing each other almost every day.  
Phil is a lovely boy. He's now around 13 or 14. Very funny, sweet, cute kid.  


Hearing this made me sob. He began to sob as well, saying he has felt guilty for years and has almost turned himself in many times. That he tries to be a better person and the thought disgusts him now and he would never do anything like that again.  
I almost broke up with him on the spot, and continued to struggle for a good week or so.  
I didn't let them alone in a room after that. It just made me feel weird. And I kept a close eye on Phil, to see if he showed any sort of signs of remembering or just issues in general.",05Dec2018,1

413,"Okay I'm kind of new to this but I'm not sure how to go about this.

Just some context, i am 21 and work in an office and the woman i'm talking about is about 36 and we are good friends.

So last Friday was my works do, and I'm very close to around 3 of my workmates.

So we were out in town and we started off the night at a meal where there was a lot of wine drank and i had drank quite a few pints too but i can handle my drink so i was a bit tipsy but nothing major.

The woman i work with (who i am quite close to) asks me to come over to speak to her. And so i went over and sat and spoke to her, she was quite drunk so she was spilling a lot to me and because were really friendly in the office she knows i can keep a secret.... but i would prefer not to hear one if it was to do with someone else in the office (i work in accounts and confidentiality is a big thing for me). This woman is a director and she started telling me things about one of the employees that wasn't really pulling her weight and so she was thinking about sacking her. I immediately stopped the conversation and said it would be a big mistake if she was to start blurting things out because she is drunk so i changed the subject to what she likes to do outside of work (in all honesty work talk fucking bores me).

So were talking for around 10 minutes and then she stops talking and stares at me asking me if i have a girlfriend/partner. I'm single so i said no i don't, to which she says ""if i was 10 years younger you'd be coming home with me tonight"" just out of the blue. BUT even though she has said this, i know that she has a boyfriend of 4 years and they live together. So i accept the compliment and make a joke about it. I carry on the conversation and i have my arm on the chair, leaning to face her (if you get what i mean) and she grabs my hand and asks if we can make up a hand shake... To which i say okay. She tells me to hold my hand out palm up and then strokes my palm slowly... and then holds my hand and asks me what i think. I wasn't sure what to say so i just said sarcastically ""don't you have a boyfriend"" and she replies with ""yeah, but i'm not sure about it you know""

I am quite a laid back person so most of the time if i feel awkward in a situation i will make a joke out of it and move on. At this point we were moving out onto a bar nearby. I went to shop to get some heartburn relief (Rennie's) and so i met everyone else in the office at the bar... Once i got in she ran and jumped at me wrapping her arms around me all excited... and this point she was even more drunk than she was before.

She was leaning and stumbling against a wall but no-one was really helping, so i took it upon myself to make sure she was sat down with a glass of water so that she could sober up... to which she refused but continued to wrap her arms around me and lean on me instead... i ended up standing with her and holding a straw up to her mouth for her to drink the water. And this is where it gets a bit strange.

I had my right arm around her on her shoulder, and my left arm had a glass of water in, holding up so that she could drink... At this point she's whispering things like ""you're a really great guy"" and constantly complimenting me. She is actually a really pretty girl and usually when a pretty girl starts complimenting me i'll make a move, but i made sure that i stayed professional as she had a boyfriend and everyone in the office could see what was going on.

I few seconds go by after another compliment and she puts her hand into my back pocket and keeps it in there... Asking me to kiss her and starts kissing me on the neck and cheek. I must have had the power of Zeus in my hands because the temptations were so high and i had to just refuse and tell her she's making a mistake.

She started to sober up but kept drinking, i think she finally hit a level and started to buy me drinks, i wasn't getting any more pissed than i was at the meal but i was fine with that because i was having a great night. 

When we decided to leave the bar, we were going to walk back to the hotel and one of the other guys from my office offered her a piggy back to carry her because she was complaining about blisters on her feet and she couldn't walk. She refused him and said ""i only want one from \*\*\*\*\*\*(me)"" So i did because it would be mean to refuse, so i do and she starts telling me that this might not be the only time she has her legs wrapped around me. 

I'm not sure if she remembers the whole night because she seems to be absolutely fine with me this week in the office but i feel really uncomfortable.... Should i tell her all of whats happened or should i leave it and just let it go?

414,"So I had the same two best friends for the last 17 years (we all met when we were 11 years old) and we were very close. More or less like family. Hung out all the time, called all the time, knew each others families, could talk about anything, all that stuff. The type of friends where you could show up unannounced to their place cause you have their spare key and roll them out of bed to go grab breakfast kind if deal. 

But then in August I ended up moving to a different country (US to EU). And since then... nothing. One stopped returning all of my calls and texts after about 2 weeks. One texts me here and there (about once every month) but never answers my calls. And honestly I’m heartbroken. It’s like we were never even friends to begin with, let alone best friends for the last 10+ years. 

I just don’t know how to cope. They were such a huge part if my life for so long, literally more than half if my life. Even though we had our own lives, we always knew the other was there. Always made time for each other. I feel like I’ve gone through every stage of greiving; from anger, to wondering if I was a shit friend all of this time. Whats worse is I lost not one, but two best friends at the same time, all while having to deal with having just moved to a new place, new culture, new language, and not knowing anyone. 

I know that friends grow apart as they get older, and we were slowly growing apart in the last year due to work and relationships, but it happening so abruptly has really hit me hard. 

Anyone have any advice on how to handle this? Do I even bother trying to still be friends and contacting them if I come visit?

I trained her in our department. Had no problems with her for over 6 months. There is a position opening up we were both in the running for (basically lab manager).

All of the sudden she starts talking about me in the 3rd person to another coworker directly behind me. She does this for a few weeks and finally I've had enough. Basically she was saying I'm doing a bad job and I'm sloppy without saying my name. No matter how small of an inconvenience I made for her, she had comments. Usually her outbursts start in the morning when she's grumpy and by the end of the day she's back to normal acting like she's done no wrong. 

I went to HR and management about her and they ended up telling me I shouldn't let people bring me down and I'm disqualified from the new position because I can't handle difficult people.

419,"There's this guy that I got to know online. We became friends and he was a great person at first. I won't go into details into what happened as it's really complicated, but the last time I had contact with him, he spammed called and msged me from 10pm all the way till 10am just because I refused to reply him. I didn't want to ignore him but he was just becoming so unreasonable and wasn't listening to what I was saying. He was also insulting me repeatedly and I just couldn't take it anymore. Replying him wouldnt help at all. 

This happened a few months ago. I don't know why I'm so affected by what happened to be honest. I didn't expect myself to be traumatized. I didn't sleep the whole night when he spammed at me, I was terrified and I was so close to calling the police. I could have blocked him off, yes, but I didn't because my close friend knew him too. At that point of time, I knew if I blocked him off, he would go ape shit on my friend. So I waited till the next morning to warn her before I blocked him.

My close friend knows how much I absolutely detest him. She's seen the screenshots of what he said and did me, and she agrees what he did was wrong. However, when I told her to stop talking to him, she refused. I asked her why and she didn't give me a definite answer. The only possible reason is that she likes him. I gave up convincing and told her to never speak of him in front of me again. I figured she would stop talking to him after a while when she herself experiences how much a bad guy he is

That guy is a total creep. Some side info about him, he's a classic 'nice guy'. Doesn't accept that some girls don't want to date. When he spammed msg me, he threatened to kill himself. He's threatened to find me as well since he knows roughly where I live. 

Recently, I found out that she's still in contact with him and it came as a shock to me. Just now, I learnt that it's possible that she's dating him. She doesn't know that I know about it. 

I feel really betrayed. I just don't understand how she can even talk to him after what he did to me. I get nightmares about him and whenever I hear his name(he has a really common name), my heart just drops and I remember what he did to me. I'm so pissed and scared of him at the same time. 

I understand that I shouldn't control who she wants to be friends with. I don't want to be controlling but the thought of them talking just hurts too much. I'm considering cutting her off but she has been a really good friend. I want to talk to her about it but my feelings overwhelm me and I just cry. What should I do?

The backstory here is that I moved to France to work as an English teacher. This is a pretty popular thing to do on a gap year and that’s exactly why I’m here. Things didn’t start well. I was kicked out of a room is rented in an old lady’s house and so moved into a french student/young workers housing association. After two days I was sleeping on friends couches due to a bedbug infestation that meant I physically couldn’t sleep there. I notified them and nothing was done for four days. A nice lady in the pest control shop told me that since the room I was renting was with an association they had to deal with the problem within 24 hours according to French law. I have no idea how true this is and I can’t find anything about it online. I moved out two weeks later after I found a new place but I only slept there for a total of two nights. 

I paid the money I owed for the total time I had spent there (two weeks and two days) and get out of there as quickly as I could. I got an email a few days ago saying that I still owed money for November. I wasnt able to hand over my keys until a Friday afternoon thanks to my job and I was told that these five days wouldn’t count towards my stay. I emailed back enquiring and apparently I owe money for five nights from November 1st until November 5th. I have sent an email back saying that I will not be paying as I cannot afford it and as I was told that I wouldn’t be paying for these five nights. I’ve had no reply but I was meant to pay by today. I couldn’t make it to the bank due to work commitments and I’m honestly bricking it. I’m behind on rent for my current apartment and I’m just furious that I was charged this amount considering that I’m now seriously out of pocket thanks to their association. I don’t have social security yet so I’m effectively powerless against them and I’m worried this will affect my job. I’m an EU citizen so at least I don’t have to worry about a visa or anything. 

What can I do? Does anyone have any ideas?

437,"Background: I'm 20 and I have my about \~$15k in my personal account (which my parents have access to and see - my money is theirs and vice versa; that's how we have lived as a family). The money is from TAing as an undergrad and from an internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never really bought my parents a gift, or a card, or pretty much anything for Christmas or birthdays or anything, since it wasn't really a thing growing up, and I just never really thought about them needing anything. Looking back, I see all these other kids giving their parents real gifts (however small) and I realize how kinda dumb I was..

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhoo, the thing is my dad is a software developer, and he has the shittiest laptop alive (while he happily bought me an expensive macbook AND surface pro for college, think \~$4k total, without batting an eyelid). His laptop is old, heavy, slow and just recently he took on my old laptop, which isn't that much better. My DAD is using MY old laptop, not the other way around, and I feel terrible. Every time the topic of him buying a new laptop comes up, he mentions how it's money that doesn't need to be spent. He really tries to change the topic, because he will refuse to buy anything &gt; $100 that is luxury for himself, saying that it is money that can go towards our mortgage, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom, while not in dire need of anything, is someone that I spent so much time with growing up (my dad would travel between 2 countries half of the year, so I would see and hang out with her more), and is also someone who I want to make happy for once (we don't even get to talk alot during the semester, we're both so busy).

 

The thing I just realized, is that money I earned wouldn't really count as money that we're ""trying to save for the mortgage"" since I'm sure my dad doesn't even consider it - while the family is all mi casa su casa, I think my parents just want me to save and use it normally. Christmas is coming up, and their birthdays are in April, so I have some time if I want to wait and think. I can't ask because they will instantly say no and I don't even want to deal with that.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to buy my dad a $1500 MacBook, and my mom a $1200 pair of Tiffany earrings (very simple looking, she likes elegant looks). How should I be thinking about this - do it, don't, how, when, why, logistics?

My ex girlfriend and I were together for 3 years. We got married last year in secret. We were in love we always talked about a future together and how we made each other happy etc. We didn’t live together but we were working toward making that move to find a place of our own. 

Last week on Tuesday she broke up with me, the trigger to this break up was that she thinks I was upset that she didn’t come over for thanksgiving, I’ve tried explaining to her that I had no issue with her spending thanksgiving with her family and that I was actually glad that she was with them and getting along with them. This led to her bringing up irrelevant stuff from the past and just not wanting to listen to me. She says I don’t put any effort when it comes to her family but she does with mine and is tired of it. Most of the time she isn’t getting along with her family and she makes it known so I don’t know how I’m supposed to do stuff for them when she’s not good with them half the time. 
She blew up on me and to me it kind of came out of nowhere because we hung out the Saturday and Sunday before the break up and things seemed good. 
Yesterday was my birthday and she texted me to wish me a happy birthday and that even though things are bad between us she will always care for me and that I deserve the best and take care. This just made me want to speak to her and talk it out maybe but I feel that if I ask her if we can speak she will not want to. 
I know what I did was dumb but I was in love and was not thinking straight, ignoring what might go wrong. She has not mentioned anything about divorce yet but I don’t know.

When we were walking he started pulling my bag back which made me fly backwards a bit because I am very light. I told him to stop and walked ahead of him. Tom caught up to me and we talked about video games and stuff. Ben started doing it again when we stopped to look at a statue. I told him to stop again. He then kicked me in the ribs. At this point I lost my shit and punched him in the face but quickly got pulled away by another student. Ben just avoided me for the rest of the trip and I was talking to Tom for the rest of it.

442,"Hello, I am looking for advice on how to try ensuring that my coworkers don't get sick.

I got super sick this morning unexpectedly and just yesterday someone else (his name is J) in another office was shamed by this office manager/my team supervisor (manager and supervisor are the same person, just have multiple roles, her name is K) for initially calling out and so K ended up pushing and shaming J until he ended up caving and coming in for a full day and leaving super late at night.

Now I'm pretty sick and it's only likely to get worse before it gets better. Unfortunately I'm surrounded by people and I don't feel comfortable taking the day off because I did it last week due to diabetic issues and I know I'll face an even more intense shame session from K if I leave. However, I can deal with being sick-- I'm mostly just worried about my coworkers. Any suggestions on how to minimize their chances of also getting sick, other than the obvious of washing my hands and whatnot? 

I work around a number of people who get sick badly when they get sick so I'm worried. Also, for reference: K is very strict about limiting any time away from our cubicles (to go to bathroom or anything) and also wouldn't allow me to work in a different area of the office temporarily.

449,"So this is a long story and I'm going to try to keep it concise because I really have no idea what my best option is here. TLDR at bottom. 

Basically, I'm really upset with my 3 closest friends for hanging out with someone who has treated me terribly in the past. I wouldn't call this person a stalker per se, but she had a weird obsession with me and my partner, and she never missed an opportunity to be shitty to me. I've managed to avoid her completely for almost two years until recently. 

Background: 

Met this girl in college, and she immediately ""fell in love"" with my boyfriend (now my fiance). She would bug him to hang out with her all the time, then would tell people that he and I were on the rocks and that when he dumped me, she was going to start dating him. She would go to his room late at night and constantly flirt with him. My bf got annoyed by her pretty quickly and stopped talking to her, and we didn't break up like she wanted (obviously, as we are still together and planning our wedding) so she took it out on me. 

Besides spreading rumors about my relationship, she also actively prevented me from becoming friends with people in our program (very small and close knit program, only about 30 students, and my 3 closest friends, who I am now having issues with, were also in this program). Any time there was a hangout or social event (literally anything, from study sessions to grabbing coffee to parties), she would tell people that she had asked me to come and I had refused, and gave everyone the impression that I didn't want to be friends with them. She also tried to get me kicked out of a club that I was president of after she lost the nomination.

The whole time she was doing this, she pretended to be my friend. Not a close friend, but she'd stop by my place to say hi, ask after my boyfriend, offer to lend me notes from class, etc. I suspected that she was the reason I never got invited to anything, but she was nice to my face so I couldn't really justify my suspicions.

I also felt like she copied everything I did. Any club I joined, she joined too. I mentioned my career choice and suddenly that was her career choice too. She even told everyone that she was struggling financially and got herself 2 jobs after I had to get a job when my funding didn't cover my tuition (I'm from a low income family and grew up below the poverty line, her parents paid all her expenses and took her on annual trips over spring break). She also asked if she could move into my apartment when I moved out. 

She was also weirdly competitive about my relationship with my bf. Shortly after we moved in together (after 3 years of dating) she dumped her bf of 6 months because he ""wouldn't commit"" and refused to move in with her. She would also ask about milestones so she could compare who got there first.

In senior year, I started becoming closer with my 3 friends, and they told me that they always thought I was busy or not interested in hanging out with them because of the things she told them. We realized that she was excluding me on purpose and she also did some shitty things to my 3 friends (mostly spreading rumors and picking fights) so people started to realize how mean and manipulative she was and started distancing themselves from her. No one wanted to be her friend anymore, but they all politely keep in touch whenever she reached out in order to avoid drama (she's very confrontational and puts on massive guilt trips if she feels wronged).

I managed to cut the mean girl out completely after graduation by moving cities and blocking her everywhere. She still managed to find my fiance on Twitter, which was really creepy and set off some red flags for us. Basically, he started a new job and was required to create a professional twitter account for it, so he set one up with his work email and work phone number, and within 5 minutes of the account being created, she was his first follower. We have no idea how she found the account so fast but we suspect she has a Google alert or something similar set up for his name. He blocked her, obviously.

And that brings us to today. 

It's been 3 years since we finished college, and in that time I've become really close with my 3 friends. We all went through some tough times and really supported each other. 

I moved back to the city where we all went to college about a year ago, and I specifically asked my friends not to tell her. About 6 months ago, my fiance and I bumped into her at a public event. We had recently gotten engaged and I was wearing my ring. I told my fiance that if she saw it, she'd be engaged or single within 6 months, because she was going to start bugging her bf to propose. Sure enough, 3 months later she's single and she gets in touch with my 3 friends and says she dumped him because she ""realized he wasn't husband material"" (which I assume means he refused to put a ring on it). 

Now she's been building back up her friendships with my friends and it's making me so uncomfortable. I avoid going to parties and other social events that she's invited to because she genuinely scares me. In the past she's damaged my social relationships and sabotaged my involvement in extra curriculars, and now I'm afraid that she'll try to go after my career. It's stressing me out and it's damaging my friendships. I thought that after denouncing her and telling me how awful she was (she was shitty to all of us, but I definitely got the worst of it) that they wouldn't want to be friends with her again, especially after I told them that she makes me uncomfortable and that I can't be around her. But ever since her breakup everyone feels sorry for her and is hanging out with her again at the expense of me not being able to hangout with them. 

What should I do?

Do I confront my friends? Bail on them if they keep inviting her and I to the same events? I don't know if I can trust my friends anymore, because one of them (pretty sure I know who) told her where I work despite me specifically saying not to. 

My fiance thinks that I should confront the mean girl and tell her that while I don't want to be friends with her, I do want us to be civil to each other for the sake of oi ur mutual friends. He thinks that right now she's ""winning"" because whenever we're invited to the same event, she ends up going and I don't, so if I confront her then I can regain some control over the situation. I honestly don't want to talk to her because I genuinely believe that she has some kind of personality disorder because of her constant manipulation and lying. She's even described herself as a sociopath. I've talked to more than one therapist about her (yeah, she fucked me up bad) and one of them said that what I was describing sounded like narcissistic personality disorder. 

I've left out a ton of details for the sake of keeping this short, but I have plenty of examples of her being a shit human being to me and to others. I almost feel like this post downplays her behaviour.

TLDR: Mean girl tries to sleep with my bf, actively fucks with my personal relationships, copies everything I do, and is now working her way into my social circle. My friends know all this, but feel sorry for her because she got dumped, so they invite her to stuff, knowing that I won't attend when she's there. ",05Dec2018,1

I love the horse very much, but the family goes over board. Constantly braided mane and tail, dozen of blankets, never ending treats. They spend hours brushing him. They insist I ride him with a blanket on and then get upset when he sweats because ""its unhealthy to sweat in the winter."" (it's not.)

So I decided not to give the college entering exams we have here (though I still can if I want to) and go to a cooking school (that my parents paid for). 

Now, out of my 5 working experiences, I can say that 1,5/5 were good. I just don't know if it's for me. I do like cooking for friends and family but it's a whole different thing as a job, so stressful and I'm a stressful person myself. I decided to take a break, go to a therapist, spend some time doing actually nothing so I could reassess. 

Thing is, I just don't know how to begin. Nothing I can think of catches my interest. I don't have a degree in something else, I have two proficiency diplomas in English (which I really like) but other than that nothing. I know I'm young but I don't feel like I am. Everything is just hard. What am I supposed to do?",05Dec2018,1
465,"I, an 18 year old person, matched with another 18 year old through bumble. Things are going good and we have loads in common, however, we’ve been chatting for a day and I was wondering what’s the best way to ask them out on a date? Otherwise, I’m not sure they’d still have interest if we keep this up, but im also not sure how they’ll react to this.
Any thoughts?",05Dec2018,1
466,"I know this is a weird question but on dates I always have the tendency to go on long story rants about myself after the girl asks me a question and it makes it so by the end of the date, about 60% of the talking was done by me (people tell me it's because of my ADHD, but that's beside the point). I'm trying to figure out a way to get out of that habit, and the most realistic way to do that I believe would be to get the girl to want to talk about herself to the point where she does it more than me. Problem is I'm a dumbass and cant think of good ways to get her to talk about herself for a long time/ strike emotional topics that she can talk about for a long time. Any tips on some things I could bring up that would support an emotional topic that the girl would be able to talk about for a long time? (also side note: I am perfectly fine if a date was 80% the other person talking; I'm an introvert and love listening to people so this approach would actually be beneficial for myself too)",05Dec2018,1

      I can’t focus at all on things that don’t interest me. If I’m in a course that interests me I will get all the homework done in the first couple of weeks and read the whole book. If I’m in a class that doesn’t I will read the same paragraph 4 times and not get anything out of it.
I get distracted from homework all the time and put it off until the last minute. If I don’t have a crazy time crunch I can’t focus.
     My family always makes fun of me because I will often put something in the microwave or make coffee only to completely forget about it. If they tell me to take something with me or if I need to take something to work I have to have a special place to check right before I leave or I will forget it. 
    Finally ( and I had no idea this was applicable) but if I drink coffee consistently, I can focus and get everything done. I knew coffee people but she said if it helps that much it might be an indication.

My question is, how should I go about getting help. School and work are really hard. I would like to avoid the prescription drugs that are commonly associated with ADHD and I don’t want to walk into a doctors and be treated like some idiot that wants to get Adderol.

471,"Whenever my in-laws get together, their focus seems to be on drinking. My father in law is a fall-down alcoholic, my sister in law is a functional alcoholic (as is her daughter) , and my husband has tendencies towards alcoholism. My mother in law and I do not drink. 

When I am around them, it is perfectly clear to me what my husband could become. 

Last night we were at my mother and father-in law's for my husband's birthday, and my sister in law kept trying to encourage my husband to have another vodka (after he had already had two).  I spoke up, and said, ""No,  let's not have another drink, how about some water?"" So, she starts pouring him wine, (as if that is not alcohol). So, as expected by the end of the evening, my father in law got so smashed that he is picking fights and had to be helped to his chair so he didn't fall and my husband is slurring his words. 

I am so sick of drinking and worrying about my husband turning into an alcoholic. He has been told him that if he starts to turn into his father, I am out of the marriage. I will not be like my mother in law, and enable him to continue. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

482,"I say weird because normally we are on the same page in most categories. It’s important to note we (son and I) live with her, in her house. It’s mutually beneficial for all 3 of us. 

Anyway, my mom is usually open-minded about things and has told me in the past that I should raise my son however I want and she’ll back me up. 

The issue is what my son is being taught about religion and holiday traditions. **We are both atheists**. But we still enjoy celebrating Christmas, for sentimental reasons and because it’s a special time for children. We have discussed this too. We justify celebrating Christmas because of its pagan origins with the Solstice, stuff like that. Keeping up spirits in the dark, cold months, you know?

I was trying to figure out where to put some decorations and suggested using the side table in the living room. My mom very quickly and firmly says “no, that’s where the *nativity set* is going.” (She grew up catholic but stopped believing in God at the age of 40, so we have a lot of leftover religious items from then)

I asked what the heck she was talking about and why it was so important that it go up. A long discussion ensued and I was getting pretty frustrated because her reasoning just didn’t add up. Her reason was; so my son wasn’t clueless about the religious aspects associated with Christmas, and would “know what people were talking about” in regards to Baby Jesus. She also implied that me not wanting the nativity set to go up must mean I was hiding religion from him. 

Okay...I’m not against him knowing about Christianity or religion in general. If he was curious about it I would help him learn, and if he were to one day convert, so be it, that’s his choice. My mom *knows* my philosophy. Or so I thought?

I tried to make my case but she doesn’t listen. Ultimately it’s her house and she can decorate how she wants but... I feel like suddenly she’s gone behind my back and now I’m cornered, and apparently I no longer have a say in what my son is exposed to? 

It wouldn’t be a big deal if she just said she wanted it up for her own religious sentiments. But she was adamant that this was about my son and how he needs to know about Baby Jesus (when she claims to not even believe!!)

Is there another way I can stand my ground about how he’s raised or is this just something I need to let go. She’s getting up there in years so I wouldn’t write off dementia, this isn’t the first time she’s been inconsistent with her values. ",05Dec2018,1

486,"Don't really have a problem with people smoking, obviously unhealthy, but let people do their own thing ya know. I've spent a lot of time with my friends while they are smoking outside, BSing while I stand upwind. 

I also have mild anxiety, but I have had no problem plenty of times approaching people like roommates to discuss issues I'm having with them so we can talk it out. 

Me and my wife, 34 weeks pregnant, bought a condo 6 months ago. Didn't notice the smoking neighbors much at first, if at all. Don't really know them, said hello 2 or 3 times. Seemed perfectly decent, at least 3 of the about 9 people living there. I don't like to be judgmental, and I hate to use the word, but for the sake of brevity they did seem ""trashy."" Their back patio, separated from ours by a 5 foot tall brick wall, is an absolute trash heap. That's fine, I don't like looking at it, so I don't, problem solved. The smoking is really getting to me though. If we have a window open we can smell it like crazy. Annoying for sure, but I've dealt with that in the past, I really don't like to tell people what to do on their own property. Now I have a pregnant wife with a kid coming very soon. The smell is whatever it may be, but the health risks are what really bother me.

I would love to just go ask them to be careful about where their smoke is drifting, but I don't think that would be enough to keep it away from our window, which is only a few inches from the brick wall that separates us. I would have to ask them to smoke somewhere else, and I know how hard that can be on a smokers routine. 

I have had difficult conversations with people in the past, sometimes keeping my temper sometimes not, but I absolutely do not want to confront them about it face to face, which is killing my ego a bit, but I'll explain. At least once a week we hear shouting matches, tons of cussing, sometimes sound of something breaking coming from them. My wife was even outside once and she thought they started shouting at her, but it turns out someone was behind her. They just seem really aggressive any time I've heard them talk more than our simple hello. I did a random google search on their address with last name. Multiple arrests from different people living there ranging from simple drug felony's and theft to assault. One of the guys also seems to have a mental disorder. I worked in a home for people with special needs for about 3 years, seems a little close to schizophrenia.

I'm a pretty big dude, 270 lbs and an active competitive powerlifter. My wife is a tiny human. I'm nervous about poking the hornets nest while we are amicable towards each other and then them having their aggression pointed our way. I'm not always home. I'd be nervous about my wife being home alone and needed to go grab something from her car, them perhaps being very drunk, being aggressive towards her. Like I said, lots of friends who smoke, immediate family who smokes, some of the most decent people I've met. I just get a really bad vibe from them.

I contacted the HOA about a month ago just to see what their policy on smoking on the back patios was. As expected it is prohibited, but they asked I talk to my neighbors first. I don't know if I'm just being  a coward in this situation or whether following my gut instinct is the right thing to do. I hate the thought of coming off passive aggressive, them receiving a warning in the mail before they ever had a chance to stop. People deserve a face to face conversation about stuff like that first I feel. But I'm nervous with a wife and a new baby next door to people I feel very uncomfortable about.

TLDR; Neighbors with aggressive tendencies smoke, approach them first, benefit of the doubt, or HOA. ",05Dec2018,1
487,"Long post because i want to add context. TLDR At the bottom.

I have just started a temp job, and I absolutely love the work, I feel like its the right step towards a new career. I'm only on my first propper 2nd week and the contract is up until December until they employ someone else. They have already suggested that I apply for it when it becomes available,.

I feel like I have hit the ground running I have suggested a ton of things to make life easier for them (they were using practises that were outdated) and im genuinely interested in the job and just want to thrive.

As of Monday they have asked me to do some data input on an important spreadsheet and all the data has to be 100% accurate (if it's not then the whole department will suffer and funding will be cut off).

today I was left to do some of it on my own, there was only me and the person who is training me in the office as everyone was out for the morning doing an event.the phone was ringing so I was busy taking messages whilst I was also inputting data onto said spreadsheet.

I couldn't find certain data so I left the form blank in some fields and moved on to the next file because my trainer was also busy taking calls and getting on with her own work. I had lunch and had come back and my trainer had checked my work for any errors I had made.

She had noticed that I didn't fill in all the fields so she sent me an email explaining what I needed to do to fix it, half an hour later my boss called me to one side and told me my trainer had informed her that I haven't filled in the spreadsheet properly and asked me to explain myself (I felt like I was being told off) and then reminded me how important this spreadsheet was.

What I'm asking is, is this a potential toxic work environment? I feel like they are putting a lot of responsibility on me as I'm only temping there and I'm still very new to the company. Not only that I feel like I got stabbed in the back for an honest mistake that I had the intention to bring forward when things had calmed down.

How would people proceed forward with this?

Tldr: got a temp job 2 weeks a go and got tasked with inputting data into a spreadsheet that can impact funding for the department I'm in, couldn't find the info to input so moved on to the next task, trainer emailed the boss about the issue which resulted her pulling me to one side to have stern words with me.",05Dec2018,1

490,"About a month ago I noticed a friend had several long cuts down one arm and I asked him how he got them. He told me that he tripped and scraped his arm on a badminton net pole and I didn’t think too much of it because the cuts were shallow, parallel, he plays several hours nearly every day and accidents happen. 

However, the cuts were still there several weeks later which I asked him about again and he told me something along the lines of ‘don’t worry about it.’ He avoided giving me a straight answer which of course made me worry, but he got really irritated when I pressed the issue so I dropped it. 

Yesterday I noticed there were 2 new cuts on the same arm. I don’t believe they could have been caused by another accident with a net pole because one runs down the length of his forearm and the other intersects. 

Nothing in his behavior suggests that anything’s wrong. He’s cheerful, active and social. The only time he seemed moody was one day after his mother yelled at him because he spent too much time away from home and not with his family and she thought he was drinking and partying but he’s spent most of that time with another girl. 

He’s a college freshman so maybe school is getting to him, but he signed up for almost twice as many credits next semester which I don’t think he would do if the coursework was too much. He works as a barista so I don’t think he could’ve gotten them due to a work hazard. 

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would cause him to cut. He doesn’t try to hide them with long sleeves or anything, but the fact that he avoids giving me an answer as to how he got them and gets irritated when I ask has me worried.

I’ve known him for a long time and he tends to romanticize things like MPD and depression so maybe he thinks cutting is cool in some way? 

He also does stuff like taking both hands off the wheel while on the freeway to do something which could be self destructive behavior or just him being an idiot or trying to impress me.

496,"About a month ago I broke up with my girlfriend. Initially i was living down at college and everything was great but after some crap happened I had to come back home, which is about 3 1/2 hours away. We decided to do a long distance relationship. We'd come visit each other whenever possible, but that only lasted about 2 months. She became very distant. I tried speaking with her about it to no avail. I felt increasingly alienated by it. Eventually we talked about it and I suggested it might be better if we broke it off. She expressed that she was relived as the relationship was causing her anxiety.

Fast forward to about 3 days ago. She texts me asking how things are going. She says she misses me and that I was her best friend and her soul mate. I, being lonely and missing her, text her back and reciprocate her feelings. She tells me multiple times that she wants to get back together. I suggest that we take it slowly and be more open with each other. 

Since then she's been saying things like I hurt her really badly, that she isn't sure if she wants to get back together, and that she wants to find herself. This feels almost like a Stark contrast to what she was saying when she initially texted me.

I maxed out on every seizure med they could give me and I was still having them all the time. Lost my job and girlfriend. Hit some bad depression but instead of the suicidal thoughts that came to mind I talked my my doctor about getting the tumor removed. It was on the part of your brain that holds memories. I did a test where they would numb half my brain and ask me questions then numb the other half. That was really shitty. After the test my doc told me that I should do the surgery. So 6 months ago I did it. It hurt a lot. Throwing up in bed shaking from the pain. I'm 27 and I needed my mom to give me a bath because I couldn't shower. Felt degrading but I did it. Kept my boxers on. After 2 months my doctor told me to start getting off my pills by dropping half a pill a week. I completely stopped one pill last Wednesday and since that pill has been gone I've been getting the weirdest feelings. Reminds me of the feeling I'd have before a seizure. I got a letter in the mail saying that my disability health insurance was canceled. So I have no insurance to go talk to the doctor but I'm worried my seizures are back. I'm not dropping my pills anymore until I figure this all out. I just don't know what to do from here. All of my family and friends are so excited for me to be done with this stuff and I can't bring myself to talk about it with them. ,05Dec2018,1
502,"I make decent money, have a job lined up where i'm moving but don't have a lot of savings due to an emergency medical bill that happened recently. I need advice on how to furnish my first place cheap, where I can find quality items (like a couch and table, beds, end tables, etc) that wont break my bank. Money really isn't an issue, but i'm pretty frugal and I just hoped someone would have some advice for where to get good stuff that isn't torn up that isn't over the top expensive.

503,"I am sorry if this doesn't make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

So, when I was a little child, my parents got divorced and I got to stay with my father which then married my now stepmother, my stepmother understands my mother's situation and respects her and my father always says that, ""She is your mother after all, you have to love her at any cost."" but my mother isn't that friendly towards neither of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I got a call from one of my aunts, she asked about how life was and other things, and informed me that my mother has went mad, she told me that my mother was staying with her parents and had developed trust issues, she wouldn't answer calls, would lock herself in a room when you tried to visit her, you know how it goes. She also gave me my grandmother's stationary telephone number.

&amp;#x200B;

I also talked with two of my cousins, one of them told me the same story my aunt told me with a few additions, like how they were trying to get my mother to see a doctor which she refused to, how my cousin decided to visit her and she wouldn't come out of her room, and I told her my guess on why she might be like this, my exact words:

""She came to visit me once, we walked around the city, sat on a bench and watched the sea for a wee bit, then got up and walked some more, while we were walking she started to talk about religion and politics, I argued with her for a bit which got worse and worse, so I couldn't hold myself and decided to go home, walked about fifty meters away from my mother for a few kilometers, didn't listen nor talk to her. Once I was about to enter my apartment, I told her that from this day on, if she doesn't try to do something about her life, you know, get a job, marry a man who loves her, I wouldn't talk to her, which I didn't for about a year, didn't answer her calls, didn't want to see her.""

&amp;#x200B;

I know this was wrong of me to say and do, but I did it and you know, I regret my decisions but you can't change the past.

&amp;#x200B;

So, you remember how my cousin told me to call my grandmother's number, I did, talked with my grandmother for a bit, she said that before she died, she wanted to see me, which really touched my feelings, after we were done talking I asked if I could talk with my mother and apologise to her for what I have done, from what I heard on the phone, she went ahead and asked my mother that I wanted to talk with her, but she didn't want to, so I heard some footsteps getting louder and louder and thought that my grandmother was going to say that she didn't want to talk with me, but instead it was my mother who was cursing at me (her curses were like a child's, she was too innocent to curse), I didn't say a word, but heard my grandmother yelling and cursing at her from the background that I was her grandchild and she should be sacrificing herself for me (may not make sense, it is like an idiom in our language) this went on for a few seconds until my mother presumably broke the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Help me, friends.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

I harshly told her that she should do something about her life, or I wouldn't talk to her ever, which I didn't for about a year, I regret my decisions and want to apologise to her but she doesn't want to hear what I have to say.

505," 

I had to create a new account to get some advice. He has my other reddit name and I was afraid he would see me post here.

some background info on Johnny

He is a 20 something year old male shut in that lives with his parents on disability because of a head injury he recieved when he was younger. He lives states away from me.

This all started about 4 years ago. I was a livestreamer on a pretty popular streaming site. That is where I met him we will call him Johnny.

Johnny would come into my livestreams every single day. I thought to myself. No big deal. He likes to chill chat and hang out thats fine. He wound up getting the mod tag he was there so much and friendly I felt like he would do a good job.

I started to notice that anytime someone would even get a little out of turn and say something even joking around towards me he would ban them, say nasty things about them blah blah blah. I wound up taking his tag because he was causing such insane drama when I was livestreaming for fun and as a hobby it was turning more into a miserable nightmare.

After I took his tag and explained and I just want to do this to have a good time he swore he understood apologized and said he would never do it again. Great I thought case closed. Oh, how wrong I was. He continued to come into every single one of my streams and just talk negativly about the other people in my room and try to stir drama. I got so tired of him doing it I banned him. That was prob the worst thing I could have ever done. It sent him into a frenzy it got to the point where he would message anyone and everyone associated with me and have them pass messages to me. He would do this unrelentlessly to where I lost a lot of friends because of him. People would message me and say ""You better unblock this F'n kid, I can't deal with his non stop messaging."" I felt so bad for the people he was messaging and I ublocked him. I figured this way he wouldn't bother them anymore. The second I unblocked him he messaged me as if he was sitting there just watching and waiting for it. ""He messaged me told me he was so so sorry that he was just going through a really rough time and that he shouldn't have been acting that way.

I told him he was acting like psycho and he needs to learn to relax and never ever message people like that again. I continued to do my streams giving him minimal attention when he would come in and just tried to mentally block him. That seemed to work best for a least a few months.

When I had decided that I was going to take a break from streaming for a week to do family stuff with my husband, he wound up getting a hold of somone who knew me in real life got my husbands work number and called my husband because he was worried something happened to me. He told my husband that I am usually online and that my husband should go home to check if I was okay. My husband of course knew I was fine and just taking a break but when he came home he said to me, I really think maybe you should just move on from this streaming stuff and we should talk to the police seems like this guy is just a little to whacked out. I agreed. I never really felt like I was in danger. One because he is a shut in and two because we are states apart. My husband and I went to the police department and spoke to an officer and the officer basically told us since he has not done anything there is nothing they can do. They said just ignore him as much as I can. Needless to say I decided to leave streaming and just sort of vanish. I vanished from all my freinds, subs, followers everything.

Everything was going good until about 9 months ago. After a while I sort of started to miss livestreaming, I missed the social interaction with people and such. So I started a channel on youtube under a completely different name and didn't even put my face on camera just my voice. It was just a vlog where I could talk about Makeup, clothes that sort of thing. My was not very big prob had about 110 subs in total. It was more than enough for me to have a bit of social interaction and talk about things I like. One day on facebook I started getting messages from some of my old subs telling me that Johnny has been messaging them every single day to help him find me. That he misses me, and he just wants to talk to me and hang out. A few of them told me that they themselves had blocked him because he was just annoying. Others scolded me because he is a shut in with no life or friends and said that I was being way to uptight about him and I should really take his feelings into consideration. I again felt bad for him and them but stuck to my guns. I was happy doing what I was doing and just didn't respond to their messages.

I continued with my youtube channel and then I started to get strange comments from names I did not know. One message would be something a long the lines of ""Is this you?"" another would say ""I Know you prob don't want to hear from me but I am someone from your past."" That is when I knew he found me. He wound up following me on twitter that I had linked to my youtube page and he messaged me. He said ""Hey, Listen I had to go to the mental hospital and all I could think about was how I was such a horrible person to you. I talked to my doctors about the situation and they told me I need to make things right with you."" I wrote back and said ""Johnny, I am sorry you were unwell and had to go to the mental hospital but I am sort of doing my own thing now I wished him luck. He then replied and I quote. "" I am the turd you can't flush. I am your bestfriend."" ""I am always going to be there for you no matter what."" At this point he started following my followers on twitter and some of these people were subbed to my youtube channel and I was afraid he would start messaging them. So I just decided if I would not block him and humor him he wouldn't bother anyone else.

Its just really hard because every single time I comment on someones twitter he has to comment to. Everytime I make a reddit post on my other account he comments, anytime I post a video he comments Everytime I post a twitter status he has to comment. I have been trying so hard to just keep him at an arms length not really pay attention to him because I feel bad that if I block or delete he will just torture other people. I mean this stalking is it not? I mean I almost feel bad saying that because there are people that are being stalked by people in real life that are in way scarier situations than myself. I don't know I guess I just needed to talk to some people that maybe had similar experiences or that can just sort of give suggestions if any. Thank you for reading this novel.",05Dec2018,1

The interview I spent so many hours getting prepared for was just for show and only needed as a check mark.

508,"I'll try to keep this as simple as possible. There's this girl I went on one date with. We made out and I regret that because I already felt like it wasn't working out but she was getting really close to my face and it was just implied and I didn't want to say no. I texted her the next day that I don't really know what I want and that I'm very confused, that I go to tons of therapy and read a lot to try to figure myself out but I'm not ready for dating. At the time I wrote that it was true, after a month she texted me and asked to hang out as friends but she constantly drops hints that she wants to be more than friends. We hang out sometimes and she asked if i see any future in us and I said probably not but we can be friends and cuddle if you want to. I really like cuddling and her and I are both very lonely. I've been in relationships with women before but I mostly date men. I'm getting a better idea of what I want out of a relationship and it's probably men and with a specific personality and hopefully tall too if I'm lucky. She doesn't have the personality or looks that I'm looking for, if she had the personality I don't think I'd care very much about the looks but I don't want to tell her this and have her act some way that seems contrary to how she normally acts. I have been dating again and as a result a lot of my free time is taken up by that. I don't want to tell her I'm dating because I think it might make her feel worse but I'm wondering if she might understand her and I aren't going to be a couple. I have been really busy lately but I also don't feel like hanging out with her a lot of the time because I feel bad about the whole situation. I've told her a few times we're just friends and that's it but it still feels like she holds out hope. I'm really confused as to what I should do",05Dec2018,1
509,"So a few weeks ago my partner was away and I had eaten a dodgy curry so I was dying at 3am. Whilst I'm on the toilet trying to remain alive I noticed this small twitch streamer she likes was steaming so I go and time in to take my mind of stuff. 

(As a mention; me and my partner have been hitting a bit of difficult patch that I thought we were seeing the end of. I'm very busy and stressed quite slot and I suppose I'm not able to be the most exciting boyfriend and quite a lot of the time I'm working or sitting with her and our cats. And her ex has been in the picture messaging her and shit)

So anyway the guy was chatting with the 10 people who watches his shit, including my partner. (I'm viewing this without a twitch account) basically they all chat for a good 2 hours about sex and all that, implying as well.my partner his snapchatting him provocative photos, plus I can see her messaging stuff like how she would be crazy in bed with him and talking about his dick.

Needless to say it's a bit fucked up. So I tell her I'm dying and I'll start watching her twitch friend, and meanwhile I can see him looking at his phone since she's obviously saying stop. I come in and someone asks of he's going to bang my partner and up until now he has been playing along but he immediately.mentions she has a boyfriend. 

It's been few weeks , she's still watching him and I still sit anonymously occasionally watching the stream and it's still most of the time.involving the odd bit of sexual frustration and she's always waiting for me to fall asleep so she can Snapchat him. 

It's fucked and I'm so stressed, I've probably not made much sense. It doesn't really bother me she's pretty much cheating on me in a way, it's the fact it's been implied she feels she can talk to him about anything and a lot of things (especially sex stuff,) are the things I desperately want to talk more about.

514,"Sometimes I (18f) wonder if I have body dysmorphia because of the way I pick apart my appearance. I do my makeup every day, even if I’m not going anywhere. I feel guilty for eating nearly anything. I posted to r/rateme and r/amiugly and the majority said I was around a 6-8, with a handful saying I was below that. Although 6-8 isn’t bad I hate it because it’s not a 10. I want to be one of those people who are astonishingly good looking and will know they’re always the best looking person in the room, and I’m not, which kills me. 

I’m quite an awkward, uncool person, with no hobbies or talents, so looks are all I have to rely on. I could develop some but really pretty people don’t need any, because people will flock to them anyway. I know looks aren’t everything, and beauty fades, but firstly, I have nearly nothing interesting below the surface, and secondly, that just sounds like what ugly people like me say to make themselves feel better. 

Recently my shallowness has extended to other people. I’m seeing a guy I met from tinder who clearly only wants me as a booty call. The only time he asks to spend time together is for sex, and he doesn’t even hold my hand or wrap his arm around my shoulder in public. He is totally one sided in the bedroom, and after we’re done we just sit there awkwardly in silence. 

But despite all this I’m obsessed with him. I check his Instagram followers every day. Sometimes he follows new girls in our city that he could have only met through tinder (he doesn’t really socialize). We met 4 months ago but he’s probably still using it because I’m not good enough for him. I know he’s a dick, but I tolerate it because he’s hot, tall, and muscular, and I can’t meet guys in real life. Guys never approach me. I can’t find anyone else, much less anyone better looking. I’ve been single all my life and a 10/10 finally showed me attention, so of course I have to put up with him. 

Part of it is because I used to be bullied about my appearance as a child, so now I’m hyper aware of it. I’m also black, so I’m far from the blonde haired blue eyed girls that everyone loves. But I tolerate bullshit from a guy just because he’s good looking. My first sexual experience was sexual assault, and he was the first person I chose to be with after that, so he is always a little special to me. But I would have dismissed him a long time ago if he were average looking, because I’m shallow. Everyone else is judging me based on looks, so I feel like I have to judge myself. How can I stop being shallow before it gets even worse?",05Dec2018,1
515,"&gt;be 26. Have only ever dabbled with marijuana and am interested in hallucinogens. 
&gt;boyfriend is 21. He has dabbled with various drugs since college. He has been completely open with me pertaining to what he has tried. Though I am not particularly experimental, I can understand the curiosities of others. As of right now, he does not have any sort of drug problem.
&gt;One drug in particular my boyfriend has done in the past is coke. This is the one that concerns me, as he admitted that he had gotten to the point where he was doing it so much that he realized he may have been developing a problem (this was before we were dating, and we've been dating for 4 months). 
&gt;He hasn't done it since we started dating, for various reasons--he knows that it makes me uncomfortable when he does it, and he knows I have zero interest in trying it; he knows that it's addictive and expensive and he straight doesn't have money to be spending on that shit; and he knows that he could/almost did develope a problem from it, and I think he respects that.
&gt;We mutually agreed that him fucking with coke is probably not a good idea (he informed me that he knows coke isn't necessarily something he should be fucking with, and he explicitly told me it was his choice to stop, and it's not me forcing him). He seems completely on board with abstaining.
&gt;the rub: his friends/roommates indulge in coke every now and then (his one friend in particular). So far my boyfriend has denied all offers, as far as I know (even one time when he thought I was drunk and asleep in the other room, and not low key eavesdropping). However, I can't shake the feeling that he would want nothing more than to say yes sometimes.

Questions/concerns
&gt;I'm afraid his friends are going to talk him into taking a bump at some point when I'm not around. I'm afraid of the reprocussions a breech in trust like that may have in our relationship. My boyfriend doesn't seem like the type to lie about things like that--I honestly believe he would tell me if he did coke, which means I would have to deal with it. I consider this a distinct possibility because, at the end of the day, 21-year-olds will be 21-year-olds. I don't know what I would do, honestly. The idea of him doing that shit actually hurts my heart. 
&gt;I'm afraid he's going to wind up lowkey resenting me for ""stopping him from having fun"" or some such nonsense. I hope this wont happen because he knew fullwell before we started dating that I'm not cool with coke. He chose me regardless.
&gt;I'm afraid I'm the one being uptight and unreasonable. So what if he ends up taking a bump or something? At the end of the day, is it really that big of a deal if he doesn't develope a habit? My boundaries around the subject are super hazy because it seems to me that coke gets a worse rep than it may deserve (if done in moderation). This is the first time in my life I've ever been exposed to something like this and I don't really know what to make of it. To be honest, the tiniest part of me wants to try it, just to understand it. However,I know how addictive and dangerous it can be and my literal soul is screaming at me that I don't have the willpower to try something like that, and so I know I wont. I know coke wouldn't be good for me, but does that mean a little bit is honestly bad for everyone? Is there such a thing as a little bit? Thoughts?  
&gt;I'm honestly afraid he's going to dump me because I'm not ""cool enough"". On a scale of 1-10, how fucking pathetic am I? 
&gt;He loved it when he use to do it. I almost feel like I should expect him to start doing it again, seeing as it's regularly made available to him. That's how it works, right? 

I love my boyfriend, and everything is really great between us. I'm so worried that this is going to be the thing that spoils everything. I worry for him. I worry for myself. I can't stop thinking about this. I don't know how to deal and I don't know what to do. The worst part of it all is that my poor boyfriend hasn't done anything to violate my trust, and I feel a little evil for expecting him to crumble. I feel like a wet blanket, but I also feel like I should do my best to protect him, and I'm so in love with him and I'm so afraid he's going to hurt me. Part of me just wants to beat him to the punch and end it before anything happens.

This is killing me. Please, I really need advice.

519,"I have a really hard time making friends and being assertive in a conversation. I especially have a hard time talking to girls, like goddamn i cringe on myself when thinking about my interactions with girls. I can start a conversation but to keep it going is a death sentence to me. It's impossible, it's like I lose all my confidence I have while being with my friends and also words to say about anything. 

How do I keep a conversation with someone and also how do I become more confident (if there is some kind of trick i don't know, something.) 

Here's some background.

I feel like this antisocial attitude stems from my lack of socialization after my 10th year, I was social during the ages 7-10, But after my dad who got back from his travel outside of my country (My dad and mother divorced and it was a very painful divorce for me as my father almost ended up killing himself, but  instead he began traveling abroad and working abroad while only talking to us through Skype.) I began isolation, he thought us very questionable stuff like for example that being a homosexual is the worst thing you can be as a man, he also heavily burdened us (my brothers and I) with him needing to meet us, he would berate us if we wouldn't meet him and had other things to do and indirectly guilt us into meeting him, it was very stressful for me. 

Because i saw how much my father suffered during the divorce and just wanted to make him happy and I followed everything he said, he would send me emails (secretly) which were between him and my mother regarding us and telling me how unfair she was and how she is keeping us from meeting him (while in reality we were scared of saying no to meeting him, because everytime we did he would start crying and telling us how we didn't love him anymore and how he is nothing to us anymore because we rejected him) and I felt like I was disrespectful when i rejected and couldn't meet him like I was in the wrong. And I would start to believe him, I believed him about the stuff he told me about my mother, I believed him when it came to his belief that it was my mother's fault that we didn't meet. I believed him about the fact that being a homosexual is a shame to the whole family and manhood (He isn't religious, quite to the contrary, he is a conservative atheist who was a former communist and participated in many rallies during his teens) 

I began to sink into YouTube and Gaming, I stopped going to football, something which I loved. I gained weight, I stopped inviting friends over and only talked to them in school. I watched porn at age 10 and not the normal stuff, really bad stuff. I feel like my parents did a horrible job at parenting, my mother is too calm and quiet and doesn't restrict us at all (hence why I could access porn websites when I was 10 years old) my father guilt tripped me for a long time and made me depressed and foisted huge amounts of responsibility on me, (Forcing me too be a mediator between him and my mother and my brothers) so while my brothers were busy being children I would be depressed and stressed. 

After a while of YouTube and this I reached the zenith of isolation, out of my own accord i began watching videos relating to Islamic theology and the Quran, I stopped eating pork and became a semi-muslim in secret, I had virtually no common ground with my brothers, we would constantly fight and hit eachother (because they were children who were innocent and played things like Minecraft while I tried to keep up and be apart of my brothers group of interests) They aggrevated me and and made me angry and I would cry if I became too angry. It was horrible. At age 11 I had the viewpoint that homosexuals are satanic and sinful and at school i would publicly say this shit. I was nonetheless ousted and kept further isolated while being convinced that I had friends while they were laughing at the ridiculousness. (I must mention that I moved schools during my years of being a semi-muslim and at the new one I had no real friends) 

And then out of the blue, i don't remember the day I don't remember the time or season, I stopped believing in Islam. And became a skeptic. I took a long look at myself and realized, what the fuck am i doing. What am i. I started being active with the skeptic community and evolutionary scientists like Richard Dawkins and others who debated creationist's. I shortly then after switched schools AGAIN and began a new school life. 

I know this sounds outright unbelievable or fake and that I am just trolling or something, but this was me, from age 10. I studied Islam, watched porn while 10 years old, was foisted on and burdened with so much responsibility for a 10-11 year old and on top of that couldn't act normally with my own family. Couldn't communicate with my own brothers.

Today it's much better, but that's not thanks to my mother or father, that because i snapped out of this. I am still dependent on the internet and my phone. I still isolate myself, but not to the degree I did before. I no longer hate homosexuals. I still go to school and I perform well and study at a high level. My mother and father are very loving but they have their bad sides which fucked me up immensely during my childhood. 

My question is how can i increase my confidence and social ability, I want to be able to invite people over again, talk to girl without weirding her out with quietness and weird responses. How do I fix myself?

524,"so, I feel like a shitty person. I hate myself. 
This is my first proper time talking to boys I guess and I genuinely didn’t know about the whole “talking phase” thing. I guess I knew OF IT?? but was oblivious. 

I’ve been talking to a guy long distance (he lives in a different country) and we’ve been talking about 3 and a half months. I assumed that because he’s so good looking, funny, smart etc that he obviously wouldn’t want anything more than a bit of fun with me. I didn’t think he would think of me as anything other than a?? long distance?? nude sender?? I DONT KNOW. we talk though, every night sometimes til 5am. We talk about everything and anything. We say i love you but i thought it was a joke? BUT I REALLY DO LIKE HIM?? this sounds so stupid and embarrassing. 

but he’s coming to meet family down here in two weeks, and we will be meeting as I live nearby. It didn’t hit me til he started hitting me up when he was sad/needed someone to talk to that I realised he trusts me a lot. like he really seems to treat me as if we are together? Which I absolutely love. But I was oblivious to the fact that maybe he likes me and sees me as a potential girlfriend. I assumed that because I thought he’s way too out of my league that I should try and move on a bit? and lessen the hurt of him rejecting me by talking to another guy. I did nothing but flirt and send a couple pics to the other guy. 

And I feel disgusted with myself. I’ve kinda been doing immature things recently and it’s my first time properly talking to guys? for the first time? And I feel stupid. 

I feel terrible. Again, I could be overthinking this. What if I tell my friend that I’ve talked to another guy at the same time and he turns around and is like?? okay I don’t care? Which is a possibility but I can’t help but notice now how much this guy could like me. 

I truly am in awe of this guy and being his potential girlfriend is my dream. I never even thought he might like me like that. He might not. But I feel guilty. 

Have I cheated? Can you cheat in the “talking stage”? would the guy care? could possibly any men out there tell me how they would feel if a girl told them they had sent pics to another dude while talking to them too. 

I feel horrible. I hate myself and feel guilty. I never thought I would be this kind of person. Hurting this guy would be too much so idk if I can tell him. Help.

527,"So me and my boyfriend have been together for nearly 10 months and we got on like a house on fire when we first met. He is a very loving guy and worships the ground I walk on. 

More recently I’ve been feeling somewhat unhappy or not right as I miss spending a night to myself at the weekend. Basically I miss my old life of being able to do what I wanted when I wanted. Obviously I want to be with him but I feel I need more of a balance in my life. He loves spending every moment of free time with me at the weekend which is very sweet but it does become somewhat tiring after a while. I miss spending one night doing what I want, watching what I want on tv, scrolling aimlessly through Facebook/Twitter, watching YouTube videos and if I need to go get something from the shop I can go without making sure he wants to go with me or making some kind of plan with him to make the trip. 

I feel I’m getting to the stage where I might snap at times with silly things and it’s starting to grind me down. I feel like I’m losing who I once was. I used to love making art or making music but I don’t have the time at the weekend as I’m always at his house or he’s at mine and I have to entertain in some way. 

I really want to discuss this with him and work out spending one day and night together at the weekend to get the most out of it but also have a night to myself to pamper or girly chat with my mum or do something with my sisters. I fear he will say that I have time during the week but I work 9-5 and the time I get after work is very limited and of course I’m always shattered after what feels like a long day so this time I feel is not quality time. Am I wrong here? Am I being unfair? I really love him and don’t want to lose him but I fear this will be what breaks us apart.

They also said that a friend of the accuser vouched for them and said they ""saw me pulling my pants up"" I simply denied the allegations and stated that Ive never had any relationship with that person and never had sex with them. The detectives after they released me tried to scare me into sumbission by saying ""we know your lying, tell us the truth and it will be better for you. It will go to court.""

I know people will tell me to terminate the friendship, but this is not possible as we have group projects to work on. I can't escape for now. 

So this person constantly makes remarks about my past mistakes and targets my weaknesses. I'm trying to ignore this but it's really triggering my anxiety. They accuse me of things that haven't happened, they twist things and manipulate me into doing things for them. They get angry when I grab food in the college canteen without then, or when I don't sit with them in class. They got angry when I met up with a friend recently for lunch instead of going to lunch with them. I feel like they're very controlling. I always help them with college work as I don't mind at all yet if I ask what room our next class in I get attitude and made feel stupid for not knowing the answer. 

I consider myself a kind person, as much as I try to ignore their messages or their ask for help I always give in.  I do stick up for myself by calling them out on the comments they make, however then I get accused of ""creating drama"" over nothing and starting a fight.

537,"Recently, my father pulled me, my brother, and sister all in his room to tell us something our mother did recently that bothered him. He said that when she was dropping him off at work (his car is in the shop) she told him that while she went to go visit her sister and she knocked on her door, her boyfriend came up to the door with a hard on. My mother proceeded to still walk in, and her sister was wearing lingerie. They were in the living room. Her sister told her, “Wow, you really know how to bomb a good time.” My mother popped up over her house unannounced, which is why this happened. My mother was bothered about it, so she told my Dad. Our Dad told us at first he didn’t really think about it, but then he thought about it some more and got bothered. He told his coworkers about it, and they told him that what our mom did was not right.

My Dad was saying all types of things like, “I can’t believe your mother would do something foul like this. If this is how it’s going to be, she is going to have to move on. What your aunt’s boyfriend did was f&amp;cked up.” My brother said, “She should’ve been like, oh I came at a bad time, I’ll see you guys later. She should not have proceeded to walk in.” My brother and father both said, “I do not want to see our aunt’s boyfriend again after doing some disrespectful s&amp;it like that.” My brother said, “I’m going to have some words with our mom.” My sister and I just remained silent.

When my mother came in for work that night, my father did not come to see her in like he usually does. The next day, my mother and I was at home. My brother called her and began to curse her out and say things like “That was some f&amp;cked up s&amp;it you did the other night. You think that s&amp;it was okay? Acting like a h&amp;e.” My mother got a little emotional and had to check him and say, “Hey! This is your mother you’re speaking to.” My father called her and had some words with her. She began crying and told him, “I made a mistake. However, I told you this because it did bother me and I confided in you. I don’t like how you went behind my back and told our kids this. I don’t appreciate my son calling me and speaking to me the way he did. I don’t care about my sister’s boyfriend, I went to go visit my sister at a bad time.”

To see my mother get so emotional was hard to see. I told her, “I just think from now on, if you want to visit her or anyone, you need to call beforehand because situations like this will happen. And you also could’ve been like oh I came at a bad time, I’ll see you guys another time.” My mother agreed. She told me that her sister was literally right there speaking to her as she walked in, which is why she proceeded to walk in.

I don’t think my mother wants my aunt’s boyfriend, I just think she made a mistake. I think all involved were in the wrong. I don’t think my Dad handled it appropriately. I don’t think he should’ve told us about it or his coworkers. If it really bothered him, he should’ve talked to our mother in private. I definitely think my aunt’s boyfriend was wrong because who answers the door with a hard on in the first place? My brother calling and talking to our mother the way he did was inappropriate.

540,"Hi everyone, using a throwaway. A bit of a backstory, I am an Asian male who has a girlfriend (also Asian). I had met her through the church (Catholic) that I attend every Sunday. 

My gf's work friends (all girls) had invited my gf to go out last Friday night to a gay bar in her town. It was my gf’s first time going to a gay bar and she told me to come with her, but I was hesitant at first since I didn't want to bother a girl's night out. I ended up going with her, and we both had a really good time together, dancing, meeting her friends etc. 

However, during this time I had a moment where I didn't realize the huge mistake I had made only until too late. In one moment where I wanted to be funny, I ended up dancing goofily next to a male stripper (wasn’t facing him just sort of next to him). I didn’t do anything crazy like grinding on him or taking off my clothes to join him, just simply dancing in a goofy way to be funny to my gf and her friends. My gf ended up recording this moment and posted it on her Instagram story. She has a lot of followers, so many of her friends and especially people at our church had seen this story. I didn’t really think of it too much when it happened simply because I thought I was trying to be funny and have some harmless fun. 

It had only hit me when we arrived to church on Sunday. People had asked us about that night and what we did etc. I felt like I was being seriously judged and was being teased by some people about what I did. Now what really bothers me is that now, people will forever have this negative image of me based on what happened that night. I was always known as the quiet guy who doesn’t really say much, and I’m sure it was very unexpected for these people to see what I had done. I am not sure how to recover from this.

My gf tells me that I am overthinking this like crazy and shouldn’t be overreacting/worrying. She tells me that worse things have happened at the church and that what I did isn’t even considered bad. I believe what I had done is considered taboo in the church community, especially an Asian one. My anxiety also doesn’t help this situation at all either and is probably making things more worse than it seems. Any advice?

541,"I'm a sophomore in college currently and living in the dorms with a friend from high school, let's call her Jane. I don't know if it's like this in all college towns, but when looking for housing for the following school year you have to start really early. So, at the beginning of this school year, Jane and I (+ one other mutual friend) decided to look for an apartment together and have signed a lease for the 2019-20 school year.

Everything has since gone to shit.

About a month ago, Jane and I got in a huge fight over having the window open in the dorm room at night. Our room was consistently 73/74 degrees, which is too warm to be comfortable in my opinion. It's alright during the day but very uncomfortable to sleep in at night. So, I started opening the window. Jane found this unacceptable, claiming she was ""freezing and shivering"" when the window was open (even though our thermostat still read 72°). Now, she might have been cold, that's fine. 

Here's the kicker: I offered her blankets, to try switching her head to the other side of the bed at night so the window wasn't blowing on her, to buy her a heated blanket, to go through the effort of switching our beds so that she wasn't on the side of the room that the window opens on (they open left/right instead of up/down). She refused every solution I offered, refused to talk about it, and refused to do anything but close the window.

One night, all of our frustration came to a head and we had a screaming match. We both insulted each other multiple times.

Things have calmed down a bit since then, and we had a conversation about how to live peacefully together next year (talked about communication, respecting each others feelings, etc.). But, we still don't really talk to each other. I have tried to be friendly to her, but the effort isn't reciprocated. We say maybe a sentence to each other each day. 

I have two problems: First, I have to live with her next year but it's so uncomfortable to be around her that I'm dreading it. I can't get out of the apartment lease without finding someone else to replace me, and I don't know where I'd live then. Second, lately she has been sleeping so much (10-12 hours at night plus a 2 hour nap every day) and isn't out of the room much that I think she might be depressed. I feel like I should say something to her but we don't talk and I don't think she'd confide in me anymore.

My boss (I have many, but it's just this one, so we'll call him Jake for the sake of the story) had a meeting with his organization where he presented our accomplishments for the year. You'd think this sounds like an awesome thing -- it's not. Jake is a tyrant of a boss, has zero regard for how his actions or words affect others, and runs under the old school ""fear strategy"" of management. But Jake makes a lot of money for the company, so there's no discouragement for him to act any other way. He's a man many wish would retire, but won't. Hopefully that paints a proper picture of Jake. I wish I had good words to speak of him to even things out, but I don't; in my ~5 years of working at this company, I've never had a positive experience with him.

But usually I tolerate the ""tyrant-ness"", if you will; on the day-to-day his insane level of micromanagement is something I can handle just fine. I do my 8 or 9 hours and go home and flip switches.

Which leads me to make this post, because I haven't felt this emotionally jarred by something or someone before until this meeting with Jake, and I can't tell if I'm overreacting. I really would appreciate brutally honest opinions, please. 

Jake had a particular segment in his presentation that was titled ""Playing the Victim"". In it, he had outlined all the ways people needed to stop ""acting like a victim"". (Amazing words from a man who bullies his employees on the daily.) This presentation included saying this such as :""feeling like a victim is a sense of entitlement that we need to continue to get rid of in this organization"", and ""Being seen as a victim is a sign of weakness we don't need in this company. We need strong people.""

Some background before I explain my reaction: I've been raped twice in my life and also suffered physical abuse from an ex partner and emotional abuse from my mother. I've been clinically diagnosed with PTSD and related anxiety/depression disorders. I'm trying to figure out if this call out of victims being weak might have been a sign of a trigger for me, or if I'm just looking too far into it and personalizing it too much. I've never been so angry with someone (Jake) in my life, and I feel ridiculous that I let someone like that shake me so hard to the point I'm still crying after logging off.

554,I just walked in on my sister and her girlfriend  making out. I don't know what to do I open the door yelled slammed the door and ran. I don't know if I should act like it didn't happen I barely know her girlfriend  I met her today which makes it even more awkward  I'm just in my room aka the basement  not knowing what to do should I act like it never happened should I say sorry after her gif leaves I don't know.,05Dec2018,1
555,"Bear with me, I'm gonna give some details before asking the advice.

I live in a two story apartment complex. On my end there are two apartments on the 2nd floor. When you get inside the building and up the stairs my neighbors door is immediately to the left on the wall that joins the stairs. Mine is to the right but a few steps down a hall. Our doors face directly at each other, no other units up here. To my knowledge my neighbors are a mid twenties couple with a baby. Never formally introduced so I'm not for certain but I've ran into them in the parking lot. I work third shift so I've been sleeping the morning away and awaking in afternoon/evening. 

After waking up I will leave the apartment to go do errands such as mail or groceries and come right back home but to my surprise their door will be slightly ajar. The first time this happened, me being a good Samaritan, my first instinct was to simply close it as their car was gone but when I heard someone inside doing dishes I decided against it. Idk them well enough to know whether they'd be appreciative or freaked out by me messing with their door. I walked by and enter my apartment like I didn't notice.

Over the next few weeks this kept happening, and I've seen a trend. They share a car but I think she does not work because she's almost always home, most of the time with the child it seems. I noticed that when I leave the door will be closed but when I return is when it is ajar. At first I brushed it off as maybe she left it cracked and me opening the main door blew it open from the outside draft. Quickly realized this wasn't the case because the door would have opened when I opened my door which is in front of theirs. Then I realized this only happens when their car is gone implying that it's only her that is home or  her and the baby. This has never happened with the car present or if he is home. Its the kinda norm now but still super awkward because I have anxiety about someone just walking into my apartment. I'll just walk up the stairs, see out of the corner of my eye it's cracked open 1/8 to 1/4 of the way, and just pull a right face continuing towards my door like I didn't even notice. I could be gone for less than 2-3 minutes to check my mailbox down in the parking lot or take out the garbage and it'll happen in that time span. What's more is none of the other tenants under us are home this time of day which for some reason weirds me out even more.

What should I do, say something? Leave a note? Close it myself? Continue to ignore it? Buy one of those sticks that the dog catcher uses so I can lasso her door knob and close it from down the hall then quickly but quietly close my door like it wasn't me?",05Dec2018,1
556,"My whole family is very conservative and Christian.

Every weekday I go to work in the morning, and come back at night. (12-7).

On the weekends I am usually with my girlfriend, either at our house or at her house (which my family doesn't ""approve"" of me going to her house because they cant control what I am doing, and they do not like my GF because she is an atheist).

Anyway, whenever I see my brother, he only says to me ""where are you going?"", or ""Where were you?"" He doesnt say it in a totally mean way, but my answer is always either Work, or Hanging with GF. And when I say I am gonna be with GF he gets silent and judgmental. 

Sometimes he also makes jokes, that I dont find funny. For example the other night we were watching a show and there was a plus-size girl, and he made a joke about her weight. I didnt know what to say because it wasnt funny, so I just left the room. His jokes are usually slightly racist/sexist/rude like that.

If I ever come home and walk past him in his room/in the kitchen or whatever, I dont usually say Hi, just because I dont really feel the need to I suppose? I dont really say hi to any of my family members if they're just at home, I just dont do that. But whenever I pass by him and dont say Hi, he will say, ""Well HELLO!"" in like a jokey-but-not-really way.

My brother is like Andy Bernard from the Office. hes a nice guy, but just... Awkward. and isn't caught up with the social/pop culture references. 

I just dont know what to do. My mom told me he is sad that I dont ever talk to him. I just dont know how to talk to him. I dont want to cause a rift, I dont want to ruin our relationship. How can I start conversation with him and just be nice?",05Dec2018,1

559,"Hey everyone, 
I was hoping for some advice, tips, and stories of experiences. I’m a US Army combat veteran with a wife and 2 kids, a boy (5) and girl (16).. Ive suffered from PTSD for a few years now but always did my best to be strong, sweep it away. After all I was the rock of our family. Recently I experienced an event that significantly intensified my symptoms and side effects. To point I’ve lost my job, barely go out in public, and became a stranger to the people that mean the most to me. My family has lost our home because of me. We’re down to 1 car. Financially we make enough to pay for a studio hotel room at woodspring suites and keep the car going, and food for the most part. I’ve applied for IU from the VA. Which basically takes my disability rating and increases payment to 100% along with applying for SSDI unfortunately both are dragging out to long. I was hoping to hear of someone who for one has PTSD and if anything has worked. I’m medicated to point some days I feel like a zombie, I’ve tried group therapy and it wasn’t helping, my Dr wants me to try exposure therapy but I’m nervous because from what I’ve heard it gets worse before getting better, if it gets better. I can’t take to much more right now. Any experiences with the VA and claims for IU and SSDI. Lastly but one that would mean the most to me. Any agencies veteran groups or anything that would help with Christmas. I’d sure love to be able to try and cook a small dinner for my wife and kids to show my appreciation. I’d love to be able to give my kids a present. Neither have asked for much because they understand and see what I’m dealing with and unfortunately hear it to many times that we don’t have the money to do extra stuff. It sucks! I’m on waiting lists at some local churches and toy drives but nothing official. I apologize for any typos. I posted this from a pos phone with a cracked screen. I’m in no way asking for handouts. But it’s nice to have some advice, others experiences, and to vent. I keep so much bottled up because I don’t want to stress my family or have them worried. ",05Dec2018,1
560,"So I’ve (F21) been in a lot of uncomfortable situations. Most of them aren’t as simple as this one, yet I still couldn’t stand up for myself for some reason. My boyfriend always asks me why I don’t tell people to back off and I really don’t know why I can’t do it. So here’s the backstory: 

I went to the doctors today and was sitting at the desk talking to a nurse/filling out paperwork. There’s dividers between the welcoming station for privacy, and an older man (probably 50s) peeks his head over the divider and just stares and smiles and me and the nurse, not saying anything. We both kind of awkwardly laugh and she makes a joke about him being creepy and he goes away. Then in the waiting room he’s there again, sitting super close to me. I keep inching away to give space. He doesn’t care/understand. Eventually I kind of give him a fuck off look and he does for a little bit. Then he says “excuse me” so I look at him and he leans down 3 inches away from my face and I jump out of my chair and stand up. I hate when people get close to me or touch me, especially when they’re strangers. He gets close again and asks if my eyelashes are real (they’re not, I have lash extensions that are pretty long but still look somewhat natural) and he’s so close to me and I’m so uncomfortable wondering why this man cares about my eyelashes so much and why he’s standing so goddamn close. 

This is pretty minor compared to other things men have done, but because it’s so minor I shouldn’t feel too scared to tell him to back off, but for some reason I can’t do it. 

Also I was wearing a coat and boots and scarf (it’s cold in Michigan) so I feel as though he was just trying to find something on me to talk about and he didn’t have view of my body so he went for my eyelashes. Proof that no matter what you’re wearing creepy men will find a way to be creepy 😂😂",05Dec2018,1

564,"Wife and I really don’t know what to buy for her grandparents. They raised her as a little girl for a few years and now we live in their old house (still pay rent). They also gave us some money to pay for the wedding. So we only started to giving them gifts after we got married and we started giving them Christmas gifts by getting them a nice wedding photo frame . My wife used to visit grandma and grandpa like once a year or so before we got married and now we spend a few holidays with them and Birthdays every year. Last year I gave grandpa some booze which he loved . I forgot what we gave grandma. Anyway during grandmas birthday grandpa said he barely drank or the booze we got him (after 8 months) but he likes it all the same . I hate to buy him more booze if he hasn’t finished what I gave him . Wife has heard that grandma wants to get a cleaning service to help clean her bathroom or something because she is getting too old to clean the house . Wife found a Groupon for it but it’s $55 and starts a subscription plan for them . So that is what she wants to get grandma and we still don’t know what to get grandpa. $55 plus $30 -40 something give or take seems like allot for grandparents Christmas gifts when we don’t spend that much on other people. We spent less on her mom . I’m okay spending it but we aren’t sure and not confident enough to buy anything yet and they are basically the last people on our gift list . They aren’t poor or rich and are living comfortably in retirement. Grandma is typical Hispanic house wife and Grandpa is a veteran conservative Hispanic guy. We have thought about maybe a restaurant gift card but we have no idea to where or for how much . They aren’t very tech savvy outside of Facebook. Grandpa basically just watches Fox News all day and reposts conservative memes on Facebook. I have no idea what grandma does all day. 
I get along with both of them fine even if I severely disagree with them politically (grandma is also extremely conservative ) . They do volunteer at the local Catholic Church every week. I fear of getting them a too expensive gift will cause them to reconsider our rent situation which is really good for us . If you can afford this great gift you can afford to pay us more rent money. I also fear that they will say “you didn’t have to buy us anything “. I want to show respect for both of them and get them something nice but I have no idea what to do .  Any help ? ",05Dec2018,1
565,"Hi,

I have a new job since a few months and I really like it, everybody is cool and my boss is super chilled. However, there is this girl, she is like 23 but looks like a child since she never wears make up and wears trash clothes (like for real we are talking about HM discount stuff). I always try to be polite to everybody and its a given that everybody greets and says goodbye.

568,"So since I was 6 years old, I had this friend from Russia, we used to be best-friends when we were together.

 But I would only see her in my vacation, so when my vacation was over, I went back to homeland (Denmark) since that was the last time, I hadn’t heard from her in a few years. 

So out of nowhere, she gives my grandmother a note, saying she wanna start talking again, along with her instagram name and such.

 So I ended up following her on Instagram and we quickly began taking frequently, like a few hours a day, everyday.

So over the course of summer, I got to learn one of her friends, which I had a good connection with, or so it seemed, after a month of talking with her, I ended up in a small discussion with my original friend.

Which then somehow spread out to the second friend, and before I knew it, they both had different story and wouldn’t explain me anything.

So I tried my best to regain control of the situation, but that didn’t work, so It ended up with them just ghosting me for a or two.

Then slowly I started to noticed that they both acted a bit jealous, which I confronted both of them, but they both denied, so I stopped pushing for that day.

Then the next day I made like a flirty joke to both of them nothing seriously flirty, just some friendly stuff, which the second friend took very seriously and straight up blocked me. 

So when I had noticed that, I just gave up and stated to talk more with my original friend, but then we had another discussion, about me not being happy, because I was always the one to start up a conversation or just keeping it alive.

So after 2 weeks of silence, she finally texted me, but she still acted cold, so I did some questioning and found out, she had gotten a boyfriend.

Normally I wouldn’t have had problems with it, except that he basically took my place, she would only talk to him and only him, she started to forget to text me for days, unless I reminded her.

And then she couldn’t accept any jokes I made, no jokes at all, she wouldn’t keep out conversations alive nor try to, at all, so I told her, multiple times that I was unhappy with our friendship.

And she would say sorry each time and say that she would do better, but after talking with some other friends about it, they said that she probably wouldn’t change, so I made a final decision.

I texted her, saying I was unhappy and I was going to cut contact, she obviously didn’t take it well, she screenshot our conversation and posts it on her story with some Russian words (laughing) I’m pretty sure.

So I just ignored her, until she bombarded my phone with messages, about how she was sorry and how she was stupid and wasn’t meant to be born and that she was a awful person and such.

So I’m now in this situation, what do I do? Should I have acted differently? Or should I give her a last chance?",05Dec2018,1
569,When I was 17 I got kicked out of my parents house and moved in with my boyfriend I had met off the internet. I had to start paying rent so went into the food service industry. When I turned 20 I met a friend who was shooting porn and camming and got me into it. The money was nice but it wasn't really for me. I just really hated being in the food service industry. I wish I had used some of the money at the time to go to school but I lived in an expensive city and paid for my boyfriend after he quit working when his mother died. I did this until I was about 25 when I switched to caretaker work for an old drag queen. She developed dementia and started threatening me with a gun frequently so I reached out to friends to find a different job. I got a job working at a hog farm I really enjoyed. It only paid $600 a month but I didn't have any rent or bills. I had grown up farming and loved the work. Unfortunately I had a mental breakdown of sorts and lost the job in my mania. I felt it would be better if I moved closer to my family and go to school. I'm 28 now and am working at a minimum wage job serving food at movie theater. I have no clue how I could go to school and what degree I would try to get. I feel like I wasn't thinking clearly when I left the farm and I'll never get anything as good as that.

573,"Normally I don’t post in these kinds of subs but I’d really appreciate a fresh perspective on this. 

Started seeing a new therapist recently with depression being the most pressing concern. My “gut feeling” immediately told me this was the wrong person, but I decided to go through with the initial appointment anyways (as I couldn’t cancel without paying). 

Once inside the office, I was immediately impressed and my impression of him changed 100%. He was able to call out my justifications around my mental state and life instantly, when I lied to myself, etc. He was brusque and upfront in getting me to see and accept the truth.

This is a trait I recognize and value in myself and I was overjoyed to find a therapist who shared it. Few people actually go there to completely challenge my logic or worldview.

Our third session was on Monday and I was left feeling much less amicable afterwards. While I was initially grateful for his passion for the truth, I soon grew weary over whether or not he possesses the capacity to know when to stop. Unless I outright and completely agree with his judgement of my world, any correction, objection, or statement I reply with is disregarded as grasping justification, or dismissed and blamed on my control issues.

Today in conversation he said “I’ll be honest, your personal experiences mean very little to me.” as I was crying. I mean, he’s not wrong. He’s right to feel that way - we’re practically strangers. But I can’t help but feel that **a therapist with good judgement wouldn’t say that to a brand new client.** Then again, I’m not a therapist so what would I know?

It’s not because he compels me to see the painful truths, in fact I value this deeply (and almost always agree with him). It’s how he goes about doing it and how he reacts if I disagree that makes me very uneasy. Secondly, his severe questioning of all of my logic in our sessions is causing me to doubt and dismiss whatever decisions I come to on this (and on everything lately if I’m being honest) which is why I’m here for a second opinion.

Live with parents and work full time while studying for 6 months. This is a very small town filled with older school bulies so I can't feel comfortable going to a bar or a club and have  0 friends.

We were still close in spirit, but we really didn’t have much time to hang out because his school was an hour away and other things just got in the way. I struggled a lot with anxiety and depression in school which made me isolate myself From everybody including B. 

Then B started hanging out with an old mutual friend from high school, who for all intents and purposes is a total burnout loser (Doesn’t have a job, parties all the time with underage people, constant drugs, constant booze, not going anywhere with his adult life). They would invite me to hang with them, but after sitting around drinking and Smoking every single time we hung out, it got Old, and I stopped hanging out with them. 

It got even worse when I met my girlfriend (who’s now my fiancé). Any of the little free time I had was often spent with her. I still spent some time with B, but definitely even less than before. I think it was jealousy tainting his view of her, but it became very clear that he didn’t like my girlfriend. It really hurt my feelings that he was so rude to me about my girlfriend. She makes me happy and I thought it was kind of shitty that he didn’t value that. Then He started being an asshole to her in person, which then made my girlfriend not like him. So I felt that I was constantly being torn in between B and my girlfriend. 

Things just get worse from there. He moved even farther away when he got a job across he country and would only hang with the old friend when he got back in to town. We would always tell each other “Well hang out when you get back” but whenever he would return, he wanted to involve the old friend that I really didn’t like. I got more serious with my girlfriend and moved in with her. We just fell way out of sync. 

I made him a part of my wedding party (mostly out of obligation to our past friendship and an attempt to mend things) but he just recently told me that he probably wouldn’t be able to make the wedding Because of his new job. This was pretty much the last straw for me. I can’t be the only person trying to keep this friendship alive. 

We never had a blowout, or a definitive “we’re not really friends anymore” moment. We just kind of stopped expecting to see each other. I’ve attempted to try and fix Things a few times which all obviously failed. It makes me sad that we aren’t friends anymore, but I’m at a point where I just cant care anymore. He’s becoming just like his friend (quit his job, got some dead end job with our old High school, spends all of his free time smoking and drinking and partying and not going anywhere with his life). I’m moving forward into my adult life with a promising career, a college degree, a fiancé who I love more than anything, and new friends who have a similar situation. 

Any advice on how to deal with this? Cope with the death of a friendship? Should I keep trying to make this friendship work? ",05Dec2018,1
579,"I’m 20f (from the UK) and I still live at home with my parents, this is relatively normal in my parents culture and I’m expected to live at the family home until marriage. I wanted to move out for university, but they said I couldn’t. Its recently dawned on me that I need to start taking some initiative for my own life, because as of right now my future seems quite bleak. I’m not really allowed to do anything (because god forbid I live a normal life!) and that lack of experience has turned me into a bit of a nervous Nellie. I do have a job and I will be going back to university next year (I took a year off), but that’s about it. I’m too scared to actually make some big decisions and get things done. 


I’d like some advice on where to start, how can I make the most of this time off from university so that eventually I’ll be able to move out? What are some of the basics I need to know about buying or renting a property? And is there anyway to maintain a somewhat good relationship with my family? Because going against their expectations will definitely cause some issues. Also, am I still allowed to apply for student accommodation? - when I go back I’ll be in my final year.

The message also said I had to be somewhere Thursday (today) and I’m just now listening to it. I’d also like to mention, when she started the message she said her name clear as day, when she started to say the company the phone cut out. It could be a coincidence, but that seems fishy as well. Another thing to mention is, in the background it sounded almost as if someone was telling her what to say during pretty much the whole message. 

Is this a scam? In ways the whole thing seems pretty fishy altogether, from not knowing this company, to asking for all my info, to the other person directing this lady on what to say, but I’d like to get some more opinions on it and maybe some suggestions on what to do or how to go about this?

583,"For a bit of context: the past year or two my friendship circle has changed dramatically. I'm now surrounded by very different people that I've grown up with and although I still don't consider myself to have any close friends I can turn to, we still hang out.

The past year has been the best personal growth year of my life and I'm pretty sure I'm happy in general but lately I've been feeling very insecure about my intelligence and the way I've been brought up and to be honest it's really taking its toll on my self esteem causing me to withdraw in conversations etc incase I say/do something completely incorrect and embarrass myself.

I come from a very down to Earth family (let's say street smart not book smart) and the people I'm surrounded by now are VERY book smart - they come from well off backgrounds as does my boyfriend. I feel like I don't belong anywhere. I don't get all of the jokes or references. I just generally feel stupid whenever I'm around 90% of the people I speak to on a daily basis.

I don't know what to do about this as it feels like a strange situation to be in but I love these people and it's not even their issue, it's mine.

When we first started dating I liked her a lot and we got along great, but over time things just died down. She’s been a part of my life for a long time now and I care very much about her.

Recently I accidentally made contact with an old friend and we got to chatting, the usual how have you been ordeal. We started talking more and more and I started feeling different . My brain felt like it came back to life and I was alive again. I clicked...with her . I’ve never felt this way before, I’ve never been so excited to wake up to a message from someone , I’ve never been so excited to hear someone’s voice and ask them how their day has gone . We had a deep conversation which led to me admitting how she made me feel, and to my surprise she feels the same way. I’ve been battling with my depression for months now and my medication doesn’t seem to help anymore and because of that I bottle up my emotions, but when we talk I feel normal, I feel like I’ve never even heard of depression and I can tell her everything that goes in within my head.  

I love the girl I’m with and I will always love her as a person and a best friend. I just don’t feel the same about her anymore and I hate it and don’t know what to do.

I work in a big city and commute in every day.
These are cities are VERY different: The one I live in is small, communal, cozy, unpretentious, inexpensive, and all my friends are here, but the commute to the big city and back every day is starting to drain me. Plus, there are no jobs in my field here and my dating scene has been restricted to struggling twentysomething artists or awkwardguys I went to college with/didn’t like.
The big city is just that: Big! Exciting! Hiring in my field! Full of hot lawyers and doctors! And a lot of people I admire visit there/art exhibits I love go there instead of my small city. But it’s also quite bougie and expensive.

Thing is, now I feel torn between two worlds. On the one hand, my small city keeps me grounded...but might also be holding me back. I can’t rly get to know my coworkers outside of work because the commute home is like an hour long. I miss a lot of concerts, shows, exhibits.
On the other hand, I don’t want to become “bougie”, shallow or corrupt. A lot of fucked up shit happens in the big city that’s kept me away, but I’m missing so much as a result. But maybe I’m rly just getting in the way of my growth.

He wants to ""bump"" into them in a mall they go shopping every Saturday. He plans to tell them about that college shit hoping to to theyd let him talk to her again (her parents are all about money and want her to find a rich husband).

We talked about our personal lives briefly. Smiled a lot. Life was great. I felt like I was doing well. I even fixed the printer that was long broken and was praised for it. Then, I took a week long vacation (an approved vacation from when I interviewed.) There was no way to back out of it, I had made this vacation months ago before I ever applied to this place. It was fine. I came back from vacation and I just felt really weird and different around my boss. Feeling distant. Thought I was just tired and I would brush it off. He told me to drink coffee. Then the next day came, Tuesday, and I've noticed my boss is very serious and even ignores my text messages at times. I feel like I try to keep him in the loop on whats going on and I also ask probably way too many questions for my own good. I try to figure out problems on my own but hes very experienced in HR and I admire his abilities so I ask him a lot of it even though my boss is new too.

I am literally messing up everything that comes my way and I'm literally thinking about just not talking to my boss unless I really need him. I annoy him and I can tell. However, he has never said anything to me but this is just what I feel is happening. I confided with a coworker he said this is probably all in my head. That he probably doesn't text back because he wants me to learn on my own. I thought about it a minute and he seemed right. Maybe that is what it is.

600,"Very long story made very short: im 19, female. I know I grew up being mostly looked after by my father. My mother was preoccupied with my brother, who was sick and in the hospital lots. So I was mostly with my father, alone. But I can just barely recall two memories that involves him, from when I was under the age of 11. Yet I can remember lots and lots about friends, school, kindergarten, my mother, other family members etc etc from under theage of 11. It's like he wasn't even in my life back then, despite being my main caregiver.

Parents got divorced when I was 11, my father moved to his deceased parents house an hour away. It was decided me and my brother would spend two weeks there, then two weeks at my mother's etc. Split it 50/50. So I lived there lots for two years. 

I don't remember the first few weeks but.. I remember this: I started being very, very anxious in my father's house. I was scared of being alone with him. I was disgusted by him, felt a lot of nausea. Everytime I looked at him or thought about him, images of his genitalia and him performing sexual acts popped up. I think I can call it intrusive thoughts? Just vivid, clear pictures and scenes of that. Always accompanied by disgust, anxiety, and a weird, strong, negative physical sensation.. down there. Where it just felt.. dirty. That I needed to shower.

In the end of the two year period where I lived there part time, I was disgusted by the whole house. I couldn't touch anything, sit on anything without feeling nausea and needing to clean myself. Everywhere he'd been or touched or been in contact with, I couldn't touch. Couldn't even touch door handles, a water glass, sit on a chair. Always made me feel like I needed to shower, but I never got clean. Same with my hands, I could wash them with anti bacterial soup numerous times and they still weren't clean. And in the shower, I had to be naked - and being naked in the house deeply upset me. 


I always covered myself as much as possible. Was terrified he'd look at me sexually if he saw my body.

I started self harming while living there. Developed anorexia. Lots of depression. Deep suicidal thoughts.

The last few days I couldn't even pee there. I'd hold it in for painful number of hours, waited until I got to school the next day. Peeing made me feel so incredibly disgusting, cause it was sitting partly naked on a toilet seat that his naked body had touched too.

I finally told my mother ""it's stressful to move back and forth"". That's all I said. And with that, I started living at my mother's place full time. 

Every time he came by I'd have high high high levels of anxiety. Avoided him as much s possible. All the same feelings came back. And if he had  touched anything in the house, I'd avoid it for weeks. If he used one of the restrooms, I'd avoid that for weeks too. In the end I completely stopped using the restroom he usually used when visiting. 


I developed bad dissociation. Would miss out on entire classes in school. Memory got worse.
He kept trying to have contact with me. I kept avoiding. I was terrified of being in the same room as him. I was terrified of everything it made me feel. Of the intrusive thoughts.  Kept self harming badly.

At least three people asked me if he had sexually abused me. My mother was one of those who asked. I just remembered crying, being angry, yelling no. Always no. 


I see him very rarely. It's been months since last time. 

I dont know what to think of this, I've always said no nothing happened, but the thing is: I remember almost absolutely nothing of him from under the age of 11, and why the fuxk would I randomly get that bad intrusive thoughts??? Should I open up for the possibility that something happened



I'm sorry for all the typos and grammar stuff, it's the middle of the night and english isn't my first language

Basically, I'm (20F) terrible with money. I can never save I just spend, and I can never train myself to budget properly. As a result, a large overseas trip my partner and I have planned for a long time has mostly been paid by me taking out two credit cards and a small personal loan. (He has contributed a large amount as well) we have paid off everything needed for the trip, flights accommodation and we don't need huge amounts of spending money as the whole trip is staying with his family, and I have managed to save a little bit.

When we return from our trip, we'll both be full time and I'll be earning quite a bit more money every week than I do now. I have sat down and made a plan to pay little amounts onto my credit cards and loans each week, and if I stick to it I can pay them all off within two years, likely less.

But being so bad at handling money and KNOWING I am without stopping myself has stressed me out for months, to the point where I struggle to sleep and I binge eat to get rid of the feeling of stress. (food helps me)

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? At a young age? I would love any advice anyone has to offer, or just for someone to tell me I'll be alright.

- I suffer from anxiety and depression and a lot of unresolved anger issues that come boiling up

- I try to work on myself, my addiction to alcohol keeps me down (not ready or done with it yet tho), but also do constantly aim to grow and learn from my mistakes

- I have acted unprofessionally with collegues at this company in the past. For example when I made a mistake and sent private info to the wrong department, a mass email was created as a result and I took said mass email as a direct insult and lost my shit on the collegue that instigated the mass email via private fb msg. I spoke to that collegue face to face and I apologized for being a bully and outlined some of my paranoia surrounding passive agressive actions (taking the mass email as a direct insult). Not sure if it was ever discussed with HR, I never had a meeting with HR regarding this incident.

Today's situation: 

- coworker in my department sends a mass email (not normally procedure to call attention to the full department/team for mistake made) and I again take it as a personal insult

- coworker and myself are close, I have confided in her and we have spoken and hung out privately numerous time so I felt sending her a personal FB message to address the email was okay

- fb msg exchange is deleted, due to anger and anxiety, I deleted my version of it. From what I remember the exchange went something along the lines of this: 

""Hey (coworker), I am hurt by the last email!! We all know its ONLY me that is able to make this mistake!!! Now everyone knows!!! Can we discuss in private next time there is a mistake made?"" 

She then replied with something along the lines of:

""Well you never make it private when you're blurting out my mistakes across the office, I was told to send an email when a mistake is made."" (She is right, but the Quality Control Department normally does it privately via email exchange and reviews each week and only if trends are noticed by ""higher ups"" are mass emails made.)

And my response was:

""Lets discuss how we can create an effective communication style between us."" 

- At this point she blocked me and I couldn't reply. She then proceeded to let our manager know, then manager brought it up to HR

- Coworker fled from work in tears

- HR took me in and is now ""placing me on probation"" and HR used to words ""Bullying, harrasment, and abrasive"". I didnt defend myself because I know I can be rude and unfiltered towards people. 

-HR kept using ""we have had multiple incidents of your abrasive behaviour etc"" not sure if HR was trying to ""protect"" Teresa or get me to confess to being an asshole to another co-worker (see I need professional help with mental illness.)

- sent email to HR after thinking about it explaining how I thought the private FB msg exchange went. I am willing to reference FB msg if coworker still has a copy, said meeting between all of us is a good idea but don't agree with a formal warning.

What are your thoughts from my stand point? My coworkers standpoint? HR's stand point?

606,"So the story goes, this girl and me used to be great friends through school, went out for a while and broke up but still had a great friendship until we finished and went our separate ways. That was about 5 years ago now and maybe 2 or 3 ago I decided to contact her again to see how she was doing. My crazy paranoid ex didn’t like that so she blocked her without me knowing. So I thought maybe my old friend had just moved on and removed me. Fast forward a few years to today, I’m told that my ex blocked her years ago. So I added her and obviously apologised for that happening and we’ve been talking a little. 
Since leaving school I’ve actually become more shy somehow but anyway I wouldn’t really be bothered too much to ask her to meet up again seeing as we were so close and either way I don’t have much to lose, it’s either speaking for a few days then leaving it or meeting up, so I know I might as well.
The only problem, is that I’m afraid she’s changed pretty majorly. Not into some psycho but just from browsing her Instagram it would seem she is good friends with people I don’t hold in high regard at all. My main concern is just what should I do. From what we’ve said to each other she still seems lovely but these people as a said really aren’t the best, I just don’t want it to be us meeting and realising she’s someone beyond different to what I remember. It actually sounds pretty ridiculous now I’m writing it out that I’m worried about her being completely different. Well sorry to ramble but yeah should I just meet even if we’re now complete opposites or just give it a miss? I’d love to just not sure if I should now. I’m in two minds haha. Sorry for rambling.
