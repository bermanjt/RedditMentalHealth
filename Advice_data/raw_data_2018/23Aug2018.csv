1,"Me and “Jason” have been together for two years. We met through a mutual friend and we immediately fell for each other. We moved in together after a year and that’s when things started to go really south and Jason’s true colours really started to show. 

It sounds like the cliche abusive relationship but at first, he really was the sweetest guy. Helping out around the apartment and showering me with affection. 

After about six months, in our new place, he started getting more and more aggressive, grabbing my arms, berating me verbally and being emotionally manipulative when it comes to sex. 

About a month ago, we had just had sex and were laying in bed when I expressed that I felt pressured to have sex with him a lot of the time. Out of nowhere he hit me across the face and accused me of not not wanting to sleep with him and accused me of sleeping with someone else. 

At this point I had been at the end of my road for a while so I told him that I was leaving and we were done because he put his hands on me. He tried to stop me from leaving but I told him I would scream (thin walls and friendly neighbours who would help me) and he let go and I got out as fast as I could. I went back later with my brother when I knew he wouldn’t be there to collect my stuff. 

After I got my stuff, I got a text from him apologizing and upset and begging me to move back in. I blocked him on everything and he doesn’t know where I am atm. 

Well this month I missed my period (which never happens) and I feared the worst. I took a pregnancy test (or a couple) and I am pregnant. 

I’m freaking out. Having an abortion isn’t for me and I already feel attached to this child. But what do I do about my ex?

Should I tell him? Does he deserve to know about his child after what he did to me? What about financial support? Shouldn’t my child know their father? Am I in the wrong for not getting an abortion? 

I guess I’m just looking for general advice and opinions on this. 

Tl;dr: I am pregnant with my abusive ex’s baby and I don’t know whether to tell him about it.

They think I'm being lazy but I can barely bring myself to shower, let alone take classes. I spent most days sleeping and crying in my car in the parking lot. All that gives me hope is my religion. I feel that I'm in a deep hole. 

For those of you who are also on the straight path I would appreciate it if you made dua for me. I hope I will find peace soon and I know that Allah (swt) wouldn't put more weight on my shoulders than I can bare. ",23Aug2018,2

4,"So my cousins been in town for close to 2 weeks now and she’s leaving on Friday. The first week she was here, I had work all week from 10-6 so it’s not like I was with her during the day. But me and my parents have been showing her around our city all this week since I’m free. On one of the days I even took her to hang out with my friends at an amusement park nearby, and just the other day I took her out to the museum for the entire day. I’m not the funnest person nor am I the most talkable, I’m not a mute nor am I antisocial but she just talks a lot, and I can’t always keep up. For a while I’ve had immense back pain and when I called my dad this morning, he was upset because my back hurt and I couldn’t take her around. She decided to go do her own thing while I was in bed all day with a bunch of heating pads and my parents were at work. After a while my back pain sorta subsided and my friend who just got back from vacation asked me to see him for a second, I told my mom who had just arrived home and my cousin who was sitting on the couch that I was going to go out. As I was walking with my friend I made eye contact with my dad who just pretty much gave me a dirty look. I haven’t hung out with my friends alone in weeks. Could he really be mad at me because I didn’t hang out with my cousin today?

7,"For starters, I’m in high school. Last year, my best friend was in a relationship with this girl. They broke up and the girl and I started talking quite a bit. Things have escalated quite a bit, and now I find myself in a situation where I am 100% sure she has feelings for me, and I’m 100% sure I have feelings for her. The answer “date her ya fuckin muppet” might seem obvious at first, but I’m conflicted. My high school is very small, so if there is a relationship, word has an 100% chance of finding its way around the halls. This means that if people hear about this, they’ll think I’m in the “shadow” of my friend or that I’m getting “sloppy seconds.” The thing I’m most worried about is ruining a friendship / making things awkward over a girl that’ll probably leave me within a few months. So, my options are to either come out with it publicly and potentially ruin a friendship, never do it at all, or get into some type of situation where we don’t tell anyone (and eventually get found out because of my fat dumb mouth; thus landing me into even deeper shit.) Also worth mentioning that if I go through with this, it will be my first relationship ever, so advice about what to do is also accepted.",23Aug2018,1

10,"Good afternoon everyone. I'm on Mobile so formatting might even shitty. 

Okay so I am currently on track to enlisting in the United States Marine Corps. I have a habit which is causing me to get blisters. I'm not sure how to stop it. I have tried a couple of times before but eventually I'll forget and unconsciously go back to the habit since I have been doing it for 19 years. I am also not sure If I should stop it at all.. 

I was born with flat feet. I have an arch but as soon as I put weight on the foot the arch disappears. I have never experienced any pain and it has never been unconfortable.

Since I was very little I have noticed the lack of an arch and I found a way to ""create"" an arch. Since I already had one and it disappeared when I out weight in the foot I found that by having my toes closer to the foot/not extended fully like they were meant to I was able to keep the arch but the downside is that I literally walk on my toes. Instead of pressure being put on the downside of the toes it's being out on the ends of the toes.

I'm 19 and this has never caused me any problems. I can walk and run perfectly fine. In high school we ran a mile sometimes mile and a half once a week. 

So here's where the problem comes in, as I mentioned, I'm enlisting in the USMC. I have been attending PT for about 3/4th of a month now and it regularly consists of running long distances. I can run short distances just fine but when I run for long distances (around 1.5+ sometimes 3+ miles) all trying constant pressure on the tip of the smaller toes causes me to start developing blisters along the edges of the nail.

So, if I keep doing the arch thing then I'll keep getting blisters but if I stop making it then I'll possibly start to get foot pain from not having an arch. All of my siblings also have flat feet but unlike me they don't do the thingy I do so they often have foot pain so I doubt I wont get pain if I stop.. 

Soo.. should I stop it? How? I have tried fully extending my toes but eventually when I forget about it I'll go back to the way they were.",23Aug2018,1

12,"I'm just a typical 17 year old trying to do too much at once. I feel overwhelmed and stressed all the time as I can't juggle all my responsibilities and hobbies. I have soccer practice every day from 8 AM - 11 AM and then work from 12 PM - 7 PM and then I try to hit the gym from 8 PM - 11 PM on the weekdays. I feel like I have no time for anything anymore. On top of that I have summer school work and SAT prep that has been stressing me out a lot. I also play piano very seriously and feel horribly guilty because I haven't practiced for almost a month now. 

I get incredibly worried that I'm putting too much on myself and end up spending whatever little free time I have on video games and leisure to try and give myself some time to relax and unwind. I am worried that having such a packed schedule could be psychologically taxing. I had been working on a lot of personal projects during the summer which I have been completely ignoring now and it's upsetting (choral arrangements, musical compositions, videos, etc.) 

I have also fallen behind on my fitness goals. I have been neglecting going to the gym because I wanted more time to study for the SAT, and I've been trying my best to supplement with calisthenic workouts, but I can see that I've fallen behind.

I have also been Juuling a lot, more than usual, and I would kindly appreciate if you would not judge me or tell me to quit or anything like that I know the repercussions that come with it. And I'm starting to think that my stress levels have been influencing that habit.

I just feel like my mind can't juggle all of these things at once; work, soccer, gym, school work, SAT prep, socializing, dieting, girlfriend, leisure, and I'm scared that I'm slowly becoming less and less productive or motivated to do anything.",23Aug2018,2
13,"I'm a freshmen in high school and absolutely love video games. If I had to put it in some over-dramatic words, video games are my life, my will to keep on living, and one of the few things I find joy in. 
Although I say that, I don't spend every minute of my life playing games, especially during the school year (I want a very successful and sturdy career and so I put school first; I'm actually very good in school and get good grades, as a result from being held back a year in 6th grade --a long story--) 
I limit myself to 3 hours on the weekend and 1/2 hours on school days, but that's whenever I feel like gaming. A majority of the time I draw, write or watch YouTube. /or sleep in but dont tell anyone that/

I have a PS4, a WiiU, a New Nintendo 3DSxL, a PS Vita, a Game Boy Advanced and, in the near future, I will most likey own a Nintendo Switch. 
I grew up playing Super Mario 64 and the Wind Waker, so I'm quite a sucker for nostalgia and video game history.
I have little to no friends who would want to sit down and have a gaming hang out day with me, especially since I am 
1) a teenage girl who plays video games.
2) living with grandparents who think my playing video games is getting in the way of my life/""dumbing me down/making me less emotional"" (which is stupid because judging from my grades im doing very well and *sarcasm* judging from the fact im a **pisces** i am /extremely/ emotional).
and 3) my few friends who DO play video games can't come to my house to hang.

So the reason I am starting this club is to unite other gamers in my school so we can enjoy a hobby/passion together, so I can make more friends, so I can finally be in group of people I can relate to, and to improve my social skills. 

Now, the reason I am here on this to this subreddit is to ask for a few things;

1) I need some advice on how to run a club, and how to be a good president. Because of some personal problems in the past I've grown anti-social and cold towards others, and will harshy insult people based on their opinions on something I feel so strongly about. I also become extremely bossy and cruel when people interrupt or don't listen to me when I'm talking -- it INFURIATES me, which is probably why I've avoided being leader in any group projects up until now.
Can anyone offer some advice as to not be so offensive, and how to calmly tell people to 'shut the hicker hecker up'? 
Also advice for how a club leader should act? 

2) I need a name. I told my friend I was just going to call it the Video Game Club, but she said that was stupid and I needed to come up with something creative. She gave me examples of how the other clubs are named, based off of the school's mascot. (A Black Cat/Panther). Or something cute and creative, but a joke everyone can get.
Can anyone help me come up with a not-so-cringey name and/or slogan? 
(i kinda want our slogan to be ""gamers rise up"" just for a meme but idk lol)

Any other kind of advice would be very helpful! I don't have the requirements to start the club yet, but if we find a teacher willing to be our sponsor, I'll be back with more questions on how to be a leader in the future if needed.
Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and, if you did, giving me advice!

22,"3 months ago, this happened... 

Me and my friends were stopped in California after coming back home from Arizona. We had vegetables in the car, that the border patrol wanted to inspect. I refused to let border patrol check the produce, and I was told to “be on my way”. 

The BP apparently called into the California Highway Patrol about us, because we got stopped by the patrol. They kept reminding us that we could either “take the citation”, “go back to the checkpoint”, or “go to jail”. 

In my mind, they were wrong, so I kept telling them that their stop was illegal. Me and the HP went back and forth, until finally they started taking the options provided off the table. It started with the “go back to the checkpoint” option they gave us, they would no longer allow that, so they just started hounding the “take the citation, and we’ll leave!” 

I kept reminding them that the stop was illegal, and that I didn’t do anything wrong, so I didn’t hand over my information. They then started warning us that the windows would be getting shattered. 

The one officer cocked his hand back, said “last chance, or you’re all going to jail.” Out of anger, and without thought I told them we didn’t do anything wrong, but with a few “F”-bombs. It was along the lines of “what the fuck? We haven’t didn’t fucking do anything!” The guy shattered the window, and immediately I told him I’ll give up my information. The officer, as he was shattering the window just replies with “too late, you wanted to play hardball”. 

So, me and my passengers were all arrested. My car was impounded, and I’m left with an expensive citation. I’m wondering if I would have any chance at getting a successful complaint filed against the officers. Not just for me, but my passengers for not having the opportunity to call for a ride. Their only crime was that they just kept repeating “what the hell?” To the officers. ",23Aug2018,1
23,"He, however, is in a seven year long relationship from since he was eighteen.

We met not that long ago, but we became very close very fast. I had never experienced such chemistry with anyone. Communicating with each other is ever suprisingly easy. Our conversations are fluent, open and profound just naturally.  We inspire and motivate each other. We make each other laugh with the most specific jokes. We learn from each other.

I love the way he looks at life and I share many of his dreams and aspirations. We share most of our basic values and moral views.  And as if that was not enough, I am physically very attracted to him and it feels mutual, even though we are very non-physical when we meet. 

He is, in the other hand, in a serious and unhappy relationship which he is not sure about. He lives with his girlfriend, who is constantly in a bad or a very bad period of depression. He has been her only emotional support for years, and he has kept her going in life. But every now and then he blurts out to me and to other friends that he doesn't think they will hold much longer.  That he is very unhappy with his situation, that he feels like he can't talk to her. Every time it ends with him trying to making things work yet again. He feels a lot of obligation towards her, and he has been with her for so long that throwing it all away is terrifying to him in many aspects.

If I had a neutral position, I would feel very comfortable with advising him strongly to break up with her. But my position is not neutral at all. From all the people I have ever met, I think he is the best one for me. Since we've met we have improved and moved each other forward so much. But this is somthing that I feel like I shouldn't get myself into. If he decides to break up it has to come from him only. But I find myself terrifyied that he won't find the courage to do it ever. And I believe that if he knew how I feel he would do find it. But I have so much to lose.

i exclusively feel happy when i'm doing stuff with other people. i have been diagonsed and treated for ADHD for 9 years.       
i have no motivation whatsoever for myself, if i can't be around people, i play games, watch series and read books to not be alone with my thoughts.     
i'm procrastinating. somehow i can't be bothered with doing things that solely have to be done to improve my own life at some distant point in the future*. exams are always like a boulder looming over me, waiting to crash down.

(NSFW Paragraph)
since around 17, i can not enjoy orgasms, i have a sex drive, had multiple sexual partners and do can ejaculate, but without feeling good, sometimes not even noticing when i come. sometimes i get a boner and really aroused without triggering thoughts or circumstances, accompanied by tiredness that feels like i took melatonin.      
i tried nofap, and after 3 weeks abstinence, i only gained a little joy out of my first orgasm afterwards. i used to get way more joy out of masturbating as a teenager than i ever felt with any sexual partner of any gender afterwards, or masturbating now.    

i do think about killing myself, although i am unsure about how serious i'd take these thoughts myself, i never ever intended to take my life. also i am really into that dark kind of internet humor, and don't know how much suicide has been normalized into my thought process through this humor alone.  

as random and far more awkward than my boners, sometimes i get something like social anxiety, where i can't deal with people at all. i then feel really uncomfortable and awkward talking to or being around anybody.    

i also sometimes recall embarassing yet not normally seen as traumatic teenage memories. yet they make me have an anxious stress response, clutching my fists, clenching my teeth, racing thoughts and muttering incomplete sentences to myself. but they only do so if i am in a specific, rather anxious mood.   

occasionally, i have visually imparing and painful migraine.    

Emotional dysregulation is a symptom of ADHD. but i think there is a lack of happiness, structure and motivation in my life, that is not caused by an external shortage of these.    

i have not been medicated for the last 5 years. i still have dopamine agonists for ADHD treatment lying around, and occasionally take them, but they do not help me regulate my emotions and tend to put me in an anxious mood. i also took a low, sub-hallucinatory dose of ehrlich tested LSD a few months ago, which is a serotonin agonist, and felt really happy and good on it.    

i have heard of successful off-label use of antidepressants for treating ADHD. ADHD is comorbid with anxiety disorders and depression.    

I live in Germany, have free healthcare, but the city i live in has not many psychologists taking in new patients, i know from experience and a lot of stories that it is difficult to get a good therapist.

42,"TLDR: How do I know what to put down for my desired pay if the pay isn't what is important to me?
Location: Medium sized town in Midwestern USA

This may sound unbelievable but I have only ever applied for one job, so I have very little experience on this front. My work history begins with me applying for and easily getting a crappy factory floor job during my last few years of high school. I worked at that job while going to college for Computer Science getting steadily promoted through various positions until I got where I am now making a livable wage as support staff. Now that I have work experience I have been looking into applying for an IT position with a much larger local corporation so that I can get my career in IT started. I originally applied for a computer operations support position and on the application I put $15 per hour which is livable in my small town and on the lower end of the salary range listed on glassdoor. During the interview with the hiring manager it became apparent to both the hiring manager and myself that the job was different from what I expected; I would still have been perfectly qualified but it isn't where my interests lie. The manager then recommended that I apply to a different position under him as an IT support analyst which sounded much more in my wheelhouse and I'm assuming that him telling me to apply for this job under him is a very good sign. My only issue now is that when I look up the new position the average pay is $26 per hour which sounds like a lot for what he was describing. Even the low end shown on glassdoor is nearly $19 per hour which is a lot for low experience job in my area. If this is too high I don't want to put a figure like that on my application and scare them off, but I had also heard that if you lowball the price that can also cause them to ignore the application as it shows that you don't know what the job is. I care much more about getting this job with this company than a potential pay raise so I'm really not sure how much to ask for to have them seriously consider my application. Any advice here or any possible resources to help me learn more would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",23Aug2018,1
44,"A job I recently started back at (left for 3 months and then returned) offered me full benefits and my 3 weeks of vacation for working a reduced schedule (30 hours instead of 40).  Fast forward a couple months and I get an email that my vacation is being prorated since I work a reduced schedule and that I am not entitled to holidays that fall on days I’m not scheduled to work (for full time employees if a holiday falls on a day you don’t work you get a floating holiday to take later when you choose, most people work a 9/80 schedule with every other Friday off).

Great pay (even better in 3 years) and all the union benefits....BUT....as the company is based 2 hours away from me, most of their work is centered around that area. There will be some jobs close to home but most likely I will be around there from what I've been told. They also only pay per diem outside a 30 mile radius from their shop or 20 miles from my home, so if I drive from my home to the town they're based in to work, I don't get any compensation. 

""So relocate!"" That seems like the obvious answer. Well, a little over a year ago I got lucky and landed a position as the caretaker for a historic building/art gallery. I get to live in the apartment there for free (no rent or utilities) as long as I take care of it and the apartment is huge and amazing and I love it. Not to mention it's pretty damn cool living in a old creepy historic mansion. So I really don't want to relocate but this is the best job option I have right now.

52,"My sister is a very hardworking person. I admire her with all my heart. She came to America knowing no english and managed to pass high school with straight A's and get into a good university. I was old enough to know how hard she struggled to pay loans and borrow cars to get to school. It was tough, so i admire her so much. 

However once she graduated she moved in with this guy and i know she's not happy. It's been 5 years since she got with him and she changed fully. She's a bit distant with my family and she always seems stressed. Its been getting worse. Sometimes she opens up about her relationships and about her job, and how she wants to go back to school but that she doesn't have the money. The worst part is she doesn't accept any help. Not mine, not my parents, or her friends. She gets angry when i suggest help, telling me that she doesn't need anyone in order to move forward. And it's worrying me.

 I hate to think how hard she worked just so she can live with depression inside a house with an older boyfriend who treats her like shit and doesnt help her with her troubles. She's 27 and he's like 38. Also he treated her so bad that she doesn't believe that love is real. I have no idea why she stays with him but i don't want her to live her life like that, i want her to leave him and find something she deserves. He doesn't do shit for her but make her take care of his 2 kids. 

Im 16 so there's not much i can do and i tried getting a job but i cant because of some bullshit on my record and it makes me upset. I told her id clear my room so she can move in and settle but she refuses to live with my parents.

53,"So my Dad has had drinking issues for a while. In the spring he was put on a med for alcohol dependency, so his doc must believe that my dad needed it for alcohol dependence.

My mom has threatened to leave/kick him out several times over the past year. I think she’s gone away a few times and she has kicked him out a few times as well. 

Now my mom is asking ME what to do, and I’m just a young adult. Apparently my dad is not willing to go to rehab. He will not admit that he has a problem.

56,"I wasn't sure whether to post this here or r/relationship_advice , so anyways... here's what's going on.   


 This is an issue we've been dealing with in our family since late 2014.   


Ever since our parents got divorced in the late 2000's our family has been divided. I had stopped communicating with the ""father figure"" (my brother and sisters father, my step-father) because he was both physically and mentally abusive towards me throughout my childhood/their marriage, and now that he wasn't married to my mom, *why should* I deal with him? My brother and sister, however, chose to move in with him over our mother due to his ""more friend than parent"" type lifestyle towards them. Since they moved in with them, my siblings grew a lot of animosity towards our mother. It's always a new reason why they dislike her, and it's never consistent. The only one that was moderately reoccuring is that ""she tore our family apart for dad trying to be a good person."" He cheated on our mother with a woman who just had her first child and was buying her infant diapers and playing daddy over in her house instead of being home with us. I don't know how that makes him a good person, but whatever. 

Anyways, after moving in with her father, my sister would still occasionally give our mother the benefit of the doubt and spend time with our mom after me messaging her time and time again about how our mother has cried to me about missing my siblings, constantly asking me how they're doing, and trying to use me as a source of information about their lives because they decided to go NC (no contact) on her for virtually a bullshit reason that they were manipulated into believing by their father. 

In 2014, my sister met someone and started seeing him (late 20s M) seriously. He met both my mother and myself on separate occasions and it seemed like everything was finally getting back to some sense of normalcy and civility. It was like everyone, sister's father excluded, was finally getting along. At this time my sister was no longer living with her father/our mother's ex, was living on her own, and was finally rebuilding her connection with our mother via plenty of mother/daughter day dates doing miscellaneous shit. Everyone was happy. Then she got pregnant. 

I found out my sister was pregnant through our mother who called me, crying, partially incomprehensible, stating my sister called her while she (our mother) was on her way to work, stating ""I am pregnant. You're a horrible person who was never around. I want you out of my life, and you can rest assure you're going to have NOTHING to do with my child."" 

It really blindsided both my mother and me, not to mention, my sister's boyfriend/now-fiance (I don't remember if he proposed before or after pregnancy was announced). He messaged me stating he was completely uncomfortable with my sister's reborn animosity towards our mother as it came out of nowhere, and was confused why she'd chose to blacklist our mother when her father was obviously the ""threat"" (if any) towards the child due to his ""mentally unstable, alcoholic personality."" 

Fast forward to Feburary 2018

I came back home for a visit (I live out of state now) and got the chance to go spend time with my sister, now brother-in-law, and finally meet my niece! While spending my few days in their home I was given the news that my sister was pregnant and wants this child, too, to not have anything to do with our mother. Later that evening, my sister gets tired and goes to bed while her husband and I stay up for a while and begin to talk. 

He's still 100% against my sister being NC with our mother and bringing their child into it. He's not too fond of his father-in-law still and really does not want the child being around him, but my sister insists the child needs to know her grandfather. Brother-in-law states he's tried to bring these concerns up about why my sister wants her child around an alcoholic, but not our mother who he's heard virtually nothing bad about except for things her father has told her has happened (which didn't). He also states that he has been keeping in contact with our mother behind my sister's back and was looking for a way to ""sneak a visit"" between her and the child, but was scared my sister would leave him if she found out. I address his concerns and tell him that I don't know what he expects me to do because I'm absolutely positive if i address my sister's toxic behavior in any way, no matter how delicately I approach the situation, that I'm scared she'd go NC with me, taking my niece and future nephew along with her. 

**How, if in anyway possible, can I address my sister's behavior over our mother who's done nothing wrong, and help her realize that her father is an abusive, manipulative, alcoholic who has essentially brainwashed her into hating our mother over made up bullshit?** 

I've always stayed in contact with my sister (mostly because she's a huge braggart who loves showing off how much better she's doing than everyone), so I've known what's going on every step of the way with her since before and after the divorce. I know how her father has mentally abused her, called her plenty of names, and etc whenever she doesn't do what he wants her to, or whatever the situation may be. I also know how our mother stepped in and took her to doctor's appointments when the father refused to make them when she was sick, hurting, or etc. Our mother has stepped in and been ""the hero"", so to speak, in literally every situation where the father didn't get his way and took it out on my sister post-divorce.

57,"Aright, so first some background : me and her are freshmen, her man is a sophomore in highschool. I started talking to her because I liked her, it never went anywhere, but we became and still are really good friends. 

Now, her and (let’s call him x) have been “on and off dating” for four years according to her. Afaik, they’ve broken up several times but are back together. X is always the one to break up, and the last break up happened in 7th grade at a rail cats game. I remember my friend (call her z) talk about how much she hurt and how x got with someone after her. 

They’ve started again towards the end of 8th and are still dating. They argue and z gets jealous of girls x talks to. Afaik z is completely hung up on x and still really into him. People also regularly talk to me about her (our history is public) and how x hurt her. Today, I got these messages from her : https://imgur.com/a/EOcMhrx


I hear my school counselors talk about emotional abuse and how it’s hard to see these things, and this kind of raised some alarms. It’s probably nothing, but I want to make sure. I’ve never talked to a counselor about anything like this, and I know that if I do talk to one and then something happens, z is gonna know what I did and probably just refuse to talk to me again. 

I don’t want to lose a close friend, but I want the best for her. I can 100% say that I’m not doing this because of my past feelings, they’re gone. I just need a second opinion before I do anything and probably ruin a friendship for life. ",23Aug2018,1
58,"I'm kind of a socially awkward person who has AvPD but try my best to hide it and my issues from others, as it would be too overwhelming for anyone who knows me to deal with.  

I basically feel like my existence is tolerated by everyone and I usually have a huge crying fest after school. I feel as if I'm not important enough because everyone I know has their own favorite person they'd rather talk to or hang out with and I'm just there. I have people to hang out with at school but I can tell they all like each other better and it's hard not to feel like the tag-along. I know that making good friends takes time but nowadays it feels near impossible because it's like every person I meet seems to already have their established friend groups and can't be bothered, unless if you happen to be that needle in the haystack they happen to click with so perfectly.

Today was my first day back to uni and all of my friends kind of pulled a 360 and all started speaking French among each other, and because my French isn't up too par with theirs, I was too shy to say anything. They all know that I didn't grow up speaking French, but English, so whenever they speak French among each other I know that it's never directed to me, hence the feelings of being left out. Last school year when we all didn't know each other too well, we would all speak English. Keep in mind, I go to an English speaking university in a French city, to give more context. 

I'm tired of feeling like I'm not good enough, and I might break down in school, but I really don't want it to happen. Any tips or advice?

I have 2nd period with girl she’s not the prettiest girl in the world but at this point I just want someone I can be with so anyways I guess she’s new to my school and doesn’t have any friends yet, I’ve seen her walking and standing by herself during lunch, so one day she’s sitting on a lone bench by herself and I decided to talk to her and get her snap. We snap a couple times and I keep spending the whole lunch time with her for like a week and a half and on one of those days I said joking  around  and said “if she was sick of me yet”and she replied “ hell no” 

So we keep talking and one day we’re talking about her ex during lunch and I asked her how long has it been since you’ve been in a relationship and she tells me it’s been 2 years, and as she’s finishing saying all about that she says that “everyone plays games and she wants something serious”. At this point I’m thinking all alright I’m going to actually try to get at this girl until 2 days ago were snapping to each other and she posts a picture on her story with a guy that has  a wife beater on and a hairy chest captioned “miss my boo” and I guess that snap was from 2 months ago but she reuploaded it and the caption on that one said “All Summer 2k18” 

As of right now I don’t know what to do, do I try to talk to her again and ask her if she’s single again or do I try to explain who that was on her snap?

WARNING -- MANY OBSCENITIES AND POSSIBLY A TRIGGER

​

I'm  terrified I'm a pedophile.  I'm a male who is in his late teens in high school. I am very much attracted to girls my age and older. As a young boy, I was never attracted to anyone more than a year younger than me. When I was twelve  or so, though, I would go on YouTube and search things like ""12 year  old girl dance"" and it would bring me upon videos of girls who were  quite a bit younger than 12 (maybe 10). I think I did this until I was  maybe 14 or 15 years old. I got a shit ton of bad shit in my YouTube recommendations from looking at those videos of girls my age which I then clicked on those videos and was turned on I think. I also looked at jail-bait. When I was 16, I started  looking at a site with alluring photos (legal) of girls who were often  14-15. I felt incredibly guilty each time I used it, and I would obsess over the guilt and anxiety for days. I try not to use it  these days, but sometimes I do and I feel terrible afterwards. I also  feel attracted to 14-15 year old girls on Instagram. I don't want to be.  I don't know if it's normal to be attracted to this age at my age, but I  feel terrible because of it. I often worry I'm attracted to very little  girls as well. I have many intrusive thoughts of little girls doing  things I'd rather not mention and they make me feel like a piece of  shit. I sometimes contemplate killing myself because of all of this (but  not seriously yet). Today, however, I did something really shitty and I  feel terrible which is why I'm writing this. I'm also questioning  whether or not I feel terrible and my mind is telling me I enjoyed it. I  went on YouTube to see this 15 year old girl from Instagram, and I was  incredibly turned on already. A bunch of little girls doing yoga videos  and whatnot popped up in recommended for some reason (I was using a TOR  browser so it's not from my Google activity). I clicked on those videos  because I wanted to prove to myself I am not attracted to little girls,  but I ended up finishing on one of the videos. The girl looked like she  was maybe 11 or 12 (maybe younger or older, I'm not a very good judge of  age which is one reason why I check the age of any girl I am attracted  to on Instagram). JESUS I FEEL LIKE SUCH A PIECE OF SHIT! I enjoyed it I  think but I can't tell if it's because I was aroused or because I'm a  pedophile. I hate this shit I hate it so much. I feel like a freak. I  feel contaminated. I should mention I have anxiety disorders. I have  many other OCD characteristics as well (Harm OCD, for example--I also have worried I am a sociopath). I feel so  shitty. I feel contaminated even submitting this. Of course I'm probably  not going to believe it even if someone tells me I'm not a pedophile,  but I guess I'm submitting this because I want to be told that. I do  want honesty though. I've never done anaything about this (as in acting  on urges \[which I don't have generally toward anyone below 14 I think  but I don't know anymore maybe I do\]). I do feel the urge to look at  14-15 year old girls though which sometimes brings me to the shit I  mentioned earlier). Anyway, I'm scared. Sorry for being so disorganized  and lacking grammar in this post...I'm in a TOR browser which is slow. All I want is to be a healthy, well-functioning member of society  who contributes toward the betterment of humanity. I feel like a  contaminated, fraudulent piece-of-shit though. It makes it difficult for  me to socialize because I feel so fucking contaminated and paranoid.  Maybe I'm a pedophile with POCD or maybe I just am a pure one fuck I don't know. I'm fucking tearing  up. I will get castrated if I am.

​

Edit:  I'm not attracted whatsoever IRL--that I know for a fact. Could it be  the camera simply distorts the image, if I was in fact attracted? Maybe  I'm just making shitty excused. I feel like a piece of shit fuck  I  can't stop thinking about this.

Edit: I  do have many intrusive thoguhts though IRL and I check my groin a lot to  see if there is a response sometimes there is and I'm incredibly  worried I'm a pedo.",23Aug2018,0
69,"Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this. I'll trying to keep this as concise as possible.

If it matters: Male and 27 y/o

To begin, let's go back to early 2016. I was hired to an automotive service company right after graduating with my BS in Mechatronics. I was told at hire that I would be a bridge between the electrical and mechanical groups. Cool!

soon after, I get my first project, and it pretty simple. Making brackets for sensors, radar, and some component packaging. Then, later in that year, I begin on another project doing the exact same thing, but I also began my masters in Electric Vehicle Engineering. 

I expressed to my boss and that I wanted to delve deeper into the EV field and I ask if there were projects coming up that would involve EV's to grow this skill of mine. I was told ""nothing that is coming anytime soon"", which I understand that is the way service goes.

In the start of 2017,  I get another project to make more brackets for sensors and radars. At this point I've realized that I am not building any experience towards my actual career goals since this is the 3rd project in a row. I also bring this up in my yearly review.

Jumping to mid-2017 I am put onto a heavy truck program to keep track of the suppliers of brake components. There was absolutely nothing EV or mechatronics related. I have to pick up the pieces from someone else and I had a huge learning curve because of my background and I know I caused some slow downs on that project...

After that I made brackets again for a active suspension project. I was hoping i'd get to help with that more in depth as a mechatronics student, but no just brackets, mounts, and component packaging... again

Moving into 2018, I am now on another autonomous project that is electric this time, but I am working on tires... while in my master courses at uni, I am learning about batteries and their chemistries , electric motors, drive cycles, fuel cells, power electronics, electric Motor control theory,etc... 

I asked my boss about a switch of departments to another since they are actively working on EV projects in the field of which I study. But now when I applied, I am told I don't have enough experience. But they ""definitely"" want to bring me over. but that was what I was told in the beginning of 2018. It's now end of Aug and there is no movement no change. 

Last week, I decieded to update my linkedin and started getting messages for recruiters. I spoke to one and he said "" your resume looks good, but your experience at your current job is kind of ... gerneric and may prove difficult to get you into a role you would fit"" 

&amp;#x200B;

so for my question:

should i stay at my current job and wait for something and have a guaranteed entry to EV role/position but not know when that will be?

Or start looking even harder for other companies and have to start at an entry level all over again or take a side step position? 

TL;DR:

I am working in the automotive service, I only get simple projects or ones that doesn't fit my expertise or promote my growth in EVs. I have asked for a change in departments but that has fallen on deaf ears it seems. Spoke to managers in EV department and the say they want to bring me over, but no change or movement. I recently started looking for other jobs but I would have to start at the bottom again potentially. Do I get a new job or stay with my current one? ",23Aug2018,1
70,"I have not spoken to my father in almost a decade and now I would like to contact him. I am not able to ask any family members that I still have contact with for information. The only person that *might* know how to contact him is my mother but she and I aren't often on speaking terms. When I do try to ask her she refuses to help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want his phone number to call him. Does anyone have advice on how to find this? We are in the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have his full name, age, and a very old address that he definitely no longer lives at. I believe I know what state he is in but that could have changed by now as well. He previously owned a business that appears to be gone now as all phone numbers for it are disconnected and the website is down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plenty of search websites claim to know where he is and what his phone number is. They show some information that is correct on him (list correct relatives, correct old address, etc.) but they all want me to pay for phone numbers and I am skeptical. I don't mind to pay if that is what has to happen, but I don't want some sketchy website charging more on my card than they should or worse then not even giving me accurate information. I have tried Facebook but he does not appear to be on it, not that I could find anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've searched obituaries in the area as well for him with no luck, thankfully. Please help me find him, tell me where is a reliable place to look. ",23Aug2018,1
71,"I'll try to keep the story short. I ordered delivery from a place a couple weeks ago and this (super cute) girl delivered it. She noticed what I was watching on TV (an anime called The Disastrous Life of Saiki K) and we talked about it for a minute since neither of us knew anyone else who watched it before saying goodbye. Today I ordered from the same place and the same girl delivered it. She noticed I was watching a different anime and we started talking about. She went to suggest another show but couldn't remember the name of it and said ""You'll have to order again soon so I can remember it and tell you...or if you want just give me your number and I'll text you!"".

I'm really bad at accepting the fact that a girl might be into me but even this feels like something someone wouldn't do if they weren't at least a little interested right? Like if you were in her shoes you wouldn't give out your number to someone, similar interests or not, if you weren't interested would you?",23Aug2018,1
72,"I can not stand him. He is abusive and treats my mom like crap. She is planning on going on a business trip with him tomorrow, but I already told her I’m not letting her go alone. I’m going to skip school if she goes. I don’t want her to go . He is a danger to both of us and I don’t want him hurting my mom. 

My mom does everything for him and really wants to divorce him now, even though she just put up with abuse for so many years. The problem is my mom and I cannot afford to live alone or the divorce costs.  My grandma would probably cover the lawyer and divorce costs but we have a hard time living on two incomes; it would be even harder on just one. Not to mention my dad has forced her into signing everything even when she doesn’t want to so all of the bills and contracts are in her name. Also the jerk won’t agree to a divorce unless my mom sells our house and gives him 60% of the money - my mom will not agree to that. And he won’t agree to a divorce unless she sells the house.

75,"I was bullied for eight years, from kindergarten to Year Eight. In Year Eleven, when I finally found a close friendship with someone in my year, that ended badly. She hated me, without saying why. Months later, I found out, rather ironically, that she thought I was after a relationship ""among many other reasons.""

That's it. I have never had any friends. I never experienced what I should have in childhood and adolescence. I had acquaintances and people I was cool with, but I never had a sidekick. I know most of the answers:

* You have plenty of time left (I am 23). 
* You can learn to soothe yourself when things go wrong, and find fulfillment and confidence in yourself...

However, I am just angry that I will never get that time back. I am also worried about whether that might harm my relationships in the future, and I have never gotten a sufficient answer to that. 

Do you think talking about it with a counselor will help. I have been bottling it in, because as I said, I have no one to vent to. I have already talked about it online on a previous account, but I have had times where I have gotten no responses because the thread is more than 200 words long. TLDR, as they say. Also, it feels really impersonal.

81,"First and foremost, we’re both just entering high school. That obviously doesn’t make it impossible, just less likely. Secondly, I’m no psychologist, and the only opinion I have is of my other friend (I’ll get to this).

The story goes like this. After knowing this friend for a while, I know how she acts. She usually never curses, has a really difficult time saying negative things against awful people in her life (let’s just say one of these awful people has done really bad and illegal things), let alone saying anything remotely bad about anyone she’s friends with or even likes. This summer; however, I noticed her slowly begin to break down this mental block and begin first by finally severing ties with aforementioned awful person (finally) and eventually cursing when quoting other people, having thoughts of cursing at other when they bug her (told me about it after the fact, but didn’t say anything), and other small stuff like this. I know it sounds like nothing, but trust me when I say this is extremely out of character for her. She also seemed to get less and less interested in her friends, me included. She doesn’t even recognize some of our inside jokes, and from what I’ve heard, another one of her close friends has had something similar happen to him. Worse yet is that she was debating giving up on getting into a preforming arts school she’d been after since kindergarten despite having a chance to audition again for a sophomore transfer. Finally, she’s starting to alter the parts of herself that she doesn’t like. She’s always had bad self esteem, and always thought of herself as an unlikeable person, both because she thought she was ugly and a bad person (Ok, she’s not the hottest girl in the world, but she’s not ugly and is one of the nicest people at our school). She’s never liked her curly hair, so she decided that if she couldn’t permanently straighten it, she d permanently dye it. Furthermore, she wants a nose job. I don’t have an issue that she’s doing these things, but she’s only 14 and it seems odd that she’d want to make a  semi-permanent decision at her current age, and along with everything else I’ve seen, it doesn’t sit right.

 profitable own company I can be proud of

--

* Good health:
No health problems

--

* Great relationship in which we complement each other well (marry before I turn 30):
Exchange of future ideas,
 share the same passion/route,
 share the same way of thinking about business and life

--

* Spacious living space with space around the house house (before I turn 35):
House with a balcony facing the sea/mountains,
 alone standing house with enough space around it for kids to play, cars to park, build on

--

* Luxury car that I can be proud of (before I turn 28):
BMW/Mercedes

--

* Good example / role model for my environment (from now on):
People appreciate what I do, for my hard working,
 being kind in all circumstances,
 never talk about people or have a prejudice 

--

* Children (before I turn 30):
Having at least 2 children

--

* Starting motivated and passionate every day (from now on):
Have a great life to wake up to, full of energy and positive mindset

--

* Music (from now on):
Enjoy music every day to achieve good vibes and to relax

--

* Travel (when the time is available at this moment):
Travel the world to see our planet, meet new people, learn their way of thinking, connect with them

Sounds all very good to my opinion, the problem is I don't know how I can achieve it.
Currently I'm working at the airport but I'm not happy at all. I've done several studies but didn't find the 'THIS IS IT' -effect.

So did some others jobs and tried several things, I even created my own company but not sure what way to go with it. I would love to be an entrepeneur and I don't want anything else than that.

--

I'm currently at point 'A' and want to go to 'C' which are my life goals. As you can see point 'B' is missing, the way to achieve this.

How do I get out of this frustrating cycle? It's really bothering me and I don't know how to escape it and really start living the life I want. I'm a positive person overall but this effects my life in so many ways.

93,"Some background:

My family and I, moved into our current house in 2005 and that is when I first met my neighbor Joe. He was a truck driver that had retired after an injury and was living alone in the four bedroom house next door, ever since his divorce. Over the years he has seen me grow into an adult, get married and have three wonderful children. He had five kids of his own but they hardly ever visited and some had ended all contact with Joe. 

When we first moved into this new subdivision he had been a very active individual, loved his lawn and was almost always on his patio or backyard working on his property. However, over the years he seemed depressed and lonely. He started drinking regularly and even began smoking. Joe eventually asked me to set him up with a online profile so he could meet someone, which I did, but I don't think he had much luck since he didn't know how to use his computer. He did eventually meet a women while on vacation at some resort and got married soon after. But she wasn't loyal and used him to sponsor her kids from her previous marriage, and once they got here she basically side lined him. This of course got him back into his depression and he began drinking heavily and I believe at this point he was smoking more than a pack a day. Which eventually caused his liver to fail and a whole slew of health issues. His new wife on decided she couldn't deal with him and moved out with her kids (I think she was cheating on him anyways). 

Last week I saw his new wife and her eldest daughter moving furniture back into their house, but didn't think much of it and minded my own business. But since that day u hadn't seen Joe, usually I always saw him sitting on his porch, be it early morning or late at night, he would be in his chair with a bottle and lit cigarette.  Finally today, I saw his wife coming home and I asked her whereabouts of Joe, she told me that he had fallen sick and had called her to assist him. Joe mentioned earlier that she comes by once a week  to help around the house and with groceries. Apparently he wasn't well so she took him to the hospital and two days latter he fell into a coma and is currently in the ICU in what might be his final days. 

The news shook me more than I thought it would. I mean, I knew his days were numbered once I saw him drinking heavily and smoking non stop, but it was still a shock hearing he might not be around anymore. I asked his wife which hospital he is at and his room number etc. And now I am not sure of I should visit him at the hospital or just wait to see if he passes and attend his funeral? He won't know I am even there since he is in a coma and has been for the past three days, I don't know his family since they never really visited him, but his wife says they are there with him now (I guess, to divide his assets among themselves)... Over the years we spoke and helped each other out in whatever ways we could but we were never really close as in having shared bbqs etc... What should I do in this situation?",23Aug2018,1

4 years ago I moved to Florida for a job in sports and during my first week at the new job the topic of 9/11 came up and for some reason I decided to say I was in the first tower that day and narrowly escaped with my life. I think I just did it to seem cool and have people think I was interesting. It was not brought up much since then until last week.

&amp;#x200B;

People at work have been mentioning it and bringing it up a lot and I say I don't want to talk about it because it is such a terrible memory for me but the more it happens the more I think somebody caught on to my lie somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

I have gotten 2 promotions since then and am working my way up in the company pretty quickly. I think it is too late to come clean.

&amp;#x200B;

Need advice.

He left but told her he would return in 3 weeks.

I’m trying to figure out the best way to let him know that he is to never knock on my sister’s door again and to leave her alone.

102,"So she and her kids moved in about a couple months ago and we aren't that close yet. It was kind of sudden because I haven't met her and her kids until she moved in, but my dad has been dating her for a year. Anyway I've gotten some time to meet them and know them better a bit but I know this is kinda harsh but I dont think she is a good parent. I know she loves her kids but I dont think she's raising them fairly.

She has three kids, the oldest child is Allen (11), Erick (8), and Isabel (4). Allen is obese and is in special needs because he has hearing issues, he often has to take care of his Erick and Isabel. Now the thing is that these kids don't seem to have any manners at all. During breakfast and dinner time we all eat together and they talk and chew with their mouth open all the time, sometimes on purpose or just naturally and this personally annoys the hell out of me but I dont want to seem rude or leave a bad impression on them by telling them to stop. 

Based on my assumption I believe that she didn't cook before if not rarely for them before she moved in with us because of some of the comments her kids gave when she cooks like ""you're cooking again?!?"". I believe these kids diet before consisted nothing but cereal, frozen chicken nuggets, or bread with a shit load of mayonnaise on them because that's all they seem to ask for all the time. I feel sorry for them because sometimes they cry because they have to eat real food with vegetables (even small things like tomatoes) instead of their usual cereal or other junk. One day I found the mom giving them cereal before we ate so we didn't hear them cry or complain about eating what she cooked. I know what they eat is killing them because Allen and Erik are already having breathing issues (which I find loud breathing also annoying). Isabel will probably end up being obese too based on her eating habits for example I found out she drank 7 cokes in one day. I don't know if these kids know or care about how bad their health is gonna be in the future. 

Finally I see that the mom go to solution on making Isabel to settle down is to shove a phone in her face. I also realized that some of the stuff Isabel watches is elsagate. Erick is glued to his tablet playing Roblox and Allen is glued to his switch playing fortnite. I also see and hear 5he stuff they watch on YouTube and I just get disturbed at the youtubers they watch. 

Side Note: their dog also seems to not have manners because I had to potty train him, keep him from searching the trash, teach him to stop getting on the table, etc. Their dog is wild and keep in mind that he's supposedly 2 years old. (My dog hates him).

Anyway I know this is kinda long but what should I do? I dont wanna make them hate me or make them feel like I'm judging them. I really wanna help them for my sake and theirs. Or should I just not do anything? Am I complaining too much or am I just too young to understand? What do you guys think?

However, the typical response is a lot of anger and energy which causes me to get defensive. The anger causes a scene and instead of solving anything it gets escalated and heated. She then continued to state how it was my fault that the other person's feelings were hurt. Either way it doesn't matter if she's right or I'm right.

109,"I am currently on my vacation for high school, and before I start my school year, I would like to change my study habits.
For years now, I've been slacking off during school years: not really studying for any tests, doing the bare minimum to get an A, procrastinating until the last minute ... and most of these bad habits were formed due to having very little negative consequences come out of them. Although I haven't excelled in studying, my grades have been fine. I've been taking fairly easy classes for most of my school career; however, as I take more advanced classes in high school, I understand that i'm going to have to change if I want to maintain my good grades. Last year was the first time I've taken one of the advanced classes, and let me just tell you, I was not ready for it. As a result of my poor study habits I had developed over the years, I had a very hard time integrating into the difficult class. However, next year, i'm going to be taking much more of these advanced classes, mostly because I need a step-up in the difficulty of my ""regular"" classes. Additionally, I've had taken standardized tests, and will be taking it again in the future, but I haven't developed the discipline to just sit down and study what I need to. 
I need advice on how I would go about developing better study habits. My experience with studying is very low. I've attempted to  go cold turkey: change my schedule up to have more time for studying instead of my usual relaxing, but it's been extremely difficult and I always find myself coming back to my old bad habits (kinda like addiction).

110,"I first met this guy in high school when I was 16. We had a weird first sexual experience which made his friends call me a hoe. So while I was in high school we’d hookup sometimes but not hangout much because I was unpopular . He moved out of state so I’d send him nudes like once a week and talk sometimes


He cheated with me once when I didn’t know he was dating someone. That was two years of knowing him.I went on a trip for 3 months and my phone broke. When I got home and bought a new one I had like 40 messages from him. I haven’t seen him for three years I’ve known him for five.


He said when I was younger he only sees me as sex that’s when I went and did other things. We talked from time to time for two years then started dating someone serious. I didn’t talk to him for six months . Then he was messaging me a bunch saying he missed me and sending sexual photos from over two years ago of us. 


I say I don’t want to talk when he has a girlfriend. He then posts on the one social media I have (and not others I checked) tons of pics with his girlfriend when he never had. Then he sends me tons of messages everyday for five weeks straight asking why I’m ignoring him and asking if I’m okay. Then he asks if if he breaks up with his girlfriend if we would be cool again. I ignore it. Then he actually breaks up with her and texts me he’s single. I talk to him a couple weeks later once then I don’t text him he doesn’t text me.


I hear he has a new girlfriend. I had unadded him on the one social media. He messaged me a few weeks later asking why I unadded him. I added him back and changed the subject and he talked to me like he normally would. Then a few weeks later when I text him he says he has girlfriend and can’t talk to me right now.


Again I don’t talk to him or have him on social media for seven months. Then he blows up my phone again in the same way after dating this new girl for like a year. He still has sexual photos of me from three years ago that he sent to me.



Why does this guy keep doing this? Why doesn’t he just go date his girlfriends? Why does he keep photos of me? He’s dated a good number of people so why not move on ?

I go to coffee shops and bars on my own, but in bars it can be a bit awkward sitting on my own - I think as I'm a woman it's a bit weirder to people, maybe they think I'm waiting for a date and have gotten stood up or something - if there's a gig people will stand in front of me and if busy I just end-up taking up tables other people want.

117,"My new physics tutor is quite a fair bit crazy. I met him an hour and a half ago for my physics lesson, and he initially seemed a little bit odd - he wanted to know where my refrigerator was because he was electrosensitive to refrigerators (but nothing else). That said, I told him that it was in the kitchen and wouldn't bother him and so we started doing some physics work.

Then he went on an hour-long tirade about how quantum physics and relativity are hoaxes perpetrated by Jews trying to suppress good Christian scientists like Nikola Tesla and Walter Russell.

He also tried debunking galactic inflation, but when I pointed out that the Big Bang was theorised before relativity and proven by people like Hubble using observations of redshifts of distant objects, he said that it's just a coincidence that relativity supports that one true thing.

When I asked about the Michelson Morley experiment which showed that the speed of light is constant regardless of one's relative velocity, he said that that was accurate but that things could still move faster than the speed of light. When I asked about how the logical conclusions from that show Lorentz transformations and time dilation and whatnot to be things, he conceded initially that those were true. Then when I showed that it's therefore impossible for any object initially moving less than the speed of light to accelerate to faster than the speed of light he backtracked and said that the Michelson Morley experiment must have produced incorrect results, declining to explain what was wrong with it.

Also the only force that exists is electromagnetism, because mass, gravity and nuclear forces aren't real and are just illusions.

Anyway, I invited a crazy guy into my home to teach me physics. He isn't violent (but I was playing along with him anyway to some degree to try to avoid that, so who knows), but he's convinced that my textbook is trying to brainwash me. And he might show up at the same time next week.

As he's almost 17 I was so outraged by this disgusting sexual predator behavior I banded together with some mates and we made a page of him on Encyclopedia Dramatica to ward parents off who might search his name on Google to find videos for their kids to watch. It includes his real name, some pics of him, pics of his gross encounters, and a picture of his idiotic mom and dad with the usual mockery (I live in a state without Cyberbullying laws I should mention).

Their son is severely depressed about this and I'm worried he might kill himself (As he's used the suicide card before for stupid things). I can't delete the article it has too much public interest and an attempt to do so would fail so the article is permanent.

She can't press legal charges against the site not only is it hosted abroad but it's protected by free speech and isn't harassment technically as the pictures used are all public domain and the doxing came from other users that weren't me and they got it from ways that weren't from the article.

I️t is a sport I want to play for a long time and have fun playing. I do enjoy working out at the gym, improving my body + strength and practicing driving, so maybe that is something. School is also way important to me (Have a 3.7 GPA) I want to work hard in school to maintain good grades. Plus, I need to take the SAT soon. Just so many other things that are more important to me.

136,"After deciding to transfer colleges and move back home while I take a semester off, I started a new food service job in June to keep me busy and to save for school. At the beginning of August, the general manager asked if I would be interested in becoming an assistant manager. She said I would get a raise of “about a dollar per hour”. I eagerly agreed as it would mean more consistent hours, the pay raise, and a nice addition to my resume. I have been informally training for the position for about two weeks now.

When I was offered the position, the GM indicated that I would need to interview with the district manager. This past weekend while I was working the DM was at our store for the day but did not interview me. However, the GM had a conversation including myself and the DM about how well my training is going, and that I should be ready to work independently soon.

I do have a few reservations about the job. I don’t feel that a dollar per hour is a fair pay raise for the new responsibility I would be taking on, and I am uncomfortable being in the store alone at night. I’m in an awkward position now. I was going to bring these things up to the DM during my interview, but it doesn’t seem that I will have that opportunity. How do I bring up these concerns with my GM after I seemingly agreed to this new job two weeks ago? Any advice is appreciated!",23Aug2018,1
137,"I suppose I have felt this way for some time now, however it has been looming over me quite heavily this past week in particular. I’m a 20 year old male and I feel like I’m not really doing anything with my life and I don’t know how to change it/where to start. I feel like I’m stuck in oblivion, as Mac miller would put it. 

I’m in college right now but I don’t really like my university or my major. The deadline has already passed to transfer schools or I would have done that. I do think I would like to graduate and get a degree, but I have no idea what career to pursue. I thought about taking a semester off but I’m afraid of taking time off from school because I’m scared I won’t go back or that I’ll spend too much time sitting around doing nothing. My best friends recently both moved out of state to attend a new college, so I’ve been spending a lot of time alone recently. After high school I only kept in contact with a smaller group of people and I haven’t really made any friends at college so I don’t really have anyone to hangout with anymore. 

Right now I’m living at home with my dad. I used to have a part time job but ended up quitting after my motivation to do anything dropped off the deep end. I feel like my lack of direction and goals has caused a serious lack of motivation in myself. Having nothing to work towards makes many things feel trivial or meaningless. 

I do have some hobbies, I like photography, playing my Nintendo switch, fishing, listening to music, going to the gym. Although these things do feel a bit stale/not as interesting as of lately. Also hobbies become harder to find when you don’t have a job anymore.

To finish this post, I would like to make it clear that I did not come to this sub with the expectation of receiving any type of professional mental health help/advice. I do think I struggle with depression and seeing a therapist is something that I will definitely consider if my family is able to afford it. I just wanted to see if anyone here could maybe share some tips on how to find some direction in life or maybe some steps to take in order to work towards getting back on track. Hopefully I’ve been able to accurately describe my situation. Thanks for taking the time to read this, I appreciate it.",23Aug2018,1
138,"This might be a little long. So I'm about to start my sophomore year in college and my first year sucked to be honest. I went through a major depressive episode in the spring semester and I really only had one friend which at least made things better at times. My girlfriend was back home and I really missed her but thankfully she's starting at the same college this year and we'll be together. So I'm looking to have a much better year but there is a bunch of decisions to make coming up soon which can completely determine how I'll be spending the majority of my time this year. I'm looking to get involved this year with a club while also trying to decide what to major in which effectively decides what career I will have. 
I'm deciding between creative writing and theatre for my major and I really have no idea which to choose. I'm taking another writing class this semester and I participated in acting in student films last semester. I'm thinking about trying out for the plays this year but I also wanted to join the baseball club since that is my favorite sport and I really feel like I'm leaning towards that as of right now. However, the play and baseball club are both huge time commitments and I don't know if I would get a part when I audition or if I'd even make the team at tryouts. I know one could help decide my major so should I do that or is acting in student films enough? I'm just really stressed and don't know how to choose!
TLDR
-needs to decide major between theatre or creative writing
-also needs to choose between theatre play and baseball club for school club
-One is for fun (baseball) while one may help decide major and could possibly be fun (play)",23Aug2018,0

155,"I've pretty much already made up my mind that I'm going to quit my fast food job. Schoolwork is stacking up and I need my outside-class time for extracurriculars. 

Also, the manager is very disorganized and untrustworthy. When I first got the job, he said he'd make the schedule to work with my school schedule, saying that I could work 3 days, 2 days, or even 1 day if I wanted. On the last day of summer break, my manager literally called me on the day OF to work, giving me a 4 hour notice. When I told him I couldn't because I was literally out of town, he actually seemed mad I wasn't available. He then told me that he expects me to work at least 3 shifts a week during school, which I know some people manage, but personally I can't. He went back on his promise at the beginning. Also more importantly, he shorted me a whole day worth of hours on my latest paycheck. When I was first training he punched in my hours for me because the schedule wasn't made for me yet. On my latest paycheck, I noticed that I wasn't paid for a whole day. I had to tell him and explain to him, so now he supposedly put it on next week's paycheck. Am I wrong to be mad at him?

Anyways I can explain more if needed, but I just want out now. I'm planning to give my two weeks notice on Sunday, but I'm not sure what to say. Should I be honest and say this simply won't work out with my schedule? Or should I just say there's a family emergency or something? I also heard to always thank them at the end, even though I'm not planning to use him as a reference.

Female, 8 months, about 70lbs, not fixed, unknown breed(all I know it mother was a pit or part pit), this is her [here](https://imgur.com/a/FypASV5)

(She is a little bigger now then she is in the pool pic) 

Got her when she was 3 months. She warmed up to us pretty quickly.... but she is only comfortable with me, my bf, and Mom. (We all live in the home) we have 3 other dogs that she gets along with too.... 

But anytime we have a guest she hides under the table or hides in a bedroom. She is VERY afraid. Even after a couple hours of the guest trying to gain her trust she will not approach. It’s so bad that she had anal leakage from fear...  a guest tried to touch her and we immediately smelled something very bad and saw brown wet drops on the floor.... she is just so terrified. When children try to approach her in the corner or under a table when she’s hiding she shows her teeth and has snapped at them.

She’s also very sensitive to noise... terrified of the vacuum, she runs and hides in another room. If we open a package/box/mail and it makes a noise she freaks and bolts. She is so afraid of so many things.

She is very comfortable when it’s just us, she cuddles and plays and trusts us. Sometimes when I reach out to pet her she pulls back.. but for the most part she is comfortable. 

I wanted to get her some obedience training but she is just so scared of other humans idk how it would work.

We tried a park visit once and as soon as anyone was within eye sight she was trying to run away and bolt.

I need to get her fixed soon and I’m worried about how her vet visit will go. I’m concerned she may bite the vet or poop all over the place.

Is this anxiety? How can I help her? Could medication be an option? (Dog Xanax or something) She is still a puppy and I want to help her while she’s still young.

159,"Hi guys! Lately I’ve been thinking about moving out. I just turned 18 and am in my second year of college (skipped a grade) and am feeling like its almost my time.


My parents were generous enough to let me use their car for transportation and are paying for my first 4 years of school. In exchange, I pick up and take care of my sister, clean around the house, pay for all my personal needs, and pay for the car’s insurance, gas, and maintenance.


However, this is beginning to conflict with school and work. I am out of a job right now and if I had the time available, I would be able to work late afternoons/evenings. My mother told me I have to dedicate this time to picking up my sister from school and watching her. This also interferes with class.

This year I am taking 3 major courses (Chem/Calc/Bio) with 10 minute breaks in between to accommodate my sister. I am also unable to get experience through extra lab work in my free time (something necessary in the field I’m studying).

Some privacy and full freedom would be nice (they don’t like me staying out late).


I have $1,500 and intend to have 2-3x that amount by this time next year. The car isn’t under my name, so I may need to purchase a used one. I would be living the in LB area, since I go to school there.

164,"I hear formatting is a problem on mobile so if that is an issue I apologize. Anywho.

I'm not very close to my family. In place of a rant about them, I'll just say they are unpleasant to be around. My little brother on the other hand is a pretty rad dude, calls me his favorite and everything, sweet kid. His dad is always working, and my mom doesn't play with him, but since they live close by I visit a lot to play Legos or Minecraft with him. 

Lately, he's been afraid to go down halls, to his room, even the bathroom. Says there are ghosts. Now, I left this up to kids imagination, and told him not to worry, nothing's there, the whole shebang. We all have a phase like that as a kid right? Thing is, it's had him terrified, and I can't get why, until a few hours ago.

(A little context for this next part, this is in rural Oklahoma, and we're also Cherokee.) I got a few messages from my mom asking if I had seen my sisters ceremonial eagle wing (she used to do powwows) in our old trailer. My uncle was living there, and I was helping him move out. She went on to say how she needed that and a few other things because she thinks her land is haunted. She recently got security cameras, and apparently they've been sending her alerts, but *nOThInG iS ThERe*. I told her it was probably an armadillo or something, as they do come around the house and their small dog is capable of tripping the signal. **""NOPE it's shadow people!""** or some other thing. I tried calming her down, having her try and rationalize what's going on, and explain that I believe her getting worked up over stuff like  that is what's scaring my brother. I figured I was doing good de-escalating the situation, but then I get a bunch of ""who do you think you are telling me how to raise my son"" kind of messages, to then be told my older sister even ""confirmed"" her land was haunted.

Now my sister and I don't always see eye to eye, probably because I'm a foot taller than her,  but she's pretty smart so I figured ""hey, she'll get how this could be affecting our brother!"" Wrong again. Apparently even with years of AP college classes, one can still come to the conclusion* ""yeah demonic portals and spirits are a thing and you're wrong for telling him otherwise.""* After about an hour of back and forth about our family's mental health issues and him being **an impressionable 6 year old boy** she still would not concede to possibly being in the wrong, stating that ""well we just believe different things, and you're not seeing the big picture.""

Is there anything in particular I should do? I can't convince them otherwise, not that I'm necessarily trying to, if they want to be afraid fine. I just don't want my little brother to constantly feel afraid of his own home when I'm not there. 

 **TL:DR Mother and sister are nutjobs making my little brother think the house is haunted, and getting angry because I told them they are the reason he's afraid. What can I do? How can I help him?**

So I’m wondering if it’s worth it to send her a message just to wish her luck on college and say a formal goodbye even though she probably doesn’t understand or know why I stopped talking to her because I was too scared to tell her why. It’s tearing me up inside to let her go but I know that it wasn’t a really good friendship for me because she would always do stuff like talk to me nonstop during the summer or over chat but completely ignore me when I saw her at school or ditch me for her other friends or treat me differently than she would treat me. And every time I just ignored it and apologize to her without knowing what I did wrong because she would never tell me how she felt even when I asked her. She was also super unsympathetic to my issues and never listened or offered to listen to me. 

But despite everything she did wrong, she did help me through some really rough times and practically was one of the big reasons I even made it out of high school. I just don’t know. Saying goodbye is too final, but at the same time the lack of closure is destroying me. Even if our relationship could be salvaged by me brushing it under the rug there would be no point since I know things would never be the same. 

Should I say something? Should I tell her how I feel and what she did wrong? Should I pretend nothing happened? I miss her so much, but I’m not sure if it’s for the right reasons...

Throwaway and fake names for obvious reasons to come. 

I'm sorry if this is a mess, I'm just typing everything on my mind and jumping back and forth cause I feel alot of context is needed. If anyone does read this and responds, thank you. Give me any advice you have, but don't be an asshole please. 

I am a 17 year old male, and the 3rd child out of 4, I have 2 older brothers and a younger sister. 
I live with my mom and dad, my oldest brother (25) Alan, and my sister (14), Riley. My 2nd oldest brother (22), Travis, doesn't live with us anymore, he has his own house. I do an online school, and Riley is going into 9th grade. I'm not very close with any of my family besides my mom. But I know my family, you know? Lol

I do an online school because in late August 2016, about a  week before my first day of 10th grade I smoked weed with Alan for the first time. I had smoked before but not such high thc weed, at the time. It caused me to have a panic attack where I thought I was going to die because I convinced myself i had od'd on a harder drug. I went to bed high as fuck still, idk how long i was high but it felt like an eternity. But with no lights or noise in my room, I went to bed with convinced i was never gonna wake up. Next day, me being an idiot i smoked with him again. Panic attack again.   Few days later, the day before my first day of school was fine, until around 10pm, I was playing gta online with my friends but i felt funny so i got off. It went from feeling funny, into a 4 hour paralyzing anxiety attack that ended in going to the ER where they gave me a pill to calm me down. 

This had a huge effect on my psyche and change my entire perception of the world. I stopped going to school around thanksgiving because I was so depressed. And have basically sat in my home since. I'm supposed to graduate this school year (2019) but I'm still a junior practically. I think my mom is under the impression that I'm going to graduate on time, which I dont think is possible unless I cheat, and I have higher morals and value my education too much to do that.

In December 2017 my parents and I got into a car accident that resulted in my dad losing his job, in Feb 2018. He is filing a lawsuit and stuff for wrongful termination. It's under review or something idk. But we've been struggling since then. My mom has a great job, but okay salary. my dad just got a job thanks to an old high school buddy but it is still not enough. I started smoking weed in December to help with anxiety. 

Alan is a troubled man. 

In early June 2018, Alan totaled his car hitting a deer on his way home from work, he works the nightshift so it was in the middle of the night. He was fine, but the car was no good. He got his car by co-signing with my grandma's wife, Ann, because his credit wasn't good enough alone. But when they got the car Ann signed her name first on the title, so he never actually owned the car. Long story short he hates them both with an obsession. Well he owed 8 grand on the car still but he all he had to do was take it over to my grandmas and get their signature, then take it to UPS and the Insurance agency will foot the bill.  My mom is letting Alan use her car to drive 45 minutes to work everyday until he can get a car. So, we only have my dads 1980s ford truck for transportation 95% of the week. Well, flash forward to July 13th, 2 days before my 17th birthday, and about 3 weeks of him needing to get her signature.  Alan and I are talking before he has to go to work and I mention me going to Grandma and Ann's the next day for a big party, he instantly starts talking about how much he hates them and then brings up the insurance stuff and tried blaming it on Ann for why it hadnt been done yet, and then goes on to tell me he forged her signature on the paperwork. I got upset and called him out on it, he tried to justify it by comparing it to forging parents signatures for like school papers, which i never did. Then he tried comparing me smoking weed to what he did. Meanwhile only my sister is home, in her room listening. This escalated into him attacking me, he was swinging for my face but I dodged them thankfully. I didn't swing on him. He had me in a chokehold and I was on my knees beat. I couldn't breathe and I was helpless, if Riley hadn't been home I don't know if he would've killed me. He finally stopped when my sister was yanking on him screaming for him to stop. The phsyical fight lasted about 2 minutes max. Fighting is not in my nature, I am a lover.

My entire life anytime he was angry at me he would always say ""I cant wait until your older so I can whoop your ass"" even though he would still attack me. 2 days before my 17th birthday he attacks me. He is 25. The next 2 weeks I avoided him at all costs. During that time I read alot, watched ted talks, and contemplated my relationship with Alan and his effect on our household. 

I have came to the conclusion my brother is a psychopath. He shows alot of the symptoms: Inflated self worth, lack of remorse or guilt, blaming others and refusing to accept responsibility, using others (acting parasitic), lying pathologically, constant need for stimulation. Irresponsibility, Behavioral problems when young. Tries to get others to work in his own personal gain,  no morals. I'll give examples:

(Inflated self worth) There is no noise allowed in the house while he is asleep, he sleeps until 2pm. He is always talking about how great he is at his job, and how bad his coworkers are. He once felt entitled to using a fan I got FOR MY BIRTHDAY on a hot summer day over me. 

(Blaming others, accepts no responsibility) He blames my mom and dad for the reason he is the way he is. Albiet my parents are nowhere near perfect humans but no one is. Also an example above with the Insurance. 

(Lack of remorse, or guilt) Last week he was telling me about him getting kicked out of a gas station for being a giant asshole to a drug addict. He was laughing while telling the story. He has stolen alot more from my family then we probably realize, but he has stolen more money from me than I know of, same goes for the rest of my family. 

(Constant need for stimulation) He is a EXTREMELY heavy pothead. A year ago his now ex girlfriend, told me he was smoking 3gs a day. No clue how much it is now but it is excessive. 

(Using others, acting parasitic, using others for personal gain) He does no chores, pays no rent, eats more than anyone in the house. Is destroying my moms car driving it 70+ mph on the highway daily, the inside is trashed and the front wheel barring is bad and shouldnt be going anywhere near those speeds, said my dad, who is very knowledgeable on cars.  

I could give more examples but i think the idea is there. 
 
I hate living here. We are broke, cant afford new clothes, the bare essentials basically since spring. And my parents are going to keep letting Alan walk all over them. I can't fucking stand it. I told them I dont want him living here anymore and I dont feel safe and they told me if they kicked him out he would probably commit suicide, which I know. He refuses any help of any kind. Our house is disgusting, there are mice, bugs, ants, fleas. We have 2 cats that we've had for about 8 years, and they've had fleas before and one of them, Mowgli almost died after the flea medicine and shit. Well I used some of my birthday money to get them the best flea treatment I could find because if not it would never be treated. I didn't apply the medicine correctly and they still have fleas. Gave them bathes last saturday after my dad finally listened. After we gave mowgli a bath he sprayed on Alans door because he was frightened and Alan texted me earlier saying he caught him spraying behind the tv. 

It feels like my entire life is falling apart. I've been telling my mom to schedule an appointment with my therapist but she has just kept saying she will, but hasnt cause we cant afford it. I told her today to actually schedule it. 

In January 2018 I weighed 215, last week I weighed 170. In march I started having problems with diarrhea and nausea, it took until june for my mom to schedule an appt with a doctor because I was, and still can barely eat much of anything, a whole lot of other stuff. Last week I had a endoscopy done, including a colonoscopy lul. The doctor found a small hiatal hernia where my stomach and esophagus meets, and mild gastritis. 

I cannot live like this much longer. I haven't ate all day and it is 3am. There is much more to be written but i need to go to bed. Thank you to anyone who read this far. ",23Aug2018,4

174,"At my school, there are various committees that you can apply to, but first you need to make an application showcasing your prior leadership/service roles + qualities you have. Because I want to go to an overseas university, I think becoming part of a committee would be a good idea (improves my leadership skills)

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, there are only about 80 roles in total available, and with around 200 students, it's kind of in demand. I'm honestly no one special, and I don't stand out in any particular way. But I have the interest to lead (which obviously isn't enough to convince anyone). My service/leadership roles in the past have been almost negligible, I focused a lot more on school work. I'm regretting this now, as everyone I know has applied and they have heaps to write down.

I feel wrong basing the perspective on a picture I find of the author, but at the same time surely a black author who lived in the 60s would have a notably different, possibly more experienced insight about the nature of black churches and what not.

184,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My boyfriend confessed to me recently that he has intrusive thoughts about taking advantage of kids. He insists they’re unwanted and awful and he does his best to put them out of his mind.

However, he’s studying to be a teacher and it concerns me that he can even have these thoughts about kids. He’s always had a love for kids; working in after school care, studying to do teaching, etc.

I was abused as a child so I probably didn’t react as supportively as I should have (should I have been supportive?). He seemed genuinely distressed to be having these thoughts and even more distressed that I thought he might act on them. I grilled him quite intensively and he says the thoughts have never been sexually charged, never triggered by sex, nor has he ever gotten any gratification from them. Just that they’re awful and he wishes he could make them go away. 

How do we proceed from here ? Do I report him ? Does he see a therapist ? How am I ever supposed to get over it  and trust him again ? This is the man I wanted to raise a family with.

187,"Preface; I write this on a secondary account as I have not spoken with them about this.

Earlier this year, I was given to opportunity yo move out of home and move in with some friendsin 2019. At the time, it sounded great. I get to live seperate to the family and instead get to rent out a house with 3 other friends. We talked about the expenses, worked out rent payments, travel to and from work, basically everything seemed to be sorted out and now all we had to do was save some money before going through with it.

This is where things start to change. The closer it gets to the date when we all move in, the more I doubt it. Talking to several others who did move out early in life, all of them said they have a red flag with the finances behind it. I talked to these friends about it and they all said  ""don't worry, we have it all worked out."" Yurns out their plan for that is to have the 2 currently receiving welfare benefits (on top of work payments) lie to their welfare agencies about how many people are paying rent, so their payments go up.

Ever so slowly, the same group have become increasingly toxic towards me, making jokes that border personal attacks and they claim it's mere 'banter'. They victimize themselves and twist it to make it look like I'm the bad guy for being offended. As of late, I've spent less time with them and felt somewhat happier about life.

I am married w/ some kids and nothing to write home about in the looks dept. She is 20 years my jr smart and very good looking btw she is at least 22. This started as being friendly I enjoyed the company and the conversation, being in sort of the same line of work of helping people it was nice to talk to someone who has seen some of the same stuff as I and being able to talk without judgement of the PC police. The other shift we were outside talking and she kissed me, a long passionate kiss. I was speechless and turned into a bumbling idiot, the only other time this happened was when I was in High School with a girl I loved. it transported me to another place, like time stopped. We stopped before anything more could happen. I know I may get reprimanded for a kiss but I know I woulda been fired for more. trust me I wanted to do more because well I'm a dude. Since then she has communicated with me about her feelings to me that she liked it and liked me. i know no real substance will come from trying to continue anything with her, even when my wife leaves me I know the whole Age thing would make it nearly impossible. I made a mistake but not that I regret in the manner of ""oh I cheated on my wife"" I honestly feel no guilt there and why is that. With this other woman I like her as a person, she was always kind and being around her was fun and comforting in an odd way, primarily because of the age difference I never thought anything more. I never thought in a million years this would have happened. Now I'm sitting here questioning wtf, why am I thinking about her daily and she will be sitting next to me in the same vehicle in a week and what should I do. I have always followed the rules, always stuck to the script but this has totally spun me round. I can't be falling for someone with a 20 year age difference wtf is wrong with me. I want to spend time with her but I dont want to get any more emotionally involved because I have a feeling it will be me wanting more and knowing I cannot request her to drop her life goals because I am a strange dude. A positive is in a short amount of time I will be moving far away. I am stuck in the, do I want to do more with her for the memories and connection for a brief moment of happiness or put a stop to it and possibly regret not learning something. The feelings of being a old pervy dude have been in my head but she is something else, I know how that sounds, if someone said that to me I would thing wtf dude shes almost the same age as your kid that's sick. However after that kiss my mind switched to f it I wanna be happy for a bit. What to do obviously I cannot talk to my friends or anyone about this, so I turn to my reddit family to provide feedback.

191,"Last year, I took a class where we had to sign out textbooks which where to be returned at the end of the school year. Some people checked out two (one to keep at school/home), while others didn’t.  When the sheet got to me, there were no textbooks left so I had to go to the back of the room and get ONE (keyword one) and sign it out on the sheet. 

The end of the school year comes around and when I go to return my ONE textbook she asks where my other one is. I’m confused and tell her I only signed out one, which she doesn’t believe as she marked me for taking out two??

It feels like my head is totally empty, I used to have a lot of anxiety and thousands of thoughts everyday, but now, nothing. And this might sound weird but I kind of miss it...

The problem is that I feel stupid, I can't do anything properly, confusion in everyday matters, and one very annoying thing I'm experiencing recentley is an absolutely terrible short term memory loss, I forgot things I was just about to google or search on YouTube for example.

I have a very hard time concentrating on anything.

Also, extreme fatigue, just making this thread feels like a big effort for me.

I had some problems with my vision, I'm also noticing my right eye is acting weird, sometimes when looking at the camera or in the mirror I'll notice that my right eye is looking at a different direction, I believe it's called lazy eye.

Also, I feel like I'm slowly but surely losing my word filter, I'll say something that I usually wouldn't ever dare to say and I just say it, it's very odd to me.

I'm figuring it might be a brain tumour, my grandmother has had one, but I ain't no doctor and I think I should go to one.

In school, my teachers ran a psychology test so they can add the data they need un order for them to help us get into university (were still in Year 11). One teacher noticed that my results are kinda off and told me to do those 3 drawings test thingy where they'll see our personality. She asked if I have anxiety and I admitted that I do. She told me that I need to tell my parents about this or this will cause problems for me in the future.

However, I did told my dad that I have anxiety, and he just doesnt seem to really care. Just about 3 days ago, my dad told me that he called up my town's mayor that I will play a piece on my violin WITHOUT my knowledge (the reason is bcs its for celebrating Indonesia's 73rd independence). Of course, with this sudden information, I instantly felt like half of my soul left my body. I told him that Im just not ready yet but he shouted at me that Im wasting his money for my violin classes and that music is for everyone to enjoy. The thing is that Im just not ready! If I am ready I'd probably tell my dad that I am!

Thats just one recent example, but he did do more things thats similar like this. How do I convince him that I have anxiety? I just want him to understand, but whenever I try and explain it to him he would assume it as normal anxiety. In addition, sometimes he flexes that 'he was always number 1 in his school' and 'he worked very hard until hes successful like this' (maybe to make me feel more better? Idk it made me blame myself for being this dumb for developing god damn anxiety though).

202,"Hi! 

I live a very drama-free, comfortable life. I try to always be nice and in a good mood, I live by the ""Treat others as you wish to be treated"" motto basically. The fact that I can just switch off a bad mood and stay positive amongst others to not bring them down with me, is one of my personality traits that I like the most. I keep my distance to negative people, but I'm never rude to them. 

I just found out recently that my neighbor is spreading rumours about me. She spends a lot of time with my ex, she even told me she's interested in him (we broke up nearly 6 years ago, I've been with my current boyfriend for 5 years now), and my old friends, she's always nice to my face, but she recently had a party where they spent a lot of time on her balcony. This was during the heatwave and we live right next to her, so our balcony door had to be open to get some fresh air inside, they were blasting music and had to yell to eachother to be able to hear eachother, even when they were outside.

So I heard some stuff about me, very nasty stuff that wasn't true at all. And it was being discussed in a way that implied that they've spoken a LOT about this before. I'm at a loss for words really, I barely remember my relationship with my ex, you tend to forget things once you put it past you. It was really, really uncomfortable, to not be able to really escape hearing them say such things about me. I couldn't confront them, because it would make it seem like I was eavesdropping, and some things said were vague, but still obvious, so they could deny it all, and leave me to be the pathetic one. 

I live in a tiny town where everyone knows everyone, and rumours spread FAST. I don't want to create any additional drama, but I'm also scared things will escalate a lot. I've always known my neighbor loves drama, she always speaks of her friends in a very negative way but I thought that since we weren't actually hanging out with eachother, and never speaking about more personal stuff, just being civil basically, I wouldn't be a part of her drama. 

So I don't know what to do now, I was thinking about just contacting my ex, explaining to him how those things weren't true at all, and tell him that he's free to do whatever he wants, and that I'm not hung up on him or whatever he does (such things were implied, which felt extremely disrespectful to me and my boyfriend), but I have a feeling that if I do that, things might go more wrong than right, and I don't feel like opening any metaphorical windows for him. 

I've also been thinking about just going over to my neighbors apartment and speaking to her mother (the girl is around 25, still lives with her mother, but spends most of her time away) and tell her that ""Next time your daughter has a party, if she insists on speaking about me, and spreading rumours about me, tell her to do it inside your apartment. I don't want to have to close my door during a heat wave just to not have to listen to her talking shit about me."". That could result in two different ways, either her mother will be embarrassed, and speak with her daughter about the matter in a more stern way, OR she'll believe I'm lying, especially since her daughter definitely will deny it, and it'll create more drama, with more neighbours. I'm thinking the latter, there's a big chance the daughter and mother think very a like. 

Any advice? It's extremely uncomfortable to not know who thinks what of me, and who believes the rumours.

I gained a lot of great friends, however, one friend in particular grew very close to me. We had great memories and I enjoyed her company. I'm not a person that shares a lot of my personal issues or emotions, I tend to keep to myself and deal with issues on my own. Every person i've met so far in my life is okay with this, and they understand i'm not the most emotional or vocal person, but this became a massive problem for her. I had told her before summer 2018 started that I'm going to be to myself for most of it, and that I wont be going out a lot. I was depressed and contemplating things I shouldn't be thinking about from the beginning. She knows that i overcome my issues on my own, and thats who I've been since I was born. She messaged me about about her not liking that i was neglecting her in July, I explained to her that I need my time alone and i wanted her to be okay with that, she still did not take it well.

Time went on, i knew others were getting involved in this small situation and it started escalating the issue. I have nothing against her, but I knew she still had something against me, School started up again 2 weeks ago and I attempted to confront her about it, it lasted about 3 minutes and she kept saying everything was fine. I said okay and moved on. A week later, she decided she wanted to talk, I said okay, and ultimately the conversation was her attacking me about being a bad friend and that she thought she was closer to me, and that going quite wasn't fair and that I never warned her. I repeatedly said that I told her and explained everything. Then she started going on about how I hurt her and she felt betrayed, how when I told her I cared that my actions didn't reciprocate, but I feel like i did more than enough to inform her of my motives yet its not enough. I gave up mid conversation due to it going in circles, and said I needed to go. I'm now extremely conflicted on what to do, was i really wrong, was it really my fault? Should I play nice and keep a good face on and pretend like I still care for her for the sake of protecting her and the people around us, or should I message her telling her that I no longer intend to keep this friendship knowing due to her only making this about her? Any advice will help. As well as perspectives on this will help as well. ",23Aug2018,1

207,"The weirdest thing is that I don't think I've ever been seriously betrayed before in this fashion so I don't know why I have these feelings. I usually get these feelings after my messages don't get responses in our group chat. Sometimes it doesn't bother me as I feel like I'm usually the final message in the chat most of the time.

Although sometimes, the questions creep up on me. What if they're annoyed by my questions? Did I creep that person out? Am I the annoying friend in this group? Do they have a separate group chat where they can talk freely about certain things without me knowing?

I understand that some of these seem ridiculous but sometimes, I just can't help but think about it and it stresses me out just a bit more. Mind you all the friends that I think about in this way have been friends for more than a year. It's also pretty much the first actual friend group I've been in, as opposed to pretty much one on one relationships.

I fully support my daughter’s decision to do what she wants to with her life. I have 5 children and I intend on giving all of them the support I can when choosing how to live their own lives.

He loves my daughter and doesn’t want to see her get caught up in the trap of having to take orders to do something morally wrong just because it benefits the higher up. I agree with him to an extent and can see his perspective but I don’t feel that it is right to discourage my daughter from doing what she wants with her life.

Here’s the short version:
I’m 16 years old, a high school sophomore student in the USA. I recently visited Zürich, Switzerland and loved the city. Like, everything about it. I thought at first that I may want to visit again sometime down the line. One of my family members suggested that I should consider attending college here, since the price per-semester is almost nothing, even for foreigners. I thought that was a joke, but it’s actually true. Upon further research, I discovered ETH Zürich has lots of programs I had already been interested in possibly studying.

Is this a crazy dream I’ll just have for the next few years in high school or do you think it’s actually a possible and reasonable path for my future? Obviously, there are some complications with it but nothing TOO major that I can think of. I just don’t want to get in over my head.

224,"Hello,

over the past years I've had enough time to think about myself. I've come to the conclusion that I have either social anxietyor that I'm just very shy and awkward. I think I've overcome some of the stuff holding me back and I've made new friends, but I think I still need some advice (I don't know that to be honest. Maybe I just need to share this or write this down. I don't even know what kind of advice I'm asking for). 

Through the aformentioned thinking I found a few examples that best describe my situation. These are in no particular order. 
* When I want to go into a small shop and I see that no one is in there and there would be a good chance that the owner or a employee would talk to me I mostly decide that I don't want to go inside (except if it's a shop where I know what to buy before going inside). 
* I get nervous extremly fast. For example I can't hold cards in my hand while doing a presentation because my hands are shaking and when I notice that they start to shake even more. (I've found the workaround to that is just laying the cards in front of me and having my hands behind my back, but still). 
* I think I annoy everyone around me when I talk to much. 
* I can't talk to people until I have some kind of idea of how they are going to react to what I'm saying or I have a really solid reason. This is really awful because I can't meet new people. My crush is kinda in the same friend group as I am, but I can't bring myself to talk to her because we've only exchange a few sentences while drunk and I don't know how to talk to her. 
Also this really freaks me out because when I am going to university I won't have the friends I've made over the course of 8 years mostly through the help of other people and I am scared that I am going to end up lonely.

All my life I was bullied. A lot of nasty things were done to me. I was humiliated, beaten up, threatened and verbally abused all of my years in school. I was a very insecure skinny kid, but I am 21 now, in good physical shape and every day I strve for self-improvement, however, it's due to my pure hatred for society. I just want to be better than everyone financially, physically and intellectually. I've held this rage and hunger for superiority ever since I left highschool. I don't know if this is the healthiest way nor is it the right reasons for me being productive. I just can't seem to forget the feeling that I had when I went to school and what these people did.   


I don't think about them and dwell on these memories, but I'm just mentally extremely cynical and antisocial. These circumstances kind of made me this way. Before the age of 14, I was okay. After that bullying started. I became insecure, quiet and afraid of everyone. Now is the opposite. I kind of want to degrade everyone.

My mood is always different, one day i would be so creative and motivated and feel like i can do anything, then i just switch and feel terrible and have no clue what to do!

Hi, today on my way home a jackass from my garde catcalled me in front of everyone. I felt humiliated, but was too scared to say or do anything because of all the people. 

This same jackass has tripped me in the hall, and made fun of me. It's not very often, but it really sticks with me...  I am able to stand up for myself when he's not surrounded by a lot of people (who ofc think he's great.)

I'm small, but I'm not unpopular - and I barely even know this dude. In movies and books I only really see girls being picked on by other girls. But I'm not afraid of girls, I'm afraid of things that I feel could beat me in a fist fight. Why is he picking on me? I don't get why he can't just bloody leave me alone.

240,"I have always struggled with depression. In my teens I self-harmed and struggled with an eating disorder because I felt out of control in my life and pain and food were the only two things I COULD control. I had a baby when I was 25, and set those things aside because I knew my son needed a strong example. But I was still depressed. I tried medications and therapy, and they help from time to time, but there are periods of time where I’m just SO stressed out and overwhelmed that nothing helps and the depression shows (low mood, exhaustion, lack of interest, crying, etc.).

I’m in one of those periods right now. It’s a combination of my baby starting kindergarten, my MIL overstaying her welcome at our house (she’s lived with us for a year and was supposed to be out last week but still hasn’t left and my husband won’t follow through on making her leave), lack of intimacy because said MIL is taking our kids room so he sleeps in our room and we can’t exactly have a good sex life with a 5 year old at the foot of our bed, and my grandparents permanently leaving the state to live with my parents 1,500 miles away when they’re not in good health. I’m overwhelmed. And nothing is helping right now so it shows. 

My husband has never been understanding of my depression. And he gets angry when it shows. He’ll ask me what’s wrong, but then get upset because he doesn’t like the answer or because I don’t handle situations the same way he does. Last night he asked me again what was wrong, and I told him again that I’m depressed and that I can’t talk to him about it because he gets angry and yells at me. Which led to him yelling at me again and he told me he’s “done caring” and “it’s your problem, you need to figure it out”. 

This hurt me deeply. We’re married. He is a recovering addict and even when he relapsed I never EVER told him that it’s “his problem, he needs to figure it out”. We’re married. His problems ARE my problems, and we’re supposed to figure it out as a team. But he doesn’t do that for me. I feel like he abandoned me last night, and I’m not sure that I want to stay in a marriage where his problems are my problems, and my problems are my problems. I need support. And I feel like it’s worse knowing that you don’t have support when there is someone there that is supposed to support you, than it would be to have no support because you’re single. I don’t know what to do at this point. This isn’t a new issue, it just hasn’t reared it’s head in a while because like everyone else with depression, i have good days and bad days and good days can last a long time. Every time Those bad days come along though, he gets angry with me. I still get up, take our son to daycare, go to work a full 40 hour week, make dinner every night, pay the bills, grocery shop, etc. I just can’t get the strength during those times to do it cheerfully, so he gets mad. 

I feel like it may be time to leave him, but I’m not sure how, and I worry that it’s the depression that’s making me feel like ending my marriage and that when it clears again I’ll be left with regret. But I cannot for the life of me right now think of a reason to stay other than I do love him and he’s a good father. But I haven’t felt loved or appreciated in a long time, and he refuses marriage counseling because he was married once before and he said that all the therapist did was attack him and their marriage ended anyways.

I was unemployed in 2017 from December until June this year, i was trying to switch industries and to gain a administration/receptionist role. Alas due to lack of experience i found absolutely nothing. I ended up going back to hospitality and these days I work at a pub that pays me pretty well \[$25/h\] but I'm only getting one shift a week, i'm getting by financially but i'm more than willing to do a couple of days a week. However I found out that it's going to take a while to work up to being a bartender and I'm after short term to medium term cash influx \[mainly to purchase a couple of things and put into savings for later stock market investment needs, i haven't passed $3,000 in savings for 3 years now and feel embarrassed at that...\].

Side note: I also do volunteering with a government organisation in administration duties to gain experience so i'm not purposefully trapping myself in the hospitality industry.  

&amp;#x200B;

The options i've considered are:

1. Getting a second job but i'm most likely moving out to the Western suburbs in December \[will find out on in early September as my house is being auctioned off\] so travelling back to the Eastern suburbs will become a pain in the ass.
2. Going to op shops/garage sales and flipping products on eBay \[Did this back in the day and made a decent profit\] while I work up to becoming a bartender.
3. Doing an apprenticeship/traineeship next year after my Diploma ends to become a tradesman \[In Australia these fellas make truckloads of money\]

Honestly I have realised that i may just need to be patient and wait until my house gets sold or not and see what the next step is from there hence why i'm after some second opinions. My body lately has already been signalling to me lately that its exhausted from what I do already \[gym 4 days a week, work finishing at 2 am and class starting the next day early\] to the point where i've developed another nervous tick in my right eye.

Since graduating, I’ve been 100% supporting myself with a job in the food and beverage industry all while coming up with plans for my own business. And now my boyfriend and I recently moved to a new city where we both found steady jobs. I’m happy. 

But my mom won’t back off about the business/accounting jobs.

But she doesn’t listen. Now, I’m in a whole new city (she’s never even visited here) and she’s getting random people involved trying to get me entry level accounting jobs. I feel extra bad because these people are sticking their necks out networking for me, a girl who has no interest in even applying. 

How can I get my mom to understand that she’s advocating for a life I don’t want and that I just need her to back off? I don’t want to hurt her feelings as I love my parents to death. ",23Aug2018,4

254,"I'm 25 and I've been in uni for 7 years without completing anything and I'm currently 1.5 years into a 4 year degree, I don't hate the degree but I'm not 100% sure its what I want to do and currently my head space is a little messed up (found out today I probably have depression and anxiety among other things).

I first jumped into uni because it was the only path I knew but I still after 7 years have no idea what it is I really want to do in life, I don't really have a set interest or passion recently my mental health has gone a bit down and while it's not my degree I think a big part of it is that I have no idea what I truly want to do.

I have 3 options regarding my path currently:

1. Continue my full workload of subjects and finish the degree (I'll be 27).
2. Drop 2 subjects and make it part time while trying to fix myself up. This will add an extra year to my course.
3. Take a leave of absence from the course for 6 months (up to a year) and just work and try and fix myself up and do the things I wish I had of done years ago like travel and try and figure out what I enjoy. This is the one I'm most leaning towards, I'll still be enrolled in my degree it'll just add another year to how long it'll take if I choose to go back.

The downside to 3 is I don't want to waste that time and get lazy, it's the one that will arguably require the most work because I'll need to be very proactive about my time and its the one with the most grey area.

I don't know what to do and welcome all opinions on the matter, the plus side is I live in Australia so money wise it won't screw me if I decide to defer and end up doing a degree later in life.",23Aug2018,1
255,"So, my ex work colleague needed a tent or something to sleep in at a festival and I lent him a hammock that could turn into a tent and covered his shift while he went there. Only, after the festival ended he didn't come back to work and he didn't answer to any of my texts or calls for a month or so.

The hammock is not mine, it's my boyfriend parents's so I got a little worked up and managed to find his home adress. I went there and found out that just his parents live there, he moved out long ago. I asked them to speak to him and return my belongings so I can return them too. 

After he found out, he said to my boyfriend that he will leave the hammock with his parents for me to pick up cause he is afraid and that he doesn't have the money for the shift I covered and that he was very busy and out of town all these weeks but he will return on tuesday.

I was ok with that, but my boyfriend said that he should give me the money too and after that, the guy got pissed that we are nagging him and said that he will return the hammock to us when he cames back, in winter. I just want that back and I don't know what steps should I take.

I must mention that the police aren't really interested in theft so I don't know how much help they would be.

TL;DR: I lend a hammock to a co-worker who ignored my boss's and my messages soon after and after almost getting it back the guy backed out cause I was nagging him too much

257,"So I realized during university that I didn't like what I was studying at all. I was still able to finish but I clearly didn't want to work in that field.   
After graduation I got a job in construction because the money was good and saved some money. Two years later I decided to do a two year master abroad to change field (doing marketing this time). I applied for it and got accepted. It starts in two months.  
The day I was going to buy the ticket I got huge second thoughts about my decision, the reason being I'm 25 year old, and if I do this for two whole years I will be studying and I won't be able to save any money or advance my career.   
And by the time I complete it I will be 27 with no office job experience. Now I know I'm not -that- old but on the other hand most people my age have finished their masters, they aren't starting them.   
And maybe I could just find an office job with my degree and try to climb up the ladder instead.  


Living abraod and getting a master degree would be cool but I would put my life on hold for two years, and I was wondering if I could use these two years in a better way.

261,"I got two bonuses in August totaling ~$1,600 USD. Before I received these bonuses, my wife and I had planned a trip to Florida in late August. With this money, I want to buy something for myself for $500. My wife is telling me not to – that we need the money for the trip. She’s very adamant. I’m having a really hard time accepting this and it’s putting me in a bad mood. 


I’d like to hear from objective, rational people. I prefer not to hear the extremes: “Happy wife = Happy life” or “Who wears the pants, you pansy?”


I feel like this is my money that I was awarded AFTER the trip was planned and that these funds should not be factored into the trip. Besides, $1,100 EXTRA dollars for a trip that should have already been funded is not bad.

265,"Hey,

As my name suggests, I am 30 years old introvet indian. If anyone knows how marriages are planned in India, they will be able to relate to my concern. I love a girl who is from a different religion. I missunderstood my parents as liberal folk untill i revealed them about my choice of life parter. Everything turned upside down. They love me, care for me but they don't have any regards for my feelings for the life partner I want to choose. For them, what people think is the most important aspect. The shallow sociatal pride is more important then my happiness (seems so). For me it's important to be particular about the person, I have to spend next 50 yrs (supposing, I would be alive till the age of 70-80). Clearly, it does not matter to them.

Anyways, I told them that i will not marry her but I don't want to get married, so let me be alone and concentrate on my career. Now the emotional torture is at it's peak. They won't let me marry the girl I love, they won't let me live in the city i want, they won't let me be ME. It's torturous. I am always angry with them in my heart, I hardly speak to them even if we are in the same room. I don't want to be angry with them but they won't let me be ME. That's unbearable. They have very narrow mentality and they want me to love closer to the relatives with similar mentality. I can't do that but I can't always be angry in my heart. Not sure, how to deal with it. 

Also, it's not right on my part to say but I want to live alone and not even with my parents ( I know it's not right). I am fine with visting the occasionally or may be every quarter but I need Me-Time.

It's simple, I don't want to live in 1980 in the era of 2018.

My girlfriend was only dating me because she liked it when I touched her tits, and when we saw a movie together she kept putting my hand up her shirt and telling me to play with her nipples. Eventually she took off her shirt and shoved my face into her cleavage and held me there until I managed to get out. As soon as I did, I dumped her and walked out of the movie. When I got home she started texting me ( there's no way to block contacts on my phone) and it went like this.

Her: *pic of her boobs in a shirt*
Me:I just dumped you, I don't want boob pics.
Her:would you prefer it if I took it off?
Me: I'd prefer it if you left me alone.
Her: *pic of her boobs in a bra* how about now?
Me: you got your boobs out in front of a bunch of kids and forced me to motorboat them. Leave me alone.

269,"He's so irritatingly full of himself. and I look back at photo albums of the little chubby-cheeked, funny kid he used to be and it's like- oh god, why!? 

So here's the situation: he spends basically all day everyday playing ps4 or watching youtube videos of people playing ps4. This makes him very snarky, mean-spirited and irritable. He'll constantly snap at us or put me or our younger sister down; making fun of our interests, etc (always with the excuse that it's ""a joke"")

The arrogance part is he's forever going on about how he's going to go to x, y and z top school, or start a business and become a billionaire, or become a brain surgeon, or become amazing at making video games, etc, etc. I think ambitions are healthy, but then it's never ""I really want to do this so I'm going to work really hard at exams, join extra curriculars, etc"" but with the extremely frustrating attitude that he's smart and exams are and will always be easy and so he'll be fine. It's extremely annoying, especially since I worked really hard to get top grades throughout school, yet he has such a dismissive attitude towards it all as if it's no big deal and will be easy to achieve. And I know that attitude is going to be a huge pitfall at some point in his life. And he's my younger brother so I want to protect him from that, but I just can't get him to wake up and get his head out of his arse.

His most recent thing is wanting to start a business because he wants ""quick, easy money"". I said get a job because starting your own business at 14 is far from easy- but he wants no effort I think and I guess thinks having a business would allow him to do close to nothing while money pours in. He asked how he might start one, I said, ""well, first you need an idea."" His response? ""Oh, no, that's the easy part I'll think of something."" So far the ideas have been a clothes company (this from the boy who mocks art and my love of creativity and knows nothing about fashion), a personal shopping business perhaps specialising in buying healthy food and creating meal plans for people, and a company helping people build computers. Does he have any experience or knowledge with any of that before? Nope. But ""It's easy, stop being so negative, I could learn about it all with a quick google search."" It just makes me cringe because people who are professionals in fashion, marketing, nutrition, customer service, computers, etc, usually have put a lot of time and study into it, but no he completely dismisses all that as something ""easy"" he could ""quickly"" learn and make money from. All my questions (Who would be your manufacturer? Where are you getting nutrition information and recipes from? How much is your budget? Customers will want to know your experience, what will you tell them?) are just ""negativity"". 

Gah I hate it so much. Not to mention the time he wanted me to ""quickly"" design a bunch of Christmas cards he could sell, because of course art is so quick and easy to do (while previously commenting all the time on how ""worthless"" and ""pointless"" art is). I didn't do it because guess what I happened to be busy with the prelims and school work I actually try hard at.

Sorry. Rant over. Any advice? He is genuinely intelligent and has the capacity to be great, only this attitude issue combined with his gaming addiction/laziness I think could really drag him down",23Aug2018,4

274,"This happened about 4 weeks ago. 
It was eleven o clock in the evening and I just finished playing darts with my father and brother ( I was on the cruise with my family ). 
We needed to get to the other side of the ship because of some sort of show that was about to start so we were in a bit of a hurry.
2 old people approach us ( lots of old people on cruise ships), one of them sitting in a wheelchair and the other one pushing it. The old lady gets up, and said:"" we have borrowed this wheelchair from the ship, could you bring it back to the other side of the deck?"".
We had to go there anyway, so we said:"" sure, no problem"". It was 11 in the evening and we all had drunk a little bit of alcohol, but none of us was intoxicated. My brother sits down in the wheelchair, and I started pushing it. After 20 seconds I started pushing a lot harder ( as is what you do, don't tell me otherwise. Running with wheelchairs is just natural instinct ). It all went well until it didn't a little bit later. 
You see: the wheelchair was a piece of crap. I was just pushing it in a straight line on a smooth floor minding my own business ( was not even going that fast ) until the left front wheel broke. 
The wheel chair came to this sudden stop , but I still had all this momentum. 
I went over the wheelchair and landed fully on my hip ( my brother was fine btw, he sensed shit was going down and got of the moment after the wheel broke ). I tried to stand up, but couldn't move my leg, so I was like:"" shit"" and had to be carried to the ships doctor.
Ship doctor looked at my leg and told me:"" the hip is not broken, since if it was your leg would be shorter than the other one"". 
Put some ice on it, he said. 99% sure you just tore a muscle he said. You've got to use it a lot so I can heal better because of blood circulation he said. 
I got some crutches and went about my cruise. Getting in cars was painful and I couldn't really put my weight on the leg ( I tried, wasn't happening)walking with crutches was shitty, taking a shit was shitty and i could only sleep on my back. My vacation wasn't great.
Ship doctors visit cost me 2000 euros, insurance only gave me back 700. I had to pay 100 euros or something like that because they gave me oxygen for no reason.

After the cruise I went to visit my general practisioner on Wednesday, who sent me to the hospital for a scan on Friday.
The guy who made a scan sent me through for an x-ray. The guy who made the x-ray was like ""OH FUCK NO"" after looking at the x-ray, and send me to the podosurgian ( not sure what the name is in English, he is the guy who does surgical things with people ) who showed me the scan ( I almost shit my pants: my entire hip has been displaced), and told me:"" not sure if we can fix it since it's been 2 and a half weeks since the accident, and there is now a lot of scar tissue, you might end up with a shorter left leg, or lose the hip because of blood flow issues so you might need an artificial one"".

Long story short: I got the surgery that evening and everything went well, but now I'm kinda pissed at the ships doctor. Everybody makes mistakes, I get that. But because of his confidence ( he said he was 99 % sure it was a muscle tear ) it almost cost me my hip. And I still had to pay 1300 euros for a bad diagnosis and things that didn't actually help me.

What shall I do? Shall I try and contact the ships doctor to say :"" f*** you, you were wrong"" shall I try and get my money back or is it a lost cause? 
Shall I do something or shall I let if rest?",23Aug2018,1

278,"My dad always threaten my brother and me. He always says he’ll beat our asses and he does have any extremely quick temper and gets mad easily. One time my brother stole something and lied about it obviously he got a beating which he deserved. But a few days later my dad found out that my brother had his phone which he hid. My dad thought he recently stole it back but he took it back a  while ago. My dad really lost it. He kicked my brother punched him used hangers. He had to to use 2-3 hangers (wooden) because they kept on breaking when he hit my brother. The marks that my dad left were partially  bruises and partially marks that didn’t go away for a good 5-6 days. My dad always gets mad and my brother and me for playing on our phones for long periods of time so he sometimes ,like the other day at a restaurant, he took our phones and threw them. My dad did this to my brother’s iPad once several years ago because he was scared of swallowing pills. My dad picked up my brothers iPad and slammed it on the floor. The iPad was obviously broken it was split almost it half. My dad always yells at us too for sometimes reasons we can’t control. I walk on my tiptoes and will my feet faced outward. It’s a habit I’ve always had but every time my dad sees my walk like this he screams at me telling me that he’s told me so many times and I need to fix it. Sometimes if i say something back or if I don’t correct myself he kicks me and continues to yell at me. Another time maybe when I was 10-11 my dad saw what I was drawing at my art class. I had been taking a while on it and my dad thought I hadn’t done anything that class and that my drawing was ugly. He screamed and me at the art class with maybe 20+ people watching. He pulled me out of my chair then he ripped my drawing in half and hurled his phone at me. After, he told me to redraw the whole thing and if I wasn’t a 1/4 done and looked good he would beat my ass at home. Maybe a year later when I was 11, my dad told my brother and me not to sit next to each other so we didn’t . I sat in the corner while my brother sat on the other side of the room maybe 20ft away. There were no people in the middle.
It looked like this. 
|me|                                    |other person|
                                             |other person|

                                             |other person|

When my dad saw us, he flipped. He screamed at us yelling at us asking why we were sitting next to each other. The went to my brother and pulled the chair from under him then he threw his phone at me. He was going to continue but then the teacher told him to stop and he did. But when we got in the car , he said  to us “when we get home I’m gonna best both of your asses” then whole car ride home was then silent. As soon as we got home , my dad first beat my brother , because I was in the restroom, kicking him hitting him with a belt sometimes even using the metal part. Then he came over to me and said “don’t think that your not getting hit either” my beating wasn’t as bad he only kicked me a bit then smacked me with his belt. My dad always tells my brother and me to stand up and not let us eat when we’re at restaurants if he’s mad. Sometimes he tells us to get out of the restaurant or he tells us we’re not allowed to eat. My dad sometimes says that “just didn’t starve then enough once they’re hungry they won’t have energy for anything” if my brother and I are fighting. My dad has also told my brother and me to get out of his house and to not come back in. My brother once stayed outside for 30-60min because they thought my brother stole a pencil. And yes my brother steals things often and he deserves those beatings. My mom once told me when I was a toddler that I was constantly covered in bruises because my dads beatings. My grandma also told me that once I was scared to drink a really bitter medicine when I was younger. And instead on trying to tell me it was fine my dad just kicked me and yelled at me. But on the contrary my dad always buys my brother and me things he’s usually nice to us but ever since his best friend stole several million dollars from us his bad temper has gotten worse. My dad also gets me lots of things that I’ve wanted like Hulu Netflix or a new phone. He also joked around with me and takes me to nice places. He really does spoil me during these times. I really wanna believe that my dads a generally nice person ,but every time I think of the bad things it brings me to tears. Ever since I turned 11-12 I’ve had to do everything myself since English is neither of my parents’ first language. And my mom can’t speak English very well. So doctor appointments,dentists appointments, my appointments, my brothers. Sometimes when I ask them if they could just do it once. They tell me no and yell at me for being lazy and if I’m not going to do it then we just won’t go. This happens when we order food to when I tell my parents what I want , they start yelling at me saying “ why are u telling me this, ur so lazy, tell the waiter not me” sometimes i just wanted to be a child and have them do these small things for me and I know I sound really whiney but I just wanted to be a child and I didn’t wanna worry about these things. I didn’t wanna take the supplementary classes all weekend. I didn’t want to do taekwondo anymore. I just wanted to play. I wanted to hang out with friends. I wanted to go to their birthday parties. I wanted to play volleyball .I wanted to have fun. I’m still young right now only 13 but I’m tired l. I really am . I’m tired of being scared of making my dad mad. And I’m tired that my mom doesn’t really care that we get beat anymore . I’m tired and I hope that I can get into a good boarding school ( if it wasn’t a good school I wasn’t allowed to apply) and just leave this home. My parents always badger me on respect and how I should take care of them when they get old. I know I should but I sometimes don’t want to I don’t want my parents to live with me when they’re old. I don’t wanna deal with them. They threaten to take out money from their will to me and give it to my brother and they tell me I’m selfish. I don’t deny that I am selfish I want to keep the good things to myself because if I don’t  I’m scared I’ll be criticized for being to messy, to poor, etc. At this point I don’t really care that much if all the will goes to my brother . I really am tired of this lifestyle. Sorry for the long rant I just really needed to vent.",23Aug2018,1

Just wondering if anyone had advice about how I should talk to him about it. Already thought of just letting him know the situation in a couple weeks and changing my vacation request to a leave of absence request or just putting in a notice before hand and finding a new job when I get back but I was hoping someone on Reddit might have some good advice for me. Please and thank you !,23Aug2018,1
281,"I'm [24F] a graphic designer and illustrator looking for a job in Spain.

The conditions were 400€/month during 6 months and 600€ next 6 months, full working day.

After all the treatment and isolation I had to go through I think I was just so sick for so long it left a scar in my mental health. I have all the symptoms of PTSD and my aunt (a nurse for 20+ years) agreed that she thinks that is the case. How do you cope with such extreme constant panic and fear everyday?

All this is driving me insane, maybe I’m just a pussy but I feel like we’re moving WAAAAYYY to fast ): I like her a lot unfortunately and I love to talk to her, but college has been really stressing me as well as I’ve been REALLY stressing out because I’m not in a good financial situation and it’s making me panic, not to mention she calls me at 11PM and will talk to me until 3am... almost every night even when I try to go to sleep, ): so I’ve been getting roughly 3 or 4 hours of sleep every night for the past month

285,"My dad left my family when I was in middle school (now Junior in college).  Ever since then we’ve had minimal contact, and he was never the father figure that I felt I needed/wanted in life. 

It has left a pretty big hole in my heart, and caused a lot of personal issues such as:

-Trouble speaking to father figures 
-Trust issues in romantic relationships 
-Holding emotions in leading to outbursts 

I want to try to work on these issues and address them.  The trust issues have hindered me the most by making it difficult in my past relationships, and scaring away new ones.   I try my hardest to trust people, but it’s hard when your dad, who’s not supposed to leave, willingly chooses to remove himself from your life.  In which his reason, that I later learned, was because he couldn’t handle the responsibility and lifestyle that came with children.

286,"As a student/freelance professional moving to New York I chose a ""private"" room at a hostel for my (non-refundable) home base, hoping I'd find there just the right balance of privacy and economy.

289,"Everything started off simply enough one Friday at work. I was in the lunchroom eating my sandwich and reading a book as per my usual while my co-workers talked about their plans for the weekend. One of them was having a house-warming party and they were inviting everyone at work. I figured that the invitation was only extended to the people he was talking to until he asked me if I would be able to make it on Saturday. As it was the first time I had been invited to hang out after work, I chose to go. I spent all of Saturday getting ready, planning what were interesting topics to bring up in case there was a lull in conversation, and the bottle of wine I was planning to give him as a house-warming gift. After psyching myself up, I left to go to the party with the bottle in hand and my spirits high. I convinced myself that I was going to be the life of the party and that maybe if I played my cards right, I could finally find a friend at work that would make the time fly by instead of dragging on. It wasn’t until I reached the house that that false bravado began to crumple apart. I stopped in front of the neighbor’s house as everywhere else already had a car parked there. It was then that I felt my heart beating like I had just run a mile. I began heading up the driveway with the wine bottle slick in my hands from my palms sweating. It wasn’t until I reached the front door that I realized that something was terribly wrong. All that excitement that had been building up since Friday afternoon was now replaced with something else; apprehension. All those topics I had thought up seemed boring and all the re-assurances I had given myself seemed hollow. I didn’t feel prepared for this at all. At this point a small part of me whispered something that has stuck with me to this very day. That voice intimated that they never really wanted me to come out. They had only given that invitation as a courtesy and didn’t actually expect me to come out to their house. It said that if I knocked on that door that I would be making a fool out of myself. It told me that I wasn’t even comfortable in my own skin so how could I even dare to imagine that they would enjoy my company. They wanted to celebrate with their friends, they didn’t want to listen to me fumble for something to talk about. All those fears flashed in front of me, taunting me, demanding that I knock on the door and make myself look like an idiot. That part of me told me that I was better off alone and I listened. I turned around without even knocking on the door and I left. No one had come in and the music was playing loudly so I doubt that they would have heard me anyways. I shouldn’t have been there in the first place. Maybe I saw them watching me from the window, maybe I didn’t. Maybe they were laughing at me as I drove away, flustered and embarrassed. Maybe they went back to the party and joked about the social retard who had seemingly freaked out and run away from their house while I went home and cried in the shower. Maybe.",23Aug2018,1
290,"Ok so I was diagnosed with bipolar a few months ago, I’ve been suffering with bad mental health from when I was 13, it really affected my grades at A level as well as the foundation year from the university I got into. I was so far from home I had a bit of a breakdown, however in the module I was interested in pursuing onto a degree I gained 75+ on coursework pieces. I’m now on mood stabilisers and in a much better place, and ready to return to education.
I don’t want to return to my previous university, although I still have a place there, as commuting will be almost impossible (a 2hr drive) so I applied to a fairly well respected local university. There are other universities nearby I could attend, but none that would offer the level of support I need and the quality of education I want.
I have applied, however despite my case that my mental health affected most of my results, they’re not keen to accept me because they don’t feel I’m capable of studying at that level, which I know I would be if I was given a chance to prove myself. My coursework pieces and essays definitely reflect that. I’m incredibly passionate about the subject, and have done more than enough extra-curricular activities to prove this.
They’ve allowed me an opportunity to appeal my case, I’m not too optimistic, but I’m not sure what kind of things I should be putting in there, and what things I should avoid. Does anyone have any experience in doing anything similar, and what was the outcome for you?
This is my last chance to really do anything and I’m just kinda desperate.

292,"Im 22 years of age and have just been feeling lost in terms of what to do with myself in terms of college/apprenticeships and what direction to take really. I have given college a try but found I just wasn't able to settle and I believe there are many different reasons for that the main ones being I wasn't as sure about the courses I chose as I thought I was and stupidly rushed in. I'm torn between going back to college as a mature student and giving myself time to see what it is I want or there is the apprenticeship route but its only recently I have given that any thought and I don't want to make the same mistake and rush into something i'm not completely sure on again. 

The idea of forgetting about qualifications and the stress of deciding what to do as of now and just go travel and work abroad for a bit and gain some life experience is something that has been on my mind so much recently and maybe it is something I should do even if it is just for a year. I have always said I would want to have some type of qualification as now a days it does go along way to have something (depending on what that is of course) but I just feel I have wasted alot of my time worrying about college and trying to sort my life out at this age and maybe getting away from all that and even away from home will help me both mature more and help me with my decision making.

My teachers did not accept me in STEM class and insisted that it will be difficult for me (because i got a 3 in math-that is average) even though i already told them that i am interested in it, will do a good job, and put effort. I told them that did not want to take humanities, but they did not care. I feel frustrated over this situation. 

I do not like socializing and attention, but that is required in humanities because things have to be done in group like discussing aboput the topic and some presentations.

296,"I made a throwaway for this and now it's time for me to be completely honest. I don't want to be a teacher. If the profession were just about imparting knowledge and teaching useful skills, I would be happy. I thought I was just nervous about doing practicums, but I realize that wasn't it. It isn't about the students - it's about all the other garbage that goes along with the job. Unions, school boards, government - they all say they want to change things and make stuff better, but it's all still the same shit. Over the course of three practicums I have met some absolutely miserable teachers. Some who have only been in the profession for a few years, some who have been teaching for 20 - 30 plus years. Some who should not be around children at all. I know it would be stupid to not finish the degree, but what could I do with it other than teach? I have been able to maintain a 3.4 GPA and I have considered doing a Masters in something related but I don't know what. I have taken some technical writing courses (enough for a minor) and enjoyed them.

298,"For the past couple weeks I’ve been seeing a huge bunny in my backyard. Clearly domestic and very docile. I had no idea where it came from but was concerned because my neighborhood is surrounded by swamp and woods. There’s hawks, coyotes, foxes, you name it. At first, I thought maybe someone abandoned it.

I saw my neighbor’s daughter out front the other day and decided to ask her. Her and her younger brother are the only members of the family that speak English. She said it was her rabbit, and I told her it wasn’t a good idea to let it roam around freely and they should think about making an enclosure for it. She said that her parents told her rabbits didn’t like to be enclosed so they let it stay in the yard. However, it was roaming much further than their yard. 

This morning I woke up to my cat at the foot of my bed howling at the window so I got up to see what was up. In my backyard, a bobcat and her two babies. My immediate thought was that it was an awesome sight. The babies were tumbling around playing and mom was sitting nearby. Mom suddenly dropped into a crouch and started creeping up my lawn. She ran out of sight and I couldn’t see what she was after, but when she returned, there it was, my neighbor’s pet rabbit. There was nothing I could’ve done.

I’m pretty sure I’m the only one who saw it so I’m the only one who knows. As I said, her parents don’t speak English so I can’t talk to them directly. I have no idea what to do. How do I tell a young girl her pet was killed?",23Aug2018,1

So a guy I've been friends with for years is suddenly unreachable.

He last messaged me in May saying that he was going to leave his abusive wife and was looking for a place to stay, he ended up staying on the couch for that night and then was going to find somewhere to stay the next day. I haven't heard anything from him since.

Im worried about him since his wife when they were together tried to stop him contacting any friends or family, and he always had to talk in secret on a device she wasn't monitoring, and couldn't talk to anyone else when she was around.

Ive sent him a couple of messages and called him, but no answer, and I can see the messages haven't even been recieved. 

I think I was more in contact with him than any of our other mutual friends, so they haven't spoke to him recently either.

His social media hasn't been updated since May either.

One thought I had is maybe he is purposely making it hard to contact him so his wife can't find him, if he did end up leaving.

Or maybe he's just busy.

I don't know. I'm just worried.

I haven't contacted his family yet, I guess that is the next step. I haven't spoke to any of his family for about 13 years, so it will be weird speaking to them again.

I just want to make sure that I'm doing the right thing in looking into this.

Maybe everything is fine and he just didn't want to speak to me for whatever reason.

311,"Hello everyone,

I have been using the internet now for around eight years. When I got my first computer I was still a child, and shared it with my siblings in my bedroom. I didn't know anything about the internet or technology, and neither did my parents. I only started taking security seriously when I was around 14/15 and that's when I began doing frequent security scans and covering webcams. The same goes for my family (we discovered the true risks around the same time as each other). Our computer was an iMac, and our parents used the same thing. In both cases, the computers were opposite the beds, which means the camera's faced them. I've just had a terrible panic attack so I'm sorry for any misspellings which may ocur as I am still shaking. I had a jail broken iphone for about two years so I could access apps for free (I was a stupid kid). I also used to be really into minecraft and had a group of (well I hink they were) fellow children, whom I played with. some of which however I know where in their teens, possibly late teens, when I was about 11/12. I also skype chatted with them (non camera) and added one on himachi to play on a server. I used to lie about my age and other details to protect my privacy, and also so they wouldn't dismiss me as 'just a kid' but what if they could see me through the webcam and knew I was lying and it was just a game to them? Mostly we talked about minecraft but sometimes other things too. I don't remember specificlly downloading files from any of them. but there is a chance I did. I also may have clicked links sent by them with viruses. I also remember trying to download games for free, so who even knows what kinds of weird websites I was visiting, or what files I was downloading. So let's say there is around 4 years of using uncovered phone/computer cameras, during which time I also was speaking to what were essentially strangers online and downloading programs and files which in theory could have contained viruses. well I'm panicing now really badly because what if someone was looking at me or my family? In our bedrooms we would have been undressing and everything, and as I was a young personw ith access to the internet, I will admit I did view porn also, and would use my iphone in bed to play apps and talk to friends. What are the chances of this? I ahve heard some people do it just for fun, and others even share pictures of 'ugly' people they see. I'm paranoid now that maybe the whole time I was bugged, or someone had remote access to everything and now I'm all over parts of the internet.

When the inevitable happened and I got out of the toxic relationship my ex began to date said girl he cheated on me with, since then out of jealousy that girl has been harassing me. I blocked her phone number and his but I still receive calls and texts from unknown numbers. I’ve found letters in my post box, she comes to my door banging and shouting whenever she gets jealous of my ex or whatever.

I’m 18, I live on a small island and this is all terrifying to me, I’m going to move out eventually and get away from this all but this girl is really taking a toll on my mental health. She’s even spread rumours which have reached my grandparents ears.

313,"I have been going to an alternative high school for two years so far. So far I have failed 4 of my English classes because of the English teacher. He would not grade my assignments that I did. I keep telling the teacher that I have completed work from months ago that he has not graded. Other students also has not had their assignments graded.

Other students, including me, have told the principal about this teacher. The principal has done nothing to solve this. I can't switch teachers because there is only one teacher per subject.

I was thinking of going to guidance early the first day of school but our handbook says we can’t request to change or schedules just to have early dismissal.

I have been through hell lately, with my entire life falling apart. In the span of like 3 months I lost everything in my life.

  
I am 28 years old, never finished my education and currently unemployed due to unfortunate circumstances. My biggest regret in life is not finishing my degree and I am really conflicted. Is it too late for me to enroll and finish a degree? Should I just look for a job instead and just get by?

I don't think my boss is aware of this rumour. I really like the boss and have no issues with her, and she is absolutely not racist.

Incoming college sophomore here whose been working at a summer internship for a little over 1.5 months now. I've also already accepted an offer for a fall internship at a different firm that starts once school begins. I have a lot of reasons for not wanting to continue my summer internship with the main problem being the firm's lack of structure and toxic environment that hasn't taught me any useful skills in my time here so far. I always get stuck doing menial work such as scanning documents and other administrative tasks (mind you, I was initially hired as a finance intern). I am on the quarter system and still have around 3 - 4 weeks before school starts and my new internship begins. 

The problem here is that I had promised my current employer that I would continue into the fall quarter when I interviewed and can't think of a way to tell her that I've already made plans at another firm. Would it reflect badly on my part for blowing them off all of a sudden? Also, for those who have been in the workforce for a while, how common do things like this happen and is there some kind of general etiquette for not seeming like an asshole?

Yea, I hate wine, so I gagged, and spit it out over the trash can. I think I caught the professor scowling at me over spitting out the wine. He just picked himself back up and said “drinking wine requires an acquired taste, which I see a couple of you don’t have...” 

Wouldn’t say I’m embarrassed, but it’s obvious I was singled out in this moment, because everyone else drank their wine like everything was fine.

- feeling guilty when you haven't checked in on everybody because your busy or tired
- not wanting to discuss your own feelings or problems because they are trivial in comparison
- worrying that the advice you're giving isn't right as you're not a professional
- watching as your friends get themselves into worse situations 
- feeling like you can't be honest/straight with them because you might make things worse
- not wanting to be honest because you're worried they will stop talking to you (and anybody else)

My question is, since I was covered by my previous employer at the time of the accident could their insurance still take care of my bills today even though I'm with a different company as well it's been like a year ago?

I ended up moving halfway across the country last year around september because my dad got relocated for his job, I had no future at any college back home anyways. With about 580 students in my class, I was about ranked at 500. My ending GPA was about a 2.7 and out of 4 years of math I failed it twice, and I failed half a semester of a foreign language class and almost failed freshman math and sophomore english. I know I'm not stupid, I've been told I'm smart but I don't apply myself (gifted kid burnouts know the feeling). I've taken multiple AP classes, was in the gifted programs throughout elementary and middle school but school itself makes me miserable, doesn't help I had problems w/ my mental health and at times severe problems with it for almost the entire time I was in school, pretty much from 2nd-11th grade. I love learning, but I can't deal with the pressure of academics. I never learned to study, I got through 13 years of school barely doing homework, I only took notes my senior year because I only had 4 classes, extremely easy classes at that and desperately needed to get my GPA up. I'm just not good at school (although I did learn how to be a master bullshitter). 

The one thing I was always good at was art, the two highest scoring AP tests were in art and psychology. I've played with the idea of being an art dealer, a lawyer, a psychologist, a business owner, a dental hygienist, etc. But I always give up on the idea a few weeks later. I don't know what I want to do, but I also don't wanna be 20 years down the line wishing I went to school. But on the flip side, 20 years down the line I could have a degree but hate my job or my job might not even be utilizing my degree and wish I was doing something I enjoyed even if it meant making less money. Even now my only option is starting out at a community college (which I'm 100% ok with). I'm just stressing out so much because I feel like my time is running out to get into school before I totally give up on the idea. Do I just get into my local CCs 2 year assoc. program, don't declare a major and explore my options there?

I recently graduated college and I've been working for an informal, corrupt, and disorganized shitty company that is off the books and does nothing for me except look good on a resume. My boss has a huge attitude constantly and has the largest ego on planet earth with little amount of work to show for it. There's no room for growth and I physically sit in between my boss and my coworker for 8 hours a day that are constantly arguing with one another over my shoulder.  I've found a loaded gun and a box full of porn (bad porn) in this office, among other wacky things. That should have been enough for me to quit. My one issue is that I currently have a criminal record and I'm failing background checks left and right and this job has no idea about it. (my record will be wiped in a few years as per a plea deal. It's a non violent drug related offense and I've been sober for 6 months and complying with probation, I'd just prefer to not get into details about it.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my criminal record is holding me back severely from pursuing anything further in my career. It sucks. I've been really depressed about it. I can't sit in front of a computer from 9 to 5 anymore listening to people scream at each other. I can't have my soul drained by staring at a monitor for 8 hours a day. I can't sit around and mope about my mistakes anymore. I just have to move forward.

Not saying I'm going to rise to the ranks and become a restaurant owner by taking a waiter job, but I feel like it's a bold move to move from something within my degree to a waiter. It has potential, and room for growth, and certainly some good money.

Do I stick with this crazy job that looks good on paper so that when my legal bullshit is figured out I can say that I worked at X company for 3 or 4 years, or do I run very far away and do something else in the meantime with the risk of having to explain to future employers why I quit my job and became a waiter?

346,"So when i was 14 i met this girl at my high school and we both really liked each other. We ended up getting together 2 days after my birthday in 2016. Everything was honestly fine. She seemed happy and i was happy. Until one day in October i had gotten arrested and the cops had taken my phone and i was expelled from school for the time being. When they told me this i broke down. My relationship with her was over. When they left my kitchen and went into the living room I tried to send her one last text telling her I'd be gone for a while and i loved her but was caught doing so. Fast forward to one month later. The people we were renting our downstairs out to gave me a new phone. I made all new social media and whatnot and i hesitated before texting her. I decided to talk to my best friend about it first. He said just explain and maybe it'll work itself out. That was 2 years ago. I eventually went back to my school and she was there but wanted to be ""friends"". I thought as long as i bide my time everything would be ok. It's gotten worse. This girl had always been a pothead which was normal for people our age. Then in the summer of 2017 things took a turn for the worst. She was messing around in a bad part of my state and started doing heroin. I broke the fuck down and started smoking cigs. At that point i was averaging maybe 3 a day. That number has quadrupled since then. But suffice to say she cleaned up her act and everything was normal. She'd come over and we'd smoke pot and watch a movie and everything was normal. It was those times I enjoyed the most because it felt like i had her back for the time being. Everything else was fine until about may of this year. Her new boyfriend is apparently an abusive drug addict at 16 so that's always fun. And no matter what he does she can't find it in her heart to leave him. Then one night when i was sleeping over i woke up and she was cuddling me for some reason. She's tried to mess around with me in the past but it never really worked out. A few days later i asked if she was into me. She said no and it was just an in the moment thing. That same night i found out her boyfriend had cheated on her for the 8th time. She flipped out when I told her and just blocked me. I was depressed for weeks on end. I didn't know what to do so i ""apologized"". She's doing worse. She's started taking pills to cope with her pain and he's pushing them onto her. I slept over and at 5 am he calls her saying he's going to slit his throat unless she tells me to go home and have him go there. She says no obviously because i live 45 minutes away by car and he starts talking about all the awful shit hes going do when he sees her. What do i do? Im convinced im in love with this girl and i cant just move on. I've tried. We always keep coming back to each other but never been together after 2016. And what do i do about her abusive bf?

I am planning on calling the prop mgmt office because I don’t like that he’s a worker, knows I live by myself and thinks it’s okay to knock on my door at night. But what do you guys think, am I overreacting... should I do more?",23Aug2018,1
349,"My friend was caught sneaking into the girls changing room and taking pictures by a girl, and he partially blamed me. We're not friends anymore. The excuse he had for blaming me was because when she dragged him out she forgot that her boobs were out and I saw her nipples. Not only that, but my friend ran behind me and pushed me over so my face landed with my mouth near her nipple. He told the school I tried to suck her nipple, and even though the girl told them it wasn't my fault, they won't listen. ",23Aug2018,0
350,"I know this post may sound stupid. But when everyone around me is telling me to take a certain job because it is an opportunity to learn a new skill, it's hard to decide what to do. 

I'm 27 and didnt go to college. I've worked pretty basic office jobs since I graduated high school. Claims, receptionist, things like that. But I haven't really been able to move up in pay. 

I just started a job as a ""financial coordinator"" for a doctors office. 

I should start by saying that I absolutely hate math, numbers, or anything of the sort. Not only do I hate it, I'm just not good at it. My entire life I barely passed Math class. Numbers make me nervous. 

This job I took is not for much more pay then what I was making, but triple the responsibilities. To me it appears this company is hiring unqualified people so that they can pay them less. For example: dental assistants that have ZERO experience in the field and arent even certified assistants. 

I dont want this job. But everyone in my life is telling me I should try to learn this new skill since I did not go to college (and dont plan to). 

I'm having such a difficult time deciding what I want to do, vs what I should do. I keep doing what everyone else thinks I should do in life and I'm never happy. But maybe I just need to suck it up and accept that I'm never gonna get a job I enjoy doing because I didnt go to college.

This probably all sounds pathetic...I've been at this job a week and I am just miserable. ",23Aug2018,1

353,"Both me and my gf are 18, recently graduated and starting the next phase of life. After graduation my parents moved a state away and I was lucky enough to move in with my gf and her mom.

My mental health is seriously deteriorating and I am not doing well. I would love to go live with my parents again but my gf is not willing to move with me. Now obviously that's her decision, but we're going to be wanting our own place within 9 months to a year or so.

354,"I've done my best to organize my thoughts concerning this, as it's a complicated situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: this person has recently transitioned female to male. I point this out because I will be referring to him as ""her"" during the time he was female. I do this to keep the timeline straight, and because I have zero experience with him as a male, so it's hard for me to remember that she is now a he. In my memory, these deeds occurred when he was she.

&amp;#x200B;

BACKSTORY: My ex and I have been separated since 2014. Our relationship started when we met online in a fan community, and we discovered that we lived close to one another. I journeyed to her home, and it was very awkward. We had almost nothing to talk about except for the fan community we were both a part of. She couldn't hold a conversation. Her house was an absolute disaster. She didn't seem to put much effort into her appearance, and the entire environment made me uncomfortable. After we stumbled through conversation and a television show for two hours, I took my leave. We continued to talk over text, and she was great at holding conversation only through texting. I was 20 years old, and had no experience with romantic relationships. I was also inexperienced with watching out for my own best interests, and I was very impressionable. 

&amp;#x200B;

As we continued to talk, she kept managing to convince me to hang out with her again. We got together maybe twice a week or so, and a couple of weeks later, she ***informed*** me that we were now dating. This confused me, since she was currently married to a man and had four children, two from her husband's previous relationship and two small ones of his own. I wasn't brave enough to tell her that I wasn't really attracted to women (especially not her), and I didn't know how to talk about it, so I didn't. Fast forward - we'd been ""together"" for a little while. While we were dating, I was completely being taken advantage of. I paid for almost everything - meals, parking, extra activities, cosmetics, cigarettes, everything. Apart from this, she was not kind to me. She bullied and belittled me whenever I shared something I liked and was looking forward to. My life was a spectacle for her. I was currently interning as a mortician, and she was so entranced by that. She only wanted to talk about it, but she didn't seem to care about me as a person. I come from a religious family, and she asked for me to let her take my virginity for her birthday. I was incredibly uncomfortable and unhappy with this request, but as I stated previously, I was weak and impressionable. She got a fancy hotel room, asked me to dress up as one of the fictional characters from our fandom, and took my virginity. I cannot truly call this any type of assault, as I went there on my own accord. But I didn't want to. I cried in the shower afterward while she smoked on the balcony.

&amp;#x200B;

I engaged in a threesome with she and her husband, and I hated every minute of it. I hated myself for what I had allowed, and I didn't know how to make it stop. She emotionally abused me every time I tried to stand up for myself. She'd isolated me from my friends and family by demanding I spend all of my time with her, because hey...we were dating, right? That's what you do, she told me. Further fast forward - she wanted to go to Washington. I didn't really want to go, but it wasn't up to me. We went up there, and I actually quite enjoyed my time. She didn't, however, and I cannot figure out why. I went out of my way to keep her in a good mood. I checked with her before I did ***anything***. When we got home, she accused me of ruining her trip, and berated me over FB Messenger at 3AM. She said we shouldn't travel together anymore. Even through the barrage of messages, I still don't know what I did wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, I'm blocked on Facebook. She blocked my phone number, and that was the last I ever heard from her. Instead of the relief I thought I would feel...I didn't. I was crushed by this. What had I done? Was it this trip, or something else? It completely took over my thoughts and energy.

&amp;#x200B;

NOW: The trip to Washington has now become an annual thing because of an event held there every year. And event both he (now transitioned) and I attend. It is a large gathering, 500+ people. I am deeply involved in it (as a cast member and a planner of the event itself), and he is the photographer for a group of other cast members. Although we are not forced to interact with one another, we exist in proximity of one another, and it has caused multiple problems. This is where I need the advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a deep need to reconcile with him. Not because I want to be friends again (never ever), but because it is an open sore in my life, and I need closure. I am also a natural peacemaker. I need to know ***what the hell*** I did to warrant such sudden cut-off. Maybe it wasn't me, maybe it was him. I don't know. And the ""I don't know"" kills me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some more tidbits:

&amp;#x200B;

\-We have many overlapping friends, and they have all told me that he doesn't talk about me. He doesn't slander, gossip, or spread hateful comments. So...what does that mean? Am I truly blameless, or is he trying to erase any existence of me? Along with this, no one in our friend circle knows what's happened (including me). I'm not able to gather any information from them, but this further solidifies that he doesn't discuss me at all. I can't tell if this is from some type of regret of being with me, or if he's just hoping I'll go away if he can't see me. Or maybe he knows he was terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Because he has transitioned, he may have ""grown up"". He may have gained a little more life experience, and maybe some perspective. I'm not banking on this very much, but I'm hopeful. I have had very, very little contact with him in four years, so I have no way to gauge this.

&amp;#x200B;

\-He claims to have Asperger's, but no official diagnosis. This would explain the inability to think outside of himself, and the unkindness he shows to people close to him.

&amp;#x200B;

\-This rift is causing me difficulty with personal and and professional relationships. Because we have overlapping friend groups, they feel they have to take sides. They will not allow me to carpool with them for the 4-hour trip to our destination in Washington from SeaTac because he is riding with them, and I now have to pay for an expensive rental car. They also won't allow me to spend time with them because he's attached to their group. They like me, and we are friends, but if he's present, they don't want me there. It's out of loyalty for him, am pretty sure. A prominent member of the Chamber of Commerce is aware of our difficulties, and won't allow us to work near one another for events - this causes ***so many*** problems with scheduling an event for 500+ people. I have repeatedly told this member that I am willing to work beside him if he can be professional. She will not even entertain the notion, thus limiting professional opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

He's recently unblocked me on FB, but has not attempted to reach out to me. I am going back to Washington for this event in September. I would like this at least starting to be resolved before then. Am I a complete idiot for wanting to reach out?

&amp;#x200B;

This is a really personal, emotional, and difficult topic for me. I have three open wounds in my life, and I am doing my best to close them. Any advice is appreciated. I know I am missing some parts of this story, but I've done my best to include them all. Thanks for reading.

358,"Hello,
So I just started a job a week ago at an optometrists office. The optometrist is my husband’s uncle, and he needed someone to scan in documents and do a little pre testing for the patients. 


It’s a super easy job. I will spend about 5 minutes with each patient and then the rest of the day I am scanning in papers. The problem is, I have only gotten a few stacks of papers to scan and it takes like... 10 mins tops? I will do it slowly to drag it out and make it look like I am busy but it really is not that much. There are two receptionist ladies that seem to be very annoyed with me when I ask if there is anything Extra I can do. I will take anything extra they have but it usually takes like ten minutes to do THAT stuff. The only other things are a few papers to file away each day and then of course cleaning. But I clean the office at nights so there is nothing to clean during the day! 
I have asked the optometrist and he says to just “take whatever comes my way”.... whatever that means. 

Does anyone have advice for what other little things I can do to stay busy? Or how can I make the job more than it is? I am afraid of bothering the ladies.",23Aug2018,4

Throughout our time in the house, we’ve cycled through many different roommates but my girlfriend and I are two of the three original people who found the house in the first place. The third original roommate is actually our landlord’s daughter. 

This past year, there have definitely been a lot of miscommunications and small fights about a dozen things within the household between my girlfriend, in particular, and some of the other roommates. 

We had a roommate meeting a few nights ago to discuss our upcoming lease renewal date (Oct 1) but instead of a discussion or meeting, we were handed a typed letter essentially saying that because of increased tensions in the household the four other roommates are giving us a 30(ish) day notice to vacate the house before the lease renewal date. In the letter they stated that the decision was not open to debate or discussion and they all signed it. 

What should I do? The landlords daughter is also a very good friend of ours and she messaged us saying that it was a hard decision but she ultimately signed the letter because she wanted to do what was best for the “household dynamic”. I don’t buy it. We literally did nothing wrong. 

The new roommates are also very toxic and manipulative and I just feel like I’m in a twilight zone, like we’re getting kicked out of our own house by people who have lived there a lot less longer than we have.

I sneak into the shared areas like a fucking agent on a stealth mission to avoid her. I rejoice when I pull into the driveway and her car is gone!

For reference, I am an eighteen year old girl in college and she is 70ish. I have been living with her for 8 months and am FUCKING FED UP.  I don't know if I'm not able to live with other people, or if my concerns are legitimate. 

There are lots of things that my landlord does that put me in a shitty mood. I am going to type them out and its probably going to sound really whiny, but I want to know if the way that she acts is inconsiderate. Maybe I am just really irritable.

Without warning. I come home and see random people working on her house, or am home alone and random workers come. I am never notified ahead of time. Is this normal? How do I address this? 

She is constantly guilting me into doing things for her. I doesn't help that I am a pushover and hate confrontation. I really don't mind helping people out, it actually makes me feel good when I can help someone when they are struggling. She asks for my help as if I owe her something. ""Maybe you could help me with... right now"". If I refuse because I don't have time (because helping her takes hours) or can't, she gives me a huge fucking guilt trip. I end up helping her.

My landlord is very invasive. She is always asking questions about phone calls, grocery store trips, and plans. She looks at my receipts and tells me that I spend too much. She has come into my room while I am sleeping, and woken me up to help her with things. When I object, she tells me that it will only take a few minutes.  She is always frantically knocking on my door or my bathroom door (we don't share a bathroom).  She calls me in the middle of the night. She always interrupts me while I am on the phone. She asks me why I'm not studying. etc.

She invites herself to go on my errands with me. 

Her: ""Where are you going?"" 

Me: ""location that I am going to*""*

Her: ""Oh, I'll go with you""

Me: *fuck*

My landlord tries to force me to eat food when I'm not hungry or to eat her food when its going bad.  She also tries to get me to eat junk, and pesters me when I say no. 

She monitors how many times I shower and use the laundry. I am careful about and conscious of the water shortage. It's annoying. 

She pushes her religion on me and makes me go to meetings with her. 

My landlord keeps unrealistic standards for me about the cleanliness of my bathroom and the kitchen. She randomly enters my bathroom and looks in the shower for stray hairs, and makes me dry off the shower after each use. We don't even share a fucking bathroom.

Sorry for all of the word vomit. Am I being an ass, or is this unusual? If these are real issues how do I address them? She has no concept of the word ""no"". Living with her is driving me insane. I don't want to hurt her feelings because I truly care about her. I am also a huge pushover who doesn't know how to be assertive or set boundaries. Help?

377,"
Many years ago, I had a friend who I got on absolutely fantastically with. We had lots in common, could chat for hours, and helped each other through some tough times. Turned out that they were a lying, gaslighting narcissist who completely destroyed my chances of a career by making promises re. putting me forward for jobs that they (in retrospect) had no intention of keeping. What's killing me is that I ignored the signs (ie none of their promises ever materialized) because we were SUCH good friends, or so I thought. I cannot believe that I fell for the lies they spun me. I eventually cut off contact abruptly and completely after my eyes had, too slowly unfortunately, opened to what was going on.

Fast forward to now, and while I had put this person to the back of my mind for years, over the past couple of years I have found myself thinking of them more and more and my anger towards them has increased. They basically ruined my career. I now work in a field completely unrelated to what I studied for. I am stuck and unhappy and too emotionally numbed to get out of this rut. I also have financial responsibilities so I need to have money coming in. 

How do I get over this? What good would therapy do, If any? I can feel this anger bubbling inside me, and some of it is directed at myself  - looking back, how could I have been SO STUPID?? I haven't given specific examples here (for anonymity's sake), but believe me when I say their 'excuses' game was strong, consistent and very convincing.

I was already told I got the job later that day from HR but cant shake the feeling that something's gunna fuck it up and I wont get it. I took a drug test(swab test) the other day and went to sign the paperwork for my backround check, which means I'm only 1 step from receiving the job. Now my anxiety went higher because of it, I think I wont pass the drug test. I dont do any drugs besides just smoking weed occasionally. The swab test usually goes back 1 or 2 weeks so I'm not sure why I have anxiety over it. I fear that the swab test is so good it will make a trace of it and I wont get the job anymore.

381,"We have been together 3 and a half years, living on opposite ends of the continent a few timezones apart. Me in Canada, him in the USA. We visit each other about twice a year for a few weeks at a time. We met online through a mutual friend, and eventually got closer playing video games together, skyping, sending mail to each other, etc.

As the title says, I'm not too great at expressing how I feel, mostly because I don't even know how I'm feeling most times. I am not very in touch with myself, something I've had most of my life. This means he has a hard time knowing how I feel as well. When it comes to going out somewhere to eat, visiting his family, or anything, he might ask ""are you ok with this?"" or ""do you like this?"" and I honestly won't even know. My mind is just blank. I really wish I knew how things made me feel because then I could say them, but all I feel like is a dumbass sack of flesh. I just go along with whatever is happening.

He's told me he has difficult time knowing if anything he does is making me happy and I can tell it hurts him. This goes for anything intimate as well. Or gifts. Or doing most things together. 
I appreciate him and everything he does for me. I just wish I could give him more feedback. 

I have never been someone who talks a lot. When we first were starting to know each other, I felt I had to be more talkitive to be more friendly and polite. But the closer I get to people, the less I talk to them because there's not as much pressure to be that way.

When it comes to friends or people I am not as close to, it's easy for me to blend in and get caught up in the mood, making it look like I'm having a good time. I wouldn't call it ""faking"" how I feel, but it's definitely dramatized so I don't seem like I'm a party pooper. Even then, I feel kind of odd, like it's forced and awkward and I'm worried people can tell

I just want to be able to help him feel like he is appreciated. I know just saying ""I appreciate you/what you did"" is better than saying nothing at all, but I don't want to be a robot. When he asks if he makes me happy, of course I say yes. He's a very considerate person, generous, down to earth, with a similar sense of humour to mine. Even if I don't feel actively happy every day we are in this long distance relationship, I don't want to lose him. I have a feeling this is the closest thing to being happy loving someone I will get. 

How can I express my appreciation/gratitude?",23Aug2018,1
382,"When I was younger, my step dad used to be a drunk. (My step dad isnt my moms current boyfriend) He would beat ever since I could remember and it was a constant ""I'm going to leave him, but wait no I love him."" It would always be me standing up for her or making him back off. My step dad also use to sexually abuse me, it started when I was 10 years old. 

When they were together, I would have anxiety attack when they would have sex. It probably has to do with what I went through when I was younger. 

I have to temporarily live with my mom and her boyfriend. I know they will have sex, shes happy and is with a wonderful guy.

So here’s the dilemma, I’m not great at throwing parties. It’s always the same group of people, but for one reason or another, it’s just not the same vibe when I host as opposed to one of the guys in the group. 

If it makes any difference at all to know this, we range in age from early 20s, 30s, 50s, and 60s. I’m making beef stew, there’ll be beer, wine, snacks, dessert. I’ll put on music, but I don’t know what kind will make for a good relaxing time.  We’ve got sufficient seating between two couches, a recliner, and some chairs at the table. 

I don’t know. My wife and I just aren’t good at hosting. We have a good time, but my one friend is so good at hosting it puts my parties to shame and it’s killing me because I can’t put my finger on what it is he does differently.

Because of that one relationship they knew of, they are extremely cautious about me having any contact with the opposite sex. Even male friends are a huge no. 

But I've actually been in a relationship with my black/Asian bf for about 2 years now. We're both serious about each other and are considering marriage and a family in the future. His family knows and likes me but they're getting impatient, asking why I haven't introduced him to my family yet. They immediately say it's because my family is racist and warn my bf that he'll have his heart broken.

I do really want to introduce him, but 
1) my parents are traditional, conservative Asians - e.g. my grandmother was temporarily kicked out of the house for not bearing a son, my uncle was disowned for marrying a Filipina
2) are, again, extremely cautious about any male contact on my part 
3) have arranged potential Asian fiances for me before
4) are pretty racist, but especially racist against blacks 
5) would be extremely critical about my bf's background (middle class, divorced parents)

So I'm talking to a guy.... and I'm thinking too far ahead, as per usual.

398,"I know the title sounds crazy and it would be an immediate no from anyone and everyone, but hear me out.

I'm a female under 20 and have been messaging this woman who I actually met on reddit. She (under 30) approached me as we both post on gonewild subreddit and asked to chat. We got on really well and one thing lead to another, she said flat out she would pay an airplane ticket to her country for me. I'd stay there and basically have hot kinky sex with her and her husband while also doing some road trips and normal touristy stuff, but staying at their house. She offered all this for basically in a months time.

The reasons why I think it's legit: - she's verified for multiple subreddits (and has her own) - has sent me multiple photos of herself (one of her in her work uniform) and one of her holding a piece of paper with my name - she's showed me photos of her kids and her husband (with her also in the photos) - her reddit history matches up with what she's told me about her personal life - she's the one paying for my plane ticket for some unbeknownst reason and I could literally be the murderer in this situation??? - she has sent me Google Drive videos of her and her husband that she has never posted

Reasons why I don't think it's legit: - why wouldn't she find someone else closer to her, in her own country for free?? - why would you let some random person come into your house with kids etc?

Should I accept? I really want to, but a part of me thinks I'm being gullible and what if something goes wrong? What questions could I ask to see if she's actually a murderer or something?

I don't even know what I'd say to my family, they clearly know I don't have enough money to randomly jet off to this country. And my boyfriend would think I'm insane (we have a semi open relationship). But I just really really want to travel and she's so up my alley in terms of kink - this offer just seems too good to refuse!

TL;DR: I met a lady on reddit, she's offered to pay for me to fly to her country and stay with her and her husband in exchange for hot sex (of which I am down for). But it seems to good to be true and I don't want to be murdered.",23Aug2018,1

He tells me how desirable and perfect he finds my body, but he will occasionally hint that he wants me to get ''thicc'' for him.

I'm not going to pack on pounds for him, but despite his reassurances that he loves my body just the way it is, it saddens me that my body lacks what arouses him the most, like a big ass for example. I know he will stop making these comments if I tell him to (and I do plan on talking to him about this) but it won't change the fact that I know deep in his mind he is still probably wishing I were bigger, and comparing me to other girls he finds more attractive than me.

I found out she had a boyfriend already but it wasn't working out they weren't seeing each other often at all, etc. We basically got close very quickly. 

After about a month or so me and 2 friends went out to grab a drink. It was fun but after a while they said they needed to tell me something and started warning me about this girl and how she's good at manipulating people to like her, she likes having loads of boys around her and so on. Every time she's had a boyfriend she was already busy with some other guy before she broke up. Nothing unfaithful but just getting ready for the next relationship or whatever. She also apparently doesn't keep friends very easily, she tends to lose them after a while due to some argument or fight. 1 of them had first hand experience and the other has a girlfriend who was once best friends with this girl.  Anyways, I was developing feelings for her, needless to say. I chose not to act on them because I wouldn't want toxicity in my life, but I didn't wanna just drop this person since we became so close. I chose to just be wary of what she says and put it into context and if anything bad should happen then that's that. I would be able to take it, idc, what's one less toxic friend? She eventually even talked about the issues my friends mentioned herself and started saying how she can't take things slowly with boys and feels guilty every time, even though some of those relationships were toxic and so on.

After a while you could say we were becoming best friends, throughout juli and the start of august we saw each other just as often, had a ton of fun. Then we went to a party together and I went over to her house afterwards. We started kissing, things got out of hand, we started touching each other, but put a stop to it before things got too serious. I stayed over but slept in a different bed, wasn't the first time I slept over. We talked it through the day after, saying she was crushing on me but now it might be more than that, I told her the same thing but added that I'm not very in touch with my feelings sometimes so I apologized if I was giving the wrong signals, etc. A few days later the exact same thing happened, which was admittedly dumb. My feelings for her just grew immensely after that. She says her feelings for me did too. She still has a boyfriend who she doesn't like, and who never wants to see her. It's weird.

Now that everything has been made concrete by our actions and words it's way harder to just dismiss my feelings. Do I let this girl go? If so, how? I don't have the balls to tell someone to disappear from my life. Do I ignore my friends advice? Do I go for it? I feel like I wont be satisfied with any answers because I can't provide enough nuance via text. It might also be I just wanna hear what I wanna hear, which is that I should just go for this girl.

My sister was never allowed to set foot outside the house alone until this year, and she is a legal adult. No one is allowed to set foot inside the house without cleaning their feet thoroughly first. There is also a set of beliefs we are expected to follow: every outsider has it out for us, there is no such thing as a true friend, mom is never wrong, and dad is an infidel. 

It wasn't always like this, according to my dad. When they got married, she was never that concerned about germs, she was never a control freak, and never assumed the worst of him and others. However, it got worse over the years and now her fingerprints are usually nearly gone from excessive hand washing. She will believe my dad is cheating on her from a single ""wrong look"" on his part and twist information around to suit her point of view. Whenever they aren't fighting, she is complaining about other people to him, those other people often being my sister and I- it is not rare that she calls us stupid, bad children, and undeserving of her. Our self esteems are pretty much down the drain.

My dad is aware of the high possibility of mental illness being involved. However, he has never done anything and lets her wear him down with verbal torture. He has hurt himself before and has tried to kill himself before. However, a few days ago I heard a struggle during one of their fights so I went to check on them. I see him lying face down, unmoving, and no one would tell me what happened. His speech was very fragmented and all my mom told me was that he was faking it so that he could avoid talking to her. When I asked him what happened, all he said was ""I want to die.""  I always fear for his life whenever things like this happen so in a panic, I called 911. They sent police and an ambulance and it turned out, he overdosed on cough syrup but he was fine.

I recognize that this isn't as serious as what some other people may do, but I could not bear to let anything happen to him. After the police left saying they couldn't do anything unless he wanted to them to, my mom became furious with me saying I was evil, that I hated them, that it would be on our permanent record, that he might get fired, that our neighbors now hated us and would want nothing to do with us, and that we'd go homeless because of what I did. I felt hopeless. This all happened around 3 am and about 30 minutes later when my dad got some strength back, he tried to kill himself again and said he should have drank more cough syrup. I had to hold onto him for hours to make sure he wouldn't try anything, with my mom daring him by saying he was pretending and wouldn't actually do it. 

She has still been berating me and claims that he only had one dose while he says he had at least ten. Things like this are normal for me but this has been the worst few days of my life. I am also going back to school in just a few days. I really appreciate anyone taking the time to read and respond to this since it's so long. I don't even know where to start and all this is only half of what goes on so I'll try my best to answer any questions. Thank you.

411,"So I’m a 29 M and have worked tons of jobs. You name it, I have probably done it. The past few years I’ve been doing live sound and production and I initially loved it. Working with bands and getting paid to go to concerts was a dream.

I enjoy working in the music industry and the money isn’t bad.  However, the hours are horrible, there aren’t any benefits and I can’t really take vacations. Also I’m starting to realize that the environment of working in bars and music venues is not very great for me.

As I get a little bit older I realize I really just want some stability(more than one day off a week,  consistent paychecks, healthcare,etc), but it is also hard for me to leave what I initially thought was my dream job just to start from scratch not knowing what I would do.",23Aug2018,1
412,"Currently a junior in college (21F) struggling with feeling very overwhelmed with everything. I am a transfer student from community college and I was lucky enough to receive a full tuition scholarship to a major university. The scholarship comes with requirements which include taking specific classes, being a part of a committee, participating in certain teams, and completing a total of 3 internships. This all is great and in the long run very beneficial to me, but I can’t help feeling very overwhelmed with all of this. Completing 3 internships in the span of 2 years is kind of stressing me out. Not to mention I also got into the honors program at the university which has additional requirements of taking specific classes, projects, etc. I also live off-campus and I commute about 45 mins every day to class. I can tell I’m procrastinating already because I feel so stressed out. I know I am capable of great things, I also know that with my history of anxiety/depression I can get really down on myself if I don’t feel like I can overcome challenges that I am faced with.

It's not like bullying ends there, but at least in my experience, that was when bullies were the most heartless and sadistic. And I grew up in the age of social media, so I was around for cyberbullying, which made it even worse, in my opinion. For people who want to hurt others, the internet made the task a million times easier.

So basically I go to community college.

With five classes remaining I should graduate this Spring with a computer degree. 

Slight problem. Some of the classes I have left require the classes I was planning to take next semester as a prerequisite before I can take them. I want to take them at the same time to save time and money. I have talked to the ""program coordinator"" (who happens to have sued the school for not getting this position because of discrimination, even though he did not apply for it. I just googled his name and happened upon this). The program coordinator basically ignored everything I said about my experience with computers (booting multiple OS's off my laptop, coding experience, etc) and told me to get a certificate. It was like he was reading off a script.

Well, that was of no use. I really do not want to spend more than two years at a community college. Is there another person who can look into this for me and over ride the prerequisite? Since it is a community college, sometimes the classes do not fill up enough and get cancelled. I'm afraid I will be here forever if I do not find another faculty member to do this for me. 

Please advise.

418,"I was a generally happy person before college, my freshman year was super hard, moving out to a different country, entering an elite engineering school, being completely isolated and barely making friends, falling into depression and my grades suffered greatly, which further increased my depression

i was always the smartest kid, first in my school, perfect grades, etc, good grades were always a big part of my self esteem, now i don’t know what i am anymore.

i dropped out after two years and now i went back of going back after 4 gap years, i’m in a somewhat better mental state and i’m in treatment for my depression, still struggling with studying bc of my self doubts that have manifested in freshman year, i genuinely think i can strive without these mental blocks, the material isn’t even very hard for me imo

i’m super self conscious about being older than my classmates, all of my peers and old friends are now in full time employment with degrees etc, and i’m a sophomore, and other than that i feel like if i don’t succeed academically i am nothing


me and my therapist agreed that i put too much emphasis on academic success and i’m letting it define me, but i don’t really have any talents, no other outlets, cant sing can’t write, my social life is ok at best. i was always the smart kid who got good grades as pathetic as it sounds, and my parents had extremely high hopes for me which kills me inside

i feel like i’m wasted potential

420,"My boss hired a temp to help our little department out with work while someone else is out on extended medical leave. Things got off to a rocky start because she made a LOT of mistakes in the beginning and I wrote a thought out response to my boss highlighting the problems. She talked it over with me and then addressed them with the temp (who did not take it well). The truth is, I only outlined to my boss the traceable mistakes that Britney had been making in her work but not the unprofessionalism that I witness being out here with her in the cubicle. She watches things on her phone all day. The FIRST day here she had both her headphones in all day. People here do put in a headphone (I do) but she didn't even wait to see if that was appropriate in this environment. When she finishes a task, she doesn't let anyone know so that she can do nothing until someone says ""are you busy"" and she says no. She's been told multiple times to speak up when she doesn't have anything to do. 

I mean, it's really just a combination of things that makes it obvious that she's not really interested in doing a good job. 

But the weird thing is, during the HOUR long personal phone call she was having at her desk (distracting me), I overheard her (I wasn't eaves dropping, we sit together in an open space with half cubicles) she told her friend she was stressed because she feels underqualified for this job. She isn't dumb, just not a hard worker. At least I think. Trying to give her a hint, I very awkwardly asked her to take her personal call outside because I get distracted easily. I assumed she would have just hung up, but no she went outside to continue her personal call and didn't come back for a half hour when it was time to leave. I guess I have myself to blame for that one.

I'll be honest, there are a few extra factors at play. One, my boss is very lenient when it comes to people under her wasting time (long personal calls, browsing facebook, etc.) and I hold myself to a higher code of professionalism than is absolutely required. Two, I'm extra irritable due to poor mental health (I'm getting help) but I recognize my own brain is blowing things out of proportion. Third, I'm a naturally nonconfrontational person so it's hard for me to be frank about the whole thing, which unfortunately leads to things building up. Finally, the girl is actually nice enough and she knows I don't like her (I mean my awkward attempt at niceness where I blamed myself for being distracted by her long personal call, and apologized for being rude, and assured her she was doing nothing wrong, probably clued her in on how hard I was forcing it) and I would prefer not to compound the situation because not only do I care about her feelings, I will probably have to work with her for the unforeseeable future. 

So the question is, where do I go from here? Do I go to my boss again to highlight my other concerns? Or will that look like I can't play well with others? Do I do nothing? What coping mechanisms can I use to cage my irritation? If she is going to stay, how do I scrabble together a working relationship with someone who I don't respect or trust?",23Aug2018,1

1. He is a Veteran in his late 20's that claims to have PTSD.
2. He has paid on time, but often does not have enough money to buy himself food. His parents will bring him groceries.
3. He constantly picks arguments or makes negative comments to anyone including other tenants/visitors
4. He asks for us to buy him things or give him rides because he lost his vehicle from not making payments
5. He brought bed bugs into the home from wherever he was staying before and the house has had to be treated regularly since.

429,"Just typing this out I feel like a total creep. Man, the mind sure does have it's ways of making you feel like human scum for things you can't control. So first let me start by saying I have a girlfriend. Towards the end of last school year (I was a freshman) I started noticing this really cute girl in my class. Then as it went on, I started thinking about her more and more. She just seemed perfect. And then I felt like I had a crush on her or something, but seeing as we've never even spoke more than two words to each other, I felt really weird about it and decided not to do anything. Summer came. And I sorta forgot about her, but how that school started again I can't stop thinking about her. It's like a deep aching feeling. I've lost attraction and love for my current girlfriend and am honestly kinda just waiting for the right moment to end things with her, but I think this crush has turned into something more. But we've never barely even met! I feel so creepy about this. And to top it off, she has a girlfriend. Meaning she's either gay or bi, which is totally cool.

I’m at my wits end and unfortunately my mum has too many bills to currently pay for so is unable to help me. 

We have no other family around here and my friends wouldn’t be able to help out either. The NHS doesn’t cover toenail removal surgery because they deem it as ‘cosmetic only.’

432,"I’m not exactly sure where to start but I’m losing my mind over this matter...

So I have a cousin who I’ll name Jane. I haven’t seen Jane in over 15 years (we were toddlers yet I do remember playing with her). Her mother and father(my uncle) divorced when we were very young and her mother held full custody. 

According to my grandmother, she’s very important to this story later on, Jane’s mother accused my uncle that he abused her which gave her automatic full custody and my uncle gave up and turned to alcohol and other harmful substances. Now my uncle has temperament issues but my grandmother has told me that Jane’s mother is very manipulative and my uncle never laid a finger on her. Although he did argue intensely with her when he found out about her affair. We’ll name Jane’s mom as Becca.

According to the court, our family was not allowed to ever make contact with Jane until she was 18 years old, yet Becca’s step-mom would secretly mail letters to my grandmother updates about Jane every few months. The step-mom felt remorseful over how the feud ended in bad blood and how she was so sorry she can’t see her grandchild. She also stated that Becca was a “Spiteful and manipulative bitch who deserves to face the consequences of her actions.” Ending the letter with a tease of how funny it is that Becca’s tattoo says “Bitch” on her neck. So obviously Becca’s step-mother hates her guts for what she did.  The letters stopped around 2006.

Fast forward to now, Jane is now 18 years old. My grandma recently told me that I should look up Jane on social media, which I did, she absolutely bawled when she saw how grown up Jane had become. Praying to the lord to let her be reunited with her grandchild Jane. I thought I should follow her on Instagram just so I could keep tabs on her. So I did.

Well, little did I know was that my younger cousin (he was born WAY after Jane’s departure) had got ahold of Jane and quickly told her so much information of how we knew her that I’m afraid it overwhelmed her. Now I had no idea why my aunts and uncles agreed to immediately tell him to ask her to FaceTime and catch up, but they did. In my opinion, I think they rushed into it, before they even did all that BS I had planned to carefully take it slow and ask her if our grandmother could send a letter explaining everything and her sorrow. 

Everything was a FUCKING MESS. She was overwhelmed about them bombarding her with questions and demanding answers. I’m getting pissed off thinking about it. They even fucking filmed it for YOUTUBE. A personal fucking reunion and they thought it was fine to fucking film it and put on YouTube for my cousins’ shitty channel.

Let me add, Jane’s father was not there during the FaceTime call because he was ashamed. 

To me, I think Jane should have been introduced to our Grandmother first and foremost before the rest of my trashy family. I think she was affected most out of the whole feud because she absolutely is an amazing Grandma and loves every single one of her grandchildren more than life itself. She spent months grieving over this temporarily long lost of Jane. Hell, if we even say her name now she’ll tear up.

Anyway, Jane stated that she needed more time to think about everything. A few weeks go by and no word from Jane. Again my Grandma tells me to DM her asking if it was okay if I could giver her contact information of Grandma and her father. 

Days go by and no answer. My grandma is disappointed and leaves to her home. Then, just now Jane messages me back stating that she does not want any contact with any of us. The reason being is that her father had hurt her mother and hurt her because he never bothered to ever make contact with her. Shit, right?

Now, I’m unsure of what the hell I’m going to do. 

1. I’m terrified of telling my grandmother. I honestly don’t know how she will react.
2. I hate being in the middle of this. 
3. I don’t even know how to react. Do I text her back like “k lol” or “you don’t want an explanation?” Or “bro grandma will literally die when I tell her you hate us.” 

I’m not going to tell my uncle yet because he’s not ready. 

TL;DR
     Made contact with long lost cousin. She said she hates our family and doesn’t want any contact. Petrified to tell my Grandmother who might lose her again.

433,"I'm a male in my late 20s and early 30's that live in quite a large and diverse city. It's not impossible to find plenty of different backgrounds and cultures where I'm from, especially myself being a person of color.

I often think about racial inequality and racial issues a lot, especially when it comes to dating. Personally for me, I'm pretty self aware enouugh to know that the type of women I find myself going for are Asian women. I know, I know. Just hear me out.

I fully understand what Asian fetishism is and I'm not trying to be that person at all. I don't want to date Asian women simply to fulfill a fantasy nor do I have any warped expectation of how an Asian person, male or female, should look and act like. I don't believe in the model minority myth and I do my very best to learn as much as possible about different cultures and backgrounds so that I won't be racially insensitive. Most importantly, I'm definitely not trying to date or have sex with every Asian girl under the sun. I've even found myself going on tinder dates with non-Asian women, fully knowing that I truly desire someone who shares my passion for music, arts and stuff like that. 

But the hard reality is....I do have a pattern and I do feel a little...guilty? It's kind of hard to explain and I can't exactly put it into words. To me, it's like knowing that all I eat is chicken tenders from fast food restaurants when there's plenty of other things on the menu. I'm pretty picky with my food. Every now and then I'll deviate and choose a burger or even stay home and cook some jambalaya, stir fry or....SOMETHING ELSE. But any other day, I'd rather just have chicken fingers and call it a day. I know that I shouldn't and I'm self-aware enough to know that I should eat something else but...I don't. I like what I like.

Am I thinking too hard about this? The last thing I want is for people thinking that I'm only dating someone because of the color of their skin. I expect people to treat me like I'm human and recognize that people will continue to view me in a particular light regardless because of my skin color, so when I'm dating I try to remember that and focus on my potential partners as human beings with real emotions, aspirations, and desires. I make an effort to do that so that they know I have no ulterior motives.

I’m also on the ASD and even though it hardly affects my day to day life I easily find interacting with others, making friends, and simply keeping a conversation going more difficult than it ought to be. I never had many friends so I usually resulted to talking to a family that I hardly liked and conversing with a father who didn’t even feel sorrow for me when I needed it most. About my mother I never really got to know her because I was taken away from her at the states request at a young age. I did really stupid stuff when I was a kid which I’ll admit that resulted in many not wanting to go near me; I usually tried to just stay away from people at that point, keeping myself secluded from others all the while my family insulted me about having no friends, comparing me to others, and never respecting my feelings. I was deemed lazy, manipulative, rude, and hateful by the people close to me. My words were twisted around by people who I trusted the most, and I was deemed incapable of many things that I could easily do if I was given a chance. My siblings spilled close secrets about me (ones I hardly could handle keeping to myself let alone leaking out) which are now known by members of my family who I hardly even know let alone ever meeting them. Now at the age of 19 I’m afraid of going to college as I deem myself stupid and incapable of handling the work. I probably would have somewhat of a difficult time because I’ve always had trouble in math until my senior year of High School where I was averaging a B- in that class. My strong subjects are history and reading still I lack complete faith in myself, I don’t know how to drive a vehicle, I still live with my family, I hardly make much money even though I’m constantly searching for a job, and on top of that I have no friends; the people who I once thought of as friends said I was always simply a pawn for them and could care less about me. I don’t blame them, I’m worthless, stupid, and at this point my life is a waste for me and everyone involved in it. Sometimes I think about just ending it all...

This friend still lives at home with her parents and does not work (gets welfare) so she doesn’t really do anything all day. Around 4:00 Pm she will see her boyfriend as that is when he gets off work.

I’ve been staying over lately to Help her pack because she’s moving out and going to university. But I noticed she doesn’t wake up in the morning!

Her child will come into her bedroom to wake her up and she still won’t wake up! Her daughter will say things like “grapes” or “juice” because she is asking for food! It’s really sad, and my friend will just put a show on Netflix on her phone and give her phone to her kid and go back to bed!

Since I’ve been over, I’ll wake up with her kid and feed her and watch a show with her, get her dressed and such. I know I’m enabling my friend’s bad bahaviour by doing this but I’m only thinking about helping the innocent 3 year old who didn’t ask to have an irresponsible mother.

And the crazy part is she has to drop her child off at daycare by 7:00 am and she doesn’t get there until 11 am because she sleeps in and can never find a single thing in the morning (car keys, shoes). Her house is constantly a mess and she never cleans up.

I’m worried about what will happen when my friend moves to her own apartment and doesn’t have friends and family around to help. If she can’t wake up to just take her child to daycare, I can’t imagine her waking up when she has to drive her child to daycare then go to class herself.

447,"Myself and a woman in my university class decided to take over a society last term as the original founders had left it and not done anything with it. This seemed to be a very much joint decision; we seemed to agree that this was something we'd do together, and while we didn't 100% agree that this was the case, it was quite clear from the way this woman was talking about it that she was passionate about it. 

So anyway, whenever I try to message her about things, she seems completely disinterested and blunt about it. She seems to still have ideas about what to do with the society, but it's really difficult to talk to her, and when I'm assertive with her about things that need to be done, she appears to get quite stroppy and say ""OK, I get it"". I've only been this assertive twice, because she wasn't contributing to the running of the social media or emails, or anything, really. 

There are three roles: the president, admin and social media officer and finance officer. I've asked her twice which role she'd like to be and she hasn't told me. I've given her the passwords to social media and asked nicely if she could update them (as well as me) and she hasn't. 

Today, after thinking about this for a while, I've decided that I don't really want to do this anymore and so I messaged her, and I said,

""I think I want to step down into a less demanding role or leave the society altogether, as I want to focus on my studies - what do you think?""

Her reply was ""sorry can't help you with that!"" - Like, OK. I wasn't asking for help. I was telling you because you're the other person involved. She seems really detached from it all. 

During term-time, she would talk to me constantly about this group and seemed really into it. I'm going to be honest, I would carry on if she left, as she's really difficult to communicate with. 

I don't know if this is something I should discuss with my uni's SU as I'd feel like I was complaining, but I can't communicate with her at all, she is unresponsive and stroppy. 

Should I email the SU and explain how I feel?",23Aug2018,0

I also have very little friends and they're all guys, which makes it worse. Because they're all normal cis guys, so i can't really talk to them about this stuff. Also because i have autism i get put into different classes than normal and autism is most common in guys (1f:3m), so school might not be the best place to make (trans)female friends.

I’m 20 years old and I was dating this girl for about 10 months and we were pretty passionate and crazy about each other. For the last few months she has been really stressed due to bills and she’s just naturally an easily annoyed person. I think it may stem from insecurities and her past relationship was abusive.

We planned to go to London together next year but as days went on I realized that I wanted to travel by myself instead and it’s due to the large amount i’ll be investing in that trip and I wouldn’t want to spend it with her potentially whining/complaining or arguing between us.

We were generally happy but she would always get annoyed very easily and I felt like she would take out her anger on me. She told me yesterday that she just paid all of her debts and she thinks that the timing of this breakup isn’t right due to knowing she wasn’t treating me well because of financial stress and that she wants another chance.

I don’t know if I made the right decision and I don’t know what to do because i’m stressing about my decision and i’m not sure if it was the right one. I felt happy with her when she wouldn’t be rude or annoyed but it was hard because she was annoyed so easily. I don’t know if it’s because we were together every single day at her house or what.

They're always trying to get free stuff, always making a mess, trying to talk to you when you're busy helping customers, and are generally rude.

She was standing in the doorway of the ladies bathroom, which is a single-user restroom, and we could her talking. We looked each other, and were like, ""Is there somebody in there?"" The old lady turns around and shuts the door. She says, ""I guess you have to knock in this place now."" 

She basically just barged in on some young, mid-teens girl, without knocking, and stood there talking to her instead of just apologizing and shutting the door. 

The girl comes up to the counter, and she's obviously PISSED. Understandably, too. After the girl left, the lady came out of the bathroom complaining about the girl, saying she was just a troublemaker AS IF ITS THE GIRLS FAULT SHE JUST GOT BARGED IN ON. We told her it was time for her and her husband to leave, and they did.

Afterwards, my coworker and I were left with doubt as to if we handled the situation well. Or if we could have done better?

That being said, the other day my friend made me a Tinder account just for fun and I was goofing around on it for all of 30 minutes before deleting it...but only after spotting this really cute girl who goes to my university. I was interested and clicked on her Instagram out of curiosity and come to see that (through the eyes of social media) she meets a lot of what I imagine I would look for in a girl: cute, outdoorsy, the same year of her PhD program as me, science major, etc. In fact, I haven't been this interested in a girl in a long time. The only thing is...I have never met her in person and don't know if I would ever happen to run into her. I am not on campus that much and we aren't in the same major, so chances are slim. I attempted to ""flirt"" through social media (liking a couple pictures, sending a friend request, etc) but quickly retracted all of those because it felt too creepy and didn't meet my own requirements of trying to meet girls in person.

So, any advice on this situation/has anyone had a similar experience? It seems really unlikely that I would ever meet her without basically going out my way, which could be pretty creepy on her end and isn't an easy situation to idly start a conversation over. On the other hand, it has been driving me bonkers, thinking about all the ""boxes"" she checks in regards to what I would be interested in in a girl, and I would love a chance to meet her (I would say hi in a heartbeat if I DID see her on campus). Another part of me dislikes the thought that I found her through Tinder (just old-fashioned I guess?), since I would prefer to meet someone and get to know them in person. 

What do I do? Keep my head down and keep working on my graduate studies in the hopes that one day I might run into her, realizing it is unrealistic to have any idea of what she is like as a person without having ever had a conversation?

481,"I'm 25 and I've been in uni for 7 years without completing anything and I'm currently 1.5 years into a 4 year degree, I don't hate the degree but I'm not 100% sure its what I want to do and currently my head space is a little messed up (found out today I probably have depression and anxiety among other things).

I first jumped into uni because it was the only path I knew but I still after 7 years have no idea what it is I really want to do in life, I don't really have a set interest or passion recently my mental health has gone a bit down and while it's not my degree I think a big part of it is that I have no idea what I truly want to do.

I have 3 options regarding my path currently:

Continue my full workload of subjects and finish the degree (I'll be 27).
Drop 2 subjects and make it part time while trying to fix myself up. This will add an extra year to my course.
Take a leave of absence from the course for 6 months (up to a year) and just work and try and fix myself up and do the things I wish I had of done years ago like travel and try and figure out what I enjoy. This is the one I'm most leaning towards, I'll still be enrolled in my degree it'll just add another year to how long it'll take if I choose to go back.
The downside to 3 is I don't want to waste that time and get lazy, it's the one that will arguably require the most work because I'll need to be very proactive about my time and its the one with the most grey area.

He said it would make him comfortable just getting his bills piled up and working on that first, my next question was ok when do we move on and talk about what comes next. Not sure if I worded it correctly but I needed something to hold him accountable to, ie; let me work on paying off my bills for the next 2 months then we move on. What if he was stuck paying this for the next 12 months? He flipped out and said I was trying to do things my way and doing it his way made him comfortable. I tried to reiterate that I didn't even suggest anything for him to do just that it would me comfortable having a timeline. He didn't see it this way, ok!

I decided that I will leave him to his devices and let him handle his bills/debt/credit the way he saw fit however I just wanted to be able to check in to see how it was coming along. He agreed! Today he signed up for dental insurance with a $33 monthly payment and $1200 deductible. I said WHATTT! why would you do that, it makes no sense. In my opinion he could have found something with maybe a higher monthly payment with cheaper deductible if he had only done his research. I didn't tell him that of course. He got pissed, said that's why he doesn't tell me anything, I'm critical blah blah.

Especially if this is someone I plan on spending my life with and having a family. At this stage am I not allowed to bring these things up? Is it none of my business what he does with his money as long as it doesn't affect me? How do relationships work when one person is more financially aware than their partner?

TL;DR. Partner isn't worried much about credit/finances and I try giving advice and he flips out. Am I being too intrusive?",23Aug2018,2
483,"I recently graduated college with a degree in marketing. I’m coming to a realization that I might not want to be in an office for the rest of my life. I have this idea of going to a vocational school, possibly welding or something, then getting a job doing that, and one day using my marketing knowledge and making my own small business so I can be my own boss. Does this sound like a realistic/sane plan? I’m kind of scared to tell my family that this is what I want to do, and that they might be mad I just spent all this money to not use my degree right away. I just figured if I don’t learn something now, it will be a lot harder to do later on in life when money is more important. ",23Aug2018,1
484,"So I'm 16 and I haven't been able to get an erection for 2 weeks, and I've always just had alot libido-related problems for my entire life. I asked my mom to let me see a doctor for this, but she said it's not important and that I shouldn't be thinking like that at my age. I feel so incredibly depressed over this issue and it hurts that I won't be able to get medical help over this. How can I convince her that it's more than just trivial?",23Aug2018,1
485,"I've had a crush on a girl in my class for 7 years. We're both 13 and she has pretty big boobs for her age, which will come in later. I was listening to music on my phone, when she walked over, grabbed my phone, and shoved it in her cleavage. Then she said ""How do my boobs sound?"" Since it just looked like a pair of earphones sticking out of her tits. I said ""gimme my phone back"" then she said, get it yourself"" I stood up and shoved my hand in her cleavage and started feeling around for my phone. I eventually found it stuffed in her bra after about 1 minute of searching. When I pulled it out she winked at me and walked away. She's very protective of her boobs, if someone makes the slightest gesture towards her boobs she covers them up, and she just let me feel them for 1 minute. What do I do now that I'm in?",23Aug2018,1
486,"a lot of my college friends have started their own project and went on to get amazing jobs just because they were able to sit down and learn new material on their own and work with it , I tried to do that but I get  through 5 minutes of material and I just start feeling like I need to go do something else.

it may be worth noting that I can literally get through a semester's worth of notes in 2 days before a final exam but I can't do this simple task that is bound to help my future career tremendously.

if anyone has any advice on how to just get at least an hour of truly focused reading and understanding , I would be eternally grateful.",23Aug2018,1
487,"We ordered several small decorations for our house from a major retailer, online. Today, most of the decorations came while the others are being shipped separately. Much to our surprise however, they also sent a large, sleek looking, very modern space heater which is apparently moderately expensive.

I'm not sure how they would mistakenly pick this based on what we ordered, or how it occurred because we've never even looked into these things, but the packing slip stickered onto it has our info.

We checked the order and bank account and it's not on there and was not charged.

Unfortunately they don't seem to have online customer service, so I guess I can call them when I get a chance to spend the time.

Anyone ever deal with something like this? I'm hoping they don't try to make me lug this to brick and mortar store or a UPS or something. And I'm hoping there's no chance they'll charge us for it sometime in the interim if we're not quick enough.",23Aug2018,1

I wish I had a better part time job that also gives me healthcare. I am working to become a photojournalist, and I'm passionate about my career.

492,"I am 17 years old and I have been experiencing this headache for about 5 weeks. I never got it checked out by the doctor because I need to bring in my parent since I'm not 18 and my mom never really took it seriously. I am most certain that it's a brain tumor. I know this because of this headache lasting for so long, me having ear pain, ringing in the ears and now I am also dizzy which are symptoms of a brain tumor. I finally got a doctor appointment tomorrow and I am supposed to be seeing a Neurologist next month. I really just not sure what to do as I am very nervous and I just started to get very dizzy.",23Aug2018,0
493,"Me and my girlfriend are both 14, and we recently went on a date. It was our first time hanging out outside of school and it was pretty nice. We saw a movie together and had sushi for lunch before going to her house until I had dinner and left, plus we were home alone. As soon as I saw her on the date I noticed something. Her cleavage. She was wearing I kinda low cut top with a bunch of cleavage. I greeted her and said ""you look a little different"" while I nodded toward her boobs. She said the only clean bra she had was a push up bra, which was where the cleavage came from. After the date at her house, we went to her room and got kinda sexual. First she let me rest my head on her boobs for a bit, until I started giving her boobs the squeeze they deserved. Then it went to her in her bra, and I motorboated her. Then we agreed to play a full match of smash bros, and if I won she'd have to get her boobs out until I went home. I won. I flicked both of her nipples as she started moaning a little. We decided to start dinner. I never knew how much boobs jiggled until now. Are we too young to be going this far? It wa fun but the entire time I felt like I was too young to be seeing my girlfriend's boobs jiggle around. Especially since she accidentally brushed my dinner with her nipples.",23Aug2018,1
