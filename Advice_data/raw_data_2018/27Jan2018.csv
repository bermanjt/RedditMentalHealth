1,"I have a huge problem with giving up. I start to do something, then I give up. I start cleaning up around the house, I get to ""good enough"" then stop. I make games as a hobby, I start trying to work on my current project, within 10 minutes I give up. I've lost all forms of motivation, and anything that's not a 2 step process will almost never get done.

It feels like at one moment, I'm super motivated, going to follow a step by step plan to get my life back together, then I'd follow said plan for a day, then I'd half ass that plan for maybe 3 days, then poof I'm not following the plan anymore. I've tried different motivational techniques, I've tried forcing myself (which in the end just makes me want to do anything else but what I want to do), everything I've tried I just give up. 

I wish it were as easy as, ""Just do it""",27Jan2018,3

3,"Ok, so this is a long story.  I moved to a new area about 4 months ago.  After moving, I immediately got hired on at a company that does in-home health care for individuals with mental and physical disabilities.  

In the home I worked at, the staff was verbally abusive and purposely denying drinks to a resident in the home who would periodically have accidents if you didn't get him to the toilet on time.  There was no medical reason for them to do this, so i chalked it up to laziness- the staff didnt want to have to clean him up if he had an accident.  


My very first day, this same staff called this resident ""ignorant"" because he burped after eating dinner.  I asked her why on earth she would call a mentally disabled resident ""ignorant"" and she said she was ""joking around"" when she clearly wasnt.  It was apparent by the look on the resident's face that she wasn't joking around.   This resident has MS and can not walk very well, so you must assist him when he is walking or he will fall over.  When she was walking with him, she grabbed his hands and pulled him across the room- faster than he could walk.  He was tripping over his shoes (they are specially made shoes and are really bulky) and nearly fell over before she spun him around and pushed him in his seat.  She told me she could already tell I was going to be ""too easy on these guys"".  I asked her what that was supposed to mean and she said if you're too easy on them they will try to ""bully you"" into giving them a drink.  When I told her it was their house and they can have a drink whenever they ask for one, she doubled down on the ""i was just joking"" defense.  

I seemed rather young to other staff members there, but they weren't aware that i have 15 years of experience in this field.  I know the resident's rights and I know how staff is supposed to treat them.  It is a pretty standard protocol in every company similar to this one.  The residents have the same rights as you or I.  If they want to go out, you take them out.  If they want a drink, you get them a damn drink.  I had seen this situation so many times in previous companies I've worked for: staff thinks they are there to control the residents and boss them around.  Every time, it ultimately ends with miserable residents who have a very poor quality of life.  I feel the staff are there to improve their quality of life and make it as enjoyable as humanly possible.  These residents are old and have been beaten and abused their whole lives.  Either by family or by staff at a previous company (which has since been shut down) that housed almost all the mentally disabled individuals in the state.  

This company was notorious for physically, sexually, verbally, and emotionally abusing residents there.  They lived like animals, had to literally fight other residents for food, lined up in rows, naked, to be sprayed off with the hose once a week and that was their ""shower"".  They've endured so much, and I feel like they should be getting the best care that they can get. They deserve respect and to be treated like human beings.

So, anyway, obviousy I was extremely concerned as this resident was only getting about 12 oz to drink every day.  I went over the home manager's head (she also would deny him a drinks throughout the day) and talked to the nurse and the VP of the company about my concerns.  The VP did nothing, and the nurse wrote an order for all staff to sign that said clients MUST have at least 64 oz a day and not the 12 oz they were giving this resident.  The staff signed it, but continued to deny drinks to the resident.

Finally, the resident started pissing blood.  I informed the home manager, who is a total idiot, and she said not to call the nurse because ""this happens to him all the time"". I had already gotten in trouble for going over the home manager's head and not following protocol (because i didnt trust the calls she was making), so i was left in a position where, either i help this client and go over the managers head (and possibly get fired because id already had a warning and all new employees are on a 90 day probation period) or i just let him piss blood and do nothing.  I ended up calling the nurse after i got home, but she didn't answer.

Well, i decided to call adult protective services after i came back to work (having been off for 3 days) and he was still pissing blood, no one took him to the hospital or a doctor and they were STILL giving him limited fluids.  I also decided to put in my two weeks notice because it was getting overwhelming and i felt i was stuck in a moral dilemma almost every time i went to work.

When I was working out my two weeks, i had began to work with other staff members i hadnt previously worked with.  I was appalled when i realized ALL the staff in the house was verbally and psychologically abusive to the residents.  This one staff would purposely fuck with a resident there just to set him off.  She would throw out stuff he was drinking or eating so he would get mad and start yelling at her, call her a fucking bitch, then because of that he was ""punished"" for his behavior and wasnt allowed to go on his outing for the day (which if you knew these people, outings are really the only thing they have to look forward to).  

I had never heard this resident even raise his voice before this staff purposely set him off.  Later, that staff member told me that she hated said resident and that he was a ""disgusting pig"" who had tried to rape her years prior to this.  If this was the case, she had no business working there.  She also told me that she was bipolar and had borderline personality disorder, and she seemed absolutely unhinged. The way she talked about this resident made it perfectly clear that she legitimately hated him with a white hot passion.  You couldnt mention his name without her groaning in disgust.  She would purposely give the other residents twice as much food as him for meals, because she knew it would set him off.  When this resident told her he had the right to go on outings like the other residents, she told him ""I don't care about your fucking rights"".  I went ahead and turned her in to APS as well, so at this point I had turned in every staff member at that home.

After realizing the only time the staff treated the residents like human beings was when i was working (word had gotten around that I was the one who turned them in, so staff watched what they did around me), i tried to revoke my two weeks notice.  At first they said theyd revoke it, then after my last day, the HR director called and said it was best for the ""staff and company"" if they just accepted my two weeks notice.  That was in october.

Now, when I was hired, I was told that if you put in a two week notice, and work the full two weeks, youd be re-hired if you were to reapply at a later date.  So, last month, i called the HR director and left him a message asking if i were to reapply, would they hire me back.  

Well it turns out the hr director has been on medical leave for a couple months, and since i had turned in every staff member at the house i worked at, the vice president of the company had been fired and moved to texas.  This happened a couple weeks after I turned in staff the second time, so i have a feeling the VP being fired had something to do with my turning them in, as she was aware what was going on in the home and she did nothing about it.

So the new vp, who has no idea who i am, just so happened to listen to the hr director's voicemails, got my message and called me yesterday to schedule an interview for monday morning.  

The main office is totally open, so all the upper-management knows what i look like (i was in the main office A LOT during my time there).  Once i go in for the interview, i know they will tell the vp who i am.   This place only pays minimum wage, but I really want to work with these guys again.  I have worried about them endlessly since i havent been there.

 I just want to slip through the cracks and get hired.  Im wondering what i should do.  Should i try to disguise myself so i can just make it past the interview unnoticed?  Or is working for a company that's bound to hate me just a bad idea altogether?  I am having so much anxiety over this interview and i just dont know what to do.  I know once I'm hired they can't get rid of me unless they have a reason to, and it's illegal to fire someone for turning in suspected abuse.  But it goes without saying that the staff at that house will not like me being there at all, and will likely be watching me like a hawk, waiting for me to mess something up so they can get me in trouble.  But I want to work there SO BAD.  

In my experience, these kind of companies do not take kindly to being turned in for abuse or neglect and usually they avoid hiring people who have previously made abuse allegations towards them.  It's illegal for them to do that, but they do it anyway.

I thought about just being honest and telling the vp i was the one who had turned them in and see where it goes from there.  I just don't know what my plan is but I have to figure something out before monday.  

If you read all of this, i am sincerely grateful and i welcome any advice you can offer me.  Thanks.

5,"I a 22 year old college graduate. After 8 months of struggling to find a ""good"" job, I think I have finally found one. It is reputable, but there are several catches. 

1. I have to relocate another part of Continental US to receive training for eight weeks, but at the end they you get certifications (which they pay for) in useful technologies such as SQL and Java. (Not a bad deal)

2. Once you finish training they want you to work for one of their clients for two years, with a guaranteed salary of at least 50,000, but they don't tell you exactly what client or where it is exactly. If I violate the contract I have to pay them around 20,000 to compensate for the training.

I'm mainly worried that they make me travel to some other part of the country, but I really do not enjoy being unemployed and living with my parents. I feel like this would be a great opportunity for me you finally be an independent adult.

Can I live with 50,000? What happens if they put me in a high cost of living area?

Thanks for the advice. I'm really torn

6,"I volunteer at one of the only two animal shelters in Syria. We have around 600 dogs and cats, most of them were tortured and can't live on the streets because of disabilities.

There's no funding, and the shelter runs on small donations only, they're not enough to cover the costs and it may shut down.

7,"So, I met this person awhile ago online. For awhile we were great friends, bonded a lot and all that. But I found it hard to reply to her a lot. After awhile it got kind of exhausting, so I ghosted her. I have no explanation other than what I said, and admitting that I fuckin suck. 

But she made it clear that she still wanted to be friends. Didn't spam me or anything like a crazy person, it was just messages like ""Hey, it's been awhile. I miss you"" and stuff similar to that. And so I soon came up with some story about why I stopped replying, I've forgotten what I've said at this point. But we were still good friends, as I never ghosted her.

But the exact same thing happened, basically. I hate myself for it. And for the past 2 weeks I've been wanting to reconnect, but I worry that I'm just being abusive and leading her on. 

What would you do in this situation? To me, it's either give her some closure and say that something is keeping us apart, and cut it off for good. Or I apologize profusely and see if she's still willing to be friends - but with that, I don't know if I'll do it again. Because the first time I felt the same way, ""I won't do this again, I just needed a break and now I'm all good again"". The only reason I am even having this debate is because she's such a great person, she's cared for me like no one else has. And I treat her like shit.

If you would do something different, please suggest it. I need some advice, guys. ",27Jan2018,2
8,"i've alternatively rented and lived with family for the past 12 years. i'll rent a place i like but then recognize that all my time is spent working to pay for it and i'm not spending enough time there to justify the cost. move in with family for a few months, rent someplace cheap and value the lesser financial commitment but then become frustrated with the place's faults. this cycle has repeated itself a couple of times. 

i work a modest job, i don't have a lot of spare money. but as family and friends grow older i feel the pressure of needing to buy a home. in part so i don't have to be moving every couple years and in part so that i have some stability to offer to others around me. this brings forth the same problems though, over extend myself financially and have a nice place that i'm never at, or buy something affordable and deal with all of its issues. 
i understand the mantra of buy the worst house in the best neighbourhood, etc. but i'm unmarried and realistically it will be a challenge for me to maintain/insure/upgrade a home, regardless of what area it is in. 

the real issue at hand is that i live in a city where i'm not happy. i'm not doing work that i enjoy but there are limited career opportunities and i feel a peer pressure that kind of says i should be grateful to have anything rather than an atmosphere of support saying i shouldn't be content with less than i desire. 

i have a reasonable amount of money saved which could go towards a down payment but i'm apprehensive towards sinking it into a property in a place i'm not particularly happy. the real problem is that it would tie me to a job i don't like and a place i don't like for the next 10-20 years in order to pay for it. 

i have to be honest with myself that moving to a new city and trying to start a new career isn't the most realistic option. if i leave my job and try it will evaporate some of my savings and i won't necessarily have the opportunity to buy a home again. 

nearly every one around me is married and i can't relate to their situation nor they mine. i can't rely on family for money, my parents retired early and essentially borrow against the value of their home to live. 

i'm sure there are other people who are in or have been in similar situations. thought i would post and see if anyone has any words to offer. ",27Jan2018,2

13,"Since I was younger I've known I've had ADHD problems, but as I, now 22, am beginning to take on tasks with much greater responsibility, it's reached a breaking point. I've always done great in school, but only because I consider school to be of the highest importance. In the beginning I was in special reading groups to get my comprehension skills up to speed, I would often do homework for eight hours when it took other students one or two. Despite this I pushed on and was always regarded as one of the more intelligent and mindful students. Straight A's 4th grade to senior year in college, but I've always known something is off. I still read around 3 times slower than average, often have to reread and triple read a sentence. I'm studying sculpture so things with my hands are great, but mental activities like papers feel like my brain just ran a marathon. The worst is the social part though. I have only one friend. I love people and am not afraid of them but when I speak it's so disorganized. I usually say the most minimal things because speaking feels like solving a calculus equation. Sometimes I get these random insightful bursts were I say something more complicated but I usually stop part way through and forget what i was supposed to be saying. Won't go on and on, but other things include frighteningly bad short term memory, I always fidget even if im feeling chill, but i do it so much ive ripped my knuckle skin open and my fingers look deformed. Was more of a spaz when i was young but have less energy now. I think Its ADHD but with SCT (sluggish cognitive tempo)

Anyway, I admit i've had my own problems with drugs as my super addictive personality tried to quell my thrill seeking yet mushy thoughts. I smoked cigs for 4 years, have quit for 6 months now, drank for a year (quit for 2 months now) was terrible for my mood and BP (i have had unexplained slightly elevated BP my whole life). Smoked marijuana a little bit but it made me feel CRAZY, but then came the various occasions I tried ADHD medication...

First was Dexedrine (took 10mgs orally) didnt even know what it was at the time but high school me wanted to get sped so i took it. I was disappointed, I felt calm, relaxed, watched some TV (something I normally have zero attention span for), and just chatted with my friend. That's when I made the connection, what do they give this stuff for? I did some research and it all made sense. I also tried Adderal once, around 20mgs. Difference was like night and day. My brain turned into a computer. All the sudden I was striking up conversations with people, I was friendly and smiling and most importantly, my sentences came out flawlessly. Even the biggest words took no time at all to form into beautifully powerful meaningful sentences. The only other one I tried was concerta which was my favorite. One dose actually corrected my thought patterns and motivation for three days! I also liked that one because i didn't feel high, after the first couple hours I just became productive. Id preferably not have something easily abused (because i admit i had a history of abuse) and concerta seemed good for that. Oh and I also tried Vivance, i thought it was the smallest dose but it made my heart rate go crazy and I didnt like it at all. 

Anyway I am seeing a Psychiatrist in a week because I can't handle it on my own anymore. I'm now doing teachers assistant roles, have a TA summer job, learning Russian, lots of time consuming sculptures, working at Tim Hortons, etc and I need to be efficient. I can't help someone learn to weld when I speak to them in confusing jibberish

Any thoughts on what I should say at the appointment and perhaps how I could avoid Stratera? I know the others have side effects but the stimulant ones work, and fast, and Im super scared of all the crazy shit that happens to some people on SNRIs and whatnot. Ill be as upfront as possible but could i sneak in that I have chronic nausea maybe (i dont)? Would emphasizing the SCT help? Im barely hanging in there right now but if this appointment fails everything I'm trying accomplish could come crashing down. ",27Jan2018,5

What are some low-stress ways to make friends as an adult? Alternately, what are some things I can do alone but outside of my apartment so I don't go stir crazy until I do have friends? 

Any advice or reassuring anecdotes you have are welcome.

Tl;Dr: how to be an adult in a new place where you don't know anyone??? :'-)",27Jan2018,2
32,"I feel like an empty shell.

I don't really know who I am or who I want to be.

I see so much ugliness and hate in society and it baffles me. The selfishness of people is astounding and saddening. I want to connect with people in a genuine way, not this surface bs that most everyone is into.

I'm not sad or depressed, but just lonely.

I do have friends, and I have no issues talking with strangers. However most conversations seem contrived or for one's self aggrandizement. Most of the time it seems people don't give a f*ck about the other person they're talking to. I don't know, that's probably too harsh.

I've kinda had a life path laid out for me because of my Father's business he's started. Ever since middle school I thought well that's what I'm gonna do, run the family business. I don't think I've ever put genuine thought into what I really wanted to do in life.

In middle school and high school I kinda tried to be part of all the different clicks, never subscribing to one way or the other. Because of that, I was never really accepted as one of them, I was a friend, people liked me, but I was on the outside.

College was fun, I partied pretty hard and was still kinda drifting between diffent types of people. I had to drop out after two years thanks to my partying. After a year off, I was ready to go back and be serious about learning. I decided to not go back to the same college and instead go to a small private college to help me evade the temptation of partying. F*ck! I seriously regrete that decision thanks to my massive student loan debt. Anyways, I did great with my classes and grades, deans list and all. I double majored in marketing and business admin, again still thinking family business was the plan.

I've been out of college and working for the family business for a little over 5 years now.

There's been this emptyness growing inside over my lifetime I believe, I've not really noticed or thought about it until just 2 years ago.

I don't really feel like it stems from my job.  It's more that I've never gone on that journey of self discovery. I don't really know what I want from life. I don't really know who I actually am. Perhaps if found myself and ventured forth I may go down some totally different path. Perhaps I'd have a totally different wardrobe, present myself in a different manner, have a different job, different everything. Or, perhaps most everything would be the same and I'd have the same job and everything, the only difference being I knew that it was me and that's what I wanted.

Sorry to totally ramble but I wanted to paint a picture of where my mind is at right now.

Anyways I have no idea where to start, how to find myself, the real me.

Any genuine and honest advice is greatly appreciated.",27Jan2018,3
33,"So the house I rent is old. The house is a hundred years old, knowing how cheap my landlord is the plumbing is probably close to it.

First off, the toilet was never bolted down. It literally rocked if you shifted your weight. It’s been prone to backing up. The sink and tub have also had issues draining in the past.

But now, after several unfixable clogs required visits from a plumber, the latest visit left my bathroom filthy and covered in what I hope is just soot. Black spots all over the place, some seemingly rubbed and some not. And the toilet, still not bolted down has slightly moved to where it rocks when you sit on it, not just when you move. It’s literally not even on the floor, a corner is off the ground, albeit only slightly. Still, the amount of movement I want from my toilet is NONE.

Is this normal? Is cleanup my responsibility? My mechanic doesn’t get my car dirty, why should my plumber get my bathroom dirty?

And how the Hell do I ask my landlord to LEVEL OUT my toilet without sounding like I’m crazy?",27Jan2018,2
34,"Has anyone gotten a shocking report from a dentist and then gotten a second opinion that was different?

So Im a person who takes care of their teeth. Brush for 1-2 minutes twice a day, floss, and all that. I've only had a single cavity in my life when i was a kid. Now today i go get a check up, and suddenly my dentist says that I have 7 cavities. He said that if I dont get some filled soon, I may have to do root canal. I was nervous at first but then something didn't add up to me. My brother doesn't brush his teeth as much as I do, but his dentist says his teeth are fine. 

It could be my problem. I wear invisalign retainers at night, but I clean it frequently too. It could be the problem that I'm not cleaning it well enough? It doesn't make sense either because I've been wearing invisalign for a while and I still haven't gotten a cavity until now.  I've asked some friends and they said it’d be good to get a second opinion. One of my friends say that a similar story happened to them, and they went for a second opinion. It turned out they had no cavities. If I were to fill all of them, it would cost a crap ton of money. Should I get a second opinion?",27Jan2018,2
35,"I'm 27M and I still don't have anything figured out. I'm close to suicide but wondering if there's anything I can do instead. 

I wake up every day and hate my life. I'm up too early in the morning. It's too dark and cold. My job is completely pointless with no sense of challenge. I come home in the afternoon with nothing to do until bed. I have no good friends. I don't desire sex right now, much less a relationship. In fact, there's a lot of things that keep most people happy that I don't care about at all.

I have no idea what kind of career I want, but I know now that I need real motivation from the heart to do something. Knowing I'd make a lot of money or be respected for doing XYZ is enough. Most of the big things I've accomplished in my life have either been for no money or a financial loss. I have the discipline to make a 28 hour road trip to take my friend to his sister in the hospital, but not to apply for jobs that sound boring but carry a larger paycheck than I'm getting.

I've been told I'm a boring person, and the truth is I am. The kind of things I like to talk about are uninteresting to most people and vice versa. Meeting a random person on the street and odds are we are not going to be compatible.

I went to college for creative writing but don't think I can do that anymore. When I should be writing, I just think about how lonely I am and can't waste time doing it.

I try to be a good person and have done huge favors for strangers, but I'm frustrated when I'm sick or in pain and friends won't even talk to me on the phone for a few minutes.

I thought travel might be the answer, but what I've found is that while there are many interesting places to see, good friends are just as hard to find in any location. It just leads to me feeling lonely at my destination, and I end up hating both there and my home and loving just being on the road.

I don't know if I should just kill myself or not.

She told me she wants to try MD. She feels numb, can't feel anything. Even when she's with me she said (it hurts, but not as much knowing what she's going through).

She said she's considered counselling and that it makes things worse opening up before it gets better. She wants MD to make her feel happy again and allow one night off she said.

She's so much smarter than this and its an emotional pain. I explained how I'd be extremely disappointed if she took it. That's when she said ""I know, but even now I don't care, that's the problem. I normally would care but i truly don't"".

38,"I'm a 20 year old girl. My friend (also 20) is a great painter and is going to school for art. She asked myself and a few friends (both male and female) to model for her in a group portrait...however she has a specific theme for the painting. 

She feels since women are generally more sexualised in today's society, she wants to paint an image that 'turns the tables' so to speak on what is normally seen...essentially she is asking all of the guys to model in the nude, the girls will be clothed. Essentially it is the opposite of what we normally see, where typically the girls are scantly clad and the guys are clothed. 

On the one hand I feel it's a great theme and empowering and a nice change, but at the same time I have mixed feelings on modeling for it. All of the guys, who I'm friends with, will all be nude. Although all of the girls will be fully clothed.

39,"Hey yall. Please tell me if this is the wrong sub or there's another. Maybe I need advice, maybe I don't.

Story started nearly 3 years ago. My mum passed away suddenly at 50 which obviously hit me hard. We were very close. I grieved and was down for about a year but slowly started to feel happy again. People who've lost parents know what I mean - it still hurts but less often.

The person who didn't feel happy was my sister. She kept a lot of it in and soothed the pain with alcohol and drugs. She was also holding down a job as a teacher at the time and nobody knew what she was doing. 

Fast forward to November 2017. I broke my ankle playing football, and the next night I was lying down in and out of sleep. For some reason I woke up and checked my phone, which was on silent. I saw a notification on messenger from my sister saying she had just taken a load of pills and that she loved me. I'm in Devon and she's in London (300 miles away). I rang 999 straight away and the paramedics broke her door down to find her almost losing consciousness. Luckily, she survived. She was diagnosed with BPD and has since been to AA and CA meetings and is doing much better.

Although I'm still worried about her, I am happy with the way she is now, but my main worry is my Dad. This has knocked him for 6. He's aged about 10 years in 2 months and he has had his health problems too.

I'm guessing the advice I might be looking for is if anyone (or a close one) has literally wanting to end it - as in this wasn't a cry for help, she tried to die, is there always that urge to do it or does it go away? I'm lucky enough to have never suffered depression so I don't understand it. Drink and coke seemed to be a trigger for it, but without that does the feeling still feel the same?",27Jan2018,2

But I can't help but hate the false sympathy I get all the time, I hate how they exaggerate any good thing I do like it's fucking incredible, sometimes it feels like I'm judges solely on the scars. I'm nasty looking, and no woman will truly love me now without it being sympathy/pity-dating and I hate having to accept this.    
I've also developed a general distrust of people, even if someone tries to get close to me I just keep them at arm's length; when I was burning I could see my friends just watching as I screamed until I extinguished myself in the sand, all because none of them wanted to take responsibility if anything happened.

Last year, he got suspended from school due to his behavior and talking heavily about shootings (dive-by shootings and the Columbine school shooting in particular). He stopped talking about it in school, apologized,  got counseling, got tested for his eligibility to get his driver's licence (and passed woo!), and we split his junior year in half to relieve him from stress.

A friend of mine that lives in another country came to visit the US this past week. When she arrived she called me to hang out and we planned a weekend together. We had lost touch before this, but seeing her was great. 


During her visit, we went out to a bar with my brother and sister in law. On our way there she asks me if I remember the time that we saw a woman jump off a bridge with a rope around her neck. I honestly thought she was kidding so I sort of gave her the ‘what kinda joke is that’ look. When I saw that she looked at me like I was crazy for thinking it was a joke, the mood changed. I asked her if she was sure it was me.. because I don’t recall that at all. My brother was driving and he shuts the radio off and tells me that it’s true because when it happened I called our house and I was really bent out of shape about it. I even spoke to him about it for months and months.  


From what she told me, this happened while she was driving and I was in the passenger seat and we were about to go over a bridge.. when I started pointing and couldn’t get the words out of my mouth. Somehow I managed to say while pointing towards the lady “she’s ... she’s... she’s going to jump.” 


Why don’t I remember this? For the last few days I’ve been trying to recall this and I can’t. How can I erase something that tragic from my memory? This happened in 2005 and I was 14 years old. 


I kept asking her more questions but my brother told me not to because there might be a reason why I don’t remember. All he told me was that I was really shaken up by this and out of nowhere I stopped talking about it so he never brought it back up again.  ",27Jan2018,2

It’s an amazing opportunity;however I have second job offer on the table as well and I am terrible at making decisions. So I’m gonna give some background on the jobs and myself and hopefully you guys can help me decide. 

The FDIC is basically my dream job. I would get to audit banks and help to keep the economy moving. It’s a government job with great pay and benefits and the staff all really seem to enjoy working there. My problem is that this job is a 4 year term. In the first year I will have to spend nearly the whole year traveling to different offices to complete my training. Then I will spend the next 3 years traveling to get my commission status, which I have to take an exam for. The whole process is like going to graduate school and I am currently married. I enjoy traveling but not for long periods of time and being away from my husband for up to 7 weeks at a time gives me separation anxiety. On top of this we will have to relocate from Colorado to Massachusetts with our two ferrets. My husband will have to find a new job and we will be moving to a place in which we have no social connections. Lastly, they are giving me the job as long as I complete two accounting classes in the next 6 months. That would normally be fine except I am in my last semester at school which would push me up to 6 classes to complete before graduation. 

The other job offer is for a logistics company called J.B. Hunt in NW Arkansas. I will be in charge of coordinating load shipments between customers and carriers. I was really excited for this job as well however it doesn’t pay as well or have benefits that compare to the other job. Downside is my husband has less job opportunity in AK because he works as a sound engineer. That is not it high demand down there.  The Work culture is intense and fast paced to the point that they require everyone Work 45 hours a week. I’m not sure it’s somewhere that I see myself staying at for the long term. On the plus side, We will still have to relocate but the distance isn’t that great and rent is cheaper there. It is also a more comfortable job with less travel and more time with my hubby. 

Comparing the two the FDIC seems like the best fit for me in the long run but the move and all of the travel makes me hesitate. I’m not sure I can handle traveling away from my husband for nearly a year. I love him dearly and I am sure that I will be in shambles most of the time. But I question weather I should take the challenge and suffer for a year to get one of the best long term career or take the safe option in Arkansas and maybe hate it or have to get a new job in a year or two. 

If you guys have an opinion or any advice I would love to hear it. I’m stuck in a rut and desperately need an answer. ",27Jan2018,2

I love my girlfriend very much, but she’s asexual, and the relationship is still less than half a year in the making, so we haven’t really talked too much about sex. This girl I’m friends with sometimes posts things on snapchat that wouldn’t be considered safe for work, though there isn’t anything that would be considered actual pornography. She posts them because she’s recovering from an eating disorder, and this is her way of improving her self body image, but that’s neither here nor there. Sometimes I’ll pay her compliments, because I do find her attractive, but i wouldn’t ever think about cheating on my girlfriend. I feel like I just have an open view on sex, but I’m wondering if this could be considered microcheating?",27Jan2018,0
68,"My (21F) mother is an alcoholic. Over the last couple of years she has shown just about every sign of chronic liver failure and still continues to drink daily. She continues to blame every symptom she has experienced on independent things when they are all very clearly tied back to live failure (for example: swollen abdomen, swelling in the ankles and feet, jaundice, itching, excessive bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, weakness and lack of appetite). 

When my brother and I try to talk to her about either being ill or an alcoholic she completely shuts it down and denies everything. She always just says that she is fine and refuses any help or too see a doctor. 

As of 3am this morning she has been throwing up all day, up to 8 times in an hour. She hasn't even been able to keep water down but I'm not sure if this is related or not (it could just be the flu or food poisoning) 

I know that she cannot keep living in this poor of health especially while continuing to drink, but she refuses to see a doctor or admit to having a drinking problem. The way that things are going I can generally only seeing it heading towards her dying. 

I guess I'm asking 2 things here:
-If there is anything I can do or say to get her to seek help and 
-If not, how long should I expect her to be able to live for in this condition?

69,"I never met my dad, I never have physically either I don’t even know what he looks like. I’ve had his phone number for a long time and I was waiting for the right time to call him. Not having a father in my life really-really planted some deep seeded issues and I’m only realizing that as I’m an adult. I know it’s not fair for me to expect him to ever be my father but yeah

So one night, in my infinite wisdom, downed a few shots of Bacardi and opened my phone and stared at his phone number in my contacts for 10 minutes before making myself push the call button

I remember only a tiny bit of that particular conversation. Probably about a half of it, but some pieces are still missing. Probably due to alcohol and maybe due to some emotional shock. I do remember laughing cause he was really funny and I didn’t cry at all (was surprised). He seemed really happy to meet me he even said “thank you it means a lot to me that you reached out to me” the next morning. Apparently i called my mom after this, I don’t remember that call at all though lol.

Anyway.. I’ve been texting him on and off all week about small stuff but I don’t know to say to him like Jeez. I get mini panic attacks when my phone vibrates cause I’m afraid it’s going to be him and I’ll have to face the situation. 

He says he wants to meet and I’ve said I want to meet him too, but I’m sooo anxious about the whole situation.

He has had some unrest in the evening after the trip when going to bed. And when I asked him how his trip went (he was with his step dad on the trip but i was already aware of the occurance) his first story was how he and his friend got stuck in the bathroom. As he began to tell me about his tone went from joyful to tearful very quickly and i can tell it has him shaken up. He was already hesitant to lock the stall in a public washroom so Im looking for advice on ways to adress it without making it more of a big deal.

72,"So I had a heated conversation with my in laws tonight about money, life, college education for our children. 
Little bit of our story, we decided we didn’t care for the “American dream” a year and a half ago so we sold our house &amp; downsized. Took a pay cut, and live in a smaller house now (half the size of the previous one). We have more time together, we actually have money to go on vacations without putting them on credit cards. Where before we were making more money but spending more money to pay for the “American dream”. 
Anyway, my in laws start saying we’re not making enough money and we need to be smart. We need to think about our children’s education in 15-18 years. Totally understandable but what really pushed my buttons is him saying we’re not making enough and saving enough. If we’re finally a happy family making 40K less than we were before who’s to say we’re doing it wrong. We are happy. Why does someone need to make 100K to be happy? Who puts a price tag on happiness. He doesn’t understand that. Am I wrong here? We are happy making less, we are living smaller, we have more time together &amp; we can travel now. But to him we are doing life wrong. He thinks we shouldn’t be traveling and we should be saving money for our child’s education. 
What if my child wants to go to tech school for hvac, or be a contractor? Who’s to say he won’t be happy. What if he wants to be a doctor he said, are you going to have 80K to pay for that schooling. I didn’t know exactly what to say so I got defensive. I would hope my children would know the value of money and work hard to pay for part of their education. I will gladly help my kids but he thinks I need to pay 100% like he did. (I paid every penny of my education, I had no handouts) my husband on the other hand had his entirely paid for so this is where we butt heads. 
I’m just so upset from this entire conversation tonight. He made me feel like I’m doing something wrong in life which hurts the most because this past year and a half has been our happiest.

73,"(this is a general post I know that there's no exact numbers you can give without my exact insurance plan) 

So like the title says I've been in 2 recent accidents, first was a minor fender bender (failure to break ticket) and the second I totaled my dad's old van (failure to yield ticket). My insurance obviously went up and I'm currently on both of my family's cars insurances. My question is that would it be worth it to buy an old used car and have my parents remove me from both the new family cars?

74,"So I'm loading my car up with stuff to bring to my sister when I heard what sounded Like a swarm of insects. I ignored it because I was busy and it's winter so there aren't any insects out. After I finish up about 10 minutes later I look for the sound and see a drone hovering above my driveway. At first I assumed it was the people over at the surf shop next door, but when I went over to find out about the drone they weren't there (it was clearly an expensive hobby drone and not some Brookstone purchase) and so I head back to my driveway and the drone is gone, then a few moments later the work van that was parked across the street left. Now I'm a little freaked out because while it could be just neighbor fucking around the timing of the drone and van leaving right after I went looking for the source is odd to put it mildly. It doesn't help that I'm on edge as it is because my entire paycheck got used up in 24 hours due to child support, paying my daughters school, and buying her medicine since she's now sick, and if that weren't enough stress I also don't get my normal Saturday with my daughter since her doctor wanted her to stay with her mom so when she takes her back in Monday she can let her know how she took to the medicine, and to put a couple cherries on top I got pulled over and fined for having an expired inspection sticker, I have a gym payment tomorrow, and my check from side work won't be here until Thursday. So I think the advice I'm asking for is what if anything should I think of the drone incident, and also any advice on my financial situation other than work more (I already work 40 hours plus the side work I get, although I am applying for a night job) and save more (hard to save when I have $0) would be appreciated.",27Jan2018,2

I thought it looked so yummy and that it would probably have to be thrown out (the custard) once she got back anyway, but now I'm thinking she probably was saving it. It says on the label it was like $10 so it was quite pricey! I don't know why I ate it, I was just really hungry and it was a moment of stupidity. What do you think I should do?

80,"Ok this will sound weird but hear me out.

I'm 22 F. I don't know why, but I've always had a strong desire to be liked by men, and have male attention on me. I don't attention seek on purpose as I'm actually very shy and withdrawn. 

Anyway it seems to be taking over certain aspects in my life. I didn't even realise my behaviour until recently.

Main example is people at work. I'm a student but I work casually at a retail store. Whenever a guy at work shows some sort of interest or attention, I am hooked. I mean I can think nothing of them in the beginning. But if they smile at me or talk to me, I start getting obsessive feelings.

Currently there are a few guys at my work I feel like this with. I want to emphasise that I don't have romantic or sexual feelings. Its hard to explain; I just start to want their attention and I feel obsessed in terms of getting that attention. I go out of my way for them to notice me.

For example, my work doesn't really have a set finish time due to the nature of my role. I know that a certain guy leaves at a certain time, so if I can finish my work to coincide with the time he leaves, I can go to the break room (where he will inevitably walk by). Then I can leave with him at the same time (the manager has to let us out a back door because we work late after the store is closed). 

Or another guy I know when he leaves so I try to finish my work at the same time. I try to have my car parked near his. And I try to drive off at the same time so his car is following mine until we go our own way.

I also want to emphasise that I would never do anything like going to their house, following them, whatever. It's not like that. It's more that when there is a chance for them to notice me, I want to take that chance at all costs. Even if it means working less hours and getting less money. Mind you I don't actually talk to any of these people. Maybe a ""hello"" or a smile as we walk past but that's it. I don't know them.

I don't know if this is normal. But there's something worse. When I am working hard to finish at the same time, it doesn't always work out and I have to finish later. So they leave before me. And this makes me so upset. Like I know it sounds really stupid but I suddenly feel so hopeless, angry, lonely, isolated, and even suicidal feelings (I would never kill myself over this, I just get those thoughts and feelings it's hard to describe).

And EVEN worse.. is that when I graduate from uni, I should look for a job in my field. But I keep thinking I want to stay working here for minimum wage. Why? Because I feel so obsessed with these people that I cannot leave my job and go into the field I studied for and potentially earn 90k+ a year. Nah I want to stay on 15k a year!! I already decided I want to stay even if I get a job in my field because I can make it work since they are short night shifts anyway. But the sole reason is because I don't want to leave the people I feel attached to now (even though I never talked to them before!!!)

I know it sounds so stupid. I can't explain it! It's just a bunch of emotions. I just want to be noticed and liked by guys. I've had  boyfriends before but it doesn't stop these feelings and eventually I feel too guilty and leave them because it almost feels like cheating even though there's no romantic interest or whatever.

Is this normal? How can I stop feeling like this?",27Jan2018,6

87,"A girl in my grade (I'm also a girl) seems to dislike me (we're both in college). This wouldn't be an issue except our school is small and she's into a lot of the same clubs and classes as me so we have a lot of social over lap.

I can't remember ever talking to her last semester beyond very general how are you doing and maybe some small talk about class. She always seemed disinterested in me but that didn't bother me. Recently I've seen her more often than usual because we're both rushing and I went to dinner with her with some of our classmates. 

Again she ignored as usual in both scenarios, usually our conversations were group conversations. The only times she really said anything to me was when someone at rush complimented my safety pin earrings she interjected with ""isn't that unsanitary? Aren't you scared of infections?"" and the next day at dinner when I said I liked people from West Point she said she thought they were gross.

Honestly I have very rarely experienced seemingly arbitrary dislike. Yeah I've experienced racism and classism, but we're from very similar backgrounds!

90,"     I should start off by saying that I am like 100% sure that I have social anxiety. All my life it has been really difficult for me to make friends and it’s gotten to a point where I can’t keep it to myself anymore. So in a new school, I really only hang out with and talk to a small group of people who came from the same school as me and who are the closest people to friends in my life. This “friendship” isn’t reciprocal though. They are really good friends with each other but I really feel that I just tag along with them so that I’m not sitting alone in the classroom or for lunch. 

     Many times whenever they decide to walk somewhere, there’s never an invite or even a signal for me to come along so when they all start moving, I just pack my things and go with them. They practically just leave me back and it’s up to me to follow them or stay back by myself. Often times whenever I talk to them and try to contribute, they acknowledge me but then kind out just dismiss me or respond to me in a rather condescending way. A few of these people are really nice, particularly this one guy who is a real friend to me but if there is someone else there he would almost always choose to talk to them over me. But there are a few I notice definitely don’t like me and just straight ignore me sometimes. 

   I’ve mentioned to them that I feel left out or that they’re leaving me behind but they always just laugh off the problem and say that I’m behind because I’m just slow or something similar. At this point in the year everyone is already in their own cliques and it is super tough for me to join any other group. I may talk to others from time to time or perhaps sit with them in class but I feel that I will always just be an acquaintance of theirs and will never truly be a part of them. They may call me their friend but wont ever invite me anywhere with them or talk to me like they would to their other friends. My conversations with them are always superficial fluff about school or the football game last weekend but it never goes beyond that like when speaking to their real friends.

      Sorry about this super long post.” That’s just me rambling on and on about different problems. I realize that for most people, this is a bunch of petty issues but it’s really killing me and this is my first time really letting everything out. This is something that I think about everyday before I go to bed, when I’m driving to school, and even while taking an exam. I’m constantly anxious and nervous as I walk into class to see whether my “friends” saved me a spot in class this time or if I should try to sit with a new group of people the next day. Once I find a real group of friends, I know that I will feel a lot more comfortable and relaxed. But for now I could really use some advice on whether I should try to patch up my relationship with my current friends or find a new group of people this late in the year and how to go about doing so.",27Jan2018,1

So i met this girl last year while i was still in high school, she is a senior now. I realized i had feelings for her a little after i graduated, and had since never acted on them because i thought they would go away. But they havent...

She posts on her finsta a lot about wanting to be in love and all that girl stuff, and im like i could give her that. I really like her, shes cool and smart and funny and cute and her voice is sexy as hell.

I might have waited too long though because soon shes going to go off to college, and our universities wouldnt be too far away but i like physical contact so i probably go crazy lol but im rambling.

Ive been trying to figure out if how i should tell her and if i even should tell her at all. I did date a friend of hers before and it didn't end too well and that might sound bad but i hadnt realized my feeling for her yet.

I was thinking of asking her to hang out, but i want her to know i like her so if i do something stupid like stare at her or stutter then at least she will know why. But i dont know how to like say that because ive only asked two other girls out before and im deathly afraid of rejection and i dont want it to be awkward.

I was thinking that the best way to combat this would be to wait until like 3 in the morning, text her like ""hey i actually think youre really cute and we should hang out"" and pray shes sleeping. Then when she sees it be like ""im sorry i was drunk, i was actually planning on never telling you this but i guess that didnt work haha"" and then see how thing go. Shes pretty straightforward so i think she would tell me if she didnt feel the same way.

This, i know is cowardly as fuck so if i should just man up and call her and tell her straight up then someone should tell me now because im just imagining her saying no. Im anxious just thinking about it, but someone told me that it isnt fair to her if i told tell her my feelings because she has a right to know, which doesnt really make any sense to me but it gave me a reason to at least consider going through with it.

98,"About 3 or 4 years ago I was talking to a different friend about how I feel really strange about sex, sometimes I have panic attacks during sex, I’ve never been sober in a relationship, tried to kill myself after losing my virginity etc. and she asked me if I was molested as a child because the things I was telling her sounded like a different person’s account of their sexual relationships. At first I was pretty resistant to the idea, but I started to remeber different events from childhood. One memory I have is of my mom’s boyfriend pulling me onto his naked lap while we were at the hot springs and me feeling uncomfortable and also of being very afraid of him. 

I pushed it to the back of my mind and figured that I probably just didnt like the guy and that it was so long ago that I couldn’t really remember the truth anyway. That and power of suggestion- I really wasn’t sure if I made it up.

Occasionally I feel weird and have panicky thoughts about it and wondered what I would do if that really happened to me, but I just figured I’m kindof weird, sex isn’t my thing and it’s not a big deal. 

A week or so ago I was talking to my sister on the phone and she was upset about a fight with our mom. She commented that her “life is effed up because (reasons) and I was molested as a child”. Which made my heart skip a beat. I asked her “was it mom’s boyfriend” and she confirmed. 

I’m still trying to process that piece of information. But I told one of my close friends what happened and she asked me for details- which I can’t give because I don’t remember them, only bits and pieces that arent graphic. 

Then she said that since she sometimes feels weird about sex it probably happened to her too, and that she felt weird about what I’d told her. I’m normally really really calm during stressful situations, like the more stressful something is the calmer I get- so I just said “it’s okay, the world we live in is messed up sometimes, I forgive the guy and honestly I just pity him he’ll never have genuine connection and who knows if he wasn’t abused” and then she told me that she’s just upset because she’s more sensitive than I am. 

I don’t know what to think about that: it feels like she took something I confided in her and made it about herself. Or am I being unreasonable in having an expectation for how she should react? To me it seems like I shared with her and because I did it calmly I got called insensitive.

I'm looking for advice on how to support someone.

My best friend, Serena, is 14. She's an amazing person and I love her to death. She was walking from our school to her dance studio which is only about a mile away. Right outside of the school, a silver car was parked. There is an elementary school directly across from our school, and a middle school a few miles north. The car had tinted windows and she didn't think anyone was inside. She walked by it, and accidentally hit the mirror. The door opened and she apologized, and an older man asked her if she needed a ride. She declined and continued walking, but he grabbed her wrist and bag and tried to force her into the car. She kicked his knee and ran. A police report was filed, and they're trying to find him.

I want to know how I can support her. She said she doesn't wanna talk to anyone, and I understand that. I just want to know what I can do to make sure she understands I'm here for her.

106,"So...I'm a 26yo without any education past my GED and I've only worked 2 jobs for a total of probably a year and a half. I dropped out of high school because at a certain point I just couldn't handle it. I was only in low level classes too. Like remedial shit. Something made me panic and I just couldn't go anymore. After that I coasted for years doing nothing but skateboarding because I thought I could go somewhere with it but that didn't happen. Not even close.

After 3-4 years of that I got a job and I only lasted there for 8 months before the same thing happened. Just panicked and left. Since then I worked as a summer camp counselor teaching kids how to skate for a few years. Then last summer it happened again. I just broke down and couldn't handle it anymore. The fact that that happened to me while teaching kids about the thing I love most in the world is so confusing to me...

So Idk what to do... My days are spent moping around my bedroom in my parents house waiting for something to happen. Most of the time nothing ever does. I have no desire to go to school because I have nothing I want to study. I don't want to study. And I can't get myself to work because 1.) I don't want to go through those experiences again and 2.) I don't want to fucking work. I do not believe I was made to work my whole damn life away. The thought of that totally breaks me down and I panic. I think that's why I've left all of those things. I realize that I should really be doing something to help my parents out, and that they wont always be here... But I just can't get myself to do anything...

I'm pretty sure I have anxiety/depression, and I've been on Lexapro for the past year. I think it helped me a bit... But I'm still pretty much exactly where I was before I started taking it. But I only think it's caused by my outlook on work and stuff. Idk if I want therapy or whatever. That sounds like the last thing I would want to do. But I just worry about what I'm gonna do in the future...

But when I brought up the boss to a mutual friend tonight the friend first asked how long I’ve known about Chris. Please help me sort through this horse shit. ,27Jan2018,1

110,"So I have browsed reddit daily for over 2 years and never needed an account before but for once I actually have a good reason to post! 

I recently learned that my best friend’s 12 year old son has been mining bit coin for almost 4 months consistently. He uses a kinda cheap hp gaming laptop he got last year for Christmas. From what I was able to understand he has made like $40 from all his time trying to mine. I think it is great seeing a young boy so dedicated to something with potential and having fun learning how to do it. He told me about saving up for some type of device to help him gain more power. 

Anyways to what I need help with! His birthday is coming up in just a few weeks and I’d love be able to give him some bit coins for his birthday. I tried googling it to learn how but can’t understand it lol. I also don’t understand how it is worth over 10 thousand dollars and if I can get smaller amounts for him, since I obvi can’t afford thousands for a gift. 

Anyone have advice on how I could help him get more and give him some bit coin for his birthday. Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks so much in advance!",27Jan2018,3

112,"I should really be able to solve this problem myself, but damn. I got an Xbox One for Christmas, and all the free time I get goes into playing it. I used to spend more time with my family and doing exercise, but now it's just Xbox. I haven't been fulfilling my household responsibilities or anything because I'm on Xbox so much. The obvious answer is just to stop playing, but the thing is, I keep coming back. I just can't stop playing. At least one group of my friends is always on playing and it's so easy to hop on and lose 3-7 hours depending on what day it is. Not only that, but I've been late to appointments and have been going to be really late as a result. So I guess I'm asking for advice about how to control the amount of time I spend gaming. It's absurd now. I just can't stop. I want to do other things. Furthermore, I want to balance my time.

114,"Hi guys.

So I really like this coworker of mine. But I’m really confused about the current situation I’m in. And I hope you all could help me be well, unconfused. Just a quick note: This is a throwaway account. As I’d like to stay Anonymous.

We met a couple of weeks ago when we started the early morning shift. I hadn’t noticed her before, and when my manager told me that I had to explain everything to her I was a bit annoyed. (Because that’s the last thing I wanted to do at 6.30 in the morning!)

She did very well and we started talking a bit. One or my friends was in the same shift so she didn’t get super much attention. 

A week later I work with her again, and I start to like her. And I eventually got her snapchat. We immediately start a snapchat ‘streak’. Now comes the part where it gets confusing;

A few days into chatting and snapping I said to her ‘you know, snapchat isn’t the best for chatting. Would you mind giving me your #?’ To which she replied: ‘sure i think this is my number loll’. Note: It was 2 digits short of being an actual phone number.. so I thought okay this could be a honest mistake. So I give her mine. And after a few minutes she says: “Fu*ck it, lets talk on snapchat.” This is where I though shit I messed up. But she kept sending me snaps and such so i continued to talk to her. (**Note: She sends a lot of snapchats with hearts and kiss emoijs. Also with “Love” bitemoji texts**)

Another week or so goes by, and we’re working together again. I was busy so we didn’t talk a lot but when she was on break I always walked to the break room to talk to her (she was alone). I wanted to ask her out but cars kept coming so they were preventing me to do that. 

At 15:00 my shift was done so I headed home. And i was pretty bummed out that I didn’t got to ask her so I looked at the schedule and we weren’t planned in together yet. (My manager plans a month in ahead of time). 

So I decided that I would just send her a casual snapchat where I asked her if she wanted to go to the movies with me. This is her reply:

Her: “Ummm😅😅 i dont know😅😅😅”
Her: “I think I don’t sorry😅😅😅”

Of course I was sad but here is where it becomes a LOT stranger:

She still keeps sending me snapchats with hearts, and the love bitemoji texts etc. So I do not know what the deal is. At the time of writing it has been a week since I asked her out. And I heard that another coworker likes her too (although he is 6 years older then her..) And I know that he might get a bit closer bc I saw that he tagged her in a meme on Facebook and she replied very enthusiastic. (2 days ago). 

So I thought well i’ll do that too. No. Reaction.

She is giving me a lot of mixed signals and I don’t know what to do. i really like her a lot. And she’s the first girl I really like since I got over my lesbian best friend..

What do you take out all of this? I cannot concentrate and I’m thinking about all of this 24/7... And I know that i’m not good with girls. i always get way too nervous and I shut down.. 

EDIT: i re-created a snapchat I got this morning to illustrate what I mean:

115,"I had some friends over this Friday night play some Dungeons &amp; Dragons. There was a total of four of us and we all sat at my kitchen table on the far side of the apartment from the bedrooms. I have a very tall kitchen table, counter height. Our feet do not touch the ground . We were sitting at the table playing a game for at least 3 hours when they knocked on my door at about 10 p.m.  They complained of stomping noises and that they were about to go to bed and it might disturb them.

I am a very quiet person. On a very rare occasion I will have friends over when I have to host our game. Two to three times a year. If anything the only loud thing that was happening was my friend and his occasional laughter at something we would say. While I agree that his laughter can be loud, it was on the far side of the apartments from where their bedrooms are and where people would sleep. And no way would that be mistaken for stomping.

I apologized to my neighbor and told him we would try to be quiet. I even thanked him for saying something to me personally, as opposed to going to our apartment manager. Is it valid to be minorly annoyed that on the rare occasion when I actually have people over to my place that I get a complaint. I'm rarely ever home and when I am I'm not stomping around or making excessive noise outside of the 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. noise restrictions of my apartment. I've been living here for over 3 years and the people below me have been living here for maybe a year. I've never had a complaint before now, but I really don't think I, or my friends, were being noisy at all. We were sitting and having a normal conversation with the occasional after on a Friday night. All before 10 p.m.

Just because I'm a quiet person I don't want to feel like I have to be quiet 100% of the time. Considering all of my neighbors are incredibly noisy. Am I out of line to feel like I should be able to have friends over on and early weekend evening without getting complaints?

I would understand if it was a weeknight, and we were directly above their bedrooms, but we were not. We were on the far side of the apartment away from any bedrooms. I feel like I have to constantly listen to my neighbors and all the things they do and say through the thin walls but the moment I make any noise they make a complaint right away.",27Jan2018,1
117,"I live in Sydney and have done so for about 1.5 years now. I have plenty of friends at work but they're all either married, in a long term relationship or have kids and don't have time to spend with a friend. I have heard that you should join clubs in things that interest you but I don't really see any clubs with people who enjoy playing video games, vaping and/or motorbikes (there are plenty of those clubs but I don't have a motorbike at the moment and probably won't have one for a good while).

It was easy making friends back home because we went to school together and if we didn't we met each other through friends from school. And they weren't married/making me the third wheel/having loads of kids back then.

I know most people will tell me to talk to them over discord/on the phone but most of them are now in the same sort of relationship with people. I'm 30 in a few months, painfully single and have barely anyone to hang out with and it sucks pretty hard.

Bills and money is my biggest problem, no car and not able to go back to school.

But no one or nothing makes me wanna keep going.

I guess I’m asking, should I die? 

When I think I meet someone worth it, they either shoot me down or they’re terrible and I shut them down. I feel like at this point I’m not trying to find someone for happiness, but to find someone just to see *if* it’ll give me happiness. 

When it comes to hobbies, I just don’t enjoy gaming or anything else I used to do.

People say “Go out and find something!”

But that’s the thing, I’ve done all kinds of things. I’ve done multiple sports, hated it. I’ve done art classes, hated it. Gaming just feel likes a passing time chore, used to be my escape. I could go on and on.

Freshman year I did not do any sports, but sophomore year I tried out for wrestling which was the first sport I ever played and tennis.

This year I really wanted to join wrestling but I really had a hard time last year keeping up with other wrestlers physically because I’m out of shape so I felt out of place ( not overweight, just really low stamina and endurance)

I did feel like a natural on the mat though and felt like I could improve to become a good wrestler but the mental wall barrier of how tiring practice is an out of place I am made me give up and quit. also due to the fact of how hard my classes were I could keep up with my HW and studying but barely.

I also want to join football but I have no experience and I don’t even watch football nor do I have any knowledge of how to play it. I’m a small guy 5’4 145 pounds.

125,"I’m unemployed and on benefits for my mental instability, 21 year old is a full time chef and 28 year old is a full time carer. We live in quite a big house, quite old, but we love it. We all share the WiFi bills and pay electric in turn, do our own shopping etc. but I have a massive issue with 28F; she doesn’t tidy up after herself, she only buys food for work and then helps herself to whatever 21F and I have bought - for ourselves, mind. When it comes to paying electric she will acknowledge the electric is out completely and leave for work or go to her own Mums in her car, and when she does pay it she only puts in £5 when we put in £15/20 each time. Both housemates are aware I live on benefits so am unable to continuously pay for things when it’s their turn. She will walk by a full bin and not do anything about it, nor will she take the bins out to be emptied on Tuesday nights. She doesn’t do her dishes and often just.. leaves her plates, bowls etc. lying wherever she was eating. Our landlord and owner of the house called round a fortnight ago, the house was damaged from a previous tenant and it needed a serious clean because no one cleans up after themselves and shit tends to build up a LOT. She offered to clean the bathrooms, there’s three in our house and we know she won’t be able to do much when she becomes heavily pregnant so we let her off with that. The bathrooms are still waiting to be cleaned, and she doesn’t seem to realise that we cleaned the house top to bottom, did various skip runs and deep cleaning in every single room while she chilled out in her mothers home until late on the night before our landlord came round. She will bitch and whinge if others leave ONE plate or bowl out, or if the full bin tips over, but she won’t do anything about it. She has continued to smoke in her bedroom and chuck her butts out of her window onto the ground which we clean despite us asking her to stop. She’s only 5 months pregnant at this rate, she is fully capable of being a full time carer but refuses to participate in any household duties or pay for anything when it is her turn. How does one approach this with her without attacking her or losing their shit? We have called house meetings three times in the last two months and nothing seems to be changing.

Edit: 28F is planning on staying with us until her child is born and then moving out afterwards or staying until she can afford to live on her own, but hasn’t addressed the fact she will then need to pay for electric / food / heating to care for her child. SS would take the child off her if they went into our house when there was no heating or it hadn’t been cleaned, it’s not dangerous but it’s no place for a newborn.",27Jan2018,2
126,"Hey ,

So I have a sister, she can almost never take criticism on her actions , and I have had it with her crap.

Usually we fight because even when I try to tell her off ""politely"" she snaps at me with comments like "" OK OK I UNDERSTAND GET OFF MY ASS "" kind of thing.

This time, she came home drunk while I was asleep, she left the damn house door unlocked and she had didn't even get the damn door key from the other side of the door!

She literally left the house open, and anyone could have taken the key!

I went to check the car because I knew her crap wasn't over there, the car looked like a garbage truck, cigarette dust all over , empty vodka bottle thrown in there and the car smelled like fucking vodka.

I want to snap at her, I really do, she is an irresponsible little shit and I hate it when she does stuff like that.

129,"As I browse Facebook, I often find myself pondering if I’m living in a fulfilling balance. I just began a new career and I want to use this time to self reflect and get some feedback from my peers on some thoughts I’ve had. 

Background on myself:  I have gotten laid off from a few careers due to feigning interest in the job role and lack of discipline (attendance has been an issue due to drinking). Now I’m 6 months sober and just began a new career path at a great company. It’s an amazing opportunity. 

Career-wise, I want to use this time to expand my education in the field as my formal education is lacking and I don’t have any hands on experience. Also, become more disciplined in other aspects in life that have indirect effects on how I treat my career (e.g. eating healthy, exercise, and sleeping well). 

Socially and as hobbies, I like, of course of hang with friends, play guitar, tennis and other rec sports, playing video games, and seeing live music. Often, surrounding myself a ton of social interaction causes frustration because I desire to be social, but I find clubs/bars largely irritating and I realize the opportunity cost of doing other things I enjoy. 

Why do I feel like I’m missing out on things? I know it’s in my best interest to keep my head down and focus on career advancement etc but then I feel like I’m not “having fun” or “making new friends” or whatever it is...

132,"Hello, today is my birthday and I feel like crying all the time, and just feeling purely miserable, because of my so called “friends”. 
I just found out that one of my close friends, let’s call him Frank, whom I’ve been friends with for 17 years doesn’t want to spend any more time with me, because of a stupid misunderstanding. 
It happened around Christmas, my sister flew home from Paris, and as soon as she landed she had an epileptic seizure, although I have seen her having these attacks a lot of times, it always breaks my heart bit by bit every time. So I canceled my planned day with Frank and his brother, girlfriend and my boyfriend to go ice skating, cause my nerves were dead. 
Frank just texted my boyfriend, if my bf seriously can’t come without me, cause why would you need two people to look after a person who had an epileptic seizure? That just blew me 1000 miles away, I really thought that that was one of the heartless thing he has done to me, trying to do it behind my back. 
It’s just, you can’t explain the feeling when you see one of your closest people go through a seizure like that, where eyes roll back, white saliva everywhere, hitting the ground like tons of brick, blood on face because we didn’t catch her in time so she hit her face on a box, the shaking, the aftermath with not knowing if she’ll have another seizure, just the most horrible experience for me.
So going through that and the what Frank texted my boyfriend, pfff wow.

That’s when I started to get really upset for a few days and didn’t want to hang out with Frank until he admits that what he said was just mean and apologizes.

Of course that didn’t and hasn’t happened, so I just kind of moved on, tried to not think about that until two days ago. It has been more than a month since the accident and I finally meet Frank at a small get-together party. He was so so cold to me, he and his girlfriend, but I just couldn’t bother that night, so I just got really drunk, until one of the party guests asked me, what’s up with us two? I got kind of anxious and couldn’t let the thought of sorting this shit out go. So I got even more drunk and just in front of everyone I just asked - the fuck is wrong??
Everyone got quite, Frank asked me to go to other room to talk, but his girlfriend would not allow it, because we were both drunk.

So we agreed to talk about it another day. Haven’t contacted ever since, and now it’s my birthday and I was imagining spending this day with them, but now I can’t, and I feel so upset and I just want to sort this out, but can’t today, cause it’s my bd. 

Please, advice :(
Am I overreacting? I don’t want to blame anyone, but how to just not be a miserable little shit on my day? How to just not think about this stupid fight?

I used to be really close to my sister, back when we were both younger, but she's got her shit together with a fiance and a child, so I don't want to bother her with my life and problems.

156,"My girlfriend &amp; I have been dating for 9 months. She has 1 brother &amp; 2 sisters (I feel that's relevant). She consistently showcases controlling &amp; manipulative behavior with me, like telling me I can't hang out with my friends who are girls, or that I can't post pictures of any kind on social media.

But lately she's taken to saying I'm too close with my mother. My mother is due to have a spinal surgery, so of course I've been helping her out more - she has difficulties moving around. But out of nowhere, my gf says that she feels like I would choose my mom over her. This really confused me, because I can't understand her logic here. She's my mother, &amp; I'm just trying to be a good son?

My girlfriend says how close my mom &amp; I are make her feel insecure. She also runs to my mom anytime we have an argument &amp; tries to throw me under the bus. But when I get simple advice from my own mother, my girlfriend demands that our problems remain ""our"" problems even though she was the one who involves my mom in our disagreements to begin with.

She's all ""buddy buddy"" with my mother until on the rare occurrence my mom sides with me on a particular topic, then my gf gets silent &amp; refuses to speak to anyone. Then after a while says she feels attacked &amp; ganged up on if it doesn't go her way. She's also tried isolating me from certain friends &amp; other family members. Her old group of friends have cut her off &amp; no longer speak to her, so I'm basically all she has. She insists on us being together 24/7 &amp; spending every waking moment together, so her trying to drive a wedge between my mother &amp; I is a fairly serious problem. I don't know what to do. I care about her, but she has a way of making me feel like I'm questioning my sanity with some of the arguments we have. I really need advice.

158,"I've caught wind of a plan that I would receive a gift. Not that I hate receiving gifts, it's just that it would be (uncomfortably) expensive. I know I'm in no position to turn down a gift, so I want to preempt it (they haven't purchased it yet) and persuade them not to buy the said gift politely. I can't talk to anyone else since they may be part of the plan. 

Edit: (For context) My previous phone got acquainted with a flight of stairs and got intimate with each step along the way. At that time, I didn't have the money nor the time to replace it. It kinda grew on me, especially since I don't have to constantly check my pockets and it helped me focus more on my studies. In time I was able to adjust. Granted, I had a hard time during the first few months and I now use an old tablet (which my brother doesn't use anymore) as a pseudo-phone (for email, messages, social media, etc.). I haven't had a phone for more than a year now and I'm perfectly fine with that. Lately, I learned about my family's plan to buy me a phone for me as a (birthday) gift. I have nothing against owning, giving or receiving phones; it's just that they plan on buying a current gen phone which I find expensive (for a phone).

Please know that I am aware of how shallow my problem is. But I trust that you understand the feeling of receiving something you feel you don't deserve, especially at the expense of others.

I literally only engage with it because I want to be supportive, and I'm a (lapsed, currently) performer myself (burlesque) and I'd never (not that I think there's anything wrong with it) hit up my friends directly to come out to shows and stuff, so I'm not being hypocritical. 

I just wanna... maybe get some tips to rebrand so I don't feel like a jerk for not going to these shows or feeling like I'm a jerk if I don't listen to these albums. Or maybe some kind ways to turn the invites down without lying?

166,"Dear reddit,

It's not often I come to the surface of the internet, but I'm in something of a bind and I don't know who else to turn to. 
  
  So, last week, I started messaging this girl on Plenty of Fish. She seemed ok, nice enough. We got talking more, and while I had a few messages from other girls, I simply messaged them 'hi' politely. I gave the original girl my number and we scheduled to meet up.
  
  However, she then messaged me very angrily demanding to know why I was still on PoF, and that talking to other girls was very disrespectful, and tjat if I was some kind of player I should piss off. I assured her this wasn't the case, and that I'd just cleared my notifications. She then proceeded to tell me that as a girl on PoF, she could see when I was last online, as well as if I had talked to anyone. 
  
  I have no idea if this is true or not, but the story continues. After ringing her up while I was at work to assure her of my good intentions, she came over to my place to meet me. Or, sort of. I took a half day, used up some leave, and sh said she'd be over by 3. I then get messages telling me that dhe can't come yet because her housemate's cat is ill and she needs to stay until her flatmate gets back from work. She finally shows up at around 8.30pm, but says she's 'seen me on PoF again'  and that she might as well just go home. I point out I only went on there to message her because she wasn't answering her whatsapp.
  
  She finally agrees to come in, we get on ok, but she's playing with her phone most of the evening. She also seems a bit upset. I ask what the matter is. She tells me that she hasn't been paid, she's practically broke, and she has to travel to Leeds next tuesday to attend the funeral of her sister's baby. She can't afford to drive and park, but she can't afford to get the train from Didcot/Oxford either. 
  
  I offered to lend her £60. She said that was kind but it still wouldn't cover her train ticket. We just sat and chatted for a few hours. Watched a film. She left mine at 1am, mesaging me to say that if I could loan her more than £60, then as soon as her boss gets round to paying her she'd pay me back. After some emotional messaging, I transferred her just over £100. 
  
  Since then, she's been messaging me asking me why I'm back on PoF, and also sending me messages that seem geared towards saying I don't want to see you again, without saying it. I've continued to protest my innocence, told her I like her, which as a person I do, and gone so far as to send screenshots of my PoF app to show I've not been doing what she's accused me of. 
  
  We specifically agreed that she would pay me back on her next payday, February 8th....
  
  Reddit, what am I to do? Can anyone answer my questions? Does PoF for women really have that functionality? Am I being led on?....
  
  Hope to hear if you've got some advice.

  Kind regards,

167,"Okay, 

I’m in a tough situation. I’ve been engaged since December: We were planning on getting married in October of 2019, this was because we weren’t really expecting our parents to help out. This gives us time to save plus, we’re in a living situation that we know we’re going to need to get out of at the end of our lease (October 2018) 

Fast forward to my problem. 

A couple weeks ago I took my bridal party to a wedding giveaway, where i ended up winning 1k off of my wedding. Exciting right? Wrong, super stressful. APPARENTLY, in order to use the 1k I have to first, use one of their three vendors and second it must be used this year! 

We sat down and got a proposal from the hospitality coordinator, and it’s actually not that bad (for a breakfast buffet, the venue for reception and ceremony: 110 guests) it ended up being like 4200. 

I don’t know if this is worth it considering I don’t have a dress, Cake, photographer.

177,"TL;DR at the end

Hey guys, I don't know if it's in my head, but every time I have an issue with society, most of the time everybody looks at me like I'm a freak, and I've learned that people don't understand me and instead of going for a solution - I try to isolate myself from the environment.. 
I love my current job (at least what I do there) but my current placement is being in a room with colleagues that are from 2-3 different departments (small company) and some of them like to play elevator music all day long. Not gonna get into details, but people working on stuff that need more concentration often listen to their own music only to cancel out the one being blasted in the room and I'm one of those people.
I like the freedom of not listening to anything, just doing my job, and listening to my own music can be tiring as well - sick of playing the same songs over and over.. 8 hours of playlist that I can enjoy - not repeating day after day can be a challenge..

My asking is.. how do I tell people that I don't want them to play any music while at work, and instead maybe listen to it on headphones if they really need to without causing tension?

I know it may sound easy to some of you - just tell them.. but I can't! For me - the whole point is that that's a thing that doesn't need to be said! I know not to do it, others won't enjoy electronic music or chill causing dubstep while concentrating on their work, but people who listen to elevator music at their workplace don't seem to be the people who will understand that not everybody else will enjoy that ""peaceful music and why can't you just relax for once..""
Nobody have said this to me yet but... But as I said, I have a history with trying to explain things to people that bother me and they don't get it so they think of me like I'm the strange one and just because they're the masses - they just laugh at the idea. Again.. I don't care a bit, and I just avoid this kind of people, but here the situation is a bit different - I care about the company I work for, and I love my job.

TL;DR How do you tell people that their relaxing music makes me wanna kill myself without coming up as an asshole but make them stop doing it?",27Jan2018,2
179,"Hi I’m 17 and I have a 7 yo sister. Maybe it’s all in my head but I feel like my sister hides her feelings and problems she has. I feel like she’s going through stuff but don’t like to talk about it, and that she is acting everything is fine, I just feel she’s not the same as the other kids... like totally happy. Like if she doesn’t want to worry us or doesn’t want to get in trouble by telling me or my parents what’s wrong. 

I try to advice my mother but I don’t want to worry her because again, maybe it’s just in my head... I can’t just go to my mum and be like,... here, I found this article about how to get your kid to open up more. She will just worry and tell me that my sister will come to her if she has any problems... 
my parents are actually very caring and loving but as I’ve read they’re making some mistakes in “talking and opening up” they might ask in a way it feels like an interrogatory to my sister... and I think my parents should read some of this articles or spend time with her, focusing on her doing a focused activity together (which they actually do sometimes ...)
Sometimes I try to ask my sister how is everything and ask her about specific things and sometimes she will first say everything is fine but then maybe she tells me “oh yes, D was a bit bad today with the teacher” then I try to go deeper in that but I can feel how It isn’t a natural conversation and don’t know how she feels about it so I stop 

However, I can’t just tell my mum to read that stuff,  but I think it would help, but I don’t want to trigger my mum or ask me about my childhood “oh so you are saying you hide stuff from us and you think your sister is doing too?” 

Idk guys it’s hard to explain but I just want my sister to be happy and I can’t spend much time with her because I’m studying and it makes me sad to send her out my Room.... also, I don’t want to really follow these articles steps or advices myself as if I was a dad or mum, which I’m not, I’m not sure that there’s really  a problem 
, maybe she’s fine and I’m just worrying to much. But I don’t want to follow steps and ask stuff to a girl that is actually happy, that will just make her uncomfortable and will put thoughts in her head that she didn’t have... I can’t really judge how she is......

I have no desire to socialize and I truly don’t know why. I have always been told that I am a people person. And I actually do like people, crave attention, and want to fit in and feel comfortable in social situations. But instead, I am intimidated and I automatically assume everyone hates me. I avoid social events, or dread going to them, because the thought of trying to be interesting is exhausting.

182,"Hi there everybody, I have a pretty classic situation of living with a friend that turned bad and I'm looking for a little bit of input on what I should do.

 My girlfriend and I decided to rent a house with a long term friend of mine (10 years).  Here's a wonderful person, has a very consistent income and all of that, but he is an incredibly messy person with 3 times more personal items than I would have ever imagined. In the summer of this year, our lease will come up for renewal, and we want to find a way to gently suggest that he finds his own place. The guy is just so massy, extremely irresponsible when it comes to general around the house sorts of things, Has an extremely annoying girlfriend who's very rude to us, and has a cat that he fails to clean up after on a regular basis leaving the whole house smelling like a filthy litter Box. 

 On top of this, he owns a construction business and as such has a large number of tools, but has decided to simply monopolize our garage to the point where nobody else is able to use it, combine that with the other mass of things he owns that are taking up all of the rest of the storage space in our house, it's as if we have 3 or 4 roommates. It makes it nearly impossible to have any level of prganization because of the sheer volume of stuff he has. 

 I have no ill wishes, he is a great friend and I have no desire to damage or eliminate our friendship. But my girlfriend and I are responsible young adults trying to build ourselves up and we feel like we are constantly fighting to have any sort of normalcy around the house.  We simply think it would be best for him to find his own place commas so that we are able to reclaim all of the lost space in our house at bring things to a normal level.

 I am aware  That it will more than likely come down to a simple conversation,  But my hope is that someone could give us a bit of advice on how to bring this up with him without creating any problems. We sincerely you only want the best for everybody, but we are at a point where living with him is a constant stressor that we no longer want to deal with.

185,"Hi, first off, I'm a long time lurker first time poster. I've never planned on actually posting anywhere on this site before but lately this problem has been driving me crazy. This is by far the least dramatic problem that's been posted, but I'd like some advice on what to do. I apologize for the length of this and any weird formatting, I'm writing this on my phone. If there are any other subreddits where this would fit better, please let me know!

So basically, I (18/F) have been best friends with this girl we'll call Abby (18/F) for about two years now. We talk a lot and know everything about each other. She's funny and nice and has been a great friend the whole time, but I think she's been kind of awful to me lately.

At the beginning of summer she dated a guy, fell in love (as in love as a 17 year old can get) and when they broke up she was crushed. I'm talking like she spent the entire summer depressed and crying kind of crushed. Since we're best friends, she turned to me for support, so I did my best to calm her down from her anxiety attacks about it and keep her in good spirits until it blew over. 

It was two straight months of her complaining to me and sending cryptic messages about how sad she was and nothing else. I admit that I got annoyed by it sometimes, because our entire relationship became me becoming a kind of therapist that she complained to. I tried giving advice but I'm not trained to give advice, I don't honestly know what's best for people in that sort of situation. I know I probably sound bitchy, but it was tiresome.

After the summer was over, Abby got happier and mostly moved on from it and we went back to normal, more balanced conversations. I began noticing at the beginning of this school year that she still talks about herself more than anything else, like how she feels about person A and who she's asking to prom and how nobody she knows is going to the same university she's going to and she's so sad about it. It's always her complaining. It's never not complaining.

I find that I'm getting more and more fed up with it, because she never asks how I am anymore or what I'm up to. I don't exactly have the best mental health either, and she knows that. But she never talks to me about anything related to me, it's always about either her, or boys she likes. My anxiety tells me that I'm being selfish or I'm reading too much into it, but at the same time I think I might be right in thinking this.

The last straw for me has been this: Abby met a new boy who she really likes. I mean REALLY likes. Maybe more than the boy who hurt her in the summer. He's now her main topic of choice and it's all I hear about. That's fine, honestly, I'm glad she's happy again. But what really gets my goat is that for the past several weeks she rarely messages me. I used to look at my phone and have like 10-15 snapchats etc from her in a single day. Now it's nothing. She even ignores the things I send her. I asked her why this was, because I was worried I'd done something wrong.

Turns out, she ignores everyone else on her snapchat because her new boyfriend is in the ""#1 best friend"" slot and she doesn't want anybody else to be there. I think that's kind of a shitty thing to do, personally. I know it's just snapchat and shouldn't be a big deal but it hurts when someone says ""I'm specifically ignoring you so I can have an emoji next to my boy's name"".

Look, I know this is such dumb teenager drama, but I don't have anyone to talk to about this and I don't know what to do about it. I care about Abby very much, but I don't want to be friends with someone who only wants to talk when it's about them.

What should I do? I want to talk to her about it but I don't know how. Has anyone been in a similar type of situation? What did you do?

I (20, F) have this ""friend"" (19, F) who is incredibly toxic, and I've been trying to cut her out of my life for quite a while now. My plan thus far has just been to ignore her, hoping to avoid confrontation, and hope that she gets the message. My plan is apparently failing miserably though, because she doesn't pick up on, or perhaps chooses to ignore, all the signs that I no longer want to be friends with her. I've decided that I'm probably going to have to confront her if I ever want to get her out of my life, but I'm still hoping to avoid an all-out war.

For a little bit of context, and also because it's almost entertaining how amazingly selfish she can be, here are some of her antics: She craves any kind of attention that she can get, whether it's good or bad. She used to go around practically bragging about the fact that she's anorexic/bulimic, and constantly judges people based on their appearance. She is highly manipulative, especially with her parents, and she will undoubtedly cause a scene any time she doesn't get her way. She comes over completely unannounced, usually around 1-3 am (admittedly we are usually awake at that hour, but we are relaxing, and you weren't invited!), and even if she does text us asking to come over, she will not take no for an answer. Even if I ignore her, she comes over! She even broke into our house once to visit us! She once came over to our house just to take a nap because she didn't want to go home because her parents weren't letting her get her way! This is insanity!

However, my parents would never let me, and I found myself spending almost every weekend with my brothers and father. Basically my parents didn’t care that I had a minimal social life. 
Fast forward seven years later, I still talk to my friends from my childhood and from high school. I’m working part time at a local supermarket, have dropped out of college, working on getting an apprenticeship or joining NYPD, and most of my friends go away to college. I still see the friends that did not go away to school, and socialize with them weekly. Problem is my parents don’t seem to realize this. Every Saturday when I wake up my mother always asks me what my plans are for the day, and my father will ask me what I’m doing for the day. To me, they didn’t seem to care at all when I was in high school, but now that I’ve dropped out they can’t seem to leave me alone about it. 

If anyone could offer me advice on how to deal with this problem I would truly appreciate it.",27Jan2018,2
193,"In high school and my first go at college I was always a very open and social person. I didn't often have problems making conversations with people or talking with strangers.     
        
But then I spent 2 years working nearly 60 hours a week, mostly just sleeping and going to work. I didn't see friends a whole lot and I hungout with my at the time girlfriend. But she was a major introvert so it didn't lead to us being around people.    
     
Now I'm single, back in college, working a much more flexible job.        
       
But when I talk to people I just kinda shut down. Like the conversation doesn't go anywhere. I can tell it's on me also. Like I close these people out and I don't have anything to say or just get awkward.      
      
I just want to be able to have a conversation  with a stranger. To potentially make friends, meet girls, etc. But just the ability to hold a fun conversation with someone I've never talked to before would be amazing. I just can't get myself to do it and I don't know why.",27Jan2018,4

We've lived in this house about 3-4 years, and these new neighbors moved in a little less than a year ago. Anyways, the way the well is setup is it's located on the very edge of their property, and we have the right-of-way to the well (I assume the well used to be on our property, but one of the previous owners sold off the lot the neighbors now live on). So, do we need to be worried about some sort of legal issue, because we don't just have thousands of dollars laying around to just relocate the well? Can they force us to pay to have it moved? Could they potentially sue us for something we had no control over? By the way, they are ""those"" kind of neighbors that only seem to want to cause problems for everyone.",27Jan2018,4

203,"I'm currently at a university studying computer science. I'm in my first year which finishes in 5 months. My course involves a 3rd year off in industry for work experience. 

Long story short I'm a pretty quiet guy with few close friends and when i came here i've met lots of new people that I get on with, but deep down are totally different to me. I thought this was going to be beneficial but its hurting me a bit. I should have gone down the route of going to societies and events to meet people with similar interests but since coming here outside of study i've basically just binge watched netflix / got drunk and gone out clubbing. I get anxious around girls and last night at a club 2 of my closest friends i've met here were joking about it and it really annoyed me and they kept pushing until i couldn't take it and i argued and just walked out. I ended up on the phone with a helpline saying i've made a mistake about university etc and spoke with my mum. I was incredibly upset. Next year i've already put a deposit down on a house to live with loads of other guys and its going to be kind of hectic i think. I want to get away from this lifestyle.

I've left friend groups before but its very hard when you live with them. And when they see you as something you're not. I really don't know what to do or how to get away from this spot.

Should i just spend more time in my room and stop going out with them?

Should i take a year out and come back in at year 2? 

My worry with taking a year out is that i'll come back with no friends and not know anyone in the year of the course that would have already bonded together. I wouldn't have anyone to live with either.

I'm thinking about just sticking through it for the next year and a half until i get my year in industry where i can move back home and then live alone or with some different friends in year 4.

208,"A little background: My husband has dreamed of being a college professor for years, and finally left adjunct hell to begin a tenure track position this year. He started teaching at the beginning of the fall semester.

We had to move, as the university he is with now is in a large city, and when we learned we couldn't afford to live in the city, we looked in the suburbs, and found a small, sleepy town with a population &lt;500 people, and moved there.

I got a job at an office in one of the other suburbs, and learned that a couple of my coworkers lived in my town. One of them was going to be one of my direct reports, the other was a woman in HR who I rarely spoke to. 

The guy who reported directly to me had a weird medical condition, which made him sweat a LOT. He had his own office (because even though he came in freshly showered, he'd stink of BO by the end of the day), and generally avoided others. But i couldn't avoid him, and the way he, and his office, smelled drove me insane. It may have been wrong, but I looked for, and found, a reason to let him go. I went to HR, and the woman I spoke to told me I'd have to run it by the HR lady from our town. Said HR lady gave me a strange look when I said I was firing him for improperly filing paperwork, and asked if I'd attempted to retrain him. I held my ground, and finally she told me if I wanted to fire him that was within my purview, but she would make note that she thought the firing was groundless to corporate. Whatever, I got rid of the guy.

A month goes by, and I'm eating lunch in the little cafeteria our office has, and the HR lady from our town walks up to me, and says ""You have something on your cheek."" and taps her cheek. I check, there's nothing there, but she just mentions I should see a doctor, and walks away. I mentioned it to my husband that night, and he said he didn't see anything either, but the next morning I had this super nasty boil there, and had to have a doctor take care of it. I still have a tiny scar.

A few weeks after that, on a Saturday, I was sitting on my porch, and HR Lady was walking down the street (she lives a few streets over).  She stopped, said hi, and asked if I'd had my car checked out yet. I asked what she meant, and she mentioned my car was making a ""funny noise"" when I was leaving the office earlier that week, and she was worried something might happen. I told her my car was fine, and she went on her way. 

My neighbor came over as soon as she'd left our street, and asked what I'd done to piss her off. I asked my neighbor what she meant. Apparently, this girl grew up in the town, and the general consensus is that she's a witch. Like, full on cursing people and making potions kind of witch. I laughed out loud, but my neighbor told me all about how she's helped the town, and how this woman is apparently also a midwife or something? We sat and talked for a while, and this is when i learned that the BO guy from work was HR witch lady's husband. I just kind of laughed it off, but the Neighbor told me I should make amends before things got worse.

The next morning, on the way to church, my car threw a rod.

At that point I just chalked it up to coincidence, but since then the following has happened:

-She warned me about a 'strange man' lurking around my house, my home was broken into within a week while she and her husband were out of town.
-She warned me she'd heard about a food recall, and she knew how we liked chicken, so we should be careful. My husband got salmonella a few weeks later.
-Leaving work during a bad thunderstorm, she warned me that lightning is dangerous, so I should park in my garage, and not run into my house from outside. As I was running into the house a bolt of lightning struck a tree a few houses down the street from me. I noticed she was standing across the street, watching me.

My other neighbors have all said the same thing the first did: this woman is a very powerful witch and you should not cross her. I know, academically, it's absolute bullshit. When I asked her about it, directly, she laughed and told me not to be ridiculous.  But I'm starting to believe them, and I feel like I'm going insane. I can't think of a reasonable explanation for this string of coincidences in 6 months!

Please talk some sense into me, because I'm very anxious going into work now, knowing she'll be there, because I'm starting to fall into this small town mass hysteria.",27Jan2018,53

once i graduate and have another bad suicidal episode, instead of almost going through with it, i'm thinking about packing a suitcase full of things and jumping on a greyhound and leaving to explore. preferably california because god damn i love the sun shine.
I have always been very independant so I am sure i can just go on craigslist and find a roommate and crash in someone's house for like 350 a month about. I have enough and then just find work once i'm settled in.

After many attempts of her trying to come up and visit him, she finally came last Saturday. I was totally fine with them hanging out. Anyways, once I showed up it was a weird situation. They didn't say a word to me. She brought her sister with her, and they mostly just talked to themselves. What was weird about this though, was that they were drinking Patrón the whole night. I would at least think they would be talkative more than they were? Once I started trying to make small talk with her, she didn't even look at me or even answer the question in a timely manner.

228,"I'm a girl, senior in high school. 

I had instagram in middle school, and but I stopped posting on it in 8th grade. Then during freshman year I stopped looking at it, and eventually I deleted the app from my phone. Then last year I went and deleted my account. I didn't regret it until right now. I kind of want an instagram again because I have things I would like to post and I also don't want to graduate high school without having a way to contact the people from high school that I won't stay in contact with through texting and all that. What if, in 2 years, I really want to get in touch with a certain person who I wasn't super close with- I won't have them on instagram so there will be no way to see what they're up to or message them. I also regret not having snapchat, because I feel like people start romantic ""things"" on snapchat, like that's how relationships start now. And maybe me never making one is why I literally talk to no boys and I'm so lonely. 

I am really upset by this all of a sudden and I wish I wasn't. Before I was really glad I didn't have social media because when I did have instagram it made me kind of depressed to see other people hanging out without me and comparing their fun lives to mine. It made me feel free and all that, and I was a little bit proud that I didn't rely on it like everyone else did. But now I kind of feel disconnected to everyone and I think I did it to myself. Social media is how the world works now and I feel dumb for taking myself out of that world. 

I have a snapchat but I have like 2 people added on there and they're my close friends, and even they never snap me because they know I don't really use it. Is there any way I can suddenly start using it without it seeming weird? How do I even go about adding people on snapchat? Some people I know pop up on suggested people to add so I could add them that way, but is that weird? Would it be weird for me to randomly add them without asking them in person first? And would I snap them first or would they snap me first?

Just for context, I'm shy and awkward and I talk to some people but everyone has this pre-conceived idea of me that I don't do anything or don't like anything, I don't know. It's kind of annoying but also kind of true. I just feel so sad because I feel like I wasted my years in high school and I wish I had more friends and had more fun and I cant' believe I've never even been friends with one boy. I don't know why but I'm literally crying right now just thinking about this.

Anyway, as far as Instagram goes, I know more about how that works because I have had one before, but I feel like it would be really weird for me to make one now. People probably remember that I had one before and deleted it so I think I'll look stupid. Also everyone made their instagrams in like 6th grade so I'll look like a loser. And I'll probably end up with like 50 followers and look like a total loser. Idk. I feel like now people just have instagrams to have them since they made them so long ago, and I will look stupid for randomly wanting one. I probably won't even post on it, like, ever.

Sorry this was so long, I think this sadness is coming from a combination of things and it's just manifesting itself in this social media thing. I don't know. But my questions still stand, so any advice would be appreciated. Thank you so much. ",27Jan2018,1

232,"So here is my issue.

I am currently a 5th year student at a university. All of my friends graduated last year and moved away from the college town I still live in to the city. My two best friends and ex roommates live there too.

I can still go visit them, but it's a major pain. It's like 45 minutes away and I have a dog. So it makes it really hard. I can't go out and drink with them on the weekends because that is incredibly irresponsible if I leave my dog alone like that because there would be no way I'd drive home. So she would be stuck in an apartment until the next day. That is borderline abuse so I will never do that. I also couldn't uber home because I've checked and it's at least a 30 dollar uber when it's not a surge. But it's usually around 100 when it is a surge. I also don't want to pay 25 dollars to put her in a kennel to see my friends.

They also have the same issue coming where I live, minus the dog scenario. But they also have expressed that they don't really want to be coming here all that often since they lived in my town for 4 years in college. I respect that.

They also work different schedules than me. Since they have ""real world jobs"" they work 9-5 and have weekends off. Since I am a college student, my job is working in a restaurant. I usually work weekday nights and the weekends.

So that really isolates me from them.

So now I need to try and find friends here I can hang out with and it's really hard. I don't know how to find a new friend group since I've always hung around with my normal group of friends that are now gone. So I don't know how to get my self acquainted with new people and it's really stressing me out.

I don't want to go to bars or anything because I don't freaking know anyone anymore. I'd feel like a total loser going to the bars by myself. So I always just stay home and play video games. I hate doin that. Especially by myself. Whem i had roommates we would play games together and stuff. I like hanging out with people, but i have jo one to hang out with.

I feel like it's too late to try and make friends in my apartment complex. I've already lived here for 5 months. It would be weird to hang out with people. By now they probably think I'm some.weird shut in. I'm not. I just don't know what to do.

I do have a pretty good friend (from a while ago) that lives in my town, but we haven't talked in forever so I don't know where we stand.

I also really want a girlfriend. But I am again in the same scenario. I would love to find a girlfriend,but I'm all worried that she would think I'm weird because I have no one to hang out with other than her. I've tried hanging out with my restaurant co-workers. But many of them already had a pretty established group and I feel super awkward because they are SUPER CLOSE. Also some of them I DO NOT vibe with at all. They are too crazy (partying) for my taste. I used to be all about partying and doing drugs and all that,but I've grown out of it. I haven't had a girlfriend since my freshman year where I got cheated on. So now too paranoid to get in a relationship even though I really want one. I absolutely hate using tinder or things of that sort. I'm an old fashioned person and can't find anyone similar. I don't know where is even look to find a girl i'd vibe with. 

That's also another issue. Being in a college town, that's what a lot of people do. I used to be that person, but im not. I like to go out maybe once a week on a Friday or Saturday night, but I can't party anymore like everyone else here. I've grown out of it

I used to he a social butterfly,but now I'm petrified to talk to people because I've never been without a group of friends. I have.like no one now and it's really getting to me.

Sorry if this is all over the place. But I am yet again just sitting on my couch doing nothing because I don't know where to go, what to do because I HAVE NO FRIENDS TO HANG OUT WITH.

If anyone has advice for how to get new friendships going or how to go about combating loneliness it would be greatly appreciated ",27Jan2018,2

I work at a stadium and I manage a stand  (the biggest one and I magange between 9-13 employees at a time) I run the stand with other ""stand leads""(technical job name). Above me I have three supervisors one girl who is office administrative, and two boys who are sposta interact with us (me and 4 other stand leads) although the girl (lets call her b) is the one who supports us. Our work is fast past and works as a pyramid. The two boys (j and c ) are slackers...oh well I am too. Although I have had issues with C, his advice is mean, he is rude, I think he liked me and took it out on me until he thought my boyfriend was cool and now just doesn't talk to me (idgaf). I get complaints from my employees constantly (who are 85% female). He is truly a dick who should not have interactions with anybody. I got a girl a promotion to stand lead and now works with me. He has been rude af, to her, not including her, and treating her like a second rate citizen..She isn't having it and is thinking about quitting an hour in the shift. B has been trying her best to handle the situation and there undermining her, trying to get her in trouble any way possible. I'm about fed up with him, and how he manipulates hes higher ups and others thinking where the issue when there not manning up to their mistakes. 
I want him to stop, I want my employees to have a good day and not deal with him, and I want to keep my co-manager. What should I do thats not petty as fuck...

It also doesn't help if an employee has an issue with me, there (j and c) are the one who are sposta handle it.

(look for asshole examples below, I can go on forever)

(Ex1) I asked for keys to put some dishes in the cooler, got told to fuck off. Thinking it was a joke I waited for a fallow up comment. I said ""fuck it, its your problem now"". After getting asked about it, I said what i got told... A co-worker Snapped the fuck out on them(j and c) for doing that. 

(ex2) asked for advice on dealing with some employees personality, Got told to act like a bitch, nobody's emotions matters. 

(ex3) Seen him cuss out an employee asking about when pretzels will be done. (this has happened many times, only seen it happen once)

(ex4) He told me many times that He will not give gratitude for a job well done to anybody, and tells us to do the same...

(ex5) Told me he hides in the sweets, Steals liquor when doing walk arounds, Iv caught him up on stealing my shit THAT HE WOULD YELL AT ME ABOUT WHEN MY NUMBERS ARE OFF. I have also caught him up flirting with staff and favors the bars (that need 75% less tlc than I) because the bar tenders take it and he makes them feel special (Idgaf get pussy dont be an ass to me )

TL;DR Hes an ass hat and treating everyone like dick, We got a new boss and there filling his head with shit, because they sucked up to the old boss. My employees are done and my co-manager is PISSED! What should I do to either get him fired or show him what he's doing. Because its not just me feeling the pain its every one of us.

245,"Hey r/advice,
(I'm from Massachusetts, USA btw)
I'm in a pretty sticky situation at this point. My Dad is constantly reminding me that I need to reestablish relations with my mother. If not I guess my family is not going to be able to afford my college education.

They are divorced, up until August 2016 I lived with both parents equally. That is until I was forced to leave.

The story starts in March 2016. I had too Guinea Pigs at the time. And she got mad at me that I wasn't cleaning their cage at the time. She went over, brought their cage and dropped them off at my Dad's driveway. She said it was his turn to pay for them even though she was the one that brought them and everything for them. I'm 90% sure she expected him to get rid of them and treated it as a way for her to not seem like the bad guy. My dad however, did not do that. He's better than that. I've had them since 6th grade and he understands what they mean to me.

A few days before she kicked me out, she took my siblings and I on ""vacation"" out to the Cape. It was kind of a spur of the moment sort of thing. She hadn't taken us on vacation that year yet even though my father had and she felt inferior. She spent about 3 hours trying to find a place to stay for the night while we were out and eventually gave up. I tried to explain to her that vacations need planning ahead of time but eventually she got agitated. She said that my siblings and I made her want to ""check out sometimes"", an obvious euthanism for suicide.

Two days later, I confronted her about this. I said that it was not right that she was feeling that way and that she needed to seek psychological help.  She responded by yelling at me and so I went up to my room so she could cool off. 

About ten minutes later, she followed me up and said that she was cutting my phone service off because I didn't have a job. We had talked about me getting a summer job but then re-negotiated because I was only home for about one week of July. We went to the grocery store the month of August and I was hired. I said I would pay back whatever my phone bill was after I started working but she said that it didn't matter. 

She then proceeded to tell me that I was not allowed access to the $400 I had in my bank account until I started working (she promised me access to this money saying if I opened a bank account with my father, he would never do so). 

She went away after this. I started to put some off my stuff outside (a container with most of the clothes I had there, my PC, my chargers, etc). After reading myself in this way, I told her that it was not right that she was taking access to my money away and that she could pay for my phone bill with the $400 or wait till I made my first pay check the next week. I told her that I did not feel safe over her house and that I was going to go to my dad's for a while.

She responded by telling me to get out of the house in a threatening manner. And so I did. Unbeknownst to her, almost all of my stuff was already out of the house. She saw it and realized what I was doing but it was too late at that point, I was gone.

With my Dad I recovered my money, put it into another bank account that I made along with him, and got my cell phone bill paid for the month. 

Away from my mother, I started to think about how she treated me growing up. How she would use being at my dad's house as a punishment. How she made fun of my body. How she tried to get my dad put into jail for ""hitting her"" despite the fact that it never happened. I decided that there was no way I could possibly go back.

She had talked about going on a trip to Ireland last summer. And I said that I might go in order to try to fix things with her. She said that if I didn't live over her house, that I would not be part of her family.

I refused to go, she gave my room and all of my unclaimed possessions to my brother and that was that. Or at least so I thought.

It's been a year and a half at this point. I haven't said a word to her in half a year. Every few days my dad keeps telling me I need to establish a surface level relationship with her. We have to pay a certain amount for college to go to the one I want to go to but she has said that she has no obligation to if I don't want anything to do with her. I have told my dad that she will never see me again if she does not support me and that's about where I'm at.

I told my Dad I'd rather go to a state school and pay my own way through rather than see her again at this point and my dad says that I'm being irrational because my brain is undeveloped.

**TLDR: my Dad is putting pressure on me to reestablish relations with my emotionally abusive mother**

Any advice on what to do is greatly appreciated.

Thank you",27Jan2018,2

Now, he loves ciphers. I can’t think of their names, but he enjoys playing those games where you got to a website and have to solve a puzzle to progress whether that’s looking at the source code or figuring out a cipher. 

So I’m buying him this puzzle box. Once, he gets that open, he’ll find a flash drive. On the flash drive there will be a password protected folder and a text file. The text file is just me rambling and some nice quotes. Then there will be a riddle to solve to get the password for the folder. The folder will just be a collection of our pictures together and a playlist for him.

I’d like to encode the text with a cipher to add an extra step. However, my cipher knowledge is limited at best. I want to avoid ones that are easy like rot13, vigenere, etc. but that is the wealth of my knowledge.

251,"I'm depressed as hell. I have been dealing with persistent depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts since my early teen years. I'm a single father, and at the moment I'm literally only existing for the benefit of my children. I do play an active role in their lives and I don't want them to go through the pain of losing their father to suicide so I chug along every day, going to a job that I don't care about, engaging in the same shallow water cooler talk with the same acquaintances that I have no interest in seeing, and maintaining a depressingly empty house that I don't care about.

I'm starting to think a lot about what I'm going to do when the kids are grown. I've only got about another decade before they reach adulthood, and the years seem to fly by anymore. Right now my future looks even more empty and meaningless than my current existence. I'm likely a confirmed bachelor at this point because every time I try dating it ends miserably. I've pretty much given up on dating all-together as I don't think I'll ever meet someone that I want to be with on a daily basis. My career goals are dead as well. I'll probably never be able to retire anyway as I'm thirty, I don't have a dime saved, I only make a little over minimum wage, and I simply don't care enough about money to keep pushing up the ladder. I'm quite comfortable with getting by on very little, and I have enough income to support my kids and keep them happy when they are staying with me.

I like the idea of getting out and travelling to other cultures. I also love the idea of doing humanitarian work, particularly work that involves teaching or helping children, but any kind of humanitarian work sounds interesting. I've found over the years that the only time I'm happy is when I'm committing myself fully towards something that I passionately care about. I'm starting to think abroad missionary-like humanitarian work could be a potential path that could give my life meaning in the future. Also, I've taken up an almost obsessive interest in foreign languages as a hobby over the last few months which is part of the reason I've started to think of abroad programs. I'm sure being bi-lingual would be an asset, and it would give more purpose to my language studies. I'm a committed atheist and from what I've seen most missionary work comes in the form of religious proselytizing, but I know some secular organizations exist. Actually the organization doesn't have to be secular, I'm just not interested in proselytizing or teaching religion.

Does anyone have any experience with programs like this? How do these organizations tend to work? From my understanding, these organizations usually handle all travel expenses, living arrangements, and meals while you are on a mission. Is that correct?

Every weekend a group of friends and I always get together and play videogames. We're all freshman in college and we've made a pretty solid friend group. But there's one guy in the group that I just can't click with. He's a complete asshole. He has an enormous ego, he bullies us, and takes the videogame way too seriously. I've given him so many chances but I can't make it work. We're just not compatible and having him around makes nights unenjoyable.

Based on social cues I know he doesn't like me and I think he knows I don't like him. So there's some friction starting to form between us. I'm speculating that there's a couple of guys in the group that doesn't like him either but it's too hard for me to tell. 

I've had similar situations like this in highschool and they never ended well. I always had to leave the group entirely and find new friends. 

I don't want to just kick him out and be seen as the bad guy but I'm just tired of being around him. It also could be me. Maybe I'm not being accepting enough or need to take a joke?

So I would only have 3-4 hours of free time every day. Added onto that, I hated my job, and I tried to learn math in my free time after work, so I didn't socialize much on weekdays.

But now I'm in graduate school. I live on-campus, so I have a 3 minute commute instead of a one hour commute, and I still only really need to work 8-9 hours a day. So now I have... 17-9 = 8 hours of free time a day.

263,"I’m seriously scratching the bottom of the barrel here. I’ve literally just made this account and don’t really know what I’m doing but here goes nothing.

So I’m in my 1st year in college. I’m completely alone in college, I haven’t made any true friends, just “acquaintances”, If I could even call them that(Not that there’s anything wrong with the people in my course, I just don’t connect with them in any sort of way that resembles the friendships I have with my other friends from high school)all my friends are about a 20 minutes bus journey away in an other college so it isn’t TOO bad. So I see my friends a couple of times a week which is great, I get to go out with them on nights out whenever we go out and I love that part of college. However, I am obsessively homesick. I’m living away from home for the first time, in a house of complete strangers. I’ve tried getting along with my housemates, one is a couple years older than me, he’s a good guy but spends a lot of time out of the house, the other is very arrogant and ignorant (both me and the other housemate see this) for example, he will just blatantly ignore us when speaking to him.I get choked up when I think of Home when I’m alone, however when I’m with my friends during the evenings and on nights out it gives me respite from this. However, with the cost of transport to see my friends (buses during the day, cabs at night) it’s just not possible financially to see them everyday, so that’s pretty much saying that there’s days in the week where I’m 100% going to be miserable. I’ve thought about this for a long time and the more I think about it, the more I want to dropout. I’m doing fine in college in terms of grades, I’ve been doing well in exams and assignments etc, so it’s not an issue of me being lazy/ not working in college. BUT, as I’ve been thinking more and more, I’m realizing that I literally don’t give a fuck about my course. As a matter of fact, the other day I sat down and just took an hour or 2 to myself to think and I just put it simply with this question: “What am I going to miss about college if I were to dropout?” Well I’d miss seeing my friends, I’d miss going on nights out once or twice a week, I’d miss the accessibility of the city (I live in a very remote area, not very much there other than my family) But would I miss college? Nope.  I don’t think so anyway.The only thing that gets me up at 8:00AM for lectures most mornings is the fact that it’d literally kill me to think that back home my parents are literally working so hard to fund my education and for me to waste it. That’s my only motivation at the moment. I know for a fact that if I did dropout my parents would support me no matter what, and they’ve also noticed a change in my general mood. They’re worried about me, they always ask if there’s something wrong and that I’m not as happy as I used to be,sometimes even mentioning  “depression”(I would never say I’m depressed, simply because I don’t know what it’s like to be depressed and would almost feel like I’m insulting others who are 100% worse off than me)but I always try brush it off and tell them I’m fine and try put on a front that I’m enjoying life, when in fact I’m feeling down most of the time. It kills me to think that they’re constantly worrying about me too so I’m also carrying some guilt with me. I feel so alone and haven’t talked to anyone about my struggles. I feel weak if I do. All of my friends from my high school all seem to be loving college life, making friends and enjoying their respective courses, whereas I feel I’m missing out. I just don’t know what to do, I’ve been struggling with this for months and after being at home for Christmas with my family for a month, going back to college has hit me so hard and I’m more down than ever and it’s really beginning to show in everything I do, I just don’t want to be this way anymore.

Tldr at the bottom sums it up but ..

I recently just turned 18, but I still don't have my license (still on my permit lol) so my mom obviously has to know when I want to see a doctor, since she's my ride.

Anyways, kinda tmi, but I recently discovered a deep cyst/boil/bump, kind of inner butt cheek. It hurts when I touch it and I told my mom about it, that I need to get it checked at the doctor.

She started asking me to see it. I told her no. She then started demanding. I told her she doesn't *need* to see it so why would she. After like 20 No's, she gave up but started yelling at me and swearing and saying stuff like ""how a mother's own daughter won't let her see"" ""I'm your mother"" ""daughters aren't supposed to embarrassed from their moms"" Like tf?? Is it normal for mothers to look at their daughters' privates? Just because she's my mother doesn't mean she gets an all exclusive pass to the sights of my body.

This isn't the first time she does this. She gets mad when I refuse to change my shirt or pants in front of her (I don't like people seeing me in my underwear).

Why does she take shit like this so personally? Is it normal? Do mothers really expect their daughters to have no boundaries with them when it comes to their bodies? 

Tldr; I need to go to the doctor because I have a cyst on my butt and my mom took it personally and is offended because I refused to show her it.",27Jan2018,2
269,"Esperanto has had a sort of political agenda tied to it of not being politically/culturally affiliated with a country so it becomes something with a culture itself. That's how I read about it anyway. In the past it had a lot of sensationalist backlash.

In my area free Esperanto lessons are offered for beginners; I thought it would be a great idea to try something new and maybe branch out to meet new people. I am a bit suspicious though because I'm not sure it is good for me to hang out with people who may have similar views to each other, like an echo chamber possibly. Possibly free sounds too good to be true, like I'm a tiny bit concerned that it is like this. If you go to the party meetings for the cookies you are kidding yourself; is it the same for esperanto?

At the moment, I don't think so but thought I should check up with some random folks (you guys). There seems to be a lot of backlash over esperanto because of historical connotations and the 'unnecessary' nature of it being a constructed language. I am more interested because the thought of knowing esperanto made me chuckle plus it might be fun.",27Jan2018,4
270,"I'm not sure what they think of me, whether they think of me as a friend or not. But...I think that it may be better to tell them, in case I do do it, and to explain why I may have suddenly dropped off the face of the earth, lol. 

Err, yesterday night, I felt I was very close to. And if I had, then what if they thought I was ignoring them or ghosted? I know that for me, it would hurt me a lot to be. 

Edit:
I'm also thinking of maybe just not talking to anybody for a couple weeks (up to a month or 2. And so I would let them know about that too.",27Jan2018,2
271,"Okay so some background, I’m a finance major and I’m applying for my first job at a big firm. Naturally I’m going to be drug tested. One of my three other roommates smokes weed a lot in his room. It’s never really bothered me, but Its pretty obvious when he does it and the smell is strong. My first question, will this come up on my drug test? I don’t believe it will, but I’m just not entirely sure. If there’s a chance it does, how can I minimize the odds of it coming up?

273,"I currently attend community college and am in a number of seated and online classes. I struggle to motivate myself and focus whenever I'm at home or outside of class. Often times I end up missing assignments because I will start them and never return until after the due date has already passed.

I have friends who have prescriptions for ADHD, and some have let me try some of their medication after hearing about my struggle.

The meds have worked wonders and I've been able to focus and become invested in/proud of my work, but the supply is dangerously limited and I feel weird ducking the law so casually.

I truly believe that a prescription would be in my best interest should I like to secure a proper future and secondary or even post-secondary education.

I made a copy of the test my brother took at home to assess his attention issues (printed by our mother, a neuropsychologist). After taking the test, the results clearly stated that I suffer from ADHD.

~~Reddit, what do you think is the best course of action to go about convincing my parents that amphetamines would help me secure a proper future and education?~~

274,"So i'm super shy, diagnosed and medicated for social anxiety and depression for a relatively short time, so I don't feel like it's working well so far. Most of my friends left town to go to uni, i stayed and am going to uni here, but I haven't really met anyone there, especially not people to go out with.

What does someone like me do when trying to go out alone and be sociable? Is it ""too weird"" to go to the club alone? How the hell do I strike up a conversation with people? And prevent just standing around alone until I leave? I went to a bar alone recently but did literally nothing but spend money there, I really don't know what to do.

Thanks in advance.

276,"So I’m going to try to make this short but basically I moved to a new state last summer and I’ve been trying to find a band to play with. I heard of this guy through a friend and we started talking about hanging out and possibly me joining his band. Once I met him he seemed super down with playing with me which is awesome. He gave me what I needed to start learning his songs so I started practicing he told me if I had questions to text him so I did. That was a week ago. He just posted to Instagram yesterday saying he had a show coming up so I texted him last night and told him good luck and asked him when he wants to practice next at this point I have texted him twice with no reply. Today, the day of his show, he posted another Instagram picture. Am I crazy or is he ignoring me? Or am I being too clingy? I need answers.

Hopefully someone reads this and can help me out I’d really appreciate it. Thank you!!!!",27Jan2018,3

280,"I've seen questions regarding how to LOOK busy when you really aren't, but I wanted to ask the opposite!

I am a very busy person and I have recently noticed that people have been acknowledging how busy of a person I am... I understand that I shouldn't really care about what other people think, but I don't want to appear busy because people start labeling me as some kind of ""overachiever"" when I really don't think I am. I wanted to ask how not to appear busy, e.g. when talking to someone, maybe I should direct the conversation towards the other person's life rather than talk about my own busy schedule?",27Jan2018,2
282,"I don’t know. I mean not like talking back with bad words. I grew up with my parents and the old style of discipline (get hit by a belt and what not whenever I misbehaved). I grew up just fine, I’m 19 in college and we all live together. There are times however, when there might be an argument arising, such as when I started dating, when I got bad grades in high school, etc. 

Every time I would get a talk by my dad and it instantly made/makes me feel weak and gets my eyes watery. This happens every time I try to “talk back to him” and defend my position. This only happens with him, not even with my sisters or my mom. I think it is just because he was the figure of discipline in the house. I know my parents love me and I love them, but although I’m more grown up now I just can’t do that with him. 

Is there any advice to help overcome this or is it normal?",27Jan2018,4

288,"Last night me and my boyfriend were out having drinks, and managed to close the bars down. We were waiting for an Uber to come pick us up, and some hulking African American male came up to to us, and asked us if we wanted to buy shirts that were printed with “Fuck You, Donald” on the front. BF tried to just brushed him off, but the guy kept escalating, trying to find a fight, and just kept shouting things like: “you racist, bro!?” “Redneck mother fucker, you’re a disgrace!” And even said that my BF needs to be “iced” (I’m not sure what that slang means, tbh, do I want to know?). 
BF tried to avoid escalating the altercation, and kept saying “sorry you feel that way, sir, have a nice night.” By the time the Uber driver arrived, my BF took a vicious punch to the cheek, and got kicked twice in the ribs, thankfully the fight was broken up quickly by a bouncer who just clocked out. 
Today he’s been sluggish whenever he tries to walk, and his face looks really bad. How do I convince him to see a doctor? It really hurts to see him like this, I just want what’s best for him. ",27Jan2018,0

300,"I’ve been friends with this girl for over ten years. We were our first best friends. We ended up going to different schools throughout high school and college, but we never drifted too far. 
Yesterday, she turned 21. She was coming into town to go to a local bar, but I’m not of age yet. She told me I could come, but I figured she was just going to be there with her boyfriend and other friends who are 21. I didn’t want to sit there drinking a Sprite while they all got drunk, so I let her enjoy her evening. I figured she would celebrate later again anyway (which she is.) 
Today, she posts on her Snapchat story her and all our mutual friends (underage friends) drinking and having fun over in one of our friends apartments. I was not invited. I got her a gift and was ready to celebrate with her. I’m pretty disappointed, hurt, and feeling lame as usual. 
This has been a common theme for the past couple of years. She hangs with a select group of about 5 or 6 people who I’ve known longer than her. I don’t really get invited to anything at all, only once in a blue moon. She sometimes tries to hang out with me when she comes into town from college. 
Is it time to take a huge step back from this friendship? I don’t feel appreciated and I feel the effort is not there. Any advice? ",27Jan2018,2
