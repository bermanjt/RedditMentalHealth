0,"Ever since this shooting in Florida, it made me realize that one of the people I know has unsettling tendencies that I think should be made aware to some authority figure. He makes a lot of suicide and mass-shooting ""jokes"", constantly says ""I want to die"" in our physics class in a really monotone way, and is generally a very pessimistic person that doesn't have much sympathy or empathy for others. All of this is moderately concerning, but what really set off a red flag is that he's already been to juvenile detention several years ago right after Newtown for posting on Facebook this:

""If I read one more goddamn post about Newtown, maybe I'll make *Insert his high school here* another Newtown."" 

To him, he was joking, but it was enough for the authorities to consider putting him into a detention center (albeit only for about a week). The news video on this is actually still on YouTube, but he still talks the same way he did in that post. I don't know if I'm overreacting, but I'd rather overreact than brush this off. Can someone tell me who I could inform about this or anything else I should do? Or should I honestly not inform this and I'm just being crazy? Thank you. For clarification we are in university.",16Feb2018,2
3,"Here's the situation, my job offers 16 weeks paid parental leave if you're ""the primary caregiver"" which they have a very loose definition, it isn't gender specific and you don't have any to prove anything just say that's the leave you need to take.  The other option is 1 month leave that you can take anytime in the calendar year.  
I want to take the 16 week leave obviously but my wife who is a very honest person has her own definition of primary caregiver and says I shouldn't take it off and just do the month of leave. This is point of contention because according to my work's HR definition of primary caregiver I feel qualifies me for the 16 week, but my wife's definition doesn't qualify me.  What should I do?",16Feb2018,1
4,"WARNING: This is a long post even after I tried to make this as short and concise as possible. While reading, I ask is there anything else I can be doing to set myself up to be successful in this situation? With that being said:

I'm a 22 y/o immigrant in the US under TPS (temporary protective status). I have about a year and a half left (July 2019) of my TPS which provides work authorization and a driver's license. From July 2017 to January of this year I was unable to work due to a hiccup with my immigration status.

I was originally planning on joining the military out of high school. Which didn't pan out because I'm not a US Resident. I also decided that college wasn't worth it because I'd have to pay for everything out of pocket (which in the end I believe was a mistake on my part).

The TPS ending is a whole problem in and of itself. I have been in the US since I was 5 months old so I have no idea if I'll go back to my 'home country' or attempt to immigrate elsewhere.

I am now basically flat broke with no form of transportation. I recently picked up a bussing job at a restaurant that's certainly too far to walk but I manage between getting rides from people and the bus. I hate it, but I'm trying to just do it long enough to get my hands on a motorcycle (from what I can figure out it's just a more cost-efficient way to travel).

I also have set aside a little bit of money for the Apple Care Certification training. Ideally having that would give me a step up from having to work dead end jobs to something that isn't as miserable and also give me that same step up if I do choose to immigrate elsewhere.

To repeat what my question: Is there anything else I could be doing to turn out successful in this situation? Defining success in this case as being prepared for potentially having to start somewhere else completely over?

PS: This post may have been all over the place. But if you even just take the time to read it, thank you.

5,"I love my boyfriend. We have been in a long distance relationship for a little over a year and get to see each other every 3-4 months. We live in different countries and have an 8 hour time difference so we don’t always get to talk everyday. We were best friends before we fell in love and I can’t imagine not having him in my life.

I’ve never felt as comfortable around anyone as I do around him. I think we both have very low self worth, but with the love we give each other we have slowly helped each other learn that we are worthy of loving ourselves. He is the main reason I feel comfortable and confident in my skin.

He is not my ""perfect guy"", but I really do think he is my guy. He didn’t grow up with any of the opportunities and luxuries I did, but everyday he does things to show me that he is working more and more to improve himself for me so we can eventually have as stable life together.

Lately, something he told me about his past keeps popping up in my head. He told me that he used to struggle with pedophillic intrusive thoughts due to sexual abuse he suffered as a child himself. There is something I saw in the news recently that triggered it that was vaguely connected to this. It’s almost like I am intentionally saying ""don’t think about it” which makes me think about it more. It’s not something pleasant and I rather not think about it, but for some reason it keeps appearing in my mind.

We have had discussions about it and he is open to talk to me about it with me when I ask, which tells me, like he has said, that it’s something in his past that will never be involved in his future. I feel deep down the that he is telling me the complete truth and will keep this promise.

I really don’t want it to get in the way of our future. I love him. He makes me feel like I am this incredible person and this has honestly helped me believe in myself for the first time in my life. Being around him makes me feel like I belong. And I think (and deep down I know) I make him feel the same way.

I do have my occasional doubts about whether it is worth it to stay in the relationship or not, but I think it’s due to being so far apart and apart for so long. Long distance relationships are not easy. And it’s easy for me to forget how he makes me feel after a few months of being apart (when we are only seeing each other through a screen). But I know when I see him I am going to feel amazing again and feel like I belong again.

I am also an easy depressive, it is the dead of winter, and I am in a very rigorous school program so I feel like my doubt and bad feelings could be related to my current circumstances and stress that I am already having. I also easily stress out about things when I am already stressed about something else.

How do I get past this one thing from his past that will never actually effect me, but may just lurk in my head? Are there practices or exercises I can do to get past this? I want to fully have my over analyzing mind believe what I truly know in my heart.

Thanks for the advice.",16Feb2018,2
6,"Hi, my boyfriend of 1 year made me delete all my male contacts on my snapchat account (I used to cam with some of these guys (before we dated) but I had two who were actual friends that I never did anything sexual with but he also made me delete them) I get him wanting me to delete the contacts, I completely understand (I stopped using snapchat and re-downloaded the app to send funny photos to him when we started dating) is why I never deleted the contacts before. He has a facebook and has around 300 friends on there that he says he doesn't talk with but a majority of them are girls and It feels somewhat unfair that he made me delete my male contacts and he gets to keep all his female contacts (I don't want him to delete them I kind of just want to rant a bit right now). Also this one time we were talking about having a threesome with someone in the future and he suggested we have it with his ex-girlfriend because ""I know she likes to have threesomes"" he stated but I wanted to know how he knew that because he told me he never had sex with anyone before me, it also bugs me that he goes to house parties with around just 6 people there and two or one of his ex-girlfriends are always there because the girls are apart of his friends group which is fine but it makes me nervouse that he thought about having a threesome with her and me and gets drunk with them and I'm scared he'll act on his feelings that he says he doesn't have but I'm scared he does have sexual feelings towards the girls.

7,"I don’t know what to do about the gifts he gives me. I’m extremely grateful, but I don’t want to seem like a brat either. Valentine’s Day I got a “Louis Vuitton” phone case but I am 99% sure it’s fake.  For my birthday I got a “Burberry” perfume that doesn’t exist to my knowledge. I’m not one to care about brands, but if something is counterfeit, I don’t believe in using it either.

8,"I dont have any friends and decided to go to college this semester since the disaster I had 2 years ago. I dont really talk to anybody and lack confidence talking to anybody. My sister says I think too realistically or over think things too much.

I was suggested to go to parties but I dont know where any of them are. 

I have trouble talking to others in starting and then continuing a conversation. I don't look visually appealing I guess. Im overweight at 5'8-5'9 188lbs male.

11,"Hello,

I'm a public school teacher who was recently hurt on the job. First, a little background...
I have worked with ""challenging"" children since 16 y/o (currently 25).
I've sustained no injuries or even had serious worries in that whole time.
I make the jump into public education.
I get certified to restrain children when they are a threat to common safety, works wonders when I use it.
My first year sucks, but I don't get injured.
Go into second year, still certified to restrain.
Everything goes fine, use restraint seldom, but 0 injuries occur, all are kept safe.
One day I get an email from the VP telling me to stop restraining students. I am told to ""get out of the way"" when they attempt to hurt me, to evacuate the room and ""let them have it""
M room is destroyed 5+ times since then (lost track).
The kids that destroyed my room are always in my room an hour later, like nothing happened.

This goes on for a month or so.

I end up giving a student a grade they didn't want (80/100).
The student starts destroying room so I follow orders and evacuate the room.
Two kids are hit with markers in the process, both uninjured thankfully.
I stand in the doorway, with 8 feet between the student and myself, to stop him from coming out and hurting others.
Student throws markers, scissors, pencils, etc, ends up hitting me with a chair from that distance.
My knee is bruised, student expelled, and the doctor says I have a contusion on my knee.
I go back a week later.
This is where I want advice...

I asked the doctor for an MRI because my knee still hurts and I deserve the proper treatment. I am denied, no matter how much I push for it. All she did was give my knee a little wiggle and said I'm fine. I refused to sign the paperwork saying I'm fine, and now I'm preparing for a shit storm when I go back into school. How do I ensure proper medical treatment? This is getting swept under the rug and I deserve better.

tl;dr - hurt in the workplace. Knee still hurts. Doctor refuses to give me an MRI. ",16Feb2018,0
12,"I used to be someone who obtained the highest possible results (97%+ in assessments) and would feel frustrated when I lost marks as I always tried to get 100%.

As I've entered university, a lot of issues in my life have been amplified. In example, my father recently had a heart attack, I've lost a pet, and a member of my household is verbally abusive - saying things such as my pet died because I didn't care. 

As you can see I have a lot of issues, but how much can these effect my studies? I understand that the academic gap between college and university is large, but does that mean I should be failing and barely scraping 40%? Or are my personal issues the cause of this? Or perhaps am I just using all of this as an excuse for poor performance? 

I also haven't been attending lectures for a while because I've been attending hospital, and I feel very demotivated with the grades I have received. 


Any form of advise regarding studying or what to do next would be very appreciated. ",16Feb2018,4
13,"For the past month she has been doing odd things. Everything ranging from leaving boxes on her lawn for no reason to thinking people are in her house with her when they aren't.

But today, she came over and was fully convinced that her mailman was sending her messages in the paper. So she showed me the paper and it was a horoscope thing about love and not being truthful. She thought it was from him, when I showed her my paper said the same thing, she said ""Well that makes it even more true he wouldn't want to get caught so he sent it to everyone.""

I then showed her the same horoscope online. She was still convinced it was him.

Now her mailman, I know him, he's a friend of mine from high school. He is married with kids and honestly sees my mother like a mother figure due to his mother abandoning him. He has no feelings for her in terms of love. He has told her this when she came to his house before thinking they were going on a date.

He has told me she has left him love letters and is apparently convinced he will leave his wife for her.

This is affecting my father very much because he still loves her and he is afraid she is going to lose it and just up and leave him without warning, they've been together for 55 years.

My father thinks she needs committed and I do to an extent but the doctors do not think she is there yet.

14,Been hearing that I will start remember everything once I start classes. Also been told I might be so lost I'll end up dropping the class. I've been going over high school math on Khan academy and feel pretty lost in some subjects. What do you all suggest? ,16Feb2018,1
16,"When I was a teenager, I thought a little too highly of myself. 

I think I over-compensated, inflating my ego to reckon with years of bullying and in-school abuse. After I graduated, I grew out of my old temper and opinions. My friends went on to medical school and graduate programs while I struggled to learn how to properly study. A long-term relationship came and went as I struggled with alcohol abuse brought on by the death of somebody close. 

Now I'm older and think I've changed. I don't think so highly of myself -- I recognize what I'm good at but am abundantly aware of my flaws. On the whole, I don't think it's an extraordinary development. Many young people seem to go through the same while transitioning into adulthood. 

My problem is this: my parents divorced when I was young, and I don't see my dad and step-mom too much. I've traveled a lot since graduating high school, am currently in my mid-twenties, and spent much of the past several years living independently in a developing country. An ex-girlfriend is from there, as are many of my acquaintances and close buddies. It's an important part of my life, albeit one I try not to discuss much with folks who aren't interested. 

For whatever reason, my dad constantly cracks ""jokes"" about how ""worldly"" I must think I am. It feels like he thinks I'm still an arrogant teenager. When we talked on the phone today, I tried telling him about a book I'd be reading and how I thought the author was fantastic. He quipped about how maybe I can win an award for writing an earth-shattering novel of my own someday before making an offhand comment about ""saving"" North Korea. 

Maybe this sounds stupid to r/advice, but it hurts me a lot. I made bad decisions growing up and wasn't a fantastic or particularly kind person. I was severely bullied throughout middle and high school. I internalized a lot of anger and tried coping by telling myself that I was ""better"" than the ""dumb kids"" who tried putting me down. Several decisions I made at that stage in my life were downright terrible. I'm ashamed of who I was then, in many ways, but I'm also not terribly young anymore -- I'm going on 26 soon. I'm graduating late but I feel like I'm an otherwise responsible person who volunteers, gives money to charity, and strives to be honest with everyone.  

I've tried telling my dad that I'm not comfortable with the jokes he keeps making about how I used to act in the past. I even broke down last year after my step-mom said she doesn't ""trust"" me because I got into legal trouble for stealing when I was 14 -- how she thinks I think I'm better than other people. She only eased up after I explained that my last girlfriend had dumped me for taking too long with school, and that I'd spent the months since our break-up feeling worthless and un-date-able. 

What can I do? I want to have a normal relationship with my dad, but I feel like an asshole whenever he makes these kinds of jokes. I don't even feel like I can talk about my friends or time overseas, since that's interpreted as ""bragging"" about being ""worldly."" A big part of my young life happened over there (first kiss, first girlfriend, learning how to drive certain kinds of vehicles, getting my first apartment, etc) but I second-guess talking about it whenever I see my dad. 

My mom doesn't act like this or treat me the same way. Even my step-dad, with whom I used to have a rough relationship, seems to respect that I work hard and am an honest guy.

Sorry for ranting and going on. But because of the nature of these relationships, I've reached a point where I no longer feel like it's ever okay to be proud of myself, or to acknowledge when I've done something well or exceptionally. My family isn't even religious but I feel like a sinner whenever I'm afflicted with a tinge of pride, either in a talent or completed project. 

tl;dr -- I used to be a stupid, angry, and arrogant kid. Sometimes I feel like my dad and step-mom still treat me like I'm that same person, even though I'm in my mid-twenties now. ",16Feb2018,1
20,"Sooo, i have the options to go to two schools for my freshman year. One has the IB program and the other has the AP Capstone program.

I get high marks in all my classes without much effort but i know high school will be much more difficult and it will be testing my limits so I want to choose the one that will help me the most.

24,"Title, and I mean list it on my resume. Edit: Also, should I be honest why I transferred?

I really screwed up at my last college, burned bridges, got expelled, told off my professor. Lost all my references. I was not in my right mind at the time. I don't know how I'll possibly be able to skirt that issue but most of my professional experience since 5-8 years ago was with that lab. It is also noted that I did undergraduate research on my transcript but just for the last semester I was there. I could probably just say I was going to but the funding fell through or something if I have to.

I'm just making sure I shouldn't list it? Cause I don't really have any professional experience since 5 years ago and I can't really use that as a reference either since I had to leave multiple semesters due to health problems.

My other option is to come back to my home city and go to the university there thats not as good but I can save a ton of money and get my degree in math and physics. I have all of my friends here but I also like not living with parents so I would move out and still have to pay rent.

Now the physics and math degree has less career paths but I've thought about becoming a high school teacher (I have done my research on this) and also theres an option of going to grad school for more specialization but this is also extremely competitive.

So if I move back I can save money and spend time with my friends and spend money on stuff I enjoy, I'll have time to go on trips with my friends and not have to spend every summer in a co-op or school, but an engineering degree is more employable and has a better outlook and pay.

Parents are incredibly religious, dad is a church minister.

Father recently got a great new job that makes him the head of everything. He has people working under him and basically has a ton of power and respect. He's an incredibly confident and driven guy who can just about do anything.

My mother on the other hand didn't have the chance to graduate in school due to poverty, lacks confidence, doesn't really have a good job and struggles to use devices such as computers.

None of this used to be a problem before but now that my father has this job, he feels that she isn't on the same level as him and it's causing problems. My mother told me that he's said things like, she is a curse to him, a burden, etc etc, saying he might leave her one day so forth and so forth.
My anger in this situation is that my mother is incredibly obedient and silent so she just soaks that shit up because she genuinely fears that situation.

The teacher (T) is known county wide for yelling at students and head earned a nickname “killer-miller” for it. 
The younger brother (B) is a high functioning autistic. He’s very well behaved and one of the most compassionate and kind kids I’ve ever met.

T then decides that he can’t leave he needs to study and begins yelling at him. She keeps this up and berates him, saying the types of things you would hear from an emotionally abusive parent. Eventually B breaks down and starts crying, he starts feeling humiliated for crying, and becomes very distraught. He is then brought to the principal where he eventually returns to classes.

49,"Tbh I’m not good at being assertive and I’m not good at saying “no”. Could use some advice on how to get this guy who’s waaayy too into me and I’ve never been into him. 

I blame myself because well there’s the back story:

About 3? 4? Years ago when I was a sophomore, he was a junior. He was this guy in my class who liked me. We started “dating” in quotes bc I really only saw him once a school day lmao. I guess I said yes to him when he asked me out because I was insecure and I have that problem of not being able to say no. I never really even saw him as attractive. I broke up w him but we remained friends. (Even tho we were practically just friends the whole time)

Now I’m a senior. we haven’t talked all my junior year because his phone was fucked up or whatever, I didn’t really give a shit. And he kept trying to hang out with me for about like 3 months and I was like “okay” since I can’t say no. But when it actually came near the day I flaked. He asked and I flaked multiple times on several different occasions. I guess he never gave up bc I’m a pretty good at pretending n i came off as sincere o whateva. Also I don’t wanna fuck with him because he still works a minimum wage job (nothing wrong with that) and doesn’t go to college. Those two together isn’t what I want to be associated with. I lowkey feel like he’s a loser. He hasn’t let me go for YEARS!!!

To be clear, we don’t talk everyday. We really just snapchat each other. He isn’t like over bearing every second but more like every week.

How do I tell his guy I don’t like him and don’t want to talk to him and shit without being rude?",16Feb2018,0

This year we were at different schools, one day at Lunch one of her friends comes up to me and delivers a message from my crush to me, “ She wanted to know why you didn’t like her, because she liked you” I froze, and couldn’t respond before a friend interrupted me and I left. I didn’t get a chance to respond because a couple days after I decided to change schools for unrelated reasons.

51,"I'm an upperclassman at a university and ever since high school, I've been fairly normal in terms of sex drive. I could masturbate once every few days and not have any issues. In this last week, I've suddenly developed a very strong desire to just hook up for sex. My urge has become really strong and I can easily masturbate two to three times a day.

54,"I’m starting to become worried about the mental health of my friend, unfortunately it’s not a mental health problem, as we need to address the underlying issues. That’s where I’m looking to conscript Reddit’s help.

My friend, X, has had a problem with her home life. She goes to school in a small town about 30 miles from where she lives. 

X’s mother and father are separated. X is currently living with her mother, step-father, and younger sister. X takes her sister to school with her everyday. X’s problems include:

1. X’s mother is regularly under the influence of pot and alcohol. She is currently unemployed because she was fired and, “Someone has to stay home to do things around the house.” Yet she only does things that immediately appear pleasing to her. All the needs around the house are fulfilled by X. X is becoming distressed about the constant responsibility while her mother is smoking her life away and not accomplishing enough to walk in a semi-linear direction.
X has no clue what to do about her mother’s habits. X feels if she does anything, she will be ostracized and split the family again. X doesn’t feel comfortable going to services about this and doesn’t particularly want her mother in the system. X needs advice on what to do.

2. This brings about other problems: She is driving on a school permit, she is old enough for a license but hasn’t went to get one because she has been driving without insurance already. Her parents refuse to add X to their insurance because this would cost ~$400 to do. 

3. X is worried about what to do with her life because no one in her family has ever went to college or ever graduated high school. Her parents are completely uncaring about her academic accomplishments, they’d rather X do things like rodeo. She is distraught over her parents unconcern and doesn’t know what to do about this.

58,"My situations a little less complicated. Or a little more depending on who you ask.

Basically I can't go out. 
I have no drivers license.
I don't go to school. (Home schooled.)
I have no job except one.
And I have no one to take me out.

To be clear I probably have people I can ask to drive me places but even then. They are very rude and dismissive, don't want to drive me places and on top of that I have no places to go. 17 btw.

I've also tried the whole online friend thing and although I know some people have really close relationships online I personally cannot make friends for the life of me beyond just pissing people off (due to some misunderstanding or realization of the political or just the other person being very sensitive.).

I think I agree with Jerry Trainor in what he says in regards to his online relationship he flew out and had which was ""Even though we were skyping and all that. When I met her she did not seem like the same person what so ever. And I just broke it off with her and went back. What I didn't realize is if you are doing skype calls or texting you are really only experiencing a small sliver of who that person really is and the rest is just when you meet them adapting to their real selfs.""


Which I can understand entirely. Like I would try to talk to friends where we had a disagreement because I thought (we're friends it doesn't matter.) And was surprised by how pathetic and immature they could be by essentially dismissing me cause I didn't like X thing they did.

For instance I criticised a counsolar friend of mine saying that she needs to reconsider what she does in counsolaing because the things she told me as advice didn't work at all. And that just to be fair and honest with her just to let her know I wanted her to know her advice wasn't helpful and there was no hard feelings.

Didn't reply. I texted her over and over again. And I said in my head ""I know how this goes."" And I said to her 'We're not friends anymore.' Instead of going ""I'm sorry to hear that :( I really liked you."" Or ""why? i really appreciated you."" She said ""Good. I don't want people who criticise me.""
Keep in mind I talked to this person for months and got advice from her.

I knew what her job was and every detail. We were friends.

Sadly most my online friendships end up like this. 
Where I'm just expressing a harmless opinion and they can't take it so they stop talking to me.

Except for a few good friends I've known for q
awhile who I never have to criticise or even when I do they accept it humbly cause they love me and vice versa.

Keep in mind this female friend would constantly give me advice on these matters. And I would accept them humbly.

Basically I guess I can make friends but it would be like probably most people on Reddit I can't get along with just cause of the stupid idiosyncrasies the people have and the constantly hypocritical nature of Reddit and its obsene focus on comment karma and its ""logic"" memeing before answering a question and the constant jokes under serious comments that are just abhorrently unfunny and terrible. (Some of you maybe like ""you make comments like this and thats why you have no online friends"" no I don't even if I did I never force anyone to accept my opinion or trap them into hearing it.)

So joining an inter-personal subreddit is out of the question.

On top of that the experiences I've had in real life with actual people in friends beyond my awkward years are actually really good. 

I'm VERY sociable and have no problem communicating and most people really like me IRL. I can make friends really easily IRL.

So how do I make more friends?

59,"I used to be so happy. I had a ton of friends &amp; my parents, while never home, were freaking amazing parents.

And then I came to college, alone, my only friend from home is my roommate. I joined a small sorority to make friends but they are small &amp; most people are already consumed w their own lives. I thought my pledge class &amp; I were close, I’m the most social out of those introverts, but they don’t really care about me.

I always have to text people first, always have to make plans. If they text me, they end up canceling. And I understand people are consumed in their own lives but it sucks never being anyone’s friend.

I was popular in high school, my friends there were the best. I still talk to them but we were always best in person, text and FaceTime don’t cut it. I had a full-ride to the school in my hometown but I chose to go to a much higher ranked university that’s further away. If I stayed home I would’ve been stuck in a rut &amp; I thought branching out would be better for life.

I’m also just lonely bc freaking V-day. It’s a scam, I’ve known this since I was a kid. But idk, yesterday, seeing all my friends with their happy relationships getting cute shit, while being insanely lonely myself really sucked. Normally, I never cared. In fact my friends never minded me being a third wheel because I’m generally good with all people. But I feel like all my college friendships are fake af. I literally put Do Not Disturb on my phone &amp; didn’t reply to anyone for 4 days but nobody even texted except my home friends.

I’m thinking of joining another org but I can only do that next year, the deadlines for everything passed. I used to love being an extrovert, it makes me happy being around people &amp; socializing. Now I just stay in except for classes, &amp; feel sad all the time. 

Idk if I’m suicidal or what. But I just want something drastic to happen. I just want to know that anyone that I’ve met in college cares. :(

They all called me their best friend but they haven’t checked on me this week which was shitty because I overslept for the first time, missed class, luckily there was no assignment but attendance. And I got my first bad grade. I used to have an eating disorder but my parents never knew. I willed myself out of it, bc I never used to believe in therapy. But I’ve started cutting calories again. I’ve eaten a total of 500 calories these past 4 days. I just felt like maybe I need to be skinnier for guys to like me, and then if I get a boyfriend I won’t be lonely. I’m not stupid, I know everyone says this, but I swear I’m intelligent. I know my mindset is wrong, it’s dumb to place happiness in a relationship. But I’m really sad and lonely here. I just want to know that someone cares.

I don’t want to worry my parents so i just pretend everything is ok. I really struggle with telling people my feelings and opening up. But honestly this problem would be fixed if someone just texted me asking to grab lunch or hang out. I just feel so lonely :(

I hated the idea of counseling and therapy. It implies something is wrong with you, and I never used to have anything wrong w me, my life was perfect. My parents have money, I had a good job &amp; was one of the top employees, grades were good, got into a top school, lots of friends &amp; good recommendations from teachers. But now I’m at the top school &amp; I’m away from my parents, no friends that care, and so so unhappy. So I signed up for a counseling appointment, free at my university, it’s in about a week. So we’ll see how that goes.",16Feb2018,4

65,"Sorry for the long post but I need some advice, not sure if I should move this over to r/legaladvice or if this is the right home. Just read.

I go to a public high school where at the beginning of the day, most of the students are checked to make sure they have an ID badge that is issued by the school that basically just has a student's name, picture, and a colored line indicating their grade. Because it doesn't indicate much, and crime isn't super prevalent in the area, none of the teachers are very concerned about students wearing it. Except for one teacher who I do not have much respect for after the incident I'm about to explain.

Earlier today, a student, who I'll refer to as John, walks into class, realizes he doesn't have his ID around his neck, and politely asks the teacher, I'll refer to as Mrs. B, if he can go back to his last class to get it. Mrs. B, who was previously just sitting at her desk working on her computer, suddenly yells ""You realize our superintendent, Wendy's employees, and trash collectors wear ID badges?"" Then she proceeds to scream at him to get out of her classroom and ""to never come back"" . Predictably, John turns to leave and then she screams at him ""no stop, I'll handle this."" She goes over to the phone in the wall and calls the front office. She starts by asking for a male administrator for discipline claiming that John is being disrespectful to her and that he needs to be disciplined immediately. Then while she is still on the phone with the front office, she yells at John who is no more than five feet away to ""shut up I don't want to hear you"". John is literally just breathing loudly. After talking to the front office (I wasn't able to hear what they said to her) Mrs. B tells John to go straight to the front office and the cameras in the hallway are watching him. After that, Mrs. B turns back to the rest of the class (while we all have our jaws on the floor), and reassures us ""I'm in a good mood today"".

I was disgusted the rest of class and quite frankly the rest of the day at how Mrs. B bullied John out of her class. Several incidents have happened between Mrs. B and John but nothing close to this extreme happened until today. John is not an interrupting type, he's not a menace to the class, he does the usual things teenagers aren't supposed to do in class but do anyway like sleep or listen to music. John is Hispanic and Mrs. B happens to be white but there are other minorities in the class and Mrs. B doesn't bully them, so I don't think race is a part of this, but I'm not at all sure why Mrs. B targets John the way she does.

Anyway, I now ask you, Reddit, for advice on what to do about this situation. I'd like to something for John because I feel like he is being targeted for no reason. At the same time, I'm asking for a teacher to be removed from her job. I know there are 20+ witnesses to this scene, but if I bring up the issue individually to the principal, it's my word vs Mrs. B's and the fear she caused my classmates is unlikely to get me any support. I'd like to tell the school anonymously about the incident, but I'm not entirely sure how to do that. If I created a throwaway email, I don't know what it would say, and somehow they were able to ever trace it back to me, I could lose my opportunity to go to a decent college because of me getting disciplined. I would really hate to do nothing, but at the same time I don't want to ruin my opportunity to go to the college I want, and thus my career.",16Feb2018,3
66,"They were each other’s first love. The relationship lasted for 5 years and it’s been 2 years since he took his life. She can’t stop blaming herself despite the fact that I told her it’s not her fault. Her boyfriend’s parents passed away when he was around 8 and his grandparents took care of him. They eventually passed away when he was in high school. This caused him to be really depressed because he literally did not have a family until he met her. Therapy didn’t help. The only thing that helped was her.

Anyway, their relationship was amazing, but they got into a huge fight two years ago. I’m not going to go too much details on it, but she was super pissed off at him. She wanted to take a break from their relationship and he told her he can’t live without her. She ignored him thinking that’s what guys usually say to keep their relationship going and he took his life shortly after that. It’s been two years and she’s been regretting it every single day. She can’t move on because she felt like she could’ve stopped him. Every year during the date of his death, she would cry and blame herself because she didn’t believe him when he said he can’t live without her.

70,"Thanks in advance for reading. I work at a well-known casual dining place and have for nearly 6 months now. 

I’ve slowly built a good relationship with all of my coworkers and managers. I’ve gotten along especially well with one manager, ‘Matt’, as I thought he was absolutely hilarious and overall just a cool, chill guy. He’s married, middle aged, and has kids. I liked having him as a manager. No romantic feelings whatsoever. 

A few weeks ago, things shifted a little. He started being a little more nice to me and showed a more excitement than normal at working with me. No big deal. Last shift though, I was scheduled in the back (which is somewhat closed off to most employees and all customers) and he was one of the closing managers—the other a woman. During that shift he told me, ‘We should hang’ and I just kind of laughed and was like ‘Haha yup!’ He also snuck up behind me and pressed against me just enough that it made me jump. Touched me once or twice on the arm or shoulder, I don’t remember. 

When everyone else had clocked out and left (minus the other manager) as I was behind, he started asking me questions about my relationship life. Things like, “So, what are you doing for Valentine’s day?”, “Your boyfriend isn’t taking you out?”, “Why don’t you have a boyfriend?”, “Well, what are your standards?” He’d stop when the other manager would walk by then pick up when she was out of earshot. 

I was on alert this whole time, probably partially because I’m a victim of a serious sexual assault crime and it was somewhat of an anxiety-inducing situation. When we clocked out and I start walking to my car, he walked with me. He said that I’m ‘nice and sensible’ and that ‘someone will try to get with me soon.’ Then he proceeded to ask me that if he tried to get with me, would he have a chance. I asked about his marriage to deflect because it’s well-known that he’s married (with young children—also with one that’s close to my age, I’m 20). He told me that he’s getting divorced next month and said he’s looking for someone to ‘hang out with’ or something. I didn’t say anything to answer his question directly, rather just pretended I was freezing and needed to get home, and he just gave me a handshake and left. 

He just sent me a friend request on Facebook an hour or two ago. About two weeks ago he joked around that he poked around looking on my profile (it’s really private so I know he didn’t see anything). 

I’m really uncomfortable about this. I’ve never once flirted with him or anything like it—just been nice and laughed at his jokes. I don’t want to tell upper management and get him in trouble, because he needs this job and has kids depending on the income. I also don’t want to stay in this environment as I fear repercussions for rejecting him, assuming I get to that point (and because I’ve been harassed so much by male employees). I’m considering transferring stores but the manager would demand to know why. I work tomorrow in the same position and am so anxious thinking about facing him if he’s working.

73,"I'm currently an Editor at a content marketing company in a major US city. My salary is below market average, and my rent will be increasing from $800 to $1,300 in September - which will be half my current monthly pay. I have been with this company for a little under a full year, and understand that it'll be tough to get an interview when it looks like I bounce from job to job, but I'm afraid that I will be unable to save money come September and live paycheck to paycheck. Also, this rent is still a very good deal for the city I live in despite the increase, and moving to another location would actually cost more. 

On the side, I work remotely for a publication in a field that more closely relates to my education, and I have been with this organization for a little over two years. I perform this work in my free time outside of my full-time job. 

Yet, as I've looked through job postings in the past few weeks, I haven't felt very drawn to the types of editing positions I see (medical, mathematics, business, etc.). I would prefer to edit in lifestyle or humanities, but that's not very popular here. Now I'm questioning whether or not I should continue in the editing field, especially when the salaries still seem too low to sustain my new rent fee, and upward movement seems difficult without major experience. 

Basically, my question is this: if I were to leave the editing field, where would my skills apply? Which types of jobs should I be looking for?

74,"So it all started back in the winter of 2015. I had a class called life skills and in it I had a couple friends. One day, we were to pick groups and I joined 2 of my other friends and with them was a female. We became friends. but it was more of a simple friendship as in we would say hi in the halls and thats all. I didnt have a class with her after 1st semester so we didnt really talk the rest of the year and didnt talk over all summer of 2016. September rolls around, school starts again, and I have my history class with her. She is just how i remember her and we still have a simple friendship, this gos through until November. I started talking with her a lot more and we became much better friends. I'm  going to call her A. have become really mean. Calling me names, making fun of me. They just started to be jerks to me and only me. The main one was C, he was in the initial group with me and A.  I liked C. I thought the highest of him and when he was saying all these things, it hurt the most coming from him.  This was probably the worst time of my life. Now Al comes in. Me and al were friends and one day i turn to him for help, someone to talk to. He was extremely close to A. I started getting emotional comfort from both Al and A. I stopped associating myself with the group that harassed me and focused more attention to A. About mid December, C asks A out and they become a thing. So my good friend and former friend are now in a relationship. Early January, A, Al, and C go somewhere together and Al tells C about the deal with me and feeling horrible about myself because of him. C apologizes and we're friends again. She moves schools and we get separated as quickly as we become friends. I barely saw her at this point. She came over 3 times in 3 months. March comes along, A breaks is with C. It was inevitable. Me and A are talking everyday still until April. She left her glasses at my house and 2 weeks later some friends came over. They broke them and she got mad at me and didn't talk to me for a couple weeks. We patch things up, all is well. She tells me she is going to Illinois for the summer to stay with her dad and so I won't see at all over the summer. She tells me this 2 weeks before leaving and so naturally I want to see her before she goes but she tells me she's busy everyday so I don't see her for the longest time. At the beginning of June, I did an experiment, I didn't text her for about 2 weeks waiting to see if she would reach out to me. I'm having a mini stroke everyday thinking about why she isn't texting me so I reach out to C, her ex. I ask him what I should do and he texts her saying I'm freaking out not talking to her and we are reunited once again. Around the end of June we got into another argument and took a break from our friendship. I texted her mid July and we patched things up again. We were still talking everyday at this point. Around mid August, we get into another argument. I don't talk to her the rest of summer. School starts again in September and we know go to the same school again. I return her glasses and that was the first time talking to her in person in 6 months. I didn't talk to her much anymore. I've had a plan to ask her to homecoming for a while and I now realize it isn't going to work because we arent as close as we used to be. I don't talk to her at all for about 2 months. I see around school, we made solid eye contact a couple times, but no acknowledgement. She texts me randomly one day saying ""fuck you blah blah blah. You're a  horrible friend"". We talk a bit and get things straight and we are talking semi frequently now. We have been good up until a couple days ago. For the longest time my friends have been telling me to not be friends with her because of all the drama it causes and  recently,  she hung up on me and made a rude comment before leaving. That night I saw a quote that said ""don't make others a priority when they make you an option."" That relates to my situation and I thought it was a sign and haven't talked to her since.

78,"my new girlfriend and I were hanging out recently at mcdonalds, I paid for her food and she handed me $10 and I paid for the food with my debit card and held on to her cash. afterwerds we were smoking cigertettes in the parking lot, this guys drove by and yelled something mean at us, to which I said ""fuck u"" and flicked my cig at them. they stopped the car and chased me, as I ran i hid in a gas station and remembering the 10$ I had I bought me a new pack of cigertettes. anyway I found her later that night and she was saying how I almost ""got my ass beat"" and I told her if I fought those guys I would have killed them and dont want to go to jail, I demistrated by punching her arm to show her how hard I can hit. any way after that night she has not responded, and IDK if u guys deal with crap like this, but im 43% sure she is mad about the 10$.

80,"Hello Reddit! 
This is my first ever Reddit post and I'm really excited to be a part of this amazing community. Essentially I'm turning to you guys, the people of the internet, for some advice seeing as no one really gets anywhere alone and certainly not in this situation. Basically I am a 22 year old, born and raised in San Diego, with some aspirations that have not been tended to yet. I set out at 18 to support myself and take charge of my education alone, not because I was forced to leave but some religions and moral differences amongst my family pushed me to try and do things with the mindset to explore and learn outside the walls I originally was told to stay within. I've persevered in my education securing my transfer curriculum and associates from Mira Costa college while earning my rent working at Seaside Market in Cardiff by the Sea because that was the responsible thing to do as an adult. I've been out of school for two years now after clearing the halfway point before a bachelor, and I'm now stuck. I'm not a person that borrows money nor welcomes debt, every dollar I have is accounted for and spent wisely, with some obvious exceptions that comes in life time to time. I understand the expenses of college, specifically University, and have opted to work until I have enough money to go back to school given the current economic climate we live in, which I'm sure everyone knows is a bit challenging today. I'm not bitter like I originally was as a naive high school student looking to run off to college, I'm grateful and privalleged for the life I have and the people I share it with, nothing I've done has been a waste of time, everything has been 100% educational. 

With all of that said, I have a wonderful house in the costal community of Encinitas, I live with my girlfriend and two wonderful humans I get to call my friends. I have plenty of other friends and have traveled alongside many of them working toward some ambitions which I haven't mentioned yet. I set out to study cinematography and production, so yeah I knew what I was getting into, but chose to give my passion a try. Since then I have secured an awesome job at the Sheraton Carlsbad doing Audio Visual engineering as well as being the company's drone pilot. I also work as a co drone op for my friend's off-road racing production in addition to freelance work including weddings and whatnot for my portfolio. I'm thankful and have a really fun life that I'm proud of, but I haven't accomplished what I've set out to do yet. 

My best friend lives in Brooklyn after graduating from NYU. He had plenty of scholarships and was lucky for the education he received as a musician theater major. I'm super proud of him and miss working close with him on our personal projects. Over Christmas, we talked about living together in New York putting our passions to the test and make something out of it. He is longing for me to head out there and try, because now is the time to take risks and make mistakes. I welcome them! You never succeed until you try, and I intend on making a move towards success. It's now February and I have till the end of March to decide to leave my life and start fresh in New York. I've been plenty of times, I even drove there and back from my hometown of San Diego to explore the country. I love travel and discovery, New York would really be a place I'd enjoy. It's definitely not for everyone, but I know that for myself. The real dilema isn't leaving to try but really it's my girlfriend. She has been my friend for the past nine years, and we'll celebrate our two year relationship the month I'm supposed to leave in May of I decide to go. I want her to come with me... She's a graduate at UCSD in public health, incredibly smart and a heart of gold. She's hesitate to leave because she hasn't really thought about leaving San Diego ever, coming with me would change a lot, and if she didn't decided to go for herself I wouldn't want her feeling like she owes me anything and avoid overall resentment. It's really the only thing holding me back from a potential opportunity to try and invest in myself, but I simply don't know. 

The way I see it, I've got three outcomes: 
1. I'm convinced to stay
2. She travels with me and we start fresh. 
3. I go by myself and potentially my roommate that could also benefit from some change (still working up to talking to him about it, it's been a rough month for the guy) 

My best friend, my girlfriend, and I were all in the same freshman class together at a very small school called High Tech High North County, so the prospect of living together wouldn't be terrifying, it's just what we're leaving behind if we leave. Our family, friends, and home town. She works two part time jobs as a server to pay rent and I know she can exceed that in a flash given the right environment. I still need to continue my education too but have some personal ambitions id like to pursue first. I'd like to start now.
Shit guys I've rambled a lot, your advice is very much appreciated and will be taken into consideration. Thank you. 

Additional facts, I work for the Marriot now after the Sheraton buy out so I could potentially keep my job and transfer. 
Our lease ends in May as well as my best friend in New York who is currently scouting for a new place to match our current rent. 
My roommate coming along hasn't been discussed yet but your thoughts could contribute to that future conversation. ",16Feb2018,1

I am a 25 year old young woman and I am torn on what I should do next in my life.

I went to college in the Midwest. While I was in college, I made some dumb financial choices like buying a $3000 dog, getting $30k in student loans, maxing out my credit card to $2300, having to get a Carecredit card to pay for my dog and maxing that out $2,000. Young and dumb, I know. 

After graduating, I worked on the Democratic campaign  because I’ve always volunteered and worked on PResidential elections. I love it - I feel like I’m doing something good, meeting great people, building relationships, and having a long lasting impact. But even after my first job on the campaign, which paid essentially nothing but rent, my debt didn't decrease one bit.

I then moved to San Francisco to live w my long term partner. She is awesome. Moving to the Bay Area, I had to take a sales job at a huge tech company - not my passion, but it is a means to an end here in the city.

This Tech company is great company - feeds us, 401k, upward mobility if you perform well. Base pay starting off is 40k which sucks for this city, but one can deal esp if in a relationship. If someone stays at this company for 3+ years, then its no doubt you're making 90k and up and it is a decent job.  Right now with commission, pay is closer to 55-60k.

My partner is awesome and just took out a personal loan to help me off my trivial debt (besides student loans). I've been given a clean slate (paying her back obviously each month, but it is way more manageable).)

I'm writing this because I was about to put a $500 deposit for a law prep class bc I registered for the June LSAT. But it just triggered some thoughts that have been coming up in my mind this past week. Like do I want to go through the pain and stress of not be financially secure, AGAIN? Or is a law school something I need to be willing to sacrifice going in debt for because it will push me faster and closer to my dreams of having a career that is truly impactful in a large and meaningful way. 

SO RIGHT NOW I AM IN A HUGE LIFE DILEMMA.

1. I am so passionate about politics, government, human rights, fair and equal representation in our country. I actually toured USF Law school and it was really cool - sat in on a 1st year contracts class. I could definitely can see there is a lot of access to amazing opportunities in law school - like presenting research at the UN HQ in Geneva...My dream is to go to law school, work at the UN/US Government, be a diplomat, work in policy, campaigns, etc. I love this shit. But, I fucked up in undergrad. Have a super low GPA of 2.5. Not a big deal because I spoke to USF Admin and they said they look at applications holistically so I'm sure I can get in, but not confident about financial aid. Law school is expensive. After 3 years of law school, I will be 200k in debt. That sounds terrible and stressful. My quality of life during law school will also go down because I won't have a solid source of income, I won't be able to enjoy frivolous things in life. After law school, I'll be in debt and will need to work my ass off, probably not getting paid a lot. By that time, I will be in my 30s. Kids after law school sounds like a horrible idea, esp with that much debt. But the end goal, (i’m hoping) will spur an amazing career for me and not just a job. 

2. I could just stay at Tech Company, perform well, move up within the company, try to get an position in Diversity &amp; Inclusion at some point and somehow make a dent in tech.. But I'm really not passionate about tech... HOWEVER, this route has a tremendous amount of security - I won't be in debt, I can easily make and save money, I work 9-5 and then it's my own time, I can focus on my relationship with my partner, family and friends - enjoy life, go on vacations, trips, pamper myself (i know... shallow).. I can get married in a couple of years and in my early 30s have saved a lot of $, raise my kids and be comfortable. But with this option, I'm not chasing that dream of mine to be a lawyer, but it is safe and comforting and less financial stress. 

I also worry that if I’m financially stressed it will impact my relationship which I really love.

Any advice, similar situations, results, stories? Please help!!

84,"So, obligatory this is not me, I'm asking on behalf of a childhood friend. 

Someone I used to know has over the past couple years fallen progressively more ill, and was finally diagnosed with a insanely rare (1 in a million) physically debilitating incurable disease. They do not have much support, but are currently living with my father, who's been driving them around to their doctor's appointments, etc...

To my understanding they've lost all hope, and are about to die a pretty sad death because my dad's going broke supporting them, and they haven't been able to work for the past year and so don't make enough money to qualify for obama care and any kind of assisted living. 

Where can I go to in order to get some kind of hope for this person? The specialist kinda told them they were SOL, are there any resources for someone like this to get medical help or hospice care?

edit: I should mention, at this point in time the person can barely walk and probably wouldn't survive a plane flight (my understanding of it, I'm skeptical of the last part). ",16Feb2018,1
85,"For a bit of backstory...

I served in the Navy for 8 years working in logistics. I specialized in inventory management and purchasing and loved the job! I promoted to E-6 within 5 years and ultimately decided to leave the service. I achieved my BA in Transportation and Logistics Management with a 3.90 right before I got out.

I ended up finding a Shipping Manager position and accepted, depending on the responses on the post I'll reveal the location. I was then internally promoted to a Purchasing Manager and ever since that day I have dreaded going to work. The stress is unreal and I've never felt it before. I am constantly in question about if this is the right industry for me and what I should do.

One of my friends asked her one day if she likes me and she said no and that we’re just close friends. I believe she knows how I feel about her but she never mentioned it. She had a side fling for a while that would come to our work and she would try her best to keep it on the down low but I noticed things. That whole time she was involved with him we didn’t talk much and it was awkward because you can sense the tension. I believe she sensed how angry I was whenever he came and she even mentioned to her co worker that whenever he comes I’m always silent. She doesn’t talk to him anymore though and we are better now. We are both seniors in high school and I want to ask her to prom but I’m not sure what she will say. Should I just tell her now? I’ve had feelings for her for over a year and I’m tired of holding it in but I’m too nervous of her reaction and I surely do not want it to effect us.

92,"Not sure what advice I can expect or hope for. Not sure what I even want, but here goes. So I'm a 28 year old man and it just occurred to me today that I feel like I've never fit in anywhere. To that you always hear ""it's okay not to fit in, just as long as you're comfortable in your own skin, blah blah."" That's doesn't really feel like much consolation at the moment. I've been questioning a lot lately my place in the universe, what I actually care about, and have been trying to gain more insight into my personal experience and how to go forward. Today it occurred me that I've never felt a sense of belonging with any group, which might make me feel and care about... something. I've always felt like an outsider. To get a sense of what I mean, the ways in which I feel like an outsider are:

Bisexual

Atheist

Existential nihilist

Mixed race (white/Japanese)

Progressive (in a rural community)

ADHD-PI (recent diagnosis)

Onion hater (they're in damn near everything)

Individually, I'm at relative ease with all of these things. Together, it makes me wonder if I'm even the same species as most people. I guess mostly I feel isolated and disconnected from any sense of belonging with a larger group, which honestly would be kinda nice to experience. I have a lot to be grateful for, too. Awesome wife and son (7 months old), good steady job with a potentially nice career a few years away... I also find it hard to care about most things except for the lives and immediate well-being of my wife and son and... this not belonging thing, right now. Could be a subconscious attempt to bury my head in the sand so as to not directly have to face my/our problems. I've also had a depression diagnosis before - several years ago, but I thought I was mostly better. Could have come back.

TL;DR: Don't fit in for several reasons and feel isolated. Don't care about most things except wife and son and not belonging. Would love to fit into a culture or community, but associations to anything feel forced and hollow.",16Feb2018,1
93,"I'm a manager of a few locations of a smaller fast food franchise. I recently hired a person who is a transfer from another store in a nearby city. I thought she was great at first but now just about every other coworker and employee is fed up with working with her. She tries to change things that work fine because they make more sense to her, annoys customers and workers with incessant upselling (which we are supposed to to do but she takes it too far), and acts like she's perfect and everyone else sucks even though she constantly makes small mistakes.

I have no real reason to fire her but she's not meshing well with a single person and actually creating a more negative work environment since everyone gets so irritated when working with her. I don't know what to do and would love it if she was just gone. 

I've tried different approaches to talking to her about some of the issues, such as ""pay attention to how the customer acts when upselling, you can usually tell when they are getting annoyed and it's time to stop by their tone of voice"" but she seems to have no social awareness. I haven't had this problem to this extent before and I would love suggestions on how to deal with it.

97,"Hi all! So background first; i work in an environment with 6 locations spread out across the city. The girl in question is a part time worker who works 3 days a week in a different location to me. So while we've worked for the same company for about 2 years, we only really met about a year ago. Since then we've seen each other once a week at a work social event.

About 6 months ago a job opportunity came up (her current one) and she messaged me asking if i thought she should go for it. I told her yes and we spent some time discussing how she should interview etc. This conversation lasted well into the early hours of the morning. We quickly became friends messaging every other day. At the work events we would always sit together. I noticed she could be quite touchy and i had a feeling that she may have been interested in being more than friends. At the time i was very much in love with someone else so i started to keep my distance a bit more, but she soon found a boyfriend and normal service was resumed in our friendship. 

I want to stress at this point that there has never been any romantic feelings towards her on my part. She has always been someone i considered a good friend and nothing more.

A couple of weeks ago there was a death in my family and i was considerably upset. I was at work when i found out  that my relative had been taken to hospital and was unlikely to survive the week. I checked my phone to find a message from her asking some unrelated question, so i rang her back. I told her i had been given some bad news and without asking what it was, she drove 20 minutes across the city to see me. When she got there i couldnt even tell her to begin with. It was actually the first time id even said the words aloud to anyone. She didnt wait and just hugged me. Eventually i told her all of it and she stayed with me for about 15 minutes until i was more myself. 

I found this incredibly moving. I'm not exactly short of friends but  i dont think there is anyone else in my life who would have done the same thing. It really touched me, and i made sure she knew how much i appreciated what she did for me. This was on a Monday. That night when i was grocery shopping i decided to get her something to say thank you. It was a spur of the moment thing and it certainly wasnt something that i spent a lot of time on. I grabbed her a couple of chocolate bars i knew she liked and a can of drink. I went out to see her at work (about 5 minutes drive away) and gave them to her. She put her arm around me again and said something along the lines of ""You're so thoughtful, you really didnt have to do this, i just wanted to make sure you were ok."" We had a brief conversation and then i went on my way.

As it turns out that was my first mistake. The following day my relative passed away. I was too upset to really talk to anyone about it, but i did message her saying what had happened. She replied with ""stay strong"". I decided to take a few days off work and we didnt talk at all during that time. Three days later, completely out of the blue i get a message from her saying ""Please dont message me i'm starting to find you creepy.""

I was pretty gutted by this naturally. I had never gotten anything from her before this that could lead me to think she thought this way. I replied that i wouldnt message her again if thats what she wanted and left it at that. I intended to wait a couple of weeks and message her again and see if we could talk things through (i was dealing with enough in my life at the time that i couldnt really give her any attention anyway), however when i arrived at work the next day the situation had declined rapidly. Within moments of walking in the door a coworker came up to me asking if me and the girl in question were really dating. I told him that we werent but he wasnt the only one to think that. One of my oldest friends asked why i bought the girl chocolates and then after hearing that we weren't speaking at the moment (i left out the details) said that was a good thing and that i shouldnt talk to her again.

Finally, the following day i found out from a different coworker that she had spoken to her boss about it and that her boss had spoken to mine. The ""power structure"" at the place i work is quite complicated. Her boss is located at the store she works in and has nothing to do with me whatsoever. I have 3 direct bosses and 1 ""big boss"" if you like. One of my direct superiors has spoken to me and given me the clearest indication of exactly what happened, but to be honest im still not exactly sure. I've been told to expect a conversation about this with the big boss when we have our usual department meeting on this coming Tuesday. He also said that no one in the managment team believes there is or ever was anything untoward going on, but that i need to be spoken to regardless.

I'm not really sure how i'm feeling right now. My other coworkers (friends in a lot of cases as well) are keeping this from me, unaware that i already know. I'd like to think that they're doing it so i dont worry but the truth is i would much rather have been able to cut this off before it became a thing. As for the girl in question, we haven't spoken or messaged since it all turned to custard. I dont know what she's thinking or how she is feeling. I dont know if she is being manipulative (as some of my friends are accusing her of being) or if this whole situation has been the result of a misunderstanding that has been blown out of proportion by people who dont know the full story. Perhaps these people are expecting ""chocolates"" to mean fancy things that come in a heart shaped box when in reality it was a couple of chocolate bars thrown into a supermarket trolley on my way out the door.

The worst of it is i dont blame her for any of this. I dont think its her fault even though she has let it get as far as she has. I miss her friendship but the sad part is that even if she came up to me tomorrow and said ""Im so sorry, i got the wrong idea. I never meant for any of this to happen""; the trust that we had between us is gone now. She doesnt trust my intentions as she clearly thinks i want to be more than friends and i cant trust her because she never talked to me. The one person who could have cleared this whole thing up for her is me. If she had came to me and just said ""look, whats going on here? You're making me uncomfortable""; i could have sorted everything out and we may have been fine. Instead she talked to her friends and her boss rather than the one person who could have given her the truth.

So i guess my questions are:
1. How do i approach this meeting, and what should i expect
2. What was this girl thinking? Why did she go to her boss about this rather than just straight up asking me?
3. How do i move forward? Do i try and salvage a friendship with this girl once the dust has settled, despite everything thats happened? Do i address the issue with my other coworkers?

98,"I know this is pretty much a non-issue compared to what others have got going on, but I do think it's an issue worth being concerned about.

So I have a professor in a class that is fundamental to my major. I'm not entirely sure exactly how I feel about her, but what I do know is that every time she gives me attention, I can feel my face and shoulders turn red and hot. I can't really say that it is legitimate romantic attachment, particularly because I often fantasize about professors-- not because I actually find them attractive but just because I'm incredibly lonely and it's nice to be cared about by someone who isn't family (even if they're paid to care about you). But with other professors and people I fantasize about, the feelings are never ""real"" in this way. 

I felt it the first time when I had attempted to help someone out with their homework in the class chat online, but it seemed that the solution I had in mind was not the only accepted solution (as I implied it to be) and the professor herself corrected me on that. I apologized for misleading the other student and felt pretty dumb about it, even after she told me that I did nothing wrong. Then when I went to office hours the first time this semester (not too long after the chat room stuff) she saw me and called me by name and asked about what questions I had. I had never told her my name, nor does she bother with roll calls (impractical, of course). So I was surprised that she had put my name to my face and was able to identify me, and so the whole time I felt that my face was red and hot from that as well as all the attention she gave me. 

But she's just like that-- very committed to her students-- she knows many of her student's names (despite her large lectures), makes a *ton* of office hours, and responds to emails almost right away. She's just a good instructor. But of course my lonely ass can't handle being given that much attention and care without feeling awkward about it. Literally just last semester my whole night was made after a cute girl fell on my arm in the bus (and I still find that moment memorable). I am that lonely.

This situation is an issue because I need to be on good, non-awkward terms with her and I feel like I'm ruining that. I feel like she's already wondering why I, without fail, turn red every time she so much as looks at me and I feel like I probably am making things awkward for her as a professor. Perhaps it's just me, but I already notice that she's less willing to look towards me, be friendly with me, etc. 

I have lecture with her tomorrow and I sit in the front row. Last lecture I almost couldn't pay attention because I was trying to avoid eye contact with her (which is probably only more awkward).

Any advice on how to navigate this situation gracefully? 

Thank you for reading!

P.S. In case this wasn't implied well enough, I might as well make it explicit: I do not want anything to do with her romantically. Even if I do have a small crush, I don't care to take it anywhere because I prefer to follow the rules with respect to student-faculty relations. I am not asking about how to or if I should get with her, I just want to know how to best navigate the normal relationship between a student and their professor given my situation here. I've begun to dread seeing her because of all this, and that concerns me. ",16Feb2018,10

It's probably not healthy but aside from that it's a perfect relationship. I don't show my concern or anything about it all to her because obviously when it comes down to it it's not my decision and it's her life so she can do whatever the hell she wants. I don't even know what advice I can get I'm mostly just venting. I just wish I could change the way I think about it all but sadly I can't. We talk all day everyday and I have no reason to not trust her but it just makes weekends miserable for me and I honestly don't know why ,16Feb2018,1
110,"This is a throwaway account.


I'm 29 years old. I've been single and without having had a partner to touch or connect with in 11 years. And I have no friends. None. 


I've tried to put myself 'out there' to be more conjugal and more open to different personalities, but I can't get anyone to stick around. I see people's eyes glaze over when they start to talk to me. I remember about 12 years ago when I worked in retail; a girl that was interested in me at the time said that I was so intense that she was intimidated in even trying to speak to me. 


But I don't know any other way of living.


I open up too quickly. 


I cogitate on thoughts for far too long. I plan and scheme for weeks about something and anything.


I care about everyone and everything. Constantly. (And it's killing my happiness. Well... it has done... for a long time now.)


I speak with deep conviction. 


I want to help everyone and everything.


I speak with conviction and I can't turn it off. I feel emotions welling up about literally everything and it pours out of my mouth.


I prefer writing rather than speaking. So I can organize my thoughts and write mini-essays in each text message.


I'm moody. I'm brooding. And I'm a die-hard romantic. I'm clingly. 


I'm sincere and I have an all-or-nothing outlook for relationships.


I hate small talk. I need depth. Right away. I need to share my deepest secrets and weaknesses with everyone immediately. And I expect the same.


And I have way too easy a time to get lost in fiction and to fall in love with fictional charaters.


I need help.


Badly. 


I can't turn it off and I have become unbelievably lonely. 


I'm not brave enough to kill myself. But I would love to get hit by a truck any moment now. I literally find the thought of being alive uncomfortable.",16Feb2018,8
112,"I've been in my high school theatre company for about 4 years now. Recently, a new teacher was added to supervise us which is great because it means both the old and new teacher divide the work.

However, I cannot handle this new teacher's constant criticism! They will stop the rehearsal every 2-3 minutes to tell an actor to do/say things a certain way exactly how they want it. We'll then have to repeat the bit over and over until they're satisfied, and even then the teacher might come up and act out the part for us to copy.

I honestly think this is so stupid, and am on the verge of quitting. We only get through a couple pages every rehearsal (due to constant stops and redos), which would be fine if our show wasn't in a week. We haven't gone through most of it yet, and can only make progress when this new teacher isn't around.

Furthermore, I feel personally attacked whenever the teacher's complaints come to me. I know there are definitely things I can change, but getting yelled at for 10 minutes and getting called a real mess isn't fun. And it's only ever me who gets really chewed out. I just keep getting worse and worse as the rehearsal goes on, and I get stopped every few minutes. 

I know that I might be taking things too personally. However, this whole thing is ridiculous to me because we are not a professional company! This is a high school group that people join because they love theatre, but recently I've come to realize no-one enjoys it anymore. We don't get any say in what we do (or at least I don't) as all we do is memorize lines and do the hard work, while this teacher gets to decide what all the characterization and acting is like! As I mentioned, we've barely been through it once, and we've never even been given a chance to learn these characters and figure things out for ourselves!

I don't want to quit because of personal differences like this, but I spend all these hours every week in theatre for my own/other students' enjoyment. I'm not there to be nitpicked and patronized every time I speak (and even when I'm not speaking!).

TL;DR: I think teacher's critiques are uncalled for. How deal?

EDIT: This teacher is ""new"", but has actually taught at my school before. He is relatively trusted among the other teachers, especially the other theatre supervisor who worked for years with him before he left 5 years ago.",16Feb2018,2

115,"So I’m a 23y/Male and  2 years ago I finished a technical School where they taught you how to become an aircraft mechanic. The school is finished you have to take a certain amount of test to become licensed. This license is called airframe and power plant license. With this license not only can you just work on airplanes Petrizzo many other options you could work such as PSE and G, power plant, generators,  etc. Although I did not complete my testing right away due to being lazy and just a lack of focus. I decided it was time to put my  big boy pants on and finally finish what I started. I’ve finished 3 out of the 5 tests and I’m due for another exam in two weeks. I think I’m scared to become an adult and start working. Or I’m scared that it’s not something I will like. I always feel like yea being a mechanic would be cool but I feel like I’m worth so much more than that. I know we all want to become successful and make money but life seems so much grander than that. Like I’m meant for much more and I don’t know what. I see my sister in college and she’s about to go study abroad and it seems awesome. I didn’t take the traditional route of going to college and I think now that it had to do with the influence of my friends. I know there’s no going back and I really want to finish what I started to be honest. Idk.Maybe I’m just scared of what the future holds and need reassurance.

118,"I would appreciate any advice here because I'm in a limbo. I'm in engineering school and I have known this guy for 3 years, we met in school and we became close friends. I'm 28 and he's 45, this is our last semester in school and we basically begged our professor to put us on the same senior design project, and it happened. 

In case you don't know, senior design in my school is divided into two semesters, so last semester we finished the first part. Anyway, out of NO WHERE, this guy started being an asshole to me, we voted for him to be project lead (big mistake), so this guy started plotting some pretty fucked up shit against me starting from last semester, I found out he had been spreading lies/rumors behind my back to my own friends, he started lying to me about every single detail, whether it's school related or not. He started setting traps for me to fail the project and in other classes too, this includes giving me false information on what's gonna be on the test/homework etc  

I also found out he had leaked every personal detail about me to my other friends including family secrets that I had only told him. I spent last semester in an extreme depressive state, I couldn't even describe to you how terrible I felt. This guy knows me very well and he knew how to break me. 

Still to this day I don't know why he suddenly turned against me, but what I know for sure based on his actions is that he's extremely jealous from me, and I have no idea why really because I don't think I have anything special about me... 

Anyway, going back to the project, he has done almost zero work last semester, but this guy is extremely sneaky and knows what he's doing. He knows how to defend himself and from the very beginning he formed a great bond with the mentors and project supporters. He's one of those people that can  know nothing about a specific topic but he can really convince you that he knows all about it. But in reality he's very dumb, he just knows how to make himself look very bright. 

This semester he also hasn't made any progress, he pretends he's working on some things while in reality there are no results. One more thing about this guy, he's a compulsive liar, almost everything that comes out from his mouth is a lie.

So, we have to submit a peer review soon, the whole team is in agreement that we will give him a bad review. What I need help with, is what I should mention. I don't want me review to be personal, and I have to keep in mind that the mentors truly think this guy is a god. (They are the ones who will see the reviews). 

Do I straight up mention that he's a liar? How can I make a point to the mentors that he's a fake and he has been misleading them?? I'm afraid the mentors will even think that we are unjustly ganging up on him because obviously the whole team decided to rip him a new one in the reviews. Any advice would be appreciated.",16Feb2018,2
119,"For various reasons my girlfriend and I are looking at taking a break so we can work on some individual things happening before we come back together to decide if we want to move forward in a relationship with one another or if we want to just be friends only. I don’t know what details of our situation might be pertinent to finding solutions we seek so I will just give an overview in OP, but if there are details someone feels might be necessary to get to answers feel free to ask. 

She has some stuff keeping her from working that she is trying to find answers for, but needless to say, she has no current income atm. She is working toward getting assistance which has, in the past, failed her and now causes lots of anxiety. We are worried she won’t be getting the help she needs through those means alone and are hoping to find other resources. No family or friends are able to offer her a place to stay for more than a couple days at a time. Couch surfing, while provides a temp solution is not a sustainable one. We live in Seattle and what we have found in looking is that wait lists to get help for housing are years long. We need something sooner than that, like ASAP. 

The reason we need to separate so urgently is that if we stay in the same place, we're in each other's way for finding out what we need for ourselves. I have a lot of growing up to do specifically, but I can't when I'm focused on how much all of this is hurting her.

120,"Hey everyone, 

I’ve struggled with depression for about half of my life and when I think I’ve gotten rid of it, it comes back.

My girlfriend is having a birthday party and we invited a few friends from our office. It was initially supposed to be relatively small but one of our friends has a big mouth and this guy I don’t like was invited.

Why don’t I like him? He is 6’4(I’m only 5’7.) he is muscular, handsome and charming. I don’t hate the guy but I’m really nervous because it will be my girlfriends first time drinking and I don’t want there to be a drunken hook-up. 

I know I’m supposed to trust my girlfriend. I’ve told my girlfriend that I’m uncomfortable with him being there and I have told her why I don’t like him. All she says is I have noting to about; she never denies the claims about him being more and handsome or a better guy which makes me all the more nervous because depression can make you overthink things.

My depression is getting the best of me again to the point where my stomach physically hurts. Because of this, I’ve been distant to my girlfriend because I don’t know how to handle these emotions and I’ve considered hurting myself again.

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like my sour attitude is going to ruin her experience but I just simply cannot compete with this guy. He is objectively a better man than me. ",16Feb2018,0

I graduated from University (in Canada) with a bachelors of science majoring in chemistry. I am having a very hard time finding work in my field (I live in British Columbia, Canada) and I am starting to feel like school was a waste. I have applied to countless jobs online and I have even followed up by phoning and visiting the companies that I have applied. I guess my question is - what should I do? Should I pursue a career in a totally different field or should I just keep applying?

I have thought about grad school but my grades are not the greatest (70% average). I really tried my best to improve my grades throughout my undergrad, but I feel things didn't click for me until my final year in school - I finally found how to study effectively.

When he was in a good mood, good times would happen. When he was in a bad mood, bad times would happen. After i guess you could say ""the honey moon phase"" ended i began getting really really annoyed with hes behavior and actually found myself having more fun alone vs being with him. And holding from telling things i would usually want to tell someone...like a bestfriend...from him cause all he does is criticize. After a ton of thinking and looking online i asked myself ""is this guy really my bestfriend? Or a friend at all?"" We got in a small argument when i told him how i felt which was followed by me just cutting the friendship off. To be honest though i feel pretty good that it ended. I feel like that was no way in anyway at all how i wanted to live any fraction of my life. The thing is im a sophmore in college as of now and well he was my only friend.

133,"Hi everybody, I'm a junior in highschool, second semester now. This summer my father got a job in a rural town far from my old hometown, which was a relatively busy urban area. I had no love for my old town, but after moving to this new town (more like village) I discovered that this town is a mostly isolated town, with a strong reliance on farming as the primary revenue stream for most families in the area. I began the school year at one of the two high schools in town, and managed to survive a semester, but now, after being there for multiple months, I find myself the target of harassment by multiple of the students at this school (One guy who sits next to me kept trying to touch my crotch etc. ) whom I am scared of potential retaliation if I go to staff. I don't want to go to the other high school in town due to the known gang problem, and there are no private schools in a commutable distance. My family bought a house here, before the trouble picked up, leaving us mostly stuck here (we aren't particularly financially sound either). There is a county based online high school program, but I don't want to be isolated either. The only other option that seemed to present itself is taking a loan to stay in a studio apartment in the only nearby town (50 mins away), but I desperately don't want my parents to take on debt on my behalf. I don't know what to do, I'm terrified of these guys, and I don't know what to do. I haven't been in school for a week, and I keep missing more days of school. I don't know what the proper course of action is. Teachers are angry at me, and my grades are falling, and so is my sanity.

I have some 'negatively' memorable moments I could also talk about but I'm not sure if they're appropriate. I have the following in mind:

- (Positive) First gym session ever/hitting the gym in general. Was overweight/borderline obese, and depressed and slightly suicidal due to low self-esteem and decided that had to change. First session with trainer left me pretty much sore all over the day after but I felt happy and confident for the first time in a long time. I have been hitting the gym since and my mental strength has improved a lot.  
- (Negative): The day my dad had a heart attack seconds after being wheeled into the ER. Made me realise that I can't live my life like he's living it (eating like crap, not exercising, gaming all day) and basically was a moment where I 'grew up'. 
- (Somewhat negative): My sessions with the university counselor. First time seeking professional help, first time crying in front of a stranger, first time opening up about problems etc etc. Helped me with my anxiety/depression.
- (Positive): Shadowing a CEO of a government department for a day. Made me realise how inadequate I was compared to fellow students and how much harder I needed to work.

I don't really want to talk about volunteering/overseas trip experiences because I'm not passionate about those.

Currently, I'm leaning more towards talking about the whole 'gym' experience - would it be fine to talk about my ongoing weight loss journey and gym training?

Well, just email me @thisaddress1 and I'll get it out to you, no problem, or I can just give you a refund if you're too impatient to wait for my awesome makeup bundle. Your choice. Uhhh.. Why are people saying I'm a scammer? You've seen *so many* proof tweets over the last 6 months! Ugh. Okay, fine, I'm doing refunds now, I'm so over this - you should have confirm emails. Oh, crap, I don't know what's up with my Stripe but I swear I sent out refunds! Check with your bank! Oh, you haven't heard anything about your bundle or refund and you already emailed me (and my assistants) numerous times at 5 different email addresses? Welllll, my dog is hurt and I'm pretty stressed right now - the bill was $1200! (Oh! Here's a link to my GoFundMe (using my alias/catfish name) you guys know she's my baby and you **know** I'd donate if it was your dog!! My doggie insurance only covers like 25%. You guys! You're so sweet - we're up to $1,000! Only $200 more to go! Love you! And I *am* noticing who's donating! 😉)

Oh, y'all are so sweet! My *loyal* followers guilt tripped people when they asked about their bundles and kept them off my back for a week, but now my dog isnt sick anymore soooo... back to the bundles that you've been waiting months for. Okay. Fine. Im only one person and look at this screen shot - look at how many emails regarding bundles I have to go through, like, 4,000+ Oh, God, you guys need to be patient! I'm really trying to do my best. If you're that pressed you can just contact PayPal or your bank and get a refund that way. Well, it's your fault you waited 90 days to dispute it/paid through Friends&amp;Family and now you're shit out of luck. I'm still trying to send out 50 bundles a week - look at these 2 people who got theirs this month! PROOF I sent them out! 

Okay guys, I've made mistakes but I'm trying to fix them. I hope you guys can understand I just got in a little over my head. I'm trying to make it right. *RT this to win a Juvia palette!* OMG people are saying that I scammed y'all out of $50,000! Can you believe that??? Would I ever do that to you! Tell them how gooood I am to you guys!! And that screen grab of the 4,000+ emails is my personal account, so not ALL of those emails are from angry customers. And some people emailed me twice or more. I didn't sale *that* many nonexistent bundles! Duh.

*RT TO WIN This ABH Softglam Palette!! 😍

End scene.

So that's the story of @urbandoll/Isabelle Martinez/Johnna Byrd. If you have a young sister, cousin, girlfriend, daughter, or a young makeup lover in general they probably follow @urbandoll and/or the many other scammy makeup giveaway accounts (@makeupgirlies, @ClothesPorn, @glowkit, etc.)

This is what I'm dealing with. Trying to figure out a way to take down @urbandoll, who seems to be the worst simply bc she's taken so much money from these young people. Sad part is, they are still trying their best to get on her good side in hopes of winning a giveaway or having their (paid for) makeup bundle(s) sent to them. They may or may not know that she's done these makeup bundle scams at least twice before, under different usernames, and not quite to the scale of this last round.

It's driving me and a lot of others crazy that she keeps getting away with this. She's friendly with big makeup gurus, such as Jackie Aina, @WOCMakeup, Amrezy, and Here For The Tea - which makes her even more legit bc she's friends with these amazing, popular ladies. So, she has to be legit, right? I'm guessing she did make at least $15,000 off the bundles this time around. A simple search of @urbandoll scam or @urbandoll bundles on Twitter or Google will come up with tons of stuff. Or just take a look through her timeline and check on some of these ""totally random, super active"" giveaway winners. And I can't prove it, but I'm pretty sure she's behind or family of @makeupgirlies, Nest bedding, and MapleMakeup.

If you've made it this far, I appreciate it. Any ideas on how to take this thieving pos down? I'm all ears. This really upsets me for some reason. I guess because I see how hopeful, even borderline desperate, these young girls (and boys) are to win these bogus giveaways and to receive their too-good-to-be-true bundles. It honestly just makes me rage. I wish I could afford to be a legit makeup giveaway account, but it's just not possible - for anyone to do this. Unless they're a millionaire, I suppose.

Thanks so so much for reading all of this - I'm sure it wont have many views... I just had to get this out there... If you feel like trolling any of these bogus giveaway accounts and getting the word out/warning people, I think that's the best anyone can really do and I'd love to see it happen. I doubt Urbandoll/Isabelle Martinez/Johnna Byrd can be sued at this point or have any legal actions taken against her. But if she loses her followers' trust and can't scam them anymore that's better than nothing. As I said, more info can be had on Google, Twitter and pretty ugly little liars . com - just do a search for @Urbandoll - people have been talking about her scams since 2016. I gotta let this go... Namaste :)",16Feb2018,2
146,"Hello everyone, I’ve had a rough evening.  I work at a movie theater and I have developed flu like symptoms - I am so horribly ill I can’t find the strength to get out of bed.  I sent my general managers a text several hours ago saying I wouldn’t be able to make it in in the morning to open up.  They replied back saying no one can cover me and that I need to give them more notice when I’m sick (as if I planned this). 
To make matters worse, my mother found my bosses on Facebook and sent them nasty messages because they won’t allow me to call out.  I’m disgusted that my mother would interfere in my life like that.  I’m now afraid and embarrassed to show my face at work.  I have been planning on quitting due to the stress and effect it has had on my mental health, but now I feel like I need to turn in my keys ASAP - giving my 2 weeks is too long for me to stay at this point.  I’m going to wake up to a shitstorm from my bosses in the morning and I really don’t know what to do.  Any advice?  ",16Feb2018,2
149,"I can’t sleep so I wanted to ask for advice about this. I love my girlfriend, she’s an amazing person and so incredibly thoughtful, so thoughtful in fact that she bought me an expensive pair of yeezy shoes for Christmas. When I heard she bought them for me I almost cried, it’s just a thing I have wanted for so long but I could never find the money to buy them for myself. She bought them a week or so after my birthday as a late birthday present but decided to hold onto them but I did not care! Definitely the most anyone has done for me in that way. 

To hide them from me so I wouldn’t look for them at her house she got her mom to take them to her work and lock them in her safe. Definitely a smart move, she probably knew I would be going through her closet for a peek, fast forward to Christmas Eve and at the end of the day at her moms work... she forgets the shoes. Oh well no big deal I guess, I can wait even though I am an incredibly impatient person especially when it comes to something I’ve already been so excited for. A few more days all good.

A few days after Christmas her mom goes in for a surgery and can’t make it to work to open her safe for a few more weeks due to recovery time, which is obviously not on her she needed to get the operation and I’m happy she got the surgery cause it made her a lot healthier and happier. But finally around January 30th she is back to work! 

I wait a week, obviously the gift isn’t the first thing on either of our minds we are both busy, me with school and her with the work she needs to catch up with. She’s worried she won’t be able to make the bills being a single mom with all the time she took to recover so I understand. But coming up on Valentine’s Day she still hasn’t gone into her safe... or so I thought.

My girlfriend confronts her mom and asks where my gift is... her mom sold my shoes to pay for some of the bills. She never asked my girlfriend and she said nothing to me as if she hoped I wouldn’t ask for the thing I had been excited about for months... I really don’t know what to do about this it really hurts to be betrayed by her mom like that but I know why she sold them... her mom doesn’t know I know yet either.

Her mom did say she would pay back my girlfriend so she could buy a new pair in a month or two, but I’m not sure I can really look her mom in the eyes and not think about how I felt tonight, it just really stings.",16Feb2018,3
150,"This will be a juicy story, so hold on. A month ago I was looking for temporary housing in California and found an apartment with a vegan for a decent price. Parking wasn't included, even though he pays for two parking spaces and only uses one. Normally I park on the street, but no one had been using the spot next to his car for a day so I decided to park there, thinking it would do no harm. Another neighbor parked behind me, in tandem, blocking me in. I had no where to go so I just left it for the night.

Later that night my roommate came back late and hit this other car, claiming he couldn't see it because it was dark and the car is black. It's an enormous SUV, so I'm not sure how he didn't see it. The next day he knocks on my door and says ""Is that your car parked next to me?"" I say yes, and he says ""a neighbor parked behind you and I hit them. You need to pay for the damages. You caused this"". Now this is where it gets interesting. I'm not even on his lease because the landlord wouldn't allow a temporary sublease, so my roommate went out in his own and decided to sublease to me anyway, making me sign an agreement.

In that agreement, it said I was not to park anywhere in the parking lot. But how can he legally hold me accountable for the damage he did while driving his own car? There was plenty of room for him to get around the other car.

He is now threatening me with eviction, because I also brought a can of silk worm pupa (I was curious) into the house and we had agreed it would be a vegan household. He says I can fix the situation by reimbursing him $240 for the damages he caused. This sounds like extortion to me. Any tips on what I should do?",16Feb2018,2
151,"On a dark and rainy night two days ago; I gently bumped into another car while reversing out. I had no pen in the car and seeing as it was 11:30 at night, I ran home to get one. I drove back and left a note with a brief description of what happened, my name and my phone number. I drive by the area regularly, the next day the note was gone but no one has yet contacted me. I checked around the ground and it doesn't look like it blew off. The other car doesn't appear to be damaged other than some white paint being left behind at point of contact. I'm wondering if there is anything else I should be doing? Call the police non emergency line and report it? I really am afraid of just walking up to their door and knocking. The other car hasn't budged. I could leave another note? Or would that be pushy?",16Feb2018,2
153,"I grew my hair long for 4 years thinking that idealistic Lee I was supposed to be like, some kind of musician poet or artist.
Inter 
Growing up in the 90s and listening to rock I just figured that's what you did. Truthfully, and some aspects it has lowered my self-esteem and alienated me from society. There's nothing cool about it really. Now that I'm age 33, not even in a band at the moment, although I haven't ruled that out for the future, everyday as the hair gets longer it becomes a bit more unbearable.

What's the difference? I cut my hair a year ago to see how ...
, I was generally more accepted everywhere I went. I was invited more places, family went up to me and hugged me more. I was approached more by the General Public, in general.

Sometimes when I walk around with my stupid man bun I wonder what I'm doing. Is this really me? I hold some ideal on the inside that, long hair represents I struggle to live a spiritual nature and Rebellion against Society. But then I reflect on that one year when I had it short and how people treated me, and wonder if I really am selling myself short, no reverse pun intended.

I'm not sure if I want to go another year, alienated by my appearance. Life is not about how people look. But there are certain standards that is accepted by the consensus of society. Let your hair grow out long in your early thirties, and you will see the difference. Perhaps if one is established financially spiritually and emotionally, then one can embark on such a mission.

Me? I'm struggling to find purpose in doing it., other than fulfilling a rock dream that has been foggy and distant for many years with financial and emotional hardships I wonder is it even worth keeping it long. I can use any help I can get, meeting, participating and anti-social habits like growing my hair long yes, long hair tends to Direct One to the more antisocial crowd, there's no ifs ands or buts about it.

I'm a right-wing conservative sober person what does that tell you?

So what I'm trying to say is, I've had my hair long for many years. 4 years in fact. Then at age 32, as an experiment I cut it. And it literally changed my life in a way that, I didn't quite trust it first. Mainly, the fact that my life changed so dramatically led me to conclude that there are just certain things in life that are based on outwardly appearance. In fact, many aspects of Life are based on hourly appearance. Things happened that were unexplainable, that I cannot explain to this day simply by cutting 2 feet of hair off myself. 2 
 
 So as my hair grows longer, and I've become more distant. From society and less social and general it is so much more apparent to me maintaining a certain appearance and what it does as a man. And I know what it's going to take to sustain this type of appearance this year if I choose to continue along this path. Truth is, I'm pretty sick of this path in sort of want to join the ranks of the normal clean-cut men of society.
 
 I find my long hair aspirations and thoughts mending more towards the, freakish aspirations of being a rockstar or poet or some kind of spiritual Guru. This is on default. Or perhaps socio-psychological predisposed childhood stereotypes impressed upon me when I was young. Either way, I do miss attention from the ladies, I do miss being more approachable rather than people seeing this unkempt hairy man and think their suspicions, not that I go around like that. I tried to have a positive and pleasant disposition inter 
 
 But let's face it, it is an absolute truth that appearance we'll always have a set of psychological subconscious rules attached to it regardless of how strong we are from the inside, how spiritual we are, being a clean-cut male has its benefits and rewards I suppose. I go against the grain because I like to challenge life. But right now I'm not really feeling the mood to challenge life I just want to enjoy life again.
 Tour 
 I don't want to fall into that stereotype of poetic Wilderness mail, musician poet guy who lives in the wilderness or has to live by the rules of The Lord of the Rings, or whatever category I'm going to be lumped into if I have a man bun and look like a samurai I guess I'm just over there and want to be a man with some Swagger again.",16Feb2018,3
154,"Hey Reddit,
        As a citizen of the U.S. for a decade, I've grown to learn and get accustomed to the society and culture of this country.  However, I subconsciously did not fully integrate, maybe because I grew to dislike some aspects of this society-- aspects such as social circles and dating. Despite having some friends and having had a few girlfriends, I often find myself acting purposely anti-social. I've grown cynical towards people, harshly looking down on ones who I think make terrible decisions - people who get too much tattoos, overly girly women who put too much makeup, people who brag too much, even people who simply try so hard to fit in- quickly blocking them out from being potential friends or partner.
         I am not completely anti-social.  It is uncommon for me to meet someone who actually impresses me, or who catch me on a good mood. It goes to show that yes, I can socialize, but I want to do it better. How do I get rid of this cynical mentality that I have towards this society? What can I do to be more ""integrated""?",16Feb2018,5

161,"Hello redditors,

I need some advice. 

**Background:**

I'm 28 years old, completed my four year undergrad at 22 and had decent job offers. My mom passed away a month after I graduated, and my Dad had been sick for some time. I didn't accept those offers at the time because of the prevailing instability in my family. I thought I'd spend a few months at home and apply in a few months. My Dad got better soon, but then I got ill, enough to not function in the world. I had a tumor and even after the operation, I was really tired, had a foggy brain and it felt like I had the flu all the time. A year became two which became three. I couldn't work at all from 22 to 25. It was hard to adjust to this new reality while all my friends were working at great companies and moving up the ladder.

At 25 I was able to work part-time. I started developing websites for nearby businesses and found a couple of remote clients. I was a good programmer during my undergrad so thought I'd use my skills. I earned enough to survive on my own. When I was 26 I came to know I have a bad enough neurological issue and a sleep disorder, which was another shock. I took half a year off trying to adjust with this new reality version 2.0. The meds wouldn't work, my schedule was erratic, the isolation and not being successful was eating me. Eventually I developed thick skin, tried different treatments and visited many more doctors.


**Current situation:**

I don't think I can work full time, as I need rest and a couple of naps a day, which makes my ability to work around 4-5 scattered hours in the day, for 4-5 days in a week. I've been able to maintain this schedule for some time and hopefully this will remain stable. Now I'm 28, and the amount I've worked in the past 5-6 years amounts to only 1 or 2 years of full time work experience (as I worked part time on and on). There is no clarity if and when I'll be able to work full time. Some of my friends say some employers will accommodate, but I've had negative experiences in a couple I've tried. I'm not in the US/Europe and there are no disability laws etc. here that would help my case.

I see that freelancing is a big industry now and there are remote jobs and projects I can do while sitting at home. Is this the best way for me – to work as a freelance web dev on sites like Freelancer, Upwork? I'm working on building my website and create a GitHub account etc.

I always thought of my earlier freelance work in the past as something I'll do before I get a job – but now getting a job may never happen. I'm way behind my peers but I have the dedication to work as a web developer and create sites/plugins that might sell – though only time will tell that.

Is working on my skills, creating a portfolio and working as a freelancer and taking up remote jobs my best bet, considering I haven't worked in any company or a team?

162,"She watches make-up videos on youtube while I play some games (ML and AoV to be exact, and Summoners War sometimes)

She takes all the internet. We both use the same kind of phone, but her make-up videos continue to load in 720p while I get 460 ms on my games -_-

I try to tell her to lay-off sometimes and let me enjoy the game. I sugested that we share timetables on which we have a schedule on which one uses the net but she refused saying that “Everyone needs to enjoy, you play your games, I watch my videos.” I think her phone uses iCloud which kills the net and I tried suggesting turning it off. She doesn’t know how, and when I offered to help, she blatanty refused (Typical 16 year olds)

My mom and dad back her up saying :

1. “sHaRiNg iS gOoD” 

2. “yOu bOth Use tHe inTerNet, aNd It’S jUsT a gAMe aNYwayS lEt uR SisTeR enJoY.”

I explain to them that I can’t play properly and enjoy due to lags and delays and they dismiss that by saying: “If you hate it that much then move to another household where they have fast internet. Just share and enjoy.”

Oh it makes me want to scrub the smug face of my sister when my parents take her side in the scuffle.

Ahhh she has fun watching her youtubers while I can’t  play. It’s annoying and makes weekends a real hell. My allowance will be killed when I use a data plan so I resort to local internet cafes to play other games, but tbh I’m more of a mobile player

What should I do? How am I supposed to enjoy weekends? I have other hobbies but mobile gaming takes most of my time. I can’t really do much as a small-town teen, no local parks, workshops, basically nothing. My friends also play games and my only other hobby is anime (Did I mention the internet) and basketball (I can’t really play alone can’t I?)

P.S: I’m from the Philippines where middle-class families have 8 mbps internet for 25 $ a month. 50 mbps net?  Forget about it. We have crappy net service here. (Mga bobong hinayupak na politiko na ayaw mag-pa invest ng mga foreign companies kaya ang bagal ng net putsa)



TL;DR: Can’t enjoy weekends due to my sister taking all the connection. Parents dont listen and my other hobbies dont really work in a long-term summer vacation. I can deal with the slow net, really, but the way my parents are so unfair annoys me so hard.

She used to post about how she misses me and she thinks she was in love with me etc. Once she typed a whole paragraph telling me she’s sorry and she really cared about me. Two weeks later she posted that I was a cunt. 

She’s a really manipulative person and even admitted to me she can’t feel guilt or empathy. I wholly believe she’s a narcissist. I used to compulsively check her Tumblr to see if she posted anything about me. I decided last month that I will never check it again and I honestly did so well. As each day passed, the urge to check lessened, but some days the urge to check was really strong but I didn’t. 

Today I cracked. I have her blocked on Tumblr, but it’s easy to access your block list and tap on her name. Today I checked my block list and saw that her URL had changed.

164,"I am a 23 year old female. I was living in a medium city for four years after high school. I was going to community college when my parents just stopped paying in the middle of the semester, so I dropped all my classes. I have intended to go back since then, but I never got around to it. 

I had to split my life between my extremely small hometown and city life after my mom died to help my dad with the family business. That lasted about a year or so until I finally moved home to my small town for good. Now, I am in a year long lease with an online job in a town where I hide from almost everyone I know. 

In the year back and forth, I moved in with my boyfriend at the time. I stayed with him for too long. He was abusive and manipulative. In the wake of that break up, I slept with my neighbor, an old high school classmate, and a best friend I was in love with for years and years. The best friend from high school had me completely convinced we were in love, that his current girlfriend was an open relationship, she knew all about me and our feelings for each other and we would miss our chance forever if we weren't together immediately. I knew he had a baby on the way. Not from his current girlfriend either. I found out his new girl was also pregnant on facebook. AND I STILL SLEPT WITH HIM. It ended in flames, and I was completely heartbroken. I still feel heart broken. I think in my head i blamed all my problems since then on him, but I put myself in the fucking terrible situation. I never thought i would be this type of girl. I never thought I could make such destructive decisions. It's not just the heart break or moving home. I am in a deep fucking hole and I don't know what I want or need to do to change it. I tried lists, goal plans, planners. Nothing works. Nothing even matters here to me anymore. The only reason I haven't run away yet is my three year old nephew. I have a plan for my education. Well, at least I know what I want to do. But, the thought of living here and commuting to the closest school an hour away is terrible. I think the last time I felt happy was when I was 16 and kissed a boy on the football field. I am aware of how pathetic that is. I don't know where to go from here.

 I am planning on moving far away where I don't know anyone and starting over. Probably Seattle. I don't honestly expect anyone to read this. If anyone has bored themselves to death listening to me complain, any input would be amazing. ",16Feb2018,3
165,"Long story short. 

So I had my grandkids for the weekend last week. They know how religious I am, and that I fear demons and any other bad spirits. They make fun of be all the time for being scared of something that you can’t even see. 

Saturday afternoon while I was taking a nap, they brought out an ouija board and started fooling around with it.. The same room I was sleeping in!! I am unaware if they made contact themselves or not, they didn’t tell me about it until the last minute when my daughter picked them up. They came up to give me a kiss goodbye and then quickly but loudly said “We played with a ouija board in your room while you were sleeping, good luck!” and then ran out the door. I didn’t even have time to react/respond. 

Ever since then, I’ve been hearing things throughout the nights. Footsteps, voices, etc. I’ve had things missing. The cupboards have been left opened. I’ve trying praying to God to banish this demon/spirit, but nothing yet. I’m just feeling a very bad vibe in my house and I don’t feel safe anymore. I’m afraid it might get worse. 

What can I do to stop this from happening? I’m thinking about inviting my grandkids over again this weekend so they start to believe. This is their fault after all. I warned them. 

Please, any advice at all. I’m willing to try anything at this stage. ",16Feb2018,0
166,"I (M27) can't connect with people. 

There have been a few events throughout my life that have made me think this. But most recently I started a job and about a week in I met a girl there. She came up to me one day and started speaking to me. Then, we'd smile at each other whenever we would see each other, we started having lunch together, and when we finished she would wait for me so we could leave together. Then she got physically close, putting her body against mine when we were standing somewhere.

I realised something was happening, like that she maybe liked me. But I'm incredibly inexperienced with girls and people in general so I started to Google on how to have interesting conversations, how to avoid awkward silence, how to not be boring etc. so I could be around her more easily and get closer to her.

And the articles I found gave tips like: 

----

* avoid ""interview mode"" where you're just asking them a bunch of questions one after the other

* Avoid negative topics like politics, religion, work, etc.

* Stick to positive topics like hobbies, hopes and dreams, long term career goals, movies and music they enjoy, etc.

* Show you care by asking about how their day was, and get them to talk about the good parts

* Make the conversation only about positive things so the other person only associates you with positive emotions

---- 

But then I thought that this is a really absurd way to go about it because I don't actually care about her or any of those things at all. And I'm not trying to be mean because it's not her who's the problem. She's smart and friendly and warm and attractive and will make a great girlfriend for someone. I realised that I've never cared about those things when it came to anyone. Even if I would ask my mom how her day was, or telling someone happy birthday, I didn't care at all and was only doing it because that's a thing that people do. I realised that I'm like a robot or alien that is just mimicking the outward things that humans do but without the inner emotional drive for closeness that makes people want to connect with each other. 

Note I've gone through my entire life without making a connection with anyone. I think back to social situations especially ones back in school and I was always outside the social situations even if I was right in them. Everyone else always had a ""thing"" going on with each other that I didn't, even when I was right there talking and laughing and joking with everyone else. So I've lost almost all the friends I've ever had and now rarely talk to anyone. 

My social life right now is basically: There's one person who I sometimes text, but again I don't care about them at all and can go months without thinking about them. When I see people who live near me I just say pleasantries. At work I'm friendly with people but I know that if I left this job I would never see these people ever again.

Now after writing this out I doubt it's fixable. Any thoughts?",16Feb2018,4

As far as I can remember, she used to complain about anything that can be complained about (from the way we are cutting our bread, the way we are brushing our teeth, people at work, like... you name it, she did it). And of course that kids are going to learn from parents. I read a bit about this, and some have advised that that I should distance myself from such people, but that is not really possible due to practical reasons. I tried to point out that problem to her, which resulted in even more complaints and a squabble. She hasn't changed since then.

I knew I would be upset but did not think I would be more than that, I was and still am utterly depressed. Today was her last day. I gave her a gift and even planned a dinner after school but she told me she forgot about it and cancelled on me, making me feel very hurt. As a result, I remained blunt to her for the rest of the day thinking it would ease the pain for when she was really leaving for good. I did every now and then show compassion but I would remind myself of her flaking on my plans and become annoyed at her. I could tell she was sad that I was giving her the cold shoulder although she did not know I did that because I am someone who severs all ties before they undo themselves. She thinks that our friendship will last for the remaining two years of high school but I know it won’t, that is why I want to minimise pain as much as possible.

182,"Hey everyone.

First time asking for advice so I apologise if this is a dumb question.

Firstly to clarify, gf (20) &amp; I (23) have been together for almost two years. Before we met and during I have been a recreational/social user of weed. She has never really taken a liking to it mainly because she tried it once and it never agreed with her. I use it to chill out after work and keep my head clear from riddling anxiety, admittedly I used to be quite addicted but I have cut down a lot. She wanted me to quit a while back mainly for money reasons due to loss of work hours, and I did for a while but came back to it as cold turkey wasn't working for me. 

Honestly deep down I don't want to quit it just yet, in the next year or so for sure, but right now I just have so much going on that it is helping me push through (I know this sounds like an excuse to keep smoking it).
The past few weeks she never said a thing about it, I always do it away from her and never too much, spending very little too. Tonight she said out of nowhere that if I buy any more ever again she will simply walk. As this was unexpected it caught me off guard and I wasn't ready, and due to being scared of losing her I just calmly agreed and kept to myself. We love each other to the moon and back, but I can't help but see what she said as slightly manipulative in a way to threaten me out of what I enjoy, because she knows I am wrapped around her finger, I'm hopelessly in love with this girl. (Her mother is extremely manipulative, and people tell me my gf is too but I guess I can't see her the way others do)

I would choose her over weed any day, but she doesn't realise that after 5 years of smoking it has become an addictive habit and dependency for me, and being told something like that is freaking me out, I can't just quit it up and now on the spot, it's not that simple of a battle.

Sorry for the wall of text, I've been holding in a lot of things for a long time, I hope this makes sense.

Please share your honest opinions, if I am in the wrong I want to know, I just need an outside opinion.
Thankyou &lt;3",16Feb2018,2
183,"I don't even know where to start. I don't remember the last time I was truly happy with my life, and I'm only 19 years old. I've always been extremely anxious and depressive, although I've never been diagnosed. I don't really talk to anyone about how I feel. 
In high school I was unhappy. I hated getting up too early, to go to some shithole that I hated. I dreaded almost every day of school, even though I had a lot of friends. I was never bullied, I was actually quite popular. I still hated it. I couldn't wait to graduate and move on. Now, I've been out of school for 1 year. I didn't know what to do after high school, so I started looking for jobs around my town, and landed a really well paying job. I got really ""lucky"" for someone right out of HS. I make good money and have great benefits. Everyone was so happy for me, but I hate it. I hate working, I dread it just as much as I dreaded school. It's factory work which is not fun for me at all. I have to work overtime, so I've been getting up at 4:30am every day. I am just so unfulfilled, I don't know what to do. Every man in my family has worked their lives away in factories and other manual labor jobs. I just don't understand how people can do something they hate, all day every day 40+ hours a week, and then just die. I can't see myself doing that. I am just so unbelievably unhappy. I don't know what to do. I called in to work this morning and now I'm just laying in bed, feeling like a piece of shit, just like I used to do in high school. I haven't even worked at this place for 6 months. I could really use some help .",16Feb2018,5

185,"So my moms boyfriend thinks we are hacked and I mean really hacked. He’s taking videos of things “moving” on iPads and IPhones. Which is near impossible. 

All of this started because he downloaded a bunch of anti-viruses to the Mac, when reality is he downloaded them from random websites and it gave us a virus instead. This happened wayyy before my boyfriend moved in. 

That last bit is important. 

My boyfriend moved in September. He was kicked out in November for reasons. So my parents mainly my moms boyfriend has a problem with him and he has so since the first day he met him even when my boyfriend was friendly before anything happened he was still rude to him. 

Because of his dislike for my boyfriend he thinks that my boyfriend is from California and poor as dirt now is hacking us. Everything from our WiFi and being on it to iPads, iPhones, laptops. Anything. I believe now that he believes that our thermostat is being hacked to which he took out of the wall. 

It seems he has tried to contact the FBI but they either won’t take him seriously or he just hasn’t despite saying he will go to them. 

It’s been taken too far with the thermostat being taken out especially during this time of the year when it’s still pretty cold. Mom she believes everything he says and won’t budge and I can’t just go up to him and tell him that he’s insane and that everything can be fix with a reset and a call to our main provider which is google fiber and not some stupid netgear. 

Only real thing wrong from what I’ve seen is the random device connected. Yes we’ve changed the password multiple times and it’s still there. I don’t know too much about it but I think again it can be solved with a quick call to google fiber/getting someone to our house to look at the stupid thing. 

I need help. I’m tired of this, I’m freezing cold in my own house all because of something that’s not even happening/can be fixed in a split second. 

Edit: only thing that was ever truly hacked was his email but quickly that was resolved 

Edit 2: if it is paranoia then how do I get my mom to go get him diagnosed by a therapist or psychiatrist? She may listen if I talk to her but the moment I call him paranoid I already know she won’t believe me or take it seriously. ",16Feb2018,4
186,"She told me two weeks ago that she’s uncomfortable with me in bed at times because ill sometimes grab her boobs at night, and that on new years it took one too many “no’s” to get me to stop trying to have sex with her(i was very drunk and don’t remember, still no excuse). It was a good night, we were finally on the same page and i felt horrible. Since then ive been working on my drinking and do NOT touch her inappropriately unless we’re about to or are having sex. 

Well tonight that changed. I had nothing to drink and she even convinced me to not take me sleeping pill because she doesnt want me to rely on them(i have to sneak this in somewhere. She is truly the most amazing and supportive girl ive ever known). We go to bed on a great note. This morning she tells me she’s very upset with me. We went to bed on a great note and i slept like a baby without alcohol or a sleeping pill which is always a win for me, so i was confused. She tells me that one time i started grabbing her boobs and touching her groin area so she smacked me hand away and moved to the foot of the bed. I woke up, also switched because she does this from time to time and i of course want to lay with her. Apparently when i fell asleep i again touched her boobs. 

I dont know what to say. I make the person i care for the most in this world uncomfortable without even knowing. When she was telling me this I started to bawl my eyes out because ive been so diligent in making sure she is comfortable, because she is my priority, and now im apparently doing it while im asleep. She hugged me and said repeatedly that she loves me and that we’ll work on it. I just feel lost, i dont know what to do. I still cant stop crying.

189,"So ya im [21M]. To give some context, i belong to a fairly well off family, we have a good business going on and im doing chartered accountancy. I have a beautiful girlfriend and a loving family. i have nothing  to worry about and im fairly happy with  my life.  Being  the only son of my parents. I had a quite childhood  i used to play with my toys all day and in my  teenage years video games were my thing. (my theory of why im not good at my verbal defence mechanisms) during middle school even  though i was a fat and looked intimidating i used to get teased allot, friends used to hide my things  and watched me suffer. 
even when i changed school (because of other reasons)  the new friends i made started roasting me, im not a coward and i think  of these people as my friends, i even got into a fight for a friend who used  to roast me. so ya im not a wuss or a pussy, if some of you think thats the reason i get bullied.
During school most people roasted me because i was fat. but in high school i lost about 40 pounds and got from 102 kgs to 75 kgs. Am currently 74 kgs btw.
The reasons for my roasting changed. (for eg my ex became best friends with a friend  i had in high school so my school friends roasted me by saying  he stole my girl and stuff)
so i have 3 friend groups 1 from school, one at my college and 1 of my childhood friends who were my neighbours.  and guess wat who gets roasted at all of these  places. ha me.
sometimes i give savage comebacks but, my friends  say why am i getting serious about it. seems so conplicated to me how this roasting thing works. 
i think its because of my early insecurities abt being fat and im not that confident enough that people make fun of me. or maybe im too nice to everyone. idk man whatsup. and i know if everyone's  doing it then the problem is with me not them. 
i recently got to know about the power of self deprecation, it works sometimes but i totally zone out when people are roasting me.
Any suggestions?

Edit: Advice on how should i get better at my verbal  defence being witty and funny at the same time? Cutting of friends who roast me is not the solution im looking for.

192,"I did nearly write out the entire story behind this situation and realised it’s super long and complicated... so without being too confusing 

Is there any way to trace back someones Instagram? A crazy ex-best friend of mine (of 3 years, and this has come out of no where) has one or two crazy minions and I have been targeted today by an online Instagram troll. While I’m not trying to give it too much attention, the troll released personal information about me having a miscarriage which is information only my ex-best friend and BF knew about. This is also something that happened 3+ years ago so don’t know why it’s being used now to ‘poke fun’ at me, and even why that sort of thing would be ‘fuel’ to use against someone at all. I’m pretty sure it’s her as BF and I are very private and did not share that event with anyone but my Mum and ex-best friend. Mum would never tell. Ex-best friend is angry because I moved on to healthier friendships so I can see her telling someone or even having a lot to do with this troll.

I think this person realised their fuck up and basically wiped their entire catfish account. Changed the username, set to private, 0 followers and 0 following. I have nothing to go off from aside from the old catfish username and a screenshot of them calling me a “natural baby killer” and a “slut”. The account also only seemed to be created today too as the only post on there (now deleted) was posted today. 

Mostly posting this for BF’s sake because he wants the solid proof that they’re behind it so he can perhaps take it further as he is FURIOUS. I am too but am also sick with flu so less bothered about catching them. Just wanting to know if there’s a chance and how we could trace this troll. Thanks! Sorry if it’s a dumb question!

196,"I've been informed that my basement apartment, and my room specifically, have been affected by a flood that occurred last night. The superintendent thinks its due to a pipe burst with the cold and then the rain on top. My roommate was home to clean it up and move things off the wall. I just had some clothes and textbooks on the ground, but apart from that nothing else was damaged. Long story short, we do not have renter's insurance. This flood is one of the many things that has been added to the list since moving into this apartment at the start of September.
We've had cockroaches twice and had to get our apartment fumigated, our bathtub was not installed properly and we had to deal with what felt like standing on a water bed for a month or so until it was fixed, another flood happened in the beginning of living there that affected my roommate, and we've had issues with the windows and heat where we've had to take matters into our own hands (ie. buying heaters, plastic window covers...). We're basically calling the superintendent a few times a month due to some leak or concern each time.
My question is what can I do about my current situation? Is there anyway for me to think that I have the right to not pay rent for at least a month with all the things that have happened and what just happened last night? Do I get renter's insurance for the last 6 months of the lease or is it too late for it now?

I have known this girl for a long time maybe about 12 years and her and my sister are close friends too (we are both late teens) and from about the last year I started to catch feelings for her but I doubt she feels the same way.
I never told her partly because I am a pussy and partly because I am scared what would happen if it went wrong and we never talked again.

This summer I moved away for college but still come home every 2 months or so and see her. This time while I was home she organised a small party of a few friends to come round hers and drink and eat. Another girl was invited who I knew of but had never met and she was really nice. We were chatting for a little while also drinking and having a good time. I think we ended up getting together but nothing serious happened just a few kisses I think.

As the night calms down we are all chilling out getting ready to leave and the girl who I knew for ages seems a little sad but I just thought she was tired. The next morning when I wake up I am texting her but she just seems to be quite cold and single word answers and when I ask what’s up she just says she’s tired.

Idk what to do but I know that I don’t want her feeling sad and I also feel really bad about last night and wish I hadn’t done it. Is there anyway I can sort this out and maybe also tell her my feelings.

205,"I'm an 18 year-old working at a local restaurant as a hostess. Over the course of seven months, one of the managers has continually made sexual remarks and actions aimed at me. They've ranged from winking at me, making sexual remarks (e.g. ""if I was 20 years younger"", constantly asking if I have a boyfriend, etc.),  brushing past me and ""accidentally"" touching or grazing me, and last night pretty openly grabbing my ass in the back of the kitchen. 


Frankly, I already put in my two weeks notice because I was unhappy there partially due to the harassment and I had always brushed it off as just joking, but now I've learned that he also does this exact same thing to the other hostess, another 18 year-old girl. 


I suppose the obvious thing to do would be to bring it to the owner or the other managers but they're all men. The owner himself is an old Italian guy who does the exact same thing to other women who work there from what I've heard. The only difference is that he goes after the older girls and not us 18 year-olds. I'm pretty sure they would just brush it off as joking, imply I need a thicker skin, and ignore it as I'm leaving anyway.

Him and my mom had a horrible relationship growing up. He was in love with her madly but did nothing to change his bad behavior (neglectful, let himself go, bad temper, unreliable) and my mom I think despised him, and he was aware of it, but they stayed together for religious reasons. Their marriage ended in a bad way once all of us kids were moved out, it's been a few years since then and he won't stop talking badly about her to all of us kids. Every single time we talk, it's always brought up. No one really wants to confront him on this, because we all feel so guilty. He's been in a loveless marriage for pretty much the whole time we've known him, and now he's alone and not in good shape. Everyone who knows him understands that he is in his own world most of the time, and is very stubborn in the way he sees things. It's more depressing than I can even bear at times. I actually kinda get mad thinking about how he could let himself get this bad and do this to us. We've never been able to depend on him. He tries so hard in his own weird way to stay close with us, but if he's not talking badly about my mom, then he's constantly pushing some kind of religious thing down our throats. I have my beliefs as well, but I feel angry any time he tries to suggest things to me because I don't trust any of his advice, or don't want to.

208,"This was in August 2017. 

We met at a camp earlier on in the year and hit it off immediately. The camp ended shortly after- but we decided to keep in touch. We texted every day. Things were awesome, we got really close to each other and back then (and even now) I knew for sure we were already on the road into a great relationship. 

This also unfortunately took place during probably one of the most... overwhelming periods I’ve had in my life so far. My personal relationship with my girlfriend was in tatters- more-so on my side because she just came back from an overseas trip with her school and basically cheated on me with my own best friend. 

This was the second time she had done it to me. She even asked if we could take a break from our relationship so she could try dating him.

Add that to the fact that my course in school was getting really, really tough to get by in. Every week I would have at least 3 or so projects to manage and juggle that had to do with coding/programming, 3D modeling, figure drawing and a few other modules. I’m not exactly a fast programmer so I was honestly struggling to get by. 

My newfound friendship with this person you could say was my sort of... retreat from the real world. Complete angel of a person she was and talking to her was always lighthearted and managed to cheer me up after a long, bad day. 

And like every movie scene that’s exactly where I began to slowly tear this apart on my own without knowing. 

Submissions week. 5 projects with multiple components all due in the same week that would decide if I make it to the next semester. I hadn’t slept for about 3 days straight and was just working and taking breaks. 

This friend was really supportive of me and tried to give me encouragement and I was responsive to it- but it wasn’t really enough for her apparently because I didn’t really say much in return aside from sending her some screenshots of my works just to keep her updated and to let her know that “hey, I’m busy but I’m still here.” 

She did also let me know a little earlier that she liked me more than a friend. 

And then one night right at the crux of my submissions she bombards me with a long text talking about how unappreciative I was and how she feels like I’ve been taking her for granted all along. I tried to reason with her with whatever energy I could have but- she wouldn’t listen. Countless voice messages were sent talking about how she feels like I’ve been kicking her aside and stuff... that set me off. 

I locked my phone and threw it to the side. Continued with what I viewed was more important at the time and just left it there. 

Those completed submissions opened doors to even bigger assignments that I had to manage and gradually I just... stopped talking to this friend. 

And here I am now. Finally free for a little bit. And I feel like an absolute piece of shit for just not talking to her for all these months. It’s been eating me up and I can’t help but feel absolutely horrible about what I had done- what I had possibly made her feel at the time. Especially knowing about her growing affections towards me. 

I feel like I should drop her a text- something... but I also feel like I don’t have the right to. I’d love any opinions on this matter. Thanks. ",16Feb2018,2
210,"Okay the title may be accurate for the most part, but also a little wrongly put. Basically, I need to put together a resume for a part time job. I have no formal work experience. I have volunteered here and there; independently worked to arrange events and stuff (etc.). However, I don't know how to sell all that. Those I worked with (especially when volunteering to represent my university programs; to recruit new students) have told me that I have selling skills unlike any they have ever seen before. Cynic that I am, i never am convinced by their kind words. I feel like the only thing I've ever sold is my dignity by dropping off resumes for the past 2 years without ever getting a job. But I know they are right: I do have skills, I just need a chance to get past the resume dropping part and to the working part. Furthermore, I also don't know what good will charm, charisma and social enchantment ever do for me (in terms of getting a job). Is there anyway to put together a resume for me that will help me at least be called in for an interview?

I just can't do self-praise (unless I'm in a social setting, where I can slip it in as a form of sarcasm; since, I do use humour as a defence mechanism). Although I agree with the great man who told me I'm vey spontaneous and nimble minded, especially when it comes to stressful situations. Other than that, I'm talkative, intuitive, critical maybe. 

In my voluntary works, I have: arranged events, set up events, set out food, serve food, recruit students, record keeping, data compilation, hospitality related stuff and so on. 

Is there any way, someone can help me sell my skills and maybe lie a little to spark interest of employers to take me. I know I can be a perfect salesperson (so if something can be catered to that, it would be great). But otherwise, at this juncture, I just need a job really; so anything will work. 

Thank you in advance! ",16Feb2018,2
212,"I'd like to start by stating I don't need help from my mom, nor do I ask help. That being said, if I needed the help my mom still wouldn't give me the help. This is where I have the problem. My mom currently pays for my brothers cell phone and let's him live rent free. My mom also let my other sister live rent free for years after college. My brother is only 9 months younger than me and my mom paid for a large portion of her house from her ex husband's parents giving her the money. My grandma stated, I wanted it for you AND the kids. I don't think she'd let me stay there if I were to fall on hard times. I have issues with this. I recently called her to catch up and I mentioned having a male friend stay with me to help with bills.

213,"Hi, it's my first time posting here. I hope people will read this. So the situation is, me [18M] and this other ""friend"" [also 18M] are part of a production crew of the esports team of our school. However we're both assigned to different groups albeit in the same creatives department.

Our production head [24M] assigned us to create a logo for another esports team within the production. We have a group chat of the PC, so everyone inside that prod. can contact each other easily.

Days ago, as I chatted with PH about some team name ideas, (he also suggested some) I suggested ""Artisans Gaming"" in which he jokingly rejected. It's fine with me cause the atmosphere around the GC seems pretty chill. 

After the PH assigned said the tasks, my ""friend"" comes up and asks some questions to PH and since I was online at the time he asked me if I already have some ideas in mind. I said no and that I'm still thinking of a team name. Then he said that they're gonna use ""Artisan Esports"". I said, ""you heard that from me"", to which he replied with a laugh and ""that's ours and no one other groups should use it"". I replied sarcastically with ""*ehem* credits"" then the fucker logged out. 

Days after we passed the assignment, our PH announced the selected team name and logo. Their submission was picked and the logo is just a big A in a triangle shield. I was pissed off since that's a big ""fuck you"" to me.  But I can't do anything about it since PH and the other admins chose it. Should I be confronting him about it? Or should I just let it go? 

TL;DR: Me and ""friend"" are part of a production team. Production head gave us a task to create a team name and logo, friend stole my idea and their submission was chosen by the admins. ",16Feb2018,4
214,"Hey guys,

I want to make this post because I'm in a bit of trouble lately. My boss at work wants me to go visit a therapist but I really don't want to. He says that if I don't I can't stay though which means I will lose my job in the very near future. I don't want to go to a therapist because I don't think I need one and it'd be a waste of effort, time and money. 
I don't know how I'd explain my parents that I lost my job and why. I really can't tell them. 
What on earth do I do? I don't feel like there's anything I can do. I really can't go to a therapist because of aforementioned reasons (+ I wouldn't be able to tell my parents I'm going to one anyway) but losing my job is also really bad. 
I'm not doing well in school either. I haven't attended in quite a while and the thought of working on something for school just makes me really sad for some reason. I get really upset if I don't understand things which happens a lot because I'm not very bright.

Thanks for reading ",16Feb2018,3
215,"So I’ll start this off by saying I have two younger siblings each two years apart. I have a brother and a sister. My parents are divorced and I’m currently in my first year of college. 

My parents got there divorce about 3 years ago. I had always stayed in the home I grew up in, with my dad. I often visit my mother where she lives now, a new house. My brother lives with her and my youngest sibling, my sister, goes between parents. 

It’s probably worth mentioning that the reason for my parents’ divorce was because my mother cheated on my father. I’ve never known the full details but I’ve never seen any reason for it. 

Fast forward to tonight, I get a phone call from my dad who long story short wants me to testify in court next month against my mother on the grounds that my brother and sister shouldn’t be able to permanently stay with her because the living conditions aren’t fit for children their age.  This is a fair allegation and I understand my dad fighting over seeing the one thing I know him to actually care about. 

The allegation that life at my mothers house isn’t suitable for kids is true, my mom is severely lenient and not an authority figure which is why my brother chooses to stay there. She gives him and his friends access to alcohol, even though they’re roughly 16 years old. Also, although not nearly as important, she will buy things such as ecigs and such that they aren’t old enough to buy. 

I cherish the neutral relationship I share with my mother and father. Over the phone my dad said something along the lines of “if you don’t do this for me your against me but by doing this you’re against your mother”. I don’t want to be against anybody. I love them both to death and it’s making me sick to my stomach to be forced to make such a choice. 

My father sounded desperate for my help cause he knows by losing this court battle he may never have his kids live with him again. He also mentioned how my mother’s house wasn’t a conducive environment for my sister, being it that she is around a bunch of drunk 16 year olds and he’s right. He said if I’m not doing it for him, do it for her. 

My mother though never did anything to ever directly hurt me though, maybe by cheating on my dad rather than going the legal divorce route. If I did something so hurtful like testifying against my own mother in court, that could mean losing that relationship with my mother for the rest of my life and I can’t do it. 

Guys I don’t know what to do, anything you guys can say to me to give me something to think about or do would be more than greatly appreciated. ",16Feb2018,3

When I was a kid,  I was curious about what porn was,  and I come from a strict asian family. So, I visited a porn website on an office computer (in my parent's office) which was stupid, but being 8 and oblivious I didn't know better. Never had the talk or anything. 
So when they got a call from their office about innapropriate website visits, they confronted me and I caved and lied, saying this other asian kid in the neighborhood told me about the site. 
Apparently he got hit by his own parents and I later found out it was him who trashed my skateboard, because he was mad about me blaming it on him, totally get that. 

Well, we were never good friends to begin with but we lived in the same town growing up so it just made it so awkward. I later apologized to him (over facebook) :T... and then he said ""its fine I thought it was funny"" I asked why he trashed my skateboard then, and I guess he was kinda taken aback on how I knew, and thats where our conversation ended. 

I just transferred to a college that he also goes to. and I thought I just saw him and it wasn't him. But what if I do run into him somewhere, like walking to class? Do I just ignore him and keep walking? What would you do in this situation? I just thought I saw him and I felt so shaken up and so pathetic..

223,"I realize I’m older than most of you but have no-one else to ask for advice. This is long...

TLDR:  my dad (disabled, uneducated, poor, immigrant) asked me for $5K bc he has no money/didn’t pay taxes for the last year. House I grew up in (needs repair, not easy to sell) will be foreclosed on.  I don’t want to be responsible for a grown man, even though I love him  :-(. Alternative is worse- he moves in with me &amp; loses his health insurance. Expects me to do everything for him. 

Background: My mom passed away 10 years ago, shortly after I moved closer (~2hrs) to them. Dad was doing ok but has never had to pay bills, etc. for himself.  It was OK for the first 5-6 yrs bc my brother (now 36) &amp; his family lived in the same house &amp; he paid the bills (dad would contribute, but bro would be responsible for the actual paying.) 

Bro moved across the country &amp; bought his own house, cannot give dad $. No other family can help. My father’s (cultural) expectation is that “the kids will take care of him”.  We never said we would, BUT I told him he won’t be homeless as he could move in to my house (CT) if needed &amp; potentially losing his Medicaid/Medicare to establish residency here. 

Options I’ve considered: 
       I pay/help him pay (he must have cash squirreled away!!!) but then he will perpetually be in the same situation.

      And/OR- We pay &amp; he must sell within the year &amp; take ANY offer &amp; repay me (I think he can only get $35-40K for the house- poor condition, built in the late 1700s??, quiet/small town on the Hudson River- any takers?!  Lol) 

      Bro says he could stay w him for the winter(s) only. Gee, thx. Also has no money/has custody issues. Love my bro but he’s not very responsible/mature. (Family cannot help.)

       OR- house gets foreclosed, he doesn’t get any money, is “homeless”... will move in w me if no subsidized housing is available. There are too many poor/old/disabled people in his area and never enough housing. We’ve had no luck trying to place him. His income is only SS, recently reduced to $700 + SNAP. No savings except for cash he hides, I expect.

What else can I do? Anyone with similar experience??  

Should also mention: 

He was/is a great dad!!! I love him very much but realize I cannot spend my 401k on him and that I have my own fixer upper that needs ALL my money.  I also do not have a family yet of my own and want to get married &amp; have a baby, like 10 yrs ago.  
(I had to end my engagement last year. The guy had anger issues, chronic pain, &amp; was controlling/overall unpleasant after getting engaged. It had to END.) my dad is the total opposite.  My father grew up in Europe &amp; has no education (left at 13 to work &amp; live the “American Dream”, worked 50-60 hrs a week on his feet in for peanuts in the US. Is a citizen/my mom was American. Has unclear diagnosis (after 4 yrs), but has neurological issues/pain and also expects to have someone else take care of him. Ugh.  Please help.

225,"So, around a month ago, some cash my mom had hidden in her room disappeared, it was something like the equivalent of 150 dollars. She accused me and my sister of taking it and was telling us to confess and that it would be fine, I know I didn't take it and I really didn't believe my sister did either. We thought she must have misplaced it or something and she judt completely forgot where or that maybe she spent it on something and she forgot.

Then around two weeks ago she gave me the equivalent of 10 bucks to go and buy her something. I don't remember what it was that she wanted me to get exactly, but I couldn't get it, so when I came back I gave her the money and she left the bill she gave me right on her night table and I saw her do it. The next day the money was gone and same story happened and my sister and I believed the same thing as before.

Now, thing gets weird here. Around her birthday (Last April) I gave her this moneybox that I thought she would love, she did. It was one of those pig looking ones like Ham from Toy Story. I had seen her put several ""5 dollar"" and ""2.5"" bills into it over the course of the year and she knew I knew the money was there. I mean she was very open about it. Now, this moneybox doesn't have that cork thing at the bottom like Ham does, and it's ceramic. So there is no opening it, there's only breaking it.

My mom wakes me up an hour ago yelling at me about stealing the money off the moneybox. I told her it wasn't me, my sister is at school right now so we won't really be able to talk to her for some hours from now. But I texted her and she says she has no idea. My mom noticed the bills weren't there since the coins in there made a lot of noise when she just put a coin in there this morning. I told her to break the box believing the bills were below the coins but they weren't. There were only coins in the moneybox. I don't now how in the world someone took the bills out of that box. I do not have pictures of it since it's smashed now but I imagine it would take quite some effort to take those bills out.

Now, I can rule out that my mom somehow misplaced the bills or something of the sort since I was positive it was there before. And I guess she didn't take it out the box and then forgot she did since taking it out would definitely take hours of effort and doing that is not something one easily forgets.

And now, my fuckup. I did steal from my mom just once around five years ago, I was sixteen, and it was quite an amount. Around ""250 bucks"" and I stole it to buy some things for a party I was throwing. Well obviously that doesn't help me and it makes me the prime suspect, but this time it wasn't me and I have no way of proving it. I really don't want to believe my sister took it but I just don't know anymore.

Important info:

My mom moved to this current house in August and my sister and I live with her.

She never lost money in our previous house.

I was in France from August to November and, to my knowledge, she didn't lose any money during my leave. (Fuck me, right?)

Friends very rarely come over and noone has come over in a month and they have never gone in my mom's room.

We have never lost our keys to this house.

We have no cleaning lady or anything like that.

I am 21 and my sister is 20.

227,"My sister is the oldest of us 4 siblings, and my brothers and I don’t get along with her, but I *really* strongly dislike her. She is a toxic, ugly person who has even made our mom want to kill herself with the thoughtless, selfish things she says. 

She and my parents are super conservative, and they think I’m being the mean one when I don’t want to be around her. I don’t believe that I have to like my sister or pretend to like her when she is around. She spreads hate and ignorance and I don’t want that in my life. 

However, she ignores my wishes and calls me to bitch every week and “tattles on me” to my parents if I ignore her or don’t act peppy every time we speak. She’s 31 years old yet creates more drama than a bratty child in middle school. 

The problem is, she and her husband are moving back to our home city, and my boyfriend is a new realtor who really needs the business. He is working very hard to become their realtor, and I don’t want to screw up his chances. Even though this situation has nothing to do with me, my sister is petty and would make life difficult for everyone if I finally tell her to just leave me alone. 

Should I wait until after they move later this year to break off with her?

How can I tell her that I think she is toxic and I don’t want her in my life, without ruining my relationship with my parents, and my sister causing endless drama for the whole family? Especially now that we’ll be in the same city, I’ll unfortunately have to see her at more family events.

My former FWB kicked my fan (a bougie $50+ one might I add) on two separate occasions while we were getting frisky. The first time he did it, I told him to please be more careful. He was able to fix it that time it was sort of lopsided. The second time, he broke it. It doesn't stand up straight anymore, and the air blows on the ground. He tried to fix it after he kicked it, and then quickly gave up. 

For context, here is the reason we aren't sleeping together anymore: Last week, his friend came up to me at a party and told me my FWB thinks I'm crazy (completely out of nowhere...it was so weird. His reasoning for thinking I'm crazy was even weirder). I texted my FWB and very calmly said I felt disrespected, and that I wouldn't want to keep sleeping with him if he had said that. He didn't respond. 

Despite being a non-confrontational person with no backbone, he is typically very polite. I think there is a high chance that he'd pay for it.

Whenever I go places,like to the park or even to restaurants people ask me where I am from or if I am from same country as them. Especially at school they ask me like a million times where I am from.
The problem is that I am not Brazilian. I am actually Mexican. But I lived in Brasil all of my life I was even born there and i consider myself Brazilian. Even my parents, grandparents lived there for years. 
Over there I didn’t have any problem with my ethnicity and there if you speak Brazilian you are considered Brazilian no matter if you are black, white ect, so no one used to ask me.

I feel very bad to lie but i never considered myself Mexican only ever Brazilian and I am more proud of being a Brazilian then of where I am real from. I am thinking if I should tell them so they leave me alone because whenever they ask I say, why does it matter?

Long story short, the bailiffs will be here Wednesday morning to evict me. I would appreciate any advice because as a single person there seems to be few options. 

I've only lived in my current town for 2 1/2 years and I work in another so the council can't help with anything, they only help after 3 years residency or if you work in the town. (Wish I knew that before I went to see them) My family live to far away to travel to work, and the landlord is owed 5k and so understandably won't negotiate. As soon as I tried to discus a solution with him he refused and hung up. I could maybe stay at a friends for a night or 2 but no longer.

The problem is I just hadn't planned on moving immediately. I do work as a self employed delivery driver but at the end of January they told me I was no longer needed. I found out on a Thursday as I left work and the Friday was my last day. In fact it was a blessing in disguise. It lead to a long conversation that if we hadn't had, I honestly think I would have come home this Wednesday to find I'd been evicted.

She says i'm negatively influencing my SO, (even though i got him his first job in his profession after 6 years of doing really bad jobs that were unrelated to it,) and that i should ""go solve my problems alone and fight my own fight"" (,no idea what she means, I never told her about my life, but she keeps saying that lately).

The thing is, i'm very poor, and have some health issues too, so i can't get a proper job yet, therefore we're renting a room in a house that's in terrible conditions that if i listed here, the already long post would become a lot longer. We can't afford a better rent because of me not making enough money, and moving home isn't an option for me (where my dad lives there are no jobs i could do, and he wouldn't pay for my train and bus tickets). Despite the bad conditions the landlord wants to make the rent fee more expensive and we won't be able to pay it. 

Therefore we need to move in the next few months. My SO's grandma moved out of the country years ago and she has an apartment here in the city. She's letting the neighbor's son live there, who's a 50 years old alcoholic with no job, his elderly mother (in the neighboring apartment!) pays the rent(edit: not rent, the bills, sorry.) for him and feeds him. The apartment is a public housing(?) apartment, and the government wants to take the house away because the person living in it isn't a family member. 

My boyfriend's grandmother said that she's not letting us live in that apartmen because ohh, there's someone living there already... And oh also the government might want to take it away anyway... Then she immediately starts talking about how god maybe wants me to part ways with his grandson, and has other plans with him.

I have no clue what to do, i'm not the best talker, moreover i'm terrible at social things. No one i asked could give me advice so far. 

Would maybe telling her we would even pay rent to her help? Or i should talk to her so she'll know i'm not such a bad person? We don't want to like take that apartment forever, don't get me wrong, i'm not an a-hole gold digger. If i can get my illnesses treated i'm going to get a better job and we'd leave and look for another rent if she doesn't want us there for long

I'd be glad to hear any ideas you have, even if it's unrelated to the question. Thanks a lot in advance!

Tl;DR:
Must move away, boyfriend's grandma has an apartment that she doesn't use, but won't let us rent it from her, but we don't really have other choices. Need advice on what i could do, what i could say to her, or really anything else that would potentially help in any way. I don't mean forcing her or anything.",16Feb2018,2
245,"My parents are absolutely helicopter parents (self admitted) and I’m sick of it. 
I’m 21 years old and due to the fact that my campus is 5 minutes away from their house, I still live with my parents, and because I’m paying for school, I don’t have my own car. 
But they still treat me like I’m 12. This might be because I’m an only child, but I’ve basically got no freedom. 
They go through my stuff, they still for whatever reason try to tell me what I can and can’t spend my money on (I don’t pay this any mind but when I spend money on something they deem “wrong” they yell at me and we end up getting into a huge fight), they talk to me like they’re talking to a little kid and they treat me like that too.

247,"I’m 26 year old male and my boyfriends 23 and on Valentine’s Day it was brought up that he wants an open relationship with guidelines. We have been in a relationship for 5 years and he’s been my first and only while he’s had both male and female encounters before our relationship. We met on a sex terms basis as me a top and him versatile and made a romantic relationship out of it. I feel we have both been honest and truthful to each other and I appreciate his honesty still after this confession. This was brought up as an option and is not a demand from him. He also said that he was ok with not doing this. I know we can both “win” from this agreement however on my end the “win” gets complicated. I will never know how it feels to be with a woman unless I try right? Yet what if I’m comfortable our relationship as it is now. If I say no, am I being fair to him and his needs? Or if I say yes will my needs be fulfilled?

I feel disgusted in myself that I cannot satisfy all his needs however I do understand it’s not fair for me to get 100% what I want sexually and for him to only get 50%. The percents are valued as that I enjoy toping and he enjoys both toping and bottoming. Yet with us he is left with bottoming the majority of the time. I have bottomed for him before about a dozen times but it has proved to be a strain on both of us. I love him. I love him enough to take this chance for better or worse. 

With the guidelines it would consist of him being able to top other men while I have the liberty of toping women (since I have not experienced this). Also we would have to contact one another to get there approval and afterwards let them know of the outcome as a debriefing. Also these encounters would be one time hook ups. I see this as fair yet previously I’ve not had any urges to try out heterosexual practices and I know once he steps over those boundary’s with his first encounter ( with my approval ) I would have to force myself to find a partner just to make it even in my mind.  Not in anger but as I see it, if he’s enjoying another body and I’m just enjoying us then it feels as if it’s agreeable cheating. Not at all am I tryin to play the victim or in addition trying to make him as the wrongdoer but I’m very conflicted with this. We have talked about it for the last 3 days and it seems easier to see as a reality even though there is a little hurt inside of me. In addition I want to just “get it over with” so we can either move on with this together or me move on by myself. 

On a side note my mother and father are divorced and cheaters. My mother started since I was born while my father began in my high school days. They divorced the first year of my relationship with my boyfriend. I never wanted to be like them in this manner. I felt so happy to give myself to someone that could only have me. Yes I wasn’t his first and that hurt in the beginning yet I had overcame the jealousy and found that he could only have me as my achievement. Now with the open relationship on the table I feel as my value to just being his is now worthless.  I value our relationship more than anything in this world.  I want him to be happy and I know that I need to be happy as well. I know once the line is crossed my feelings will change. For better or worse I do not fully comprehend but I know it will be different. I’ve told him I would most defiantly try to make us work after the deed is done. However I know that I’m worth something and must respect myself by ending the relationship if this is too much for us.

It’s just skin right? He’s had experience with others like I said in the beginning and has told me he can distinguish the difference between love and lust. He loves me. Wants to grow old with me and see the world. And he said that what he will be open to with other men is just to top and leave. No strings attached. 

I don’t feel like I’m being manipulated at all.  And I know if I text more I’ll probably start rambling more than I am now. Thank you all for reading this message and thank you in advance for any advice you could throw my way. If there are any questions I will answer them as fast and clear as I can.

249,"(Very sorry for how long this is...) I had an interview on Monday for a job I want very badly. My first interview was on the phone and the guy told me I'm definitely one of the top candidates. So I had my in person interview on Monday and it went well, but it was...different? First he had me write down 5 questions I wanted him to ask me. Already I knew this wasn't going to be a typical interview. When he came back into the room, he said he believes a person's personality is as important as their skills/experience when it comes to fitting in at the workplace. He said the first half of the interview is a lot of personal questions and I don't have to answer any of them if I don't want to. 

The very first question was about personal challenges I've been through and how they made me who I am today. I tried to keep things vague, but the second question, which I don't recall exactly, didn't leave me much choice, but to go into more detail. So...I revealed my battle with Crohn's. I quickly read the situation and made a calculated risk because I felt like it was the best choice from the options I had. I could have kept citing ""personal struggles"" which sounds either A. vague and suspicious or B. like I actually haven't had any personal struggles and I don't want to sound like I've had some perfect life. Or I could have made up a personal challenge, but I didn't want to lie and I couldn't think of one quickly enough anyway. Or I could be open and honest about my health issues and let my past cite what a strong person and hard worker I believe I am. I did not go into gory details and I stressed several times that I've been working full time for seven years and have overcome the road blocks life has put in my way. I said I've done things people said I could never do and I've fought to make something of myself and be successful. 

Also, if I don't get the thumbs down for the health problems, he kept asking questions about conflict in past work places. I eventually opened up about my last boss who was verbally abusive to me and many of his employees. I did NOT bash him or call him a bad person. I just talked about how he was difficult to work for at many times and although I'm grateful for the opportunities I was given there, I also feel like it was time to move on. I talked about how working for someone like that was difficult but a great learning experience. 

At the end of the interview, I asked him a very basic question about the company structure and he could have answered in a few sentences, but he talked for 15-20 minutes about his past. He mentioned personal and professional points including how he couldn't play golf when he was young because he had his ""own personal struggles as a child"" implying health problems. I really feel like he went into detail to make a connection and be open with me like I was with him. 

I actually felt pretty confident on the drive home, but all week, I've felt worse and worse about my chances. I go from beating myself up for what I revealed to telling myself it was the best decision I could have made given the circumstances. Anyway, I know that was a lot of detail to give, but I had to do so in order to get advice on a follow up email. I want to thank him for his time and somehow stress again what a great fit I think I'd be despite my past yet without dredging up the health problems in detail or indicating in any way that I'm ashamed by what I told him. 

I think I've already 98% accepted I won't get the job, but that 2% is holding out hope and thinks an email would help. I'm honestly just really sad. The asshole boss fired me 2 weeks after giving me a large raise and after I busted my ass for him for 2 years. I was completely blindsided and he wasn't even the one to fire me because he doesn't have the balls. I've been unemployed for 2.5 months now and I probably only have a couple more months till I'm in trouble financially. I have a daughter to care for and this job isn't just an ""I need to make money"" job. I think I'd absolutely love it and I would fit in so well. Every time I think about it, I get emotional knowing I probably blew my chances. Again, I'm sorry this is so long. I just really want to follow up and I have no idea what to write to him.

I made an okcupid and started messaging men from all over. Most don't respond. One who did is 26 and I think he might just be looking for friends.

I’m a sub for schools. I have potentially two different long term sub positions offered to me. 

The first job has a woman  going on maternity leave and they need someone  to fill her spot desperately. I’ve never been to the school and would no one and would be pushed into active full time teacher for that time frame. This would start in March

With the second school, I know everything there is to know. I’ve worked several times there and the principal loves me. I have no doubt they’d hire me. The issue is the job isn’t as 100% set in stone as the first. The teacher believes she will will be leaving in March, but she isn’t sure. 

I would prefer the second school, but I also don’t want to miss out on the first school if the second school falls through.  The first school needs to know my answer soonish because the first teacher leaves in March . Overall, though, it won’t suck too bad because I can still sub short term, on daily basis, if I don’t get either job.

267,"I’ve been working at my current company for about a year and a half now. You’d think that this would be short considering I haven’t worked here that long, but with the way that the company is run and handled creates a lot of tension between everyone working here. Honestly, the tension has been here since before I started working here. My dad has been with the company for over 30 years, and he’s the reason I got hired in. 

We’re a family owned and operated business, co-owned by 3 brothers who haven’t gotten along in years. The oldest one, who I’m gonna call Tom, is the acting president of the company, and the other 2 brothers, I’ll call them Ed and Rob, work on the main sales floor and deal with customers who come in and who call. Them, along with Ed’s son, who I’ll call Brian, run the “parts counter”.

My dad is the head manager of our outside sales team, but this has nothing to do with those guys. They’re the best people to work with and they understand the frustrations of working with the 3 brothers.

So now I’ll kick off the part where I bitch about them.
When I was hired in, everything seemed great. I was hired as a part time cleaner, but about a month or two later the lady who ran the shipping, receiving, and inventory walked out. I was asked if I would like to fill her position, and I did because it was better pay, more hours, and benefits. 
That’s when the problems started. 
I was trained by a guy who I’ll call Bob, but then he ended up walking out a month later. I was never properly trained because really only Bob and the lady before me knew the exact details of my job position. So I was basically on my own after Bob quit. Ed tried to teach me as much as he could with the shipping stuff, but I really just figured it out on my own. Another part of my job is handling the invoices we get from our vendors. I personally didn’t feel qualified enough to handle that portion, but everyone just shrugged it off and left me to handle it. I was never really trained.
So basically I was left to my own devices in a position I knew nothing about.
My full job description (I guess?) is shipping, receiving, inventory, invoices, cleaning, and answering phones. 
Some days I get so overwhelmed with everything that I’m supposed to do, I end up not doing other portions that need to be done as well. I’ve dropped many comments to my coworkers, boss, and dad about hiring someone to answer phones, do the invoices, and handle the other computer related tasks that I don’t feel comfortable doing, or just don’t wanna do. I would much rather handle the shipping department, cleaning, and inventory, because I like being on my feet and active during the day. I hate sitting around. Because of that, I tend to get the active tasks done before I sit down at the computer to do that stuff. Nothing has been done, and I’ve barely been acknowledged for that idea. 

Last week, I heard talk of wanting to hire someone else for our repair department, which I personally think is stupid. If anything, we need someone on our “parts counter” team, because there’s only 4 of them, and we get very busy some days. Brian is already trained to do repairs, so why not hire someone to help with the parts department in case he has to run back and do repairs some days? I’ve said that to multiple coworkers but they’ve all shrugged it off.

But wait! There’s more!

I’m sure everyone has had coworkers who they absolutely cannot stand because of difference of opinions, or you just flat out don’t like their personality. That’s the problem that I have with Ed and Rob. Honestly I have a problem with all of the brothers because of how they act toward each other, and the fact that there’s no communication between them whatsoever, but that’s a moot point. 

Whenever there is a difference, everything halts and no further progress on the topic is made. There have been yelling matches with loads of profanities thrown by all the brothers towards each other, and there’s literally nothing anyone can do to calm or resolve the situation. 
I have had quite a few problems with them, some that are still going on. 

Rob doesn’t like when people just sit around. He doesn’t like when you look like you’re not doing anything. I’ve been yelled at by him multiple times for being “lazy”, most notably for tying my shoe one morning when the phone was ringing and I had literally just gotten in the office.
Like I said before, I handle the inventory. Which means I take care of fitting new inventory in on the shelf and tagging the items. One day after reorganizing an entire product line and putting the items in numerical part order, he told me I was “making things worse” because I couldn’t fit 3 bigger items on the bottom shelves and they were too heavy for me to put on the top shelves. That’s something that has always stuck with me. 
He’s also the type of guy who will burp really fucking loud and not say excuse me, but instead will say “woah” or “what’s that noise”, which was funny after the first 2 months I started working here, but now it’s just fucking gross.
Rob is also very politically opinionated, and will openly talk about politics and stuff with customers, in front of customers, and with other coworkers. If you can’t guess already, he voted for Trump. Pretty much everyone here but me voted for Trump. There’s been a number of arguments because of the discussions he’s started. 

Moving on to Ed. 
He’s not really as bad as Rob, but he’s a micromanager. Pretty much every project I’ve taken on with organizing inventory or just cleaning up our sales floor, he has to butt in and give an opinion of it. There have been times where I’ve finished like, hanging products up on the slat wall and three days later he will have it all moved a different way because “he likes it better”. It’s really fucking annoying and it makes me feel like shit because it comes off like my work wasn’t good enough. One day when I was on vacation, he took it upon himself to reorganize a product line I was intending to take care of when I got back from vacation. He said nothing to me about wanting to do it before I left, never said a word to me about it when I was off work (he could’ve texted me, we all have each other’s numbers), and brought it up to me when I came back. I was fucking furious. It was like he didn’t even want me to have a chance. 
He hovers whenever I get UPS in in the morning, setting boxes in front of me whenever I get one done. Since Ed started doing that, now his son Brian does it which is as equally annoying. 
Ed will also whistle at me whenever he wants my attention. I have made a comment before saying that “I have a name, I’m not a dog”, but he still continues to do it. Ed really is just annoying, and I’m not sure if he knows he is or not. 
I know that pretty much everything I’ve mentioned so far has just been petty shit I’ve been annoyed with over time. 

With those individual situations aside, I’ll address the fact that I’m a girl, and this industry is very much male-dominated. I’ve had customers who have made sexual comments to me, in front of my coworkers, and they have done nothing. I mean, I’ve told the guys off or just ignored their comments, but still. It’s obvious that I don’t want that attention, and my coworkers know I’m gay.
I’m constantly asked if I want to be helped, or they’ll go out of their way to do my task for me. I understand that some people would love this, but I’m a very independent, introverted person. I like most parts of my job because I can be alone. I’ve said no every single time I’ve been asked if I need help. But shit like that continues to happen. There will be times where a certain task is done by someone else even though I’m the one who should be doing it.

I guess this is where the advice portion kicks in. 
My company doesn’t have an HR department. I really only have my dad to talk to about this stuff, and he can only do so much. With communication lacking between everyone here, I don’t know who to talk to, or if anything will get done since all 3 of my “bosses” don’t get along. 
I think that some, if not most, of the behavior here and shit that’s gone down needs to be addressed and that some serious things need to be done for everyone to benefit and grow. It’s like this job hires you in and because of the constant annoyances and disrespect, it just wears you down to make you stay. I don’t have intentions of staying with this company, because this industry just isn’t my thing. I’m not even sure what I can do about it. That’s the advice I’m looking for. Is there any way I can talk to someone and get shit set right without having an HR department?",16Feb2018,2
268,"Ok guys, this is a bit of a long one, so bare with me while i try to explain this chaotic mess.

Let's just start with me, so essentially I am a 16 year old girl, and I have already lost my virginity.

I have a close friend(16M) and he has a girlfriend. His girlfriend constantly cheats on him; and he is aware of this, however, due to circumstances he is unable to break up with her. I have had multiple conversations with him in regards to sex, and my own sexual frustration; when he suggested that we become friends with benefits. He is not sleeping with his girlfriend due to the whole cheating scenario.

I am tempted to accept his offer, however the fact that he has a girlfriend is putting me off, however he is trapped in the relationship; and therefore unable to break up with her. We are both quite mature for our age and it is unlikely that we will catch feelings for one another.

I just want to know what you guys think in terms of what I should do, and whether you think it is acceptable to have a friends with benefits relationship at 16.

So, my boyfriend recently broke up with me on the 26th of January due to my “insecurities” over social media (not knowing or understanding that he feeds them and with that being said.. how can I overcome them when you keep giving me reason to feel a certain way) so we broke up for 3 days.. he went on a dating app, (every time we break up now he goes for dating apps and try’s to get attention from women online by adding and liking all their photos” he went on a follow spree and followed tons of people on his IG. &amp; then 2 days later sends me this huge text about how he really cares and wants to be with me but I need to stop questioning and assuming and trust him this and that. (He has done things in the past to break my trust or make me skeptical about a situation or someone) ex: the dating apps. (That’s a whole other story) anyways we talked for two hours that night and then we agreed on working things out. We talked about how on social media out of respect to each other maybe we shouldn’t like certain pictures of the opposite sex. Sure look all you want but sometimes, liking can send the wrong message to the person in the picture. And he agreed!! Example/current situation: he followed this girl on January 27th.. the day he asked me to come over and talk. She posts nothing but workout pictures and videos mostly in her sports bra and shorts and some in tanks or t-shirts. Not that it matters too much because most people workout in those types of clothes, anyways. Ever since that day he has been constantly liking all of her photos.. mainly the ones of her in sport bras. But when she post logs of her running and stuff he doesn’t like it? ... every day for the past 2 weeks he’s been liking her pictures and even went back 2 months and liked pictures of her at some work party in a tight dress. (Would that not send some type of message/signal to her?) like you’re snooping 2 months back into her stuff and liking her pictures when you just followed her 4 days ago. Usually if a guy does that to me he’s trying to get my attention. Maybe I’m also in the wrong here because I have been “spying” on him through another account due to the fact that he has blocked me and removed me from all social media accounts for my past “stalking issues” but I wouldn’t call it so much stalking even tho that may be the right term for it however, I noticed a pattern and now it’s like I have to look. I have to wait for her to post new pictures to see if you are or aren’t going to like it.. I do it honestly in hopes that he won’t like it so I get some type of relief/reassurance  knowing you’re happy with me &amp; satisfied with the way I look because before he never used to do this. Now it’s just like he doesn’t care about my feelings at all. Every time we fight or he fed mad he goes and does this. But for the past week we have been good and he’s still doing this? Him not constantly liking a females photos to me would mean that he’s respecting me and my feelings and actually cares about our relationship and how it could possibly make me feel if I saw it. He himself in the past is the one who said “I don’t like women’s pictures out of respect to you unless they are really close friends” okay, I agreed. Then he also mentioned the weekend we talked things out and previous times before.. “if you see me constantly liking someone’s pictures then okay you can come at me with it and I would understand but I don’t do that” well.. he’s doing it and it’s really eating me up inside and idk if I should just let it go or if I should approach him with it. I’m almost scared to because he’s got a bad temper and can’t control himself when it comes to things like this. He instantly gets verbally abusive . (He tells me Extremely rude things) breaks up with me, turns it all around on me, makes it all my fault beats me down about my insecurities not realizing that he’s not perfect either and that if he didn’t do these things maybe I wouldn’t feel a certain way. Like okay you liked 1 or two of her pictures fine. But no, he’s liking every single one for the last 2 weeks and then going back 2 months to like others it’s just not sending the right message.

I have talked to friends/ family men and women, they can see both side sometimes and some don’t think it’s right and out of respect to their gf/bf they keep from liking pictures that they know would affect their S/O 

TLDR; my boyfriend for the past 2 weeks has been constantly liking this girls workout pictures/videos on IG. Even went back 2 months and liked a picture of her in a tight dress at a work party (he just followed this girl 4 days ago) He told me to never approach him about social media EVER unless I have valid proof of him doing something wrong and if I he was constantly liking a females photos that he would then understand where I’m coming from. Well it’s really bothering me and idk if I should say something or if I’m just over reacting but I feel disrespected and hurt. He calls me insecure but doesn’t realize that things like this trigger those types of things for me. If I talk to him he’s instantly going to lash out and turn everything around on me and make it all my fault for “ stalking him” because I been using someone else’s account to find this info due to the fact that he removed me and blocked me from all his social media accounts because of my past “stalking” mind you... he has done his fair share of stalking of past girlfriends that I have caught him doing twice now but of course.. it’s different when I do it to him. But it’s totally okay for him to do it to people he’s dated or been engaged to in the past.

SO, Please don’t be rude but if I’m over reacting let me know and if not, How do you think I should approach him about it because I’m already at fault for “stalking him” and I KNOW he’s going to say that and probably end things with me but it’s really bothering me and I can’t keep holding it in and try to remind happy when he’s around with this in the back of my mind.


** Edit; because some of the comments on my other post are already making me look just flat out crazy for no reason. ..........so, just a week ago, 4 days after he asked me to go over and talk to him to work things out he messaged a girl on fb and was talking to her, talking crap about me calling me his “ex” when we were clearly together and he was telling her “I crushed hard on you back in the day” talking about if she remembers when he asked her to go hangout this and that and the conversation was brought up after she had mentioned her and her bf broke up 2 days prior.. then he asks why and one of her reasons was because the bf didn’t want to pay all the bills and my bf just stopped messaging her after that and all of a sudden came back to me being nice and what not after he was being really weird and kicking me to side I couldn’t understand why but it was all clear once I saw this because he was distracted by someone else until he found out what she likes and he wasn’t about that. So I honestly feel right now that I do a reason to “stalk” and feel a certain way because I don’t feel 100% secure in our relationship right now. Most people would say well then just leave. But I love him and I want to try to make to make things work even if most think I shouldn’t. I’m trying to move past what happen and forget about it but with things like this happening it’s not going to be easy plus I feel like he’s now adding to what’s already happened.",16Feb2018,2

271,"What’s up everyone, so two things. One: I was at a concert last night which me and my friends thought would be majority of kids our age. Turns out most of them were slightly older. But this group of girls from a near high school were there so we went and talked to them. So I did my thing and started talking to the hot one, and she was grinding on me the whole concert. It got to the point to where I was fingering her thru her jeans. This went on for about an hour. They had school the next day and we had off so they had to leave immediately after the concert, but we kissed and left it at that. So I guess the first question is what you guys think of this, was it a one time thing or can I potentially make it more. This was the first time I broke out my comfort zone and approached a girl like that, especially going to an all guys school. 

Second: I’m pretty sure I’m the only teen that is horrible at Snapchat and texting. I’m a lot better in person than over a phone, but She snapped me a picture of her face, so I responded with “hope you enjoyed the concert” and then we talked for a bit about nonsense. When is the next time I should hit her up, I want to see her again. Should I start a streak with her? Sorta looking for advice. ",16Feb2018,1

I’m a 20 year old guy from England and I’ve been home for around 2 months since working in Vancouver. I’m struggling to find a job now that i’m home and with 21 creeping up on me I had this dreadful, looming feeling today, which was that I should probably have a career in sight. But I literally have no idea what I want to do with my life. I’m tempted to move back over to canada, get back into that job (it was just retail) and try out something stupid that i’m passionate in (acting and music) whilst working this job. I know it’s a long shot and obviously I should have a back up plan and try and find myself a good career, but should I do it now in case I regret it?

274,"Wall of text incoming, as there’s a lot to cover here.

About a year ago I took a job as a grocery supervisor at a small health/organic focused store. I’ve been working in the grocery business since 2011 and I’m good at what I do, so getting the job was pretty easy. Pay was _okay_ to start (though minimum wage in my province will be more than what I make now by 2021), but it was full time and I legitimately love what I do and am fairly knowledgable about organic foods, vegan/vegetarian dietary needs, etc. 

The grocery manager was kind of a weirdo, and knew very little about what he was doing. Discontinued products from the store ad nauseam because “they don’t sell” (despite transaction reports directly to the contrary), would refuse customer requests for products, would only ever order something if it was completely out of stock (so half the department would be empty for days and weeks on end), would never bring in new products at all, and just in general went about department operations in stupidass ways. His practices contributed (there were other factors too, which I’ll get to later) to the store’s sales plummeting to about a third of what they were before he took over. Me and him started clashing on things within weeks. To top it off, he treated me like a grocery clerk with a title and not a supervisor.

Anyway, maybe two months into my tenure, he peaces out. Leaves me no instructions on how to do anything. I’m put into de facto control of the grocery, dairy, and bulk departments while they begin searching for a grocery manager. They don’t find one. After a few weeks I throw my name into consideration for the job as I was basically doing it anyway.  It was a stumbling process, but after a few months I became confident in my role. Sales were slowly climbing. My merchandising was on point. I’ve developed good relationships with vendor reps. I regularly bring in new products and most of them end up being hits with the customers. I’m an absolute boss at scheduling (I maintain constant coverage in the department and added coverage during peak times while still coming in extremely under my weekly hours budget). I’ve managed to get the department spending almost bang-on to what the company’s margin expectations are. I’ve done all of this since last spring, while having the potential position dangled in front of me because they want to “see what I can do.” In December I finally get told that, despite meeting all expectations, I’m “not ready” and “too inexperienced” for the position and that I was never really being considered in the first place, I’ve just been in the role so long because they can’t find anyone else. I ask for a raise as a gesture of gratitude for how much I’ve turned things around for the store. I’m told no. During my tie with the store, I turned down a grocery manager job and a grocery supervisor job that I was headhunted for by a couple other stores out of a bizarre sense of loyalty.

Yesterday they hired a grocery manager. I haven’t met the guy, but I know that his experience in the grocery business was being a dairy supervisor from 1998-2003, and has been working a trade ever since. He’s already been rude to the cashiers at the store in his exchanges with them. Furthermore, I’m told he knows absolutely nothing about organic/natural food. I’m expected to train him when he starts next week (as I am literally the only person in the store who knows how to do most of the ordering or admin stuff in the department, hell I’m the only one who knows which products come from which vendors). I was given the option to take the rest of the day off with pay. I did, and told the CEO he can give me the entire weekend off with pay too, and he agreed. No stock will be ordered during this time. No admin stuff will be done. The department will come to a standstill. My staff think it’s bullshit I didn’t get the job, and my standing orders for them in my absence were “do whatever you guys want. Go whole hog.”

I kind of just want to say “fuck it” and leave them scrambling to figure shit out while I walk away. Downside is I have no immediate job prospects and not a lot of savings, so the financial aspect could become an issue quickly. What should I do? Quit? Wait? Swallow my pride? Order ten pallets of short-dated milk as a parting gift?

Other happenings in this store/company: the cash manager was recently fired for not working Christmas Eve (family man) which has kind of soured everyone in the store. The store manager is facing rather significant sexual harassment charges. The company regularly doesn’t pay vendors for deliveries, so we frequently go on hold or lose vendors altogether.  The CEO fired the entire HR department to cut costs and declared himself the HR representative for all staff members company-wide. The list goes on.",16Feb2018,2

276,"Long backstory ahead.


This happened a few days ago, I should mention we have a son as well.
My wife and I met in 2014 and we clicked immediately. She was very sweet and kind but as we moved forward in our relationship it became apparent she had anger management issues among other things.
We got married in 2016, in between that time she convinced me my family were toxic people and slowly began to convince me I did not have time for hobbies or friends and despite having a job and doing things around the house that I was lazy and unsupportive. During this time she kept in full contact with her exes and I was unaware she was still in a relationship with her previous ex when we met and started dating. She also slowly turned physically abusive months before the marriage but there were medical reasons or ""she would do better and was sorry"" so I stuck around.

We learned we were having a baby a few months before marrying, and although she was happy it never lasted more than a day, or even an hour. I soon lost all comfort as she would leave the temperature in the house at a pretty warm temperature, affection became non existent as I did not ""deserve it unless I did something good"" and slowly started becoming sleep deprived  from her asking for a massage every hour of the night and eventually had to stop working due to such a bad work environment as well as her taking every second she could for me to do chores or massages or anything that I would run late every day.
I eventually found a new job and got paid really well and worked over 50 hours a week, we were living in a hotel at the time after being evicted three times in the span of a couple of years and living with her mom. Then a few days ago, I totalled my car and my air bags did not deploy, and my wife and her mom picked me up and she treated me like she was very concerned and worried. Then the next day told me I need to work nearby and told me where to work, where I would be on minimum wage and part time. I have more qualifications for other kinds of jobs that were hiring well within the same walking distance if not closer and I had mentioned this and it angered her a lot. She got over it but then it was brought up a few hours later and she decided to fight with me. It ended with her pretty much saying that my best friend of about 18 years was tired of being my friend for the second time and in fact, all of my friends and her friends were sick of how much of a deadbeat I am to her and that I'm abusive and gaslighting her. I have not had time to play video games or go out with friends or do anything outside of work, chores and taking care of our son yet she has time to text her friends and go out with them a couple times a week. I conclude that because I don't talk to anyone but her really she must be talking to them and I left the room to let her cool off and I was depressed already. I come back a few hours later to find she had left to go out with friends and her mom was home. The door was left open so I open it and her mom asks how I open it and I'm not supposed to be here. The room is almost empty and I ask what is happening. She says to get out so I take my jacket and leave but come back, I knock on the door a few times them police suddenly show up and escort me off the premises. I break out in tears because I don't know what's going on but I'm getting a faint idea of where things are going.


The police are kinda confused and eventually I tell them what's going on from my side of things, and they get my stuff. I get some of it back after a while and learn that my wife is moving hotels, have blocked me from calls and texts, and left me pretty much stranded in the middle of the night and failed to give me the medicine I needed from the accident the day before. I slept in the street that night and got help the day after, I was nearly 50 miles from friends or family and stayed at a friend's. I find a place she didn't block me and ask for my stuff which goes ignored for a few days then out of the blue she shows me some pictures of all my stuff out of the storage unit and says ""come get it"" pretty much. It was all left unattended and my friend's dad could not go to help so it was up to my grandfather to pick up all my stuff at nearly 75 miles away from where he lived.
He is a very calm, very smart and kind person, and that day was one of the first times I've heard him really disappointed, he tried to get along with my wife and made an effort to help her- and us out as much as he could.


I lost contact until a couple days later, my best friend of 18 years texts me some confusing things and I call him up, turns out she had tried to get him to get a statement against me and say how abusive and horrible I was. He called the bs out and heard both sides of the story and his family knows the news now too and are very disappointed in her. I admit I'm not perfect, I've said some mean stuff to her before but always worked to make up for it and instantly regretted it, and it was never like the things she has said to me. She has said some messed up stuff to me and it was a nearly everyday thing however ranging from light things like ""you're so lazy"" to ""I hope you die in a fiery car accident and there is nothing left of you."" I have no clue where my son is, she apparently wants to get an anollment, I'm done being married to her yet it still hurts so much, a friend of mine for over a decade told me she always liked me and should have dated her and she's super concerned so there's that, everyone is saying I need therapy because of the psychological stuff she has put me through and I'm in debt over 30k because of my wife and her mom.
I don't know where to start with picking my life back up, I'm worried about my son but know she won't hurt him despite the comments she makes in her depression (things like climbing in the oven with him so they can both die) and I have medicine now for the pain from the accident but even when I'm feeling okay I just feel like laying down and staring at the ceiling trying to get this figured out, I'm still in shock at the when situation and feel like an idiot for thinking things could get better if I stay and keep working harder to do better.",16Feb2018,2

278,"My class had a physics exam which I didnt study for, I didnt have all the notes and I lost my physics book, so I couldnt study.

 Our physics professor is also probably the worst, meanest professor in my country. At least 20 generations of students have complained about him, all the professors know how terrible he is at his job. He cant explain anything related to physics, and just writes a couple formulas on the board and expects us to understand what he means without explaining it. Multiple headmasters tried to fire him, but they couldnt because it has to go through the ministry of education, who then send their people to the school and watch how the teacher works for one school hour. Nothing ever comes out of it because my country's just doesnt care.

So, I havent studied because I had nowhere to study from. So I and 11 more people from my class (theres 23 of us in total) decided not to come to the exam. I spent an hour with my mom trying to make her allow me not to come to the exam, to which she said no.

I didnt go to the exam with 11 others and our ""main teacher"" ( dont know how its called in english; a teacher that has to take care of us) said that our parents had to come to the school. He also told us that if they didnt come in a weeks time, that he would personally call them and tell them that I missed the class.

280,"I'm a 24 year old female, I've been a stripper for 3 years and never had a boyfriend...when I first started dancing I didn't want a boyfriend at all, I just wanted to be free and date around and do whatever I wanted, which was awesome, fun, and fulfilling for what it was but deep down I'm a hopeless romantic, I want to be in a relationship and be super in love...but then there is always that moment where I have to tell the guy what I do for a living. And at first they typically take it really well, often he will even be a little bit chuffed and impressed with himself (lol) for scoring with a stripper (that's fine lol, even a little bit cute). But over time, sometimes a short amount of time sometimes longer, they start to show signs that they're not actually okay with it, hinting for me to quit my job, not wanting to hear me talk about my shift at work, (also I would never say anything that I know full well would make a guy I'm seeing uncomfortable to hear, just if I have funny customers that night or someone is extra weird or rude I like neeeeeeeed to tell someone, lol) etc. I try to be cool about it and explain exactly how stripping works for me, how I communicate with my customers, the sales aspect, what it does and does NOT involve, but there are obviously hairier aspects (especially at the club I work at which is a bit seedy I admit but I'm old enough and been dancing long enough to just kind of rise above that when I'm at work, it really doesn't bother me anymore) and I feel like once I tell a guy what I do for a living, it becomes all he sees in me.  

Most recently a guy ended a relationship with me last week over my job, saying I couldn't meet his family or parents because he already told them what I do and there's a ""stigma"" about my job. I already know this full well. Lol. IM the one who's the dancer, obviously I know there's a stigma, and he's not the first guy to change his mind when he sees how emotionally and mentally taxing it all is on me and that Im going to need to talk and vent about it sometimes. I don't mind if a guy is concerned for me or thinking about my safety, but it's more like he's concerned with how MY job would affect HIM. I was kind of surprised that he went and told everyone what I do without telling me or letting me meet them and explain how and why I got into it and how and why I stayed in it. Obviously ""I'm dating a stripper"" is a topic you would broach carefully...I just feel like so many guys are all eager to fuck a stripper and tell their friends about it and high five people over it, but no one actually wants to be with you and help take care of your emotional needs, and let me take care of his. I guess my thinking is, please don't get my hopes up thinking that you're okay with it, only to find out months later that you've been not okay with it this whole time, because by that time I'll honestly probably be heartbroken and confused when you end it. I literally have a university degree (not that it makes me any better than strippers who don't) but ALL guys see in me is my job. I literally just want a normal, boring relationship where we watch documentaries and smoke weed together and talk about our day, lol. Is this normal? I was told when I first started dancing that guys don't want to date strippers but I didn't think anything of it because I wasn't into dating at the time.

281,"So, I need some help here.

 my step son is 22 and still lives with us.  He's a text book narcissist.  He's manipulative, cruel, selfish and to be honest, evil. Here are a few examples.  

He black mailed his one friend (a minor) with naked pictures he had gotten if him. This friend ended up calling us and begging us to stop him.  He had threatened to post the pictures to Facebook for all his school friends and family to see.  

He worked for a local cell phone provider and used his backend access to spy on his friends and used the priveledge to threaten and blackmail them.  

His sister has a learning disability.  She's the nicest girl ever, and he mocked her relentlessly with it, calling her stupid and retarded.

Him and his online friends on Second life, hack the game and kidnap random women. They then trap them and pretend rape them for fun.  Not just once either.  They stalk them for days, using voice changers to sound creepy and such.

Currently, he has started a child abuse claim against me.  I'ts not true, but he's done it because he's getting revenge at me for an argument we had recently.

His mother won't do anything about it, won't talk to him about it or anything.  She's afraid of him I think.

He's lieing to his counselor and is telling the government he is paying us rent, when he isn't.  He's pretty much a compulsive liar.

In our community? Everyone likes him.  He plays the role of a nice person very well, people praise him for how polite and intelligent he is.  Literally noone believes what he's actually like. 

What should I do about this?  He manipulates everything and everyone.   The rest of the family avoids him and tries to placate him to make life easier.  What is the best way of dealing with this? 

Note... I don't want to get revenge or hurt him. Not do I want to leave my wife. Don't see the point in kicking him out either.  I think it's something he can't help or something, he's got Asperger's and he's always been like this. He just enjoys controling and hurting people.  Seems confused when other people don't get what he thinks is funny.  I want him to get the help he needs.  But if he's manipulating his counselor, how can he get it?",16Feb2018,2
283,"And this is why:

Backstory - semi large apartment complex in a more expensive neighborhood - rent is expensive due to coastal location. Unit next door got new tenants around September 2017.  Around Nov 2017, a woman and her kids moved into the unit with existing tenants. 

Two weeks ago, said woman and kids start moving out. Later that night, 4 cops come and woman and a man I’ve never seen before start arguing loudly in the hallway with the cops. She said this guy just came back from jail and was smoking meth in front of a baby in the apartment (clue # 1). Cops don’t do anything, and next day 2 people in suits come to talk to the guy in that apartment. 

A couple days later, I see a new guy coming out of there that I’ve never seen before. I have not seen original tenants that moved in, since move in day. 

Three days after that, I hear continuously throughout the night, for 4 days straight, people partying in there until about 8am (bedroom wall shares with their unit).   No one leaves the apartment, I never hear the door open and close (only one door into the unit), and yet the marathon partying continues - clue #2. 

I totally feel like the nosy neighbor from Small Wonder but this seems like methy neighbors and it makes me nervous. From what I’ve seen in the past, meth users love petty crimes like B&amp;Es to get $ for more stuff. Plus the meth gives them super human strength so I fear for my safety on a possibility of a break-in. 

Is there anything I can do? I don’t really have proof other than hearsay.  We’ve never had neighbors like this before. The people in the building are working professionals that keep to themselves mostly and are cool. ",16Feb2018,3

So my friend got grounded and messaged to meet up with me on her tablet, and her mum didn’t know about this. So we met up and then we were sitting in a cafe and her mum walked in (don’t know how she found her daughter) and started screaming at us. She found out about us meeting by going through my friends Facebook and saw she has messages, and read them. She said the obvious, ‘why do you continue to defy me when grounded?’, but then she started firing off at me saying I’m a bad influence and that we’re both not good people and that she thinks we need to spend time apart. 
I walked out of the cafe and felt kinda upset. I know I shouldn’t take it personally, but her mum really went off at me, when in the end it’s her daughters choices and life.

Am I right to feel like it’s not her place to speak to me like this? Am I just supposed to accept the fact that she can go through my conversations with her daughter about stuff, at times, which is personal?

Her mum has called me and some of my friend’s other friend before firing off at us if we bunked school with her daughter, which was very strange to say the least.

So, what do you think of it and please tell me if I’m over reacting.

289,"Hello everyone, 

Recently, my mom friended a supposed captain in the army in Afghanistan, and their “relationship” progressed to the point where he has asked to send a package to her mail (she receives her mail from a UPS mail box that is in store, not directly to her home nor a federal post office). 

Hearing this, I was easily able to reveal that the profile was fake (as there were several others with the same name and information but with  different profile photos) but the scammer already received her mailing information. (Note: she has not disclosed any other pertinent information such as credit card or banking information nor her actual address.) 

From what I’ve read, most of the time these schemes send expensive items like laptops or cell phones and are then shipped elsewhere as a means of sending black market items under the radar. 

However, to the actual question, what is she to do with the package if it comes and if the contents are truly unknown? ",16Feb2018,5
290,"My mother, bless her, seems not to understand some basic conversational niceties that we all take for granted. I love her without question, but there is something that really gets my goat...

She constantly tells people, mostly me and my father, what they think, feel or believe, usually in response to that person expressing a thought, feeling or belief. 

It's absolutely infuriating to be asked a question like ""why don't you want dinner?"", respond with ""had a big lunch"", and get told ""no, there's obviously something else wrong"". That's minor though, but happens frequently. 

Other example from the last week in reference to my rekindling of a relationship: 

""You're just using her to distract yourself from your other problems""
""No, I'm dealing with my shit, I just miss her""
""No you're not""

""She only wants you because you weren't available""
""She didn't know I wasn't available""
""No, that's bullshit""

I wouldn't give a shit if I was lying and she was catching me out, but she's not particularly intuitive, and I'm always being honest in these interactions. I've explained to her that she doesn't know people's minds better than they do, but to no avail. How do I stop her doing this, or is 58 too late to change?

**TL;DR my mum thinks she's a mind reader and constantly refutes statements people make about their thoughts.**

292,Over the years I had many failed friendships but in the last 6 months I've lost ALL my friends. The problem could be me. I don't know I may be  a repulsive person in general or something I couldn't notice. All my friends tend to treat me like shit or generally ignore me. To give some examples one group of friends I was very close started to ignore me and started making plans I couldn't attend. In another group of friends a close friend started to verbally assault me with shit like taking shots at my girlfriend and my brother. When I confronted him with anger he implied I was the problem and he was just testing me. Other friends agreed with him that his behaviour was normal. They shamelessly ignored me from there on. I was always helping when they needed. I always cared for these people. Maybe I have serious flaws that make me unbearable or I can't choose friends.

My surgeon told me it’s going to take 5 weeks to get to a point where I’m about %80 healed and I can start lifting again. She wants me to start walking around immediately and I can start running after a week or two depending on how I feel. My question is how long until I can really get in the gym again and start pushing my limits and lifting heavy. I’m a huge Gym rat so it’s going to be hard to wait but I have enough self control not to push myself to hard. What’s your opinions and experiences with this and how should I proceed?

So, since 12th grade, I've gotten *kinda* close to her..we're friends, at least, thanks to some projects. I even moved closer to her in class. 

The thing is, I get really nervous every single time we talk. I'm shaking intensely and eat my own nails. I'm sure she noticed because she said it one day, but really friendly, as always. There were also some text messages, in which I was really awkward, but she seemed cool with it. My love for her now is bigger than ever, but i'm afraid of one thing:

301,"Hi!

We're a couple of newly engaged Canadians who've set our hearts on Italy, currently somewhere along the Amalfi Coast, as our destination for a symbolic ceremony before coming home to sign the legal paperwork here in Canada.  Italy was the first country I traveled to as a younger man and it has remained on top of my list as my favorite experience and I vowed to return one day.

Anyway, we're not looking to have any sort of elaborate ceremony, we're not even sure if anyone we know will come with us to see the event.  We literally just want to find a beautiful spot, most likely overlooking the Mediterranean, and have someone 'officiate' the ceremony by giving a small speech that talks about the start of our new life together, and guides us through the process of exchanging rings/vows.  If anyone we know is able to come, we'd have them standing around us, so no seating would be required.  The only additional thing that would be the cherry on top of this cake would be if we could figure out organizing a violinist, a student even, who could play something beautiful nearby as we have our ceremony.

What we need help with is figuring out how to do this.  I've contacted a couple companies who organize weddings in that area, and explained our situation/desires but I don't think they quite get how small/informal we're thinking.  The cheapest price we've been given so far is 2800 Euro, which is many times more than we can afford to pay for some local knowledge of the area as to where would be a good place to do this, and 15 minutes of someone's time as an officiant.  I'm thinking of just phoning someone with wedding officiating experience directly, but anyone with any helpful advice about how best to get this planned would be great to hear from at this time.  Thanks!",16Feb2018,1
302,"Some background; I am 21 and she 20. My car was stolen in early December and I am very lucky that my father is a wonderful mechanic who is allowing me to pay back the $1750 in repairs via payment plan and that is without labor costs. 
2 days after my car was stolen my sister was in a terrible collision totaling her car after rear ending a stopped car going approx 30mph. 

Actual situation; On Wednesday evening my boyfriend and I were planning a romantic dinner and my sister was to watch his son (4 y.o) for us. I typically pick him up from daycare and today was no different. We have been sharing a car for one month and after her accident in December she has 100% been more mindful and cautious about her driving. So Wednesday after talking with her about giving the boy a bath and putting him to bed and such, the 10 minute drive home wasn't a huge red flag for me in terms of letting her drive home. 

Shortly after getting on the highway we hit a terrible patch of ice and after being unable to correct in the roadway headed for the ditch to slow and gain traction. My SUV didnt agree and we rolled in the ditch 3 times. I am shaking writing this because it was such a horrific experience. 

EVERYONE WAS OKAY. We were beyond blessed that the worst injuries were sustained by myself and my sister and save for being really sore and some bruises we are all incredibly lucky to have fared so well. But my car is beyond wrecked. 

Here is where I need advice. I was not driving and I have insurance. So logically it makes sense to me to file a claim and they would help me with money given this is what I pay insurance for right? To help financially after an accident? Right?

She is on a covered driver on my dads auto policy. 

But my dad and my sister don't want to file a claim given that she was just in an at fault wreck and the likely hood that the payoff would even be worth it is low. But I don't have a car and still owe my dad the remaining $1600 dollars and need a new car seat and such. 

I feel fucked with a hot poker and my boyfriend is stressed also. He has been incredibly busy at work and the extra set of trusting hands has eased his mind. So to lose my car and us be kind of left with the mess is frustrating. 

I honestly have no idea what to do because the entire situation has been so odd and traumatic to a degree. Even telling me to buck up will be helpful because I don't even know if just moving on is the best course of action. 

TL;DR: My sister totaled my car in her second accident in 90 days with myself and my step son in the car. We are okay but her and my dad have left me and my boyfriend to pretty much figure it out on our own. Looking for any advice on what to do or how to proceed. ",16Feb2018,9

I am a male at the age of 17 and i hate my self. I used to be looked down upon and bullied a lot. I don't really know the reason but my life was sh*t. When i went to high school things changed. I started growing up and exploring my passions.

I like reading books. I read politics, chemistry, computers, philosophy, psychology, fiction and many other topics. I became more responsible and my grades skyrocketed. I am actually one of the best students in my school. I got a bit recognised too. I like playing music and i am also interested in martial arts. I have interests that make me happy but i don't like parties and clubs.

I don't drink or smoke, i don't care about following fashion trends (i do want to look good but i don't buy new clothes all the time).I don't like social media, i don't care about buying new phones, cars and gadgets they don't make me happy. I don't like consumerism. I am not very meterealistic.

I don't like forming relationships with girls for sex or just for the sake of forming a relationship. I would like to have a relationship with someone i really like. I am also a bit of a loner, prefering the company of a few friends than to go out and make noise and havoc. That being said i am not afraid of people or socializing, its just that some times i like to be alone.

Because of that i can't find friends or a girlfriend. I am an outcast. People hate me. 

I feel like for people not to hate me i have to live a life i don't want, i have to do things i dont like. But if i don't live a life like that i will still suffer. So i am desperate, either way i will not be happy. I have very dark thoughts about suicide. I don't care if you think i am pathetic or that i am just ""advertising"" myself at this point. Who cares anyways? I might even be disabled.

310,"So there I was sitting in my room watching Netflix on my Television when i got a knock on the door. It was the apartment complexes plowman apologizing vigorously ""Dude , I am so sorry I hit your car"", ""Its really bad"" . I responded with ""It cant be that bad"", and so we go to look at it ,and it seems like a straight line scratch on my 2 door 09 Scion. So i called up my USAA insurance and spoke to the claims adjuster who advised me to go get my car inspected so we can figure out how much the car is going to cost to get repaired. 45 mins later on that Saturday morning , I am told my car is a total loss, and that I need to speak with USAA. So fast forward about 2 hours and I am told by the (In the total Loss department: TLD) gentleman ""A"" , that since my car is in the state of NEW YORK , I have no choice but to surrender it for salvage and that i have to take 4900 dollars for it. I was extremely salty about this because for one thing, I babied my car. I used only premium gas, synthetic oil in all maitenance checkups and replaced only my break pads so far. My car was doing pretty good. It had 116,000 miles on it with all check-ups done as per the owners manual. So now USAA says i have to surrender my car because its under $ 5,000 , and that the repairs are over 75% of its total value. So naturally I say no, this isn't fair , I do not wanna give it up for this kind of aesthetic damage. They apologize and say sorry but you have to its the law to which he then proceeds to read a clause lining this out. I get depressed a little bit and do some of my own digging. Turns out statute 216.8 regarding auto insurance and total loss is kinda sketchy in New York. So I call the Department of Insurance in New York State , and file my claim and asking why this kind of thing can happen when I OWN my car and forcefully have to surrender it. By the way my cars value on KB is 6-8k$ but they are putting me at 4900$ and just 101.00 $ dollars of being short of keeping my car , and my car came equipped with all the sweet stuff like the pioneer radio system , speakers, sun and moon roof , spoilers , and low profiles all stock. Any who moving forward USAA tells me they need my title if i want my 4900$. 3 days after the claim had been made my Apartment complexes insurance calls me (its Progressive) and they are trying to handle things on there end, and I ask the claim adjuster for Progressive if they can really do that? he responds to ""No, i never heard of that and we gave people their buy back option for lower than that in New York"". With his response I am like oh really..? Fast forward another 2 weeks and i get a call from USAA , and they are telling me now that ""Hey btw you get the buyback option on your car instead of having to surrender it"". Now in my head I am thinking ...""I bet , specially since the Department of Insurance (DOI) probably gave them a ring. They are now giving me the option to buy back my car and that if I do, I have to turn my regular title into a salvage title for my vehicle and.. i have to write a letter stating ""I wont sell my car"", and that ""I intend to keep it for personal use"" . Also i cant drive my car, and they are only giving me a 7 day rental after they literally tried steal my car for parts and auction.
Now I know USAA banking services have been a great thing , but dealing with USAA total Loss and Insurance for me has been a nightmare. I have logged more time with them on the phone just to get hung up on , waiting 20-35 mins for ""Hold on while i look this up"" , and ""Let me double check this to make sure its right"" , and literally being put on hold for so long that it auto hangs up on you .
I highly recommend any of you to switch if you are in New York state with USAA . they will try to rob you if your cars getting just to that point where they do not want to repair it. (They go buy NADA) and will undervalue your car anytime they get the chance. Also one more thing if I am the first person to fight them on this kind of thing how many more times did they get away with this kind of thing ????

A couple of months ago me and three of my ""friends"" decided that we should go on a ""trip around the world"" (and yes I know that this is big thing), but they all seemed so thrilled about it. We talked about it a lot. I was, of course more thrilled than them, and I was SO looking forward to it.

A guy I know from work (18) and get along with quite well had followed multiple male gains account (he's gay). I never understood the fetish for fat and big bellies, and out of curiosity I looked at the accounts he'd followed. One of them, as stated in the title, had only two pictures, and they were both of fat young boys about 10 I would assume.

We worked the same shift today, and all the accounts were followed at the time he would have been on break, ruling out the possibility that someone else followed them as a prank.

I know it's sort of my own fault for looking, but I really don't know how to react. What would you do in this situation?",16Feb2018,1
328,"So, I do have career goals (I am not thinking much about right now because I am currently I little disinterested), but let's just say that some of the major goals I was working toward are completed/close to being completed. I should be feeling happier, but I feel empty because I've nearly finished everything I was working toward for right now.

What are some things that the everyday person could or should strive toward? I mean like long-term goals. (I know mine will be specific, but ideas for general goals will be helpful). Thank you.",16Feb2018,1
329,"I'm a uni student studying in my 2nd year at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. I've always been exceptionally intelligent and a good all-rounder, naturally athletic and a good learner. However, it's all been natural and very little hard work. It worked fine in school, I wasn't the best but was always near the top few students.
But now at uni, I'm below average because everyone here works insanely hard and the workload is such a high level, that I can't cope with it - natural talent isn't good enough. Moreover, I've chosen poor company and made poor decisions so that I barely have any good friends to rely on, and sit alone in classes. Recently, I've stopped going to classes altogether and stay at home most of the day, wasting my time away online on videos. I'm behind on my studies and moreover feel like shit because I don't have much of a life. What do I do? How do I get motivated? How do I get energy to work, I'm always so tired?",16Feb2018,1

331,"I didn't mean to make her feel that way but it's a pretty understandable reaction, especially for an already extremely self conscious person.

Its just that I couldn't handle the negativity. So often I'll wake up to a text about what's annoying her at work, then she'll call me and complain on her way home, then she'll complain when she gets home, then I'll get a text sometimes at my work, then she'll complain when she's on her way home at night, then once she's home. 

We'll have a great time somewhere but the second we're back in the car she'll have something to almost immediately complain about. 

And one of the most common things she complains about? Other people ""bitching"" be it her sister, her dad, her co-workers, teammates.. she'll go on about how overwhelmed they make her feel 

I came home from a busy night at work, she was in bed, and while I'm in the process of changing and getting into bed, she's started complaining already. I told her that I feel like I can't react to everything she has to complain about and can't handle not even getting a few moments of relaxing after work. 

Now she feels like she can't tell me anything. I'd gladly listen and help her with the things that truly bother and affect her but I can't hear the almost daily same complaining about the same things like how annoying one guy at work is or how one manager always forgets to give her a break and her solution is to mope and literally never say anything about it but tell me all about what she WOULD say",16Feb2018,1

334,"Storytime:
When I was 18 I met this girl at a party. We sat in a group and she and her boyfriend sat a little outside of the group. Shes quite cute so ofc I noticed her but didn't think too much of it because she had her boyfriend with her. They had been together for 3 years or so.

Fast forward 3 months and we meet again at a summer party. Shes now without her boyfriend and in some way or another we end up in the kitchen with another friend taking shots. The last person suddenly leaves and we're there left talking and just getting to know each other. Nothing interesting happens (sorry guys) and I offer to walk her home. Its kinda chilly so I gave her my hoodie to keep her warm. She forgot to give me it back when she was home and I got my friend to pick me up and drive me home. 

We started talking and meeting more after that party. She still had the same boyfriend and I knew that, but she was just awesome. I knew that it would be bad if I tried to do anything so I just kept on being the best friend possible. We hang out, talked all day long and one night she asked if we should do something. So we met up somewhere and drove around in the city in my car just talking about anything. We stopped at this one spot and decided just to talk. 

We probably talked for like 3 hours and the clock were close to 2 AM. We suddenly started holding hands and just looking into each other’s eyes. She then asked me “you have been thinking about it for a long time now?” And she was thinking of kissing. So I reminded her that she had a boyfriend and I didn’t want to destroy the special thing they had. So after some time we drove back to her car again and she literally begged me to kiss her. She told me that she had started to dream about me and I was always on her mind, and she needed to know if it was something or not. I held my ground and said I would not destroy her relationship.

We drove off in each our car and later I got a text asking if I would like to visit her the next day and so I did. We planned to watch Netflix (I was actually planning to watch Netflix and not “chill”) but I think she was hoping for more. So we literally laid under the blankets for two hours and I know she was just waiting for me to make a move. I did not make that move and I think she got upset after that. 

Some days later she was out drinking and I called her to make sure everything was ok. So I spoke with her the whole way home and when she got home we ended the call. A little later she sent me some nudes and wanted to get it on. Me as the (unfortunately too nice guy) told her to not do that. I said “think about your boyfriend. If I were your boyfriend I would not like that you did this to another guy”. She was a super nice girl and not that type at all! (No idea if I low-key seduced her and made her crazy about me?) but I said it as it was. If she ever became my gf I would not like that she did that kind of stuff to other guys.

She got really really mad after that.. I tried to explain but she just went off. So we didn’t talk for like 1 year after that.


So should I be proud or should I regret to not take the opportunity? She is a solid 9/10 maybe even a 10/10 both on the outside and the inside.



Edit: Guess what? She started talking to me today. Still have the same boyfriend. Started to low-key flirt with me and said she wanted a sweater from me that smelled like me because she loved it.",16Feb2018,1

336,"Two of my close friends are sleeping together and one of them is in a long term (&gt;5 years) relationship. I told them both a month ago that I knew about it and both promised to resolve the situation, but I’ve seen no signs of this happening (going out for meals together, getting drunk together etc) 

I know the girlfriend of the guy and she does not deserve this one bit. I’m getting closer and closer to giving him an ultimatum. 

To cap things off, I know both of these people as we all work together. However, I’m leaving in one week time and I don’t really have any qualms about not speaking to either of them again as my opinion of both has dropped massively since all this started. 

Do I stay out of it and move on or give an ultimatum do you think?",16Feb2018,2
337,"So I'm 22 years old last year I went to China to teach English (3-5 years of age) and fell in love with a Chinese girl, only problem is after getting recruited for the daycare centre I realised me being in China was illegal. if you don't have a bachelors degree (i don't) you cant legally get a working visa, I was on a business visa working illegally. I loved working with the kids and I really loved spending time with my gf its the first time in my life that I actually enjoyed living but as far as I can see its almost impossible to make it work. I don't have the funds to attend university and my parents wouldn't allow me to live with them for years while I complete my course. not to mention her Chinese parents will push her into getting married within a few years if she doesn't have a partner, the only option I could see working is if I go back to China and work illegally but that's something that I really do not want to do as I felt extremely uncomfortable doing it last time. I've never felt this way about anyone before and its mutual she's not doing it for money or anything etc (she has a lot more than I do) but I just have no idea what to do.",16Feb2018,1
338,"I don't feel like a person anymore. I honestly feel like I'm fucked in the head. Yesterday I was working with my SO (yeah yeah don't date co-workers, she was different), I started having a massive anxiety attack. My anxiety loves convincing me that other people hate me. If I knew someone I, at one point, convinced myself they hated me. Well this was happening with my SO. She's not a very affectionate person, she's told me multiple times, yet my anxiety still wanted to say otherwise. I thought her not being affectionate was just a cover up for not liking me and not wanting to confront me about it.

Work flared up, it got hella busy and we're under staffed as shit, so it's really tense and fast paced. Not good for anxiety attacks. At one point my mind felt like it literally shut down. My anxiety was beating the shit out of me. I had to fight back tears because I convinced myself that we were on the verge of breaking up. 

I caved in and tried to talk to my co-worker (good friends) about it, but it only made the tears burst out. I had a full mental break down during work. My SO had to confront me about it and tell me everything was ok, and that I needed to chill out. Honestly I feel like that in itself hurt our relationship.

After work I talked to my mother about going back on anxiety pills (Zoloft), and she gave me 2 weeks worth of hers and scheduled a doctors appointment to get me a proper prescription. I've took the pill before bed yesterday, and going to take it again today.

I just don't feel right after that incident. It was humiliating breaking down in tears in front of everybody. I don't know why I did that, I've been fine for 3 years but recently my anxiety has gone through the roof. I feel like I'm starting to degrade into a psychotic piece of shit. I just want to feel normal again. I just feel so inhuman.

345,"Hello, my name is Garlactomus, and I have a dream of moving to Colorado, and start working at a marijuana farm, or in a dispensary.  I am 20 years old, but have had a rough start to my life.

When I graduated high school, my parents were going through a divorce. I went to one semester of college, but had to drop out due to financial issues. I worked at a local store for about 2 years, went to work full time for a cable/ internet company, but then was laid off. I had a decent amount of personal issues happen last year including death, depression, abuse, and toxicity.

I am away from the toxic and abuse, been feeling pretty happy about myself the past couple of months, but I've felt lost during that time. I've been unemployed this past year and living with my mother. I live in West Virginia, so not the most suitable of career choice locations.

I would love to pursue my dream of what I mentioned before, but I have no money to my name, no car due to  troubles and an accident, and no college education.  I feel very lost and I feel as if I have no sense of direction or hope to accomplishing what I dream of.  I don't know which steps to take, and I feel like I need to hear some advice from multiple perspectives.

Thanks, Garlactomus.",16Feb2018,1
346,"I really need advice.

Here's some background info: I'm an 18 year old full time college student. I am the youngest of 6 kids, as I have five older brothers.  My oldest brother is now 29 and has a drug problem. I don't know what drug he is currently hooked on, but I know he's tried everything. In November of 2017 he told me that he has lost 4 different jobs in one year due to his meth, heroin etc. addictions.

 He's my brother and I love him but this causes problems.  He stolen excessive amounts of money and valuables from family and friends. He has stolen my first car (2008 Pontiac Grand Prix) and all of my graduation money from me. I decided not to call the cops because I didn't want to throw my brother in prison.  I am not the only one that he has stolen from.  He stole at least 1,500 worth of stuff from my aunts after Christmas dinner.  He has stolen at least 500 from my dads business. He has stolen from my grandparents, I don't know how much but I know it happened. He also has stolen a handgun, trek bike, cervelo racing bike and 3,000 in cash from one of my other brothers.  

At this point everyone else has given up on him, except my mom and I.  I know that he is a good person deep down because I remember how he used to be.  There are a lot of upset people, and as a solution 3 years ago I was appointed as the family rep. since they can't stand to be around him.  My job is to go to his apartment as often as I have to until I have the money he owes each week.  At first I only had to go about once per week now its around 12 times. Each time I arrive he'll say ""come back in two hours and I'll have the money"". He has a good job I estimate he makes 2,000 a week. Lately though he claims to only have 300 for payments. 

He lives in a horrible apartment with his friends and I know for a fact that they only charge him 200 a month. I have no idea where the money goes; the only idea I have is drugs. I fear one day to show up in his apartment and find him dead. As someone who has never drank nor tried weed, I am upset and confused when I go there and sometimes find him too strung out to answer me intelligently. Because he is not fulfilling the agreement I'm getting all the flak.  I am getting yelled at all the time and I am having to spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to get money from him.  I told my relatives that I couldn't keep doing this because I was exhausted and my grades were starting to suffer. Their responses were ""you're just like him"" and ""he's going to jail because of you now"".  I cannot confide in my parents now because my mom is in denial and my dad would probably have a heart attack.  I am starting to wonder why this is my responsibility. I was 12 when the thefts started. 

These responsibilities are causing my grades to suffer; I am not failing by any means but I am risking losing my full academic scholarship.  I feel like I don't have enough hours in the day to go to school, do homework, study, take care of my mom with severe ra and constantly be begging him for money.  I feel like for the first time in my life I'm not excelling, I'm just drowning. 

Its hard for me to see how things will ever improve. I don't want him to go to jail but at the same time I feel like the stress is suffocating. I have considered attending another university far away, but I fear not being offered a full ride and I really don't want debt.  I also don't want to run away from my responsibilities.  I pride myself on being more mature than most of those my age, but I as so stressed and upset all the time that I wish to be immature and go somewhere and start new. 

I am just asking for an outside perspective on a few things.  
a) is there a good way to juggle these tasks? --I currently have many alarms on my phone labeled so I do the task when the alarm goes off. 
b) am I just wasting my time helping him?
c) how can I get my relatives to realize I am not the criminal?
d) am I enabling him to be a drug addict by protecting him?

Thanks so much for reading this I know it was really long, but I really want advice.

348,"I’m in first year at university studying film and history. I really love history and film sounded so interesting that I decided to follow through with that degree path. The thing is, I feel like I don’t really fit in at my university. I don’t have any friends and I always feel anxious when I am there. I constantly feel I am not smart enough to be attending the university. Not only that but the degree is just not what I thought it was going to be. It is interesting but I don’t find myself truly immersed in the courses. I felt like this during the first semester and now we are halfway through the second semester and I don’t feel any different despite studying different topics. 

I have been researching and thinking about switching courses to study criminology instead. However, this means I will have to go to a different university and move to a different city. I get home sick and living at home right now is a big comfort for me. So I don’t know how I would cope in a new city alone, and this is making me have doubts. But, I don’t know if this is just because I have never lived anywhere but my childhood home. I find criminology really interesting and I actually studied it before university. I coped with the content well. I am worried that if I do decide to switch courses, I will just be as unhappy as I am now. 

Another thing that puts me off this change is that I am already older than the majority of my year group at university. After school I didn’t feel ready to go to university so I decided to get a qualification in social sciences. If I  were to leave university then I will have to take a break for a year as applications for this year have already closed. So, again I will end up being older than most of my classmates. I feel like I am going to be judged for not graduating when those my age will have. 

I’m really unsure what to do. I want to be happy with my studies but my brain is telling me to stick with what I’m doing and just get my degree. But, I don’t know what I will do with that degree after I graduate? Teaching seems to be the only option and I don’t think I would be good for that role. 

If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it a lot. Thank you for reading :-)",16Feb2018,2
