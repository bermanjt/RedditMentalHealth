0,"So, I recently moved back in with my best friend and his wife. I've lived with them before, originally it was them helping me out, but they asked me to move back in as a way of helping *them* out (basically, my rent allowed them to buy a second house to rent out).

Something I've noticed, though, is they seem to have this really weird thing where, any time they're ""going out"" (clearly with friends), it's almost like they're trying to talk in code around me. He always puts on this act of pretending he doesn't want to go out, and they're always weirdly tight-lipped about who they're going to hang out with.

I don't know why it bothers me -- obviously, we live together, they want their time away from me.

But at the same time... like, tonight, she ""slipped up"" by saying they were hanging out with a female friend, and I was just like ""Ah, cool, who are you guys meeting?"". And they were literally *silent*, and then changed the topic. It just felt *super* awkward out of nowhere.

Admittedly, okay, I'm 30 years-old and single, so yeah, I would be interested if they had any single female friends, which was clearly the case. Of course, I'm fairly sure that my friend's wife doesn't *actually* like me that much (or at least, doesn't have any sort of respect for me), so maybe she just doesn't want me meeting any of her friends, judging I'm not ""good enough"" or something?

I dunno. The whole thing just feels weird. It's not like I've ever invited myself to tag along, or given them any sort of guild-trips for making plans with other people. It's this thing of them ""trying to hide it"" that just makes me think, I dunno, maybe there's some deeper issue they have with me?

Not my business to know where they go or who they hang out with, but it *does* seem sort of weird, right? Or is this just normal behavior?",15Nov2018,1
1,"Hey everyone. Super quick to setup the advice part:
I served 12yrs in the USAF as a Command Post Controller, NCOIC for 5yrs. It’s basically a military 911 Center so I’m used to emergencies flowing in and acting/reacting to them. I’m fully trained in Self Aid Buddy Care, CPR certified, and received special training to deal with Airmen who were suicidal and recognizing the signs. 

I’ve been separated for almost 2 years. In the 12yrs there I’ve saved a minimum of 6 Airmen, lost one I was counseling (if someone is going to do it, you can only do so much), and several civilian incidents. I’m always open to listen, always available by phone if not in person anytime, so usually I welcome someone trusting me to help them.

Recently a female at work (19yr old) was breaking down crying in our warehouse so I asked what was going on. The whole thing boiled down to parental abuse (physically and verbally), drug addict bf, stuck at home with controlling parents can’t do stuff ever. Super low self-esteem. Hates life. To me, the way she was explaining things triggered my suicidal instincts. I immediately got her to HR and explained the situation.

We figured out that she wasn’t suicidal, but she was a victim of abuse and we were both going to get her some resources; including appointments she could go to ON WORK TIME ON WORK’S DIME to keep her parents oblivious.

HR warned me it sounded a little BS and I need to be aware of her actions going forward.

That week.

Never goes to an appointment, missed the weekly update meeting.

A week or two later.

She calls me saying she broke up with druggie boy and was all torn apart (he cheated). Emphasized its best to get her thinking of herself and where she can improve things. Get her goals of moving out put into fruition.

She made the mistake of saying she’s a “huge attention whore” and loves getting attention from men who see a girl in distress (alluding to her BF). That immediately signaled to back off and quit helping her... but still wondered how much was self-created for her.

Today.

She was crying again, so I asked what was up, she said about life sucking, no one likes her, her X blocked her on FB.

I know I’m easy to talk to, but I’m not sure at this point if I should:

1) Let it go, distance myself and let whatever happens, happen.

2) Continue to support her only because she’s obviously mentally unstable and still needs help

3) Something Else I don’t know

I’m used to Airmen and Civilians who essentially support themselves and have the courage to ask for help. This is the first time I’ve asked my way into it and I’m not sure if/how I should get out.

Your help/advice/support is appreciated in advance. Thanks!",15Nov2018,1

As you could imagine, we have done alot of things together and I have obviously met his family and extended family who have visited from out of state. My family is very inviting and always invites my bf everywhere. Him and I even went out of the country to Japan where my grandmother lives and she was nice enough to let us stay with her, along with all my mothers friends and family who took care of us. My grandmother even gave us 100$ equivalent of Japanese money EACH to welcome us to Japan. So I'm 22 and My bf is 22 years old. Me being super romantic and affectionate Christmas and the holidays for me are to be spent with significant others and family. I found out last night that my bf is leaving out of state for 2 weeks during Christmas with his family to visit his family out of state (whom I have met) ... are you kidding me? and he kept saying he couldn't do anything cause his mom got the tickets. 

He's 22 years old and he can't say anything to his mom? His mom is so strict she still doesn't even let him spend the night at my house. They did not invite me or ask me to go, and he didn't even think of wanting to be with me during Christmas. If that was me I would have asked if I could invite my bf or if I could come back before Christmas to spend the holidays with him.

What do you think? I just feel like they don't consider me family and he doesn't really care or think about wanting to spend Christmas with me. Please help I need some advice or thought, like am I tripping or??",15Nov2018,1
5,"I told my current girlfriend I had feelings for her around august, the following weeks were the best I've ever had.

We had constant make out sessions whenever we went out together, around October I brought up the feelings I had for her and sure enough we got together.

6,"So I adopted my dog about a year ago and she is fantastic and easy going. Before I adopted her I brushed up on training guidelines which have been very effective. Like when we first got her she chewed on the carpet and we simply said “no!” And gave her a toy and she hasn’t chewed on it since.   We taught her it wait for her food so she doesn’t go for it until I say so even if it’s right in front of her, so I can leave my food on the coffee table and tell her “wait” or “no” if I have to leave and get something and she has never gone for my food. This is fantastic. However my roommates leave their food on the floor in their room/side tables unattended for hours consistently and they get mad when the dog eats it and when they find out (hours after she’s done it) they will yell and throw her in the crate. (This only happens when I’m not home) and they yell at me saying my dog is not disciplined or trained. 

She is crate trained and I have told them over and over that her crate is to never be punishment because I read it is not effective and if I want her to be comfortable in there while I’m at work as it should be her “safe place” not a place of punishment. They refuse to keep their door closed, keep food off the floor, keep the common space clean so she can be left out unattended. Which we do if we go grocery shopping. 

The big problem is they refuse to change their behavior and they said that “they will punish my dog as they see fit” when I am not home which is only 5 hours or so at a time. It’s disrespectful to me and it may set back her association with her crate/den. It’s never a problem for me with the food because I don’t leave food out or she knows not to eat it if I tell her no.

They stayed in my sister’s bedroom— she isn’t living there currently, but still has some belongings in her room. The girlfriend apparently dug through my sister’s drawers and got out her old phone and took it upon herself to start using it. My mom let her use it while she stayed there, but later kicked her out and didn’t get the phone back. 

The girlfriend can get my sister’s texts from a texting app, because the phone is still linked to her phone number, I guess. Not sure how that works. But we have been texting it and demanding the phone back, and girlfriend is avoiding us. Should we report the phone as stolen? Do police usually do anything about these kinds of calls?

10,"hi reddit! ive got a problem.
I’m a f(17) junior going to a magnet arts high school where I major in film production. My cinematography work and films are award winning. (I am not bragging, but this plays into the problem.) I work very hard to turn out several films a year, so I have an abundance of work available on my YouTube page. 

Enter in my classmate, Jenny (f18)(also not her real name.) I’m not good friends with Jenny, but I have worked with her on school projects before. she is one of those people who sits back and watches in a group project and lets everyone else carry her weight. (you know the type).

Recently, one of my good friends and frequent collaborator sent me a link to her college demo reel. instantly, I noticed that a screenshot from one of my films was used as the thumbnail. I clicked on the video, and I was horrified. The four minute video was filled of my work and several other of my peers work. 

I’m not sure what to do. I have not yet talked to her because I want to do it in a smart and professional way. I do know, however, that Jenny has already submitted the video to big colleges across the country- schools I plan on applying to in a years time. 

I’m very nervous. Any advice would help.

11,"Okay, so my parents know I “have same-sex desires”, but they’re really worried living a “homosexual lifestyle” will be a detriment to my relationship with God, and I without having a good relationship with God... well, the outcome wouldn’t be good. I’m a Christian too, but with a slightly different outlook than they have. Much to their chagrin, about 4 months ago, I admitted that I had liked one of my female friends for almost two years, and that I had found out she likes me too. My parents were worried and unhappy and strongly urged me to step away. 

They more or less got what they wanted, because within a month, the girl in question happen to get an opportunity to go to France for a few months, which after talking about it with me, and a lot of a deliberation, she took. But now that 3 months is almost up, and she’s going to be home in about a week. We’ve kept really close contact, and really have been together for the entirety of the 4 months since I spoke to my parents. 

But now that she’s going to be back, and we really can’t keep living in this limbo between dating and not, but I’m worried if I tell my parents they’ll either cut me off from her or insist in some way that I don’t. I know it sounds like the obvious conclusion would be to just not tell them, but I just can’t. I tried in the past and they found it, and it completely destroyed my relationship with my parents. It’s been almost four years since that happened and our relationship is still on the mend. Beyond that, it’s just not a way I want to live.

So now I feel like I’m pretty much out of options except for talking to them, but I’m terrified of losing my “friend” in consequence. I honestly don’t see my parents just throwing their hands up and telling me I should just do what I want, but they’d never send me to some gay conversion therapy thing either. I just don’t know what to say, or how to say it.

tl;dr I’m a 17yo lesbo who needs help if/how I should try to convince my orthodox Christian parents to let me date the girl I’ve been pseudo-dating for 4 months, and low-key in love with for 2 years. (Oof)",15Nov2018,1

Since it's happened twice with me, I feel that it's my fault for not feeling the same way as my ex-partners on the things we discussed.  I also keep getting attracted to people that are emotionally unavailable for me. I keep gravitating to strong, kind-hearted, nerdy women that, in some cases, are married in relationships or are coworkers.

17,"It's been 6 years since we've last spoken.

It was a fantasy before we first really met, and then it became reality, and then you tore it away. Fantasies of our life together still come and go like the wind. I still hold onto a dream where I have everything.. and you. Should I let go of this dream or not?  It's a fantasy though, or is it a goal? If I actually got you back, what would even happen. I don't know.

I've blocked you out but my memory can still recall the happiness the first time we chatted over text, the joy we had on face-time.  It can still relive the emotions from the first night we slept together as teenagers. Nothing has felt as pure to me as your comfort. Realizing my feelings were unreciprocated was panic, depression, desperation, all swirling at 3000 miles per hour. It was the first time it felt like my world had truly been torn upside down. 

My longing to make things work. I had to let her know this was important to me. To make what work. I don't remember much except for how it made me feel. I think how it made me feel was important. Was it magical or was it a disgusting obsession. Maybe it was the long-distance that gave my imagination so much time to wander and wonder what could be.  I placed her on a pedestal 1000 feet above everyone else, and from there she dropped a boulder on me. 

You needed to give me a reason. Or else my disgusting mind will continue wandering. Years later I understand you probably didn't want to hurt me, or it was hard for you to confront me and be honest.  You struggled with self-esteem (who wouldn't if they compared themselves to Beyonce) so maybe that's why you couldn't muster up the courage to tell me what was really wrong.  

I guess I was burdening you with the pressure of being the one, and I put you on a pedestal you didn't ask to be put on. Did you ever truly love me? I want to ask you, but what would the answer even matter anyway.

If I did things differently would you be happy with me? Would I be happy with you? Did you ever truly love me? Did I ever truly love you? I want to tell you I still have feelings, but at the same time I fear rejection and the loss of hope... At least it's off my chest here.

I can know with all my brain that you aren't special, and that you're not perfect, and that what we had was just chemicals. But somewhere deep down it seems wrong that we don't end up together.

Give me advice: I've been thinking about calling or texting. I just can't stand constantly thinking of her when I feel like I don't know who she is anymore.

26," 

In my life, I've had bad experiences with women. When I was sick I had a weak immune system so I was constantly sick and I went to school a lot and was made fun of and outcasted from everyone and as I grew older I never really learned how to socialize so I got social anxiety. In high school I was lucky enough to get a girlfriend but I realized I never really had feelings for her and was only going to use her as a sexual fleshlight so before it even happened I came to my sense and broke up with her ( she was also crazy saying stuff like, she was going to ""cry until blood comes out of her eyes"" or ""cut herself until I loved her""). It took some time but as high school finished and I'm in college now (2nd year) I've had terrible luck with women, either when it comes to striking a conversation or trying to get past my anxiety. My mind gets blank a lot when I talk to girls and especially the beautiful ones.  
So the reason for my post was recently a girl who is in my class sends me a pic of her in a bra. I'm like in my head ""holy fuck this girl is out of my league and I think she might be either trying to play me since she has a boyfriend or she wants to fuck"". I strike a normal conversation ignoring the pic she sends and I find out she was on Xanax and she had broken up with her boyfriend that night. I made the decision to talk to her when she was sober so she could be feeling better when she was making her decisions. So I talked with her after class and I made it kind of awkward towards the end of our conversation when she was at her class building since she kind of signaled me that she wanted me to go so I just left. Later that day maybe 4 hours later, I go to the cafeteria to get some food, guess what, she's there and I'm pretty sure we notice each other about the same time. I walk up to her and say what's up, I didn't expect you here, and she responds with are you stalking me and laughs after that. So in my head, I'm like oh shes joking and ask her if she needs someplace to sit and she says ""she came with with a friend"" so I respond with ""oh ok Ill see you then"". I check my snap cause I wanted to text her but I see that she blocked me. I'm just realizing how bad of a mistake I was to even think about making a move since she was out of my league and my own classmate. Maybe I should've just left the snap of her bra alone.

P.S. I forgot to mention shes sent me a selfie of herself before to me but not as explicit as the bra pic.

27," Hey guys, I always heard when individuals are interested/attracted to someone there's obvious signs and some that are more subtle. I'm having a hard time figuring out if this girl in two of my classes is showing interest or not. 

I have notice we tend to glance at each other at times and i would describe her as shy but does talk when I ask her questions etc. When we talk is a decent conversation then it goes dry and it ends with an awkward silence. We been seeing each other at campus and we just glance at each other. In the second class I once came late to lecture, and notice she was looking straight at me until I sat down, couple minutes before that I saw her walking around campus and she saw me but I was looking at my phone.

Last class I ask her if she’s going to the second class and she said yeah because i did not attend the last two, are you? I said maybe, I’m going to talk to this girl in my other class and she said look at you and I told her see ya. Other times we don't say anything as just move on with our days but is hard to tell.

He was busted with meth, weed, pills, ammunition, guns, and assorted other weapons. He is around 60 years old and has dozens of similar charges stemming from the 1970s until around a decade ago, when he seemingly cleaned up his act. 

Based on his criminal history, I do not see any judge being lenient. I imagine he will be looking at around 20 years, but that is just a guess. Due to his age and extremely poor health (as a lifelong drug user he has multiple issues including hep C) I think it’s very likely he will die in his cell. 

My daughter is 9 now, and while contact with “grandpa” was always infrequent and brief, she will eventually notice that he’s gone. 

So, should I explain that grandpa is in jail due to some bad choices and that she may not see him again, or should I lie and tell her that he moved away and explain it to her when she’s older?

I don't want my entire group to start hating me for being a snitch but I also want my tooth fixed as it is very painful and annoying. Any advice would be much appreciated :))",15Nov2018,1

Now i’ve never had good social skills. It’s not that i didn’t have friends growing up (I did), it’s just something that has never come naturally to me. I’m awkward around people I don’t know, get way too anxious about approaching people to talk to them, and whenever i try to get myself out and be social, i panic and spend the night in my residence alone. another thing that didn’t help is that i had class all trough the club fair, so i couldn’t join any clubs.

So now, i’m 3/4 through semester one, have no friends, and everyone has already settled in their cliques. i have no idea how to make friends at this point and it’s led to me being depressed. i want to make friends so badly but it seems i’m just completely incapable of doing that. i’m completely lost and need guidance. any help is welcome. thank you.",15Nov2018,1

It’s been our rule to only have protected sex outside of our relationship but I messed up and now I’m in a really bad situation. 


I had morning sex with my bf and he didn’t pull out but my period had ended 2 days before so we thought we were in the clear. That same night I went out with some friends and ran into an old fling and one thing led to another and we had unprotected sex. I told my bf and we decided not to have sex until I got an STD check. Fast forward a month and I find out I’m pregnant. 


Now we didn’t have sex at all after that morning so I’m certain the pregnancy happened that day.  
My old fling and I had “drunk” sex, well he was drunk, me not so much. I know for a fact that he didn’t cum because he got soft and it ended. 


My bf is aware of all this and he wants to keep this baby but I just don’t think I can. The thought that this baby might not be his drives me nuts and I’m depressed over all this. 


My bf swears that there is no way that it’s my old flings baby since he didn’t even cum and my bf actually came inside me.

I still live at home but everything to do with the puppy is my responsibility I pay for his needs, obedience classes, and vet bills.  Well yesterday my father carelessly left his hearing aid god knows where and of course my puppy thought it’d be a cool thing to consume. No one informed me at the time because they figured my dad just lost it (although apparently my mom already suspected my puppy ate it). Well after this all occurred I went to the vet for routine care, got him vaccinated, microchipped, prevention tablets for tick and heart worm, etc. You can imagine the bill was pretty expensive.       
                                    
Well, I got home and after about two hours that’s when they decided to inform me my puppy may of swallowed a hearing aid. I was literally just at the vet. My mom said I may want to take him back to a vet tomorrow. I told her I just dropped a bunch of money and frankly it felt a bit unfair for me to pay for someone else’s carelessness. She said she’d cover the bill (it would have to be at an emergency vet clinic seeing my vet is always to weeks booked). I said fine and that was the conversation. 

Well I just got back from the vet where he needed an X-ray, examination fee, he did consume it so a call to poison control, and some food to help clear it out of his system because luckily it was in his colon. Unfortunately they can’t tell if the battery is still in the device and may have caused more damage and we will have to wait for him to poop it out. 

Well I got home and informed them of the bill. They told me there is no way they can afford it, and that I would I have to pay. I brought up how much they cover my brother’s ass which is another beast on its own. I deleted the post but saved the text if you want to dive into that below.  But I did bring it up with the rest of why this isn’t my fault. Anywho now my mom is guilty me into saying she will have to pawn off her class ring and such. 

Regardless, I was under the impression they’d be covering this. But now it’s just as much my fault as theirs that he swallowed the damn thing that I don’t own nor is my responsibility to keep an eye on..? I’m pissed needless to say. 

First TLDR: 

My puppy swallowed my dads hearing aid when he placed it in a spot the dog could reach. Mom said they’d cover the vet bill, seeing it was their mistake. Turns out they don’t want to cover it, and now we are in a huge argument and I have the bill sitting on my credit card.

Brother stuff if you care to read:

I’m going to try to make this short but I really need to vent. Honestly, skip if you don’t want to read a woe is me type rant. 

My brother is now 23 and in college for a second senior year, due to him flunking many of his college courses. He only got a job recently thanks to me putting in a good word at the store I work for. He is predicted to be over 75,000 dollars in debt and lives two hours away from home in an apartment he can't afford. He is in over his head and regrets his major but wants to see it through because he is so close (if he doesn’t fail any more courses). He is severely depressed about his finical state and comes to my parents whenever he needs help emotionally or financially. Although his mood has lifted a tad thanks to him getting his FIRST actual job.  I know I sound bitter and I am due to the fact my parents are pouring money into his pockets.

Now, I am 20 and have been working at my job since I was 16 saving up for whatever I may need in the future. Thanks to this I now am pretty finically sound. I go to community college free of tuition due to a program I was able to get in. I also have received refunds from the school for scholarships (I maintain straight A’s in hopes to get into med school someday). I am living at home rent free but pay for most necessities, except for the occasional meal my mom makes. I make payments on a car each month and they agreed to pay the insurance(keep in mind they gave my brother their old car). My boyfriend and I are making plans to move in together in our own place. I recently got myself a dog and pay for all of his vet bills, food, training, etc. Basically, I’d like to think I’m in a great spot.

Yet, whenever I find myself asking for help on the smallest of things, they tell me they don’t have the money for it. While I know each month they transfer my brother over 400 dollars a month (dipping into their retirement funds just to get by). I only know this because of an email I saw that was up on the computer one day. Today I decided to tell them I was considering buying pet insurance for my dog and their response was I should pay for my car insurance first. Although they still pay for my brothers and probably will continue to do so till god knows when. Honestly, I am upset, it feels like they are putting all their eggs into his basket, and he seems to have little remorse knowing they are struggling financially just to help him. Every time he is on the way to head home from visiting, my mom asks if he needs money to buy food or coffee for the road like she has it to spare. It really makes me excited to move out, because it pains me to listen to how much they are struggling to get by and pay for him to stay afloat.

TLDR: Parents pay for everything for my failing older brother to get by, evening resorting to dipping into their retirement (over 400 a month). But when I ask for simple things or mention big purchases, they suggest I pay for more things like insurance yet they still pay for him in full. It makes me sick to think about how he does this with no remorse and I feel hurt that no matter my achievements I’m still put second for any sorts of funds.

Am I the bad guy here? If I am I’ll reconsider it all. It may just be resentment. Also I can afford the vet bill, it’s just they said they’d cover it and went back on their word.",15Nov2018,1
45,"Got into a little dispute with my boyfriend yesterday and I’m not sure who’s in the wrong here. But basically, 5 months ago he told me he bought me something and that it’s on the way. I was excited to find out what it was. Months passed and I never received anything, so a couple months ago I asked him what happened and he immediately shut me down, refused to answer my question, and simply said he made an embarrassing mistake. He told me he would tell me then, so I just let it go. I assumed that maybe it was just gonna take longer to arrive. 

Yesterday I remembered and brought it up again and he immediately started insisting that he already explained to me what happened, which is untrue. He refused to tell me again. I started getting annoyed and accused him of lying. He got offended and asked if I honestly don’t remember him telling me about him getting scammed when he bought me a $30 watch. Tbh, I have a really good memory and I would remember these details if he really had told me. He kept trying to convince me that this convo took place but I know it didn’t. 

Im not upset that I never got the gift, I was just wondering what happened and I didn’t think it would be a big deal to ask. But it’s hard for me to tell if he was trying to gaslight me, or his brain really did fabricate this memory that he had explained what happened to me already. I ended up apologizing this morning because I didn’t wanna seem like some crazy bitch who starts arguments over something as silly as a watch and he told me it’s okay, he said I’m going through a lot and I just needed to vent.",15Nov2018,1

47,"I'm twenty-one years old, and there's this girl who I work with who I suspect is into me (she's asked me out before to which I politely dismissed). She's nice and real down to earth, which is a rare quality in a person. The only problem is I'm not really that attracted to her. That being said, I don't actually think I could do better. 

I think if we did get together we'd make a good couple. But then again, I'm not really looking for a relationship right now anyway. I'm a pretty reserved person when it comes to dating and relationships (meaning I don't actively seek them out). I wouldn't even know what to expect from a relationship or what even makes a good couple as I've never been in one. Maybe it would be good for me to get into one though, as most people my age have been in one. 

To put it in a really juvenile way, I think this girl is pretty cool, but the idea of having to potentially go down on her grosses me out, and I feel like you just shouldn't enter into a relationship with a person if they're going to repulse you when you have to show intimacy.

49," I've dealt with lots of stress/depression, ect in the past and I finally read this book that the dalai lama wrote about compassion. Pretty good stuff. I used to be very very negative about every little thing, and I have learned to better myself and being more available to  who may need help with anything. Recently a ""friend"" of mind came to me about her depression and sadness because I had gone through a dark place like that earlier in the year. I've been doing what I can to help and I try to not step on her toes, sort of speak because I understand what depression can drive you to do or say. She's been in a weird situation with some guy and comes to me for help, after our talks she ignores what I try to tell her and things continue to happen to her for the worse....and when things get worse...who do you think she runs to? me lol. Of course I think about her wellbeing , but it is to the point where she wants to argue and doesn't even say a simple ""thank you."" (I'm not the type of guy that needs recognition for anything, I just look at it from a manners aspect I guess). The old me would have cut ties immediately and pretended like I didn't know her...but there is still a part of me that wants to help.....I just can't stand people being ungrateful. I'm not saying you need to reward me but a thank you goes a long way.....so idk what to do here. I understand that people with depression can say or do drastic things because of their mental state...but even when I was depressed, I was able to have at least some civility when interacting with people. Is there a way to keep being nice? Or should I look out for myself and ignore her?

I want to know whether a man is gay or not but not based on stupid stereotypes and social stigma. 

I hire a technician for repairing stuff at the house from time to time. His ass is bubbly and is usually partially exposed but that may be because he is climbing a metal ladder. He touches his front junk for 5 secs or less couple of times over 2 hrs period of time to fix his junk positions. He tries to fetch a chat with me about any topic when I was giving him a ride to his home after the job was done

His Characteristics:

Uneducated

Hot and attractive

Got a good curvy ass no muscles leaned a bit skinny

Sparkly eyes

Brown skin that looks like if it was tanned

Poor outfit becoz he is broke

He is living with his brother and roommates

He is young

Single

Simple and friendly

Wears red aussie bums

I donno maybe his actions come from his ignorance about manners. We live in a HOMOPHOBE country. He may be straight and not knowing he is sending gay interest signs...



TLDR; I am gay. I live in a homophobic country. I would like to drop subtle hints to know if he is gay and interested in me.

Hello, for a bit of background I'm an 18 year old male, never had anyone to love me, and I moved away from my family over a year ago and live on my own. I have to work 25 hours a week, plus full time student, plus I live around 2 hours away from my university, Now the workload itself is manageable, I'm able to pull through even with difficult classes. But mentally I've been going downhill for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I do not want a therapist, I know what my issues are. I'm lonely as fuck. I miss my mom, I miss my dad, I miss my sister, I miss my friends. People here are shit, I don't like them and they don't like me. I feel isolated and on the weekends I get mental breakdowns.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had anyone, I just want someone. I've been doing all the usual stuff like working out, dressing well, good hair, cologne, and used different ways to ask out girls but I never get a date. I've honestly just given up. I still try but it's just a chore at this point. I can't handle it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I see cute girls all the time on campus, and honestly while I would like to have sex, I genuinely just want to have someone to cuddle with or sleep with in bed. How can I go about asking them? I send most of my money to my family (about 80%) and spend about 10%, and save up the rest 10%. I have an emergency fund and other relatives that can back me up if I get into an emergency, and for expendable i have about 2,500$. How can I approach them and ask to spend a night just hugging and sleeping?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

please don't try to derail or get me to stop. Theres nothing illegal or immoral about this, I just want company.

I recently got myself a dog and pay for all of his vet bills, food, training, etc. Basically, I’d like to think I’m in a great spot.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, whenever I find myself asking for help on the smallest of things, they tell me they don’t have the money for it. While I know each month they transfer my brother over 400 dollars a month (dipping into their retirement funds just to get by). I only know this because of an email I saw that was up on the computer one day. Today I decided to tell them I was considering buying pet insurance for my dog and their response was I should pay for my car insurance first. Although they still pay for my brothers and probably will continue to do so till god knows when. Honestly, I am upset, it feels like they are putting all their eggs into his basket, and he seems to have little remorse knowing they are struggling financially just to help him. Every time he is on the way to head home from visiting, my mom asks if he needs money to buy food or coffee for the road like she has it to spare. It really makes me excited to move out, because it pains me to listen to how much they are struggling to get by and pay for him to stay afloat.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Parents pay for everything for my failing older brother to get by, evening resorting to dipping into their retirement (over 400 a month). But when I ask for simple things or mention big purchases, they suggest I pay for more things like insurance yet they still pay for him in full. It makes me sick to think about how he does this with no remorse and I feel hurt that no matter my achievements I’m still put second for any sorts of funds.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I the bad guy here? If I am I’ll reconsider it all. It may just be resentment. Also, I can afford the vet bill, it’s just they said they’d cover it and went back on their word.",15Nov2018,1
64,"This has been killing me for about a month. I have to make a huge life decision based on such a wide range of factors and I’ve been torn about it for too long. I need advice whether to start a business in a foreign country or stay in the States and be an employee. 

Backstory: i worked in investment real estate for 2 years.  It’s a stressful version of sales and I hated it so I decided to join the Peace Corps with my wife. I eventually learned how to do sales and started liking the job (and got good at), but we still decided to leave. We moved to the Dominican Republic for 1.5 years where I worked on business development for a small town. I built up contacts out there and during my down time I developed a business plan. A REALLY GOOD business plan, that can have us running between $200k-$400k within 2 years. Of course, that comes with huge risk.

1.5 years into the trip, my wife becomes depressed and we both get separated from the Peace Corps and come back to the States. She quickly gets a job in the $80k range back at home in her chosen field. 

I now have the option to stay at home and look for a good sales job or go back to the DR and start a business there. 

If we moved back, the goal is to start the business, pass on operations responsibilities to a local manager, and move to Miami where I would remotely manage and control sales with a quick flight back whenever needed. This would take at least two years, up to 4, probably 3. 

Pros for starting business:
-Money. A lot of fucking money. Like 1:5 earnings difference.
-difference between middle class and upper class life for self and future generations. 
-Get to be my own self-made human. 


Cons:
Risk. A lot of fucking risk.
 -might lose all of raw material supply
 -might end up in snafu where I’m not making the money I thought I would and can’t recoup investment cash fast enough. 
 -might lose all my investment and time
-I’m in the early 30s, a time where saving for retirement is paramount. 
Have to live in the DR for years.
  -inherently more dangerous. Just driving, let alone robbery, burglary, and everything else. Let alone health care. 
  - less nice things
-Wife might just up and leave if causing depression again
-Wife obviously wants to stay in States with chosen profession.
-It’s going to be a constant fight with corruption, raw material supply, and people who don’t honor contracts. 
-I give it a 65% chance of great success, 75% chance of reasonable success.

66,I'm a 19 year old currently working full time as a supervisor aswell as attending university for sound design. Recently I've had to cut back my classes even more because of work. Its been a one semester since I started and I'm really loving the experience I'm recieving from the classes I'm in but I'm falling behind on my homework and projects due to the fact that I have no free time to do it. I like what I currently do (Meaning my job) and I can potentially see a future but I see a much brighter and happier future through what I'm studying. I think the money is definitely a reason I haven't yet made up my mind but I've got plenty in my savings from when I first started especially to survive quite awhile without worrying at all. I just don't know what to do. Should I just quit now and focus on my education? Or should I try and switch to part time and lose my role as supervisor? Or just keep going how i am?

67,"I'm 29 years old and I don't know how to drive. Nobody ever taught me as a teen and we couldn't afford driver's ed. 

My mother was always scared of driving too so she kind of ingrained that in me. She did drive for years though but slowly got more and more anxious that her driving radius got smaller and smaller until she gave up driving entirely. So, needless to say, she was never able to give me any lessons barring one single time when I drove her van behind the grocery store for about 100 feet and then stopped.

All throughout my 20s I've never really needed to drive. I live in a city with great public transportation so it was just never necessary. But now that I'm almost 30 and really trying to better myself by getting a career, I'm finding that not  knowing how to drive is really holding me back. The career that I would like to pursue requires a car very early on from the internship to the second year of school. Even when I've tried looking for other jobs in the meantime I find that a good 50% of them require a license. I've found really awesome sounding jobs that I fully qualify for except that one thing. 

Starting in September a friend of mine started giving me lessons in his car in a parking lot. I just practiced making smooth turns around a circle and just learning how to control the wheel. A few times we drove out into the street in a lane and I had a really hard time staying in the lane and keeping the wheel straight. That seems to be my biggest issues. Keeping the wheel straight and staying on the right side of the road even in the parking lot. I did start to get the hang of turning but that was all we were able to get done. 

Now that Winter is coming and the days are short our schedules on our days off don't really allow for us to start early in the day so it's already getting dark by the time we're able to start driving. I don't want to practice in the dark. That sounds terrifying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, so I guess I'm here because I feel really stuck and I feel like I'll never learn to drive. It seems like it comes so naturally to people that already drive but it seems SO FUCKING HARD to me! I see people that are a decade younger than me just hopping into their cars and pulling away like no big deal and they make it look so easy. I feel like so many people had the advantage of learning when they're young and capable and they pick it up really easy. Learning in your late 20s just seems so fucking hard. ",15Nov2018,1
68,"Sorry if this is not the right place to ask about this, if this is the wrong sub then direction to the right sub is appreciated!

I used to work at a fast food place. It was my first job, and I was on the 90 day trial. The day before my trial was set to end, at the end of my last shift I was unexpectedly told my employment would be terminated. I was given no other explanation other than the job just didn’t seem right for me. I was given a reference letter that was all positive to give to my next employer, and I was told not to come back for any more shifts. 

I’m still not sure why I was fired. I’m assuming it’s because I was a bit of a slow learner when it came to the lunch rushes and had gaps in my training since no one really trained me, but they acknowledged this and I was told I’d be swapping shifts to quieter days so I could learn more and fill in these gaps in my training, so being fired was definitely unexpected as I thought my shifts would be changed a few days prior?

Anyways, I just recently had a job interview for another place. I mentioned my previous work experience, and they asked why I left the job. I explained what happened, what my employer told me, and I was honest. I have a feeling I’m not going to get the job, as it’s not a good impression that I’ve been fired, and my explanation was a bit shitty (a fault on my part for not fully thinking through what I’d say when asked). They also didn’t bother with my reference letter unfortunately.

I'm getting divorced don't need advice on that but I do need advice on what to do next

I 29(m) my ex 28(f) have been in a relationship for 5 years married 3 we had a beautiful baby girl 2 years old I love her completely right now she's in DHS custody because well one bad night I was accused of neglect (no evidence or proof) long story short she got taken out of my and my wife's custody (please don't get hung up on that just know it's false it's all he said she said not even from my wife a 3rd party person at my job who never seen my child or even my house) isn't DHS amazing

Now fast forward almost 2 years since she got taken away my life has been ruined my wife left me because the court and DHS is taking forever to get our daughter home (again they have no proof or evidence) I completed everything they wanted but because I will not admit all the horrible things I was accused of to be true they are trying to terminate my parental rights and my now ex wife's rights too

I stand at a cross road because my now ex wife wants absolutely nothing to do with our daughter because she's calling someone else mama which even hurts me too and when I do get her back because my lawyer and I both know they have nothing so I can 100% get her back I will have to raise her 100% by myself and I want to but because of the hell I have been put through because of DHS I lost all my family and friends I have 0 support system 0 family 0 friends and when I do get her back I will have 100% custody because my ex wants nothing to do with her

Now here's the problem if I go through the system and get her back she's already attached to Foster parents begging for mama and daddy even in my arms I don't want to torment this beautiful baby girl and rip her ""mama and dada"" away from her but if I don't I honestly feel like I will be killing myself figuratively by ripping her away from me giving up parental rights

And it seems everyone is against me my mother who has always hated me has been telling DHS horrible things about me my now ex has been doing the same telling them I was abusive an such but just know even DVIS Domestic abuse center has cleared me because I don't fit any of their metrics of a abusive man

I'm scared and I don't know what to do because I don't have a support system my ex doesn't even want to see her daughter if I do give up on my daughter i don't know what to do I lost everything and i honestly want to try and be that single dad but I'm scared and tormented by thoughts of my daughter having a better life where she is than with me not looking for anything but advice on what to next would ease these tormented thoughts I have

Now a little about myself I have a good paying job good house able to pay my bills easily but just no friends or family no drugs no alcohol dependency no health issues as of now besides depression (which is understandable) works hard hours are 7am-5ishpm even my therapist says she's shocked DHS is doing this because I do sessions with my daughter and she wants DHS to move towards overnights and living with me

75,"I made friends with someone just near the end of the school year in June, not because we were similar but because we both played this video game I liked. I had always known him as a funny person, but when you got to know him, he was a really toxic person. I became ""friends"" with him, or so I thought I had, and I played this game with him for the entire summer. Only halfway through had I realized how horrible of a person he was, because he constantly threatened to beat me up, saying ""September 5th, (which was the first day of school at least where I am) you're getting jumped"". He would always laugh and so would his friends in the discord call, but I laughed along as a joke. I honestly felt really threatened. I couldn't even escape them because they constantly dm'd me trying to get me to play with them every single day. He wouldn't just tell me he'd beat me up, he would call me a loser and things like that, and exaggerate on it a lot. His friends would always agree with him no matter what, and I would always pretend to laugh along with them. I dealt with this shit for 2 months straight and my entire summer was ruined because of him. He never did do anything on Sept. 5th and his excuse was that ""it was sarcasm kid, you're too gullible."" Being an idiot, I only found the courage to block him once school started and I'd realized the kind of person he was. He stopped talking to me after I blocked him.

2 months later in November, my friend (a different one who I've been close with forever) pissed me off once while we were texting. This friend is quite popular and he's known as a friendly guy. I will admit, I am jealous of him in one way or another. I felt like being a huge asshole to him for this reason saying shit like ""stfu you mental fuck"" to him over and over again. Keep in mind this was not the type of thing we ever usually said to each other. At first he took it as a joke, but I kept doing it for 2 weeks straight. 1 week in, I started threatening him, like my first friend in the other paragraph did. I told him my other boys would jump him on December 1st. Once again he originally took it as a joke but as the days went on and I kept saying it, he took it seriously. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've seriously fucked with his mind even though I meant almost nothing that I said to him. I don't know why I started acting this particular way towards him because I would have never have done this before meeting the other friend, but I can only think that I felt like it had to do with myself being threatened by my other friend, which is why I mentioned that story in the first place. I feel horrible. He has told me to never contact him again, and he says he will tell the principal at our school. He has always been one of my closest friends and I've known him forever. I don't know what to do but I want to be his friend again and want him to realize I was joking about everything. The thing is, he knows about the whole thing with the other friend and I told him my explanation that I've given here, but he refuses to accept it.

When I was 9 or 10 years old, I had 2 books checked out from the public library.  One day my mom told me we were moving to across the country at the end of the week-completely out of the blue (she was very sick, that's a different story entirely).

I started packing my things and when I came to my books, I thought it made sense to take the library book jackets off and peel the checkout card slots off. I don't know what I was thinking.. I was a kid.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 4 or 5 years and we never did end up moving.  At this point we were in a different town but the same general area and I had entirely forgotten that the books ever belonged to the library. 

One day on Facebook I received a message from the business page of the public library I had checked those books out of. Because I was so young when I checked the books out, they didn't have any information on me  besides my first and last name and I guess they pulled some Nev Schulman magic and eventually found me.

They messaged me saying I had racked up more than $500 in late fees and that I needed to bring the books in immediately.

I tried to explain what had happened and said I would bring the books back, but let them know that the barcodes had all been removed.

The person on the other end just said, ""Well, come down to the library and we will go from there.""

I wasn't old enough to have my own money yet, didn't have a way to get down there even if I had the courage to, and I wasn't about to tell my rats in the attic crazy mom that I owed the library a few hundred dollars. In my mind, they may as well have told me I needed to send 3 trillion dollars to planet Neptune.

90,"Last night I had a very vivid dream which left me confused when I woke up. Almost every night I have a dream or two that I remember immediately upon waking up and I usually lose them by the end of the day. I am still a little off put by this one in particular, though. I thought maybe I would have a better understanding of it if I wrote it down. If anyone has any thoughts or possible interpretations of it, please let me know.  I would be thrilled to have some feedback. 

My dream started off as me nine months pregnant in labor with my first child. I gave birth to her painlessly and it was a very beautiful moment even though I was alone in the process. I don't remember the switch from the birth setting to my house. My mom was hovering me and telling me how to take care of my baby, which I absolutely opposed. I named her Daiya. I have never known anyone with this name before and I'm not really sure where it came from but I think its a really pretty name, nonetheless.

Everything about this dream felt so real. I held my baby girl in awe. She felt like a real baby does in our world. Usually in dreams I lose my sense of touch, but this baby had weight and was soft and beautiful. I even changed her diaper at one point, not something I would imagine doing in a dream. But something about this dream made the baby seem so real to me. As if I really had her and she was really mine.

Everyone was coming out of the wood work to see my new child.  The freakiest part of this dream however, is that my current boyfriend was nowhere to be found. It was like he didn't exist. In fact, the father of my child was my ex from about three years ago. 

In the dream, I consciously knew he was the father of the baby and I hadn't seen or slept with him since I conceived Daiya. The father didn't even know that I was pregnant. I hid it from everyone. No one knew until I had her until I posted about it on my ""finsta"" account. (I know, crazy, right??) Everyone who had come to see me and the new baby was trying to convince me to call the father and tell him that I had given birth to his baby. It wasn't that simple, though. 

I didn't want to tell him. How would he react to being a new father? Surely he would be mad that I kept my whole pregnancy from everyone, especially him. And on top of that, I didn't want to share my new pride and joy with him, or anyone for that matter. I was convinced I would raise her and take care of her all by myself. I cared for her until the minute I woke up. It was confusing at first because after I opened my eyes. I had to sperate my dream from reality. This dream almost made my want to contact my ex and just ask what's been up with him lately. It's been over a year since I've talked to him. I just wanna know why I'm still so off put by it. I can't stop thinking about it. It was just *so real.*",15Nov2018,1

96,"Specific knowledge on qualifying for disability would help, but other advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad is a type 1 diabetic who has been struggling financially for years, specifically since he lost his pipe fitting job back in '08. He's gotten inconsistent work here and there but the union jobs he finds never last longer than a few weeks and I suspect that is due to his lack of control over his blood sugar.  In fact, every job he's found he hasn't held down and frankly I'm really worried about him.

I was living with him throughout high school but after graduating he moved back to Chicago, 1200 miles away (it wasn't really by his choice, but that's another story). He lived with a lot of family members but due to his volatile and extremely dependent personality he often burned bridges with those who were helping him. Now he's living on his own and he often calls me and talks about his fears - being alone, dying alone, being unable to pay his rent, medical bills (insulin), etc.

Today he called me up crying. He lost his wallet and along with it, all the money he has. 5k, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, he carried all of it. He doesn't trust banks and owes money to the IRS. I don't know what he's going to do.

I suspect he has a mental disability, possibly exasperated by his blood sugar going below 30 on a regular basis. He generally talks slowly and repeats a lot. He has a short fuse, he suffers from depression and anxiety.  Sometimes he comes off as bi-polar, sobbing one minute and angry the next. I would like to find out if he qualifies for disability. Aside from mental issues, he has diabetic neuropathy in his hands and his vision is decreasing rapidly. Tunnel vision on one eye, botched cataract surgery on the other. 

I feel so much sadness thinking of the bad luck he's had. Sometimes I'm just frustrated by his bad decision making and inability to do his own research.

He seems to lack the ability to find a job for himself and I think he would benefit from a caretaker of sorts, but I'm in no position to pay medical expenses. He has talked about suicide before and I really want to find some solution that can get him back on track. He needs to learn some life skills, to find some friends and hobbies. I don't how I can help him, but I care about him and I would really appreciate any advice you all have. Thanks for your time.",15Nov2018,1

While not great, I had only spent about 1000 on purchasing the car so overall I feel I've gotten my moneys worth.



Took the car in after hearing an odd noise and feeling a strange sensation when turning at low mph. I replaced the power steering hose myself years ago and figured it was leaking fluid and it was the power steering hose again. Turns out the control arm bushing/ball joint/sway all need to be replaced and will be around 1200-1400 for everything (original quote was for 1800 but that included a couple other minor things that I wouldn't do).



When is the time to put the car out to pasture? Driving on this is super dangerous cause the freeway I take to work is 70 mph speedlimit and it sounds like the ball joint could kinda just give out at any time.

I'm not transgender, and I don't identify as non binary, but I love these styles and expressing femininity in this way has been so fun and freeing, to the point where I'd love to integrate styles like this into my every day life (Btw, style advice or suggestions would definitely be appreciated).

She is in one of my classes and she is honestly a really nice person to talk to, but she appears to be looking rather down lately.

From what I’ve heard, my friend went on a date with someone from the county high school across from ours and the date went south quickly.

My friend isn’t really great with relationships in her history, but she is always wanting someone to be with her.

I feel like I could get to know her better as being a close friend. However I’m not that close of a friend. I want to get to know her better, such ways I’ve tried is inviting her to some of my hangouts with my friends, but she appears to be busy often with her family, basketball, and church related activities.

I feel as if I could try starting a relationship by asking her to go to prom with me as a friend, but I don’t know if she has been talking to anyone from my high school or from another one.

I’ve never have been in a relationship before, and I’m one of those guys who’s in the boat of ‘wait and let the girl ask you,’ but as a slightly overweight person (6’2” and 255 pounds) I feel afraid I would be terrible with relationships and that girls wouldn’t date me because of it.

104,"Throwaway account as people know my other one. I've been stuck on this choice all year, so all feedback much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I've grown up with my grandparents and always had a great time staying at their house over the holidays etc. As I got to be about 10+, my mom slowly told me that they'd abused her growing up, badly, in most of the ways you can think of. She'd kept me in their lives as a bit of a final effort to continue a relationship with them (which she now regrets), but fell out with them once and for all when I was about 15. 

&amp;#x200B;

By then I had a car and would keep in touch, visit etc and put it in the back of my mind. As I've got older and I've seen more of what my mom has gone through in life has been the consequence of that childhood, and this too has effected me (multiple divorces etc, the siblings of that generation are all split, uncles talk to each other and the grandparents, mom and her sister only talk to each other). I haven't seen my uncles since I was 15. Mom has a way of always mentioning her parents in casual conversation and will tell stories of what she went through pretty much once a week (they weren't fed, she was called names, punched once, abused by her father, generally uncared for.) We're pretty much like ""yes mom, we know this one..."" You can imagine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I was visiting the grandparents until recently, and kind of putting it in the back of my mind, but this year I'm finding it more difficult to reconcile. My aunt came out to visit them (her relationship with them was recently restored) and she didn't end up seeing my mom during the trip, as she claims they forbade it and made it difficult. I've never seen this side of them, they seem like slightly religious old people, who talk to these uncles I don't know. I currently live overseas and I'm close to cutting them out at this stage, but I'm also scared to think of how I'd feel if one of them died. Basically I'm torn between loyalty for my mom/or whether I can keep the relationship separate. It's very difficult and I don't particularly enjoy visiting them any more because it's in my head and awkward because they don't talk to my mother or my younger brothers and sisters as a consequence. What should I do?

Hi everyone. Twitch lurker for a few years and recently an interesting situation came to my attention. It’s juicy tea so i hope I can tell the story in a manor people can understand but in the end Im looking for advice on - things to say IRL to parties involved and possible alerting a party to what could be borderline obsessive stalker behavior or toxicity. 

Male- 28 splits (know of IRL) with female 26 (person i know IRL) after ten year relationship and one year of marriage to say he needs to focus on his twitch career. From what I’ve seen he has streamed for 2-3 months and has apx. 1500 followers. Male 28 also admits that he has strong feelings for female streamer - that he hasn’t met IRL. but plays duos with often within the past two months Other than playing duos female streamer seems to be just as kind to several dedicated fans not just this male streamer. 

Also male - 28 seems to have alluded to the desire to have wife/female 26 move out so he can have a “twitch house” that instantly made me think of Jake Paul. 

Obviously separation happens if unhappy, and no crime has been committed but I think the fact that it’s happened close to me IRL makes me more concerned. The sudden decision screams sociopathic tendencies to me, and I am well aware of the constant negativity and harassment females on twitch and the internet in general have to deal with.

113,"Hi Reddit, hope y’all are having a great day because I’m certainly not!

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering how you guys cope with the inevitability of being alone in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify myself, I am not lonely. I feel like loneliness constitutes yearning for people. I do have a lot of friends at my college who I’m very grateful for, but I still feel so ungrounded and miles away from any substantial relationships to the point where I feel like all these casual friendships and relationships are meaningless.

&amp;#x200B;

The reasons I feel so alone are these: 

1. In the 20 years of my life I’ve moved back and forth between 4 countries

2. I attended 11 different schools so I did not make any long lasting friendships apart from two friends who live in different countries.

3. I’m an only child so I do not have any sibling. Also I’m not close to my parents or extended family because I have a hard time communicating with them due to cultural and language barriers in addition to the fact that I live in a different continent from them.

4. I go to a public university so it’s very difficult to make a close group of friends. I do have a lot of individual friends, but after a year of college I still don’t have a set group of friends despite joining multiple clubs because everyone has such hectic schedules. So I don’t feel a sense of community at all at my school. + I would have totally joined a sorority, but I’ve heard that they have so much drama/ cattiness and a lot of negative reviews from my friends who are in them.

5. I know I’m probably going to have to leave the country I go to school in because its so hard to get a sponsored visa after graduation, so everything that I build up here is going to disappear when I’m forced to leave.

6. Because of the above reason, I find it very hard to begin relationships because I know that I’ll have to break up with the other person eventually aka I find it hard to commit and I find it even harder to find a person that I truly connect with and am attracted to because of my “diverse”(more like belonging nowhere) background. I’ll like guys but I won’t date them because I’m too focused on the pain that will follow post break ups.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a speck of dirt on this planet, very insignificant and ready to be wiped away at any point. I sometimes wonder if I’ll have a group of friends to take grad pictures with or have anyone come to my wedding or (sorry for the morbidness) my funeral (if I die after my parents).

&amp;#x200B;

I’m trying my best to stay afloat and positive by pursuing my hobbies and having a lot of interests, but I find the fact that I’ll always be alone hard to accept.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd blame the boss but well he's never there. lol

Longest person has only been here two months and is already most senior employee.

I'm the second senior one and i've only been their 4 days.

I was told in the beginning it would take time to learn everything we would be doing but I was taken off guard when I found out I was expected to know the majority of my job duties by now.

Even the most senior person isn't really sure what to do.

I'm very stressed out and am already being berated for asking questions over phone. Customers keep asking where the boss is cause he keeps telling them he will meet with them but is never there and doesn't always answer phone right away. In addition the place is a huge fire hazard. Electric cables are casually sprawled over a toilet with other boxes. My parents say this place is a serious safety hazard cause tons of chairs and other stuff are blocking emergency exits and I should just leave.

I don't need this job to be honest and could quit but a part of me feels like I failed if I leave. I'm actually getting stable emotionally and to leave a job so soon makes me wonder if i'm regressing into instability. Having autism also makes me wonder if that's why I failed and I feel like giving up means I'll never be able to do more than retail.",15Nov2018,1
123,"I've just realized this about myself. I normally pride myself on considering a situation where I felt I'd been wronged and letting go of it. This may be continuing a friendship with someone who stole from me, for example, or something similar, instead of breaking things off. It's something I went out of my way to do - but I act spiteful afterwards, and bitter. It's not healthy for me and it's toxic for whoever has to deal with it. How do I come around to dealing with these feelings? Is it alright to continue trying to let go of these problems when it's obviously causing me to be a POS? Im frustrated with myself for doing it, especially now that I've finally realized this is what it is, but it's impulsive and I don't know how to work through that.

I deflect with humor or just ignore and I'm sick of it. But it literally disgusts me to acknowledge feelings of closeness with another person. I usually can't sustain a romantic relationship for this reason too. I sometimes feel like I'm not even a person deserving of real stuff life has to offer.

136,"So I have applied to nursing school a couple times. Granted, I know it takes awhile and no one gets in on their first time usually. I have transferred schools a few times and am going to transfer yet again. My main problem is most nursing schools look for experience, which I have very little. I'm not cut out for the CNA route, but I have a certification as a phlebotomist but I don't remember a lot of the tubes and things that go along with the job so I don't feel comfortable pursing a job in that field. I still have the book so I guess I could look over the material but still.

So, I'm at a crossroads as to what I should do. Pursue a Bachelor's in Biology (or whatever I'm closest to finishing) and keep applying to nursing school and hope to get in while seeing if there is any medical job I can get with my little qualifications, or pursue a surgical tech program. 

The tech program is a year and a half. The plan would be finish the program and pursue it for a year or more and pay off as much of my loans as I can, then apply to nursing programs later on.

The Bachelors/continuing to apply route would just keep stacking up loans and hope I don't run out whenever I finally get accepted. Finishing a Bachelor's would also give me more options to apply to nursing programs. ",15Nov2018,1

142," 

Hey Ask Reddit. I was wondering if anybody had any other ideas on how to handle this situation. For some context, I am a male in his 20's, so I'm not exactly helpless or terrified. I'd say I am more angry, confused, and apprehensive.

For a period of several months now I have been receiving harassing text messages. They do not include threats (other than the occasional threat to kick my ass or otherwise fight me). The frequency is about every month or month and a half. What concerns me is more situational. Almost all of these texts include a few common factors

* they come from fake numbers from texting websites (so they can't be traced)
* they all have the same tone of writing and share common themes and insults (as if all written by the same person or group)
* they reference me by name
* they occasionally reference an incident in which two guys attacked me unprovoked, while a third person stood several yards away, watching but not intervening on either side (I came across them at night, they yelled and cursed for me to turn my light off, I said a brief sentence of refusal that did admittedly use the words ""sketchy"" and ""bitches"", they charged me and one took shots at the back of my head while the other bobbed and weaved just out of arms reach, this continued in a monkey in the middle fashion, with various other cheap shots, until I was barely conscious and struggling to stand. I got a few punches in but otherwise lost hard. I went to the ER where they told me I was concussed fairly badly, told them a fight put me there, and was forced to file a police report for what the officer called a felony assault before I could check out of the hospital)
* they never identify themselves
* when I moved cities they texted me saying they knew I lived in ""X"" now even though I hadn't posted it on social media or told anyone but close friends and family (to be fair, I moved for work, this probably wasn't a situation where they literally tracked me down despite my best efforts)

Recently I received a couple calls from a number with no call ID but there was silence on the other end of the line. A few hours later I received a text (there was no voicemail) from a number I did not recognize asking if I was still interested in a job and asking what region of the state I lived in. I repeatedly tried to determine who was offering the job, what the job was, what company it was for, and where we had met. They did not answer any of the questions in any way, except with a first name. I called from another phone, they did not answer, but minutes later texted me asking ""if your girlfriend called"". When I asked them to clarify the girlfriend comment they said they received a phone call from ""X"" area code. He said he gave his number to me and my girlfriend the other day at work. I asked what work that was since I use a separate phone for my job and did not receive a reply. Furthermore, I am not currently dating anyone, but did recently have a tinder date over to my place about a week before this incident. I sent a follow up text that essentially said that it's clear we'd never met, but he knows an uncomfortable amount about me, and that if he didn't provide the information I asked for: full name, contact info, the company he worked for, the job he was offering, and how we met (standard issue I would assume for a job offer) I would file a police report using previous harassing texts and his number and name as my primary suspect. He replied very soon after apologizing and professing it was a wrong number. That was around 10 at night. I woke up to see a text from him that had been sent at 2 am, cussing me out and getting defensive about having to provide basic info and saying I was harassing him by asking these questions. The message also included the phrase ""it wasn't hard to find out who I actually texted"" and he used my full name, first and last. I would assume he spent 4 hours fuming, and reverse looking up my phone number, possibly even paying for the service. The text then launched into name calling and insults - with the exact same tone and word choice of the previous texts. I don't believe the wrong number story at all. How do you have two unsuccessful phone calls, and an hour long argument over text without double checking the number you dialed? Especially when the person repeatedly mentions never having met you.

There are other suspicions and uncomfortable situations, (rumors the two people who got me were gang affiliated, a paranoia/feeling of being watched both by neighbors and in public), but these are the main incidents and only concrete evidence. My question is, how should this be handled? My friends and family have a few suggestions I view as either cowardly or excessive. From changing my phone number and moving again (cowardly), to filing a police report (which I have already done but do not expect to solve anything), to getting a concealed carry permit and firearm (which is expensive and beyond excessive in my eyes). If anyone has any ideas on other actions I can take please let me know. If possible, I'd like these suggestions to focus on determining what is really going on, identifying who might be involved, and finding ways to confront them that do not involve the authorities or violence (outside of a more evenly matched fist-fight). There is always the possibility these are old college roommates I didn't get along with or an ex trying to troll me and I do not want to overreact before I know the whole situation.",15Nov2018,1
143,"Hello everyone,

Recently my friends and I have been setting up a small team. We've primarily used reddit and other forms of social media to advertise and find new blood. These friends that I referred to werent initially friends.. we just became friends with time. 

So we've had a new recruit, Ben. He's been in our team for about a month now. He does not speak to us as a friend and avoids social interaction with us at all cost. One of the main recruiting criteria is that the applicant must be friendly and willing to work together as a team.   
As of late we haven't seen the improvement that we'd like to see. And whenever we try to help him, all advice is discarded. Sometimes he would choose to be rather sassy too when I(team leader) would tell him to do approach the problem differently.   
Personally I feel like he doesnt feel welcome, because it came to my attention that he would privately message other teammates to ask what they were talking about in the group chat. I personally think that he could very well just ask in the group chat which would get him more involved with the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

I also feel like he tends to ignore my advice because he doesn't respect me as a leader. This is because he would often prioritize advice from his friends(albeit Ben's friends and I sharing the same level of skill in the sport). I do not have this problem with the rest of my team though(6 others including myself).  


I do not wish to treat him as a liability and get rid of him.. ideally he'd accept my advice and he'd work to better himself, however should it come to him vs the rest of the team- i would choose the rest of the team. Can anyone please give me some advice on what I can do to resolve this issue with the least damage to all parties?",15Nov2018,1
144,"Do you ever think that you’re smart or you just think that you’re capable of accomplishing something meaningful academically? Like I know theres genuinely gifted people out there, gifted people who think they’re dumb but their test scores or academics don’t support that statement.

But I’m just one of those sorta above average people, probably not even above average just simply average. I’d like to think I’m capable of being academically successful but genuinely i will never achieve such thing. I won’t get into an ivy, I won’t be in the to 10 percentage of my class , I won’t be the legend of my days. (If that makes sense lmao) 

Throughout my years of schooling I’ve always had high expectations for myself, I wanted to be associated with the “gifted kids” but the only accomplishment I’ve received was just being with honors kids which was like gifted but literally without the perks of calling yourself “gifted”- at least thats what I got from it. Teachers never thought of me as the smartest person in the room even though I genuinely worked hard to be perceived that way. Luckily some student’s perceived me that way but those were the kids who didn’t put any effort into school at all, and I somewhat envy those students. They’ve been passed along yet never dealt with wanting to be validated from a societal prospect nor a personal prospect.  There was no stress placed upon them with the overwhelming pressure of succeeding and going to college and being the best out of all your class. 


But here I am, knowing that somehow I’ll never live up to the model student I’ve always wanted to be, knowing how much effort I’ve put in knowing how much time I dedicate myself, somehow i will always be stuck on the bottom half of the spectrum while everyone soars past me and makes something of themselves.

Knowing this promotes a nihilistic mindset on me, it’s like why even try to go to a good school- you’re not going to succeed there?? It’ll just be like k-12, wanting to feel smart but never being perceived that way. 

Why even try being successful? Especially in my dream career?? It’s a hard field to be accepted in and yet I want to pursue that?? 

Is it going to have a same result, am i constantly going to feel mediocre??

147,"No joke, the fifth time attempting to write this post. Interrupted everytime and at this point I'm sick of rewriting it and just. Never mind. Short vent. So, here's some simple background with me. I'm 23f,pisces, lives in Connecticut with my family. Mom is married with another woman. I have two half siblings and two step siblings. Total of 7 besides the pets we have. I work two jobs at the moment, trying to go back to school. I have the same best friends I've had since 2015. And a boyfriend I've dated for almost a year(never officially asked me out so we just picked a date). I should be happy but I'm miserable.
 
     I'll try to keep this as short as possible.
There was a guy I really fell in love with, for privacy reasons I'll call him S. I met him online through a popular game called League of legends.When I married my highschool sweetheart who was in the navy at the time ( yes I married young we were together for almost 5 year and my marriage had already been toxic and violent, so gaming was my escape)The moment I heard him speak, I was instantly drawn to him. His deep voice didnt match his face  and it took me a long time to match the voice and face together. We instantly connected. We'd play games with a group of people but little did I know I was falling for him little by little without realizing it. He could tell but I always denied it. Then we found out we lived close to each other. After a few group hangouts, we got to finally hang out alone. (Now that I think about it, back then I felt butterflies I didnt realize I had at the time. )I thought I had a type back then, Hispanic boys. He was no where near that. He was a white mutt, not even he knows exactly what he is. Shaggy brown hair, shit-brown eyes as he used to say (I love brown eyes) tall, white creamy complexion. And a adorable slightly crooked smile. Oh, and walked funny too. But they were all things I loved about him. But he did something for me I could never forget. Eventually he ended up homeless(long story) and I was powerless to help. ( I wasnt allowed to work while married to the man I was with) He would find any way to try and talk to me. And he asked me to spend a day with him and spent all of his money getting a hotel room just for the both of us for one night. That night was the best night I ever had alone with anyone. I have a lot of trouble with my emotions. (I was molested from 6 to 16 by 3 different people 2 men and 1 woman) and I process my emotions better with touch. And I was feeling all sorts of emotions without even touching him half the time. Which rarely happened. Fast forward we start to date for about 2 years but that's when everything went downhill. He was living with me and my family and my mom for some reason started to hate him more and more every day. He didnt meet my mother expectations. He could never have a normal job, didnt have money. All things I didnt care about,she did. And she started getting to me. My entire romantic  life I had made choices on who I wanted and when. When my mother pleaded to me in tears to leave this man I was so in love with. My heart started to break. I still do not fully understand why my mother couldn't truly give him a chance. But I was scared, maybe I was getting into a bad relationship. He wasnt that much older then me but had two kids and my mother felt I needed to live my life and be happy and not take any more of other peoples problems. For about a year I'd either hide to see him or push him away. Then one day my mother threatened me so bad, I wanted to hurt S so badly that he'd never want me again. It almost worked. We tried to make it work but he had really bad trust issues with me which were understandable but I'd get angry when I was saying the truth and eventually I gave up. I promised my mother by the end of the year I would cut all contact with him. The last few things he told me before we stopped talking  was, I need to leave my house (multiple people have said the same) and if I dont I'm going to break slowly from overworking ,my mothers demands and that I think I'm happy but that it's only convenient and that he knows deep down I still love him. And after almost a year and dating someone else. I cant deny what he said. I close my eyes sometimes and all I can imagine is him. It's become almost everynight now. Just a few days ago I admitted to my boyfriend that I still think about him and his kids and that I miss them so much. The last thing S told me repeats in my head and no matter how far away in my brain I shove it, it keeps coming right back. I cried so badly but my boyfriend just held me in his arms and told me I have the power to get rid of any voices I have in my head that's affecting me. I'm with my boyfriend to give what my mother said a chance. Give myself a chance. I do love my boyfriend but not in love. Like I still do with S. Every time I want to message him, my mothers voice comes back into my head ""You'll regret this"" and all those times I choose my own relationships that went down the drain, play in my head and I get scared again. I want to let him go but I cant. I feel so fucked up for even saying this but I even asked him to have sex with another woman just so that I could move on. I've said selfish and mean things and I still cant. I wasnt happy with my boyfriend but it's been getting better. Anyone have any advice on what I should do? I feel like people that know me give me the wrong answers off their own emotions. This post ended up being a lot longer so I do apologize, I just haven't been able to get this off my chest for a long time. So it feels nice to assume someone's listening to me. Theres much more to say but I'm sure someone will ask questions.",15Nov2018,1

Now being in college I still struggle with this and have only told one person. I keep this from everyone except all of you now, I used to just put on a fake smile for everyone.

152,"This is likely going to be a long post.

I've been battling depression for years.  I was severely bullied in middle and high school, struggled with hypothyroidism, and had some bad experiences with some ex-girlfriends (I'm a male for reference).  I was a very good student in high school &amp; made almost straight A's, got scholarships and such.  Started college in the summer, partied a lot and made B's on both of the classes, but no big deal.  When college started back up again in the fall, things were great for the most part.  My ex broke up with me, although it was somewhat mutual - we were toxic to each other.  I didn't notice at first but my depression was gradually getting worse.  I was going to class less often and my grades were starting to slip.  This led to my depression getting even worse because I felt like a failure for not even succeeding in my first semester of college.  I began self-medicating more heavily (I go to a party school so alcohol, weed, etc. are easy to come by).  I finally talked to my therapist about starting medication.  I was put on Wellbutrin 150 mg, about 3 weeks ago.  I know that you shouldn't drink while on antidepressants, but I wanted to go out with my friends this past Sunday night, considering that we didn't have classes on Monday.  Some things happened that aren't entirely relevant to my situation right now so I'll skip ahead.  I got very drunk and became suicidal.  I called my friend who lives in a different state, and he stayed on the phone with me for a while.  Another friend came to see me in person, but I guess I forgot to call the other friend back or something because the police knocked on my door a few minutes later.  They ordered me on the floor, put me in handcuffs, and sent me off to a mental health facility under the baker act.  I was then transferred to another facility.  I stayed there for 2 days.  It was the worst experience of my life.  My parents came to pick me up, we went and packed up all my stuff from my dorm, and drove me back home.  I now have to participate in an intensive outpatient program.  9 A.M. to noon, monday to friday, for 5 weeks, followed by 6 months of aftercare.  The problem is that before this incident, my mood was at a 9/10 to 10/10, with my bad days being a 7/10 at worst.  I don't feel that I need the therapy.  But now that I have no freedom and no options, I feel trapped and my mood is at an all time low.  I'm sober currently and will stay that way.  I was told today that because of the 6 month aftercare plan, I won't be able to return to college in the spring, which is what I was hoping for.  I would be okay with the 5 week treatment plan if that was the extent of it.  But this is too much.  My parents are asleep so I could run away, but I don't have much in my bank account and I believe my parents would call the police on me, so I likely wouldn't get far.  I know suicide would hurt my parents and people who care about me, but these coming months are going to be hell that I don't know if I want to endure.  I don't really have any significant goals I want to achieve in life; a wife and kids would be great but I can do without.  I'm just torn.  I don't want to hurt my parents but I can't do all of this.  They're very controlling; my mom put a tracking app on my phone before I went to college.  I couldn't exactly cut off contact because they supply the money and such, and I wouldn't have had time for a job in college because of my schedule.   I don't like being out of options, but right now I feel like I am.  I know that people are going to tell me not to off myself, and I respect that; but understand that that will not escape my mind as an option.  ",15Nov2018,1

160,"Ok. So basically I attended a University last year that i still owe $20k. (ik crazy) I left the school and took a gap year. Now I’m applying to schools again but my transcripts are being held because of the balance. 

There’s no way I can get that kind of money soon enough to get the transcripts for my applications (for Fall 2019). The university offered a payment plan, but made it clear that my transcripts are still on hold until the balance is paid in full. 

I’m okay with disregarding the year and starting over academically, however, universities require you to put ANY AND EVERY school you have attended with the respective transcript. 

I have also been told by counselors that universities have access to which colleges students have attended, but I’m pretty sure that’s only if they dig deeper into it. 

My question: Would it be better to...

A: Get a loan to pay off the school so I can have my transcript

B: Don’t mention that university on my applications because these schools most likely won’t check

C: Wait to go back to school until I have paid off the 20k

163,"So before I start I just want to say that I am relatively new to making posts so I apologize if this post isn't the best.

Well, I guess I should start with some background on this. I have been in my religion for most of my life, ever since I was a very young kid. And up until recently I haven't had wavering thoughts at all about my choice in life, that being a part of this religion was the right, and truly only, choice in life. I think that, personally and not to toot my own horn, that I have done in this religion. It has helped greatly in helping me be a more outgoing person then I once was and still allows me to have at least one really good friend in life even though I am in a homeschool now. But recently things have changed. I start thinking more and more about if what I am learning is true. I mean there are so many things that I want to do in life, but never can if I want to be a part of this religion. And so many other beliefs and ideas make so much sense. A major factor for me not having already made a choice is that a friend of mine in the congregation I belong to had a son who left the religion at the age I am now. And now seeing how they are today I can see how much their son hurt them by leaving and I don't want to do that to my mother, but I also don't want to put myself through something I won't be happy with. I am just so conflicted, on one hand I could leave and do so much more with my life but on the other hand I would hurt so many people I care about. Now normally I would go to the elders in my congregation and ask them for help on the situation, but I feel like that would almost make things worse, so I thought I would come here first before I ask for help by them. So, if you have any advice on what to do, who I should talk to, what you would/did do in a situation like this, please tell me. I need all the help I can get. Oh, and thanks for taking the time to read through that mess, like I said I know that this probably wasn't the easiest to read but I thought I would try anyway.  ",15Nov2018,1

Essentially we broke up 6 months ago. Together 4 years.

He said to me ‘we need to talk’ so I suggested that he picked me end so we could drive somewhere.

He picked me up and parked next to a park on my street. He said it isn’t working and can’t ‘do this anymore.’ He blamed me for his university work quality going down hill (he had only seen me twice in 2 weeks) so I don’t understand how they would have been my fault. He basically broke up with me because he felt like he was living ‘2 separate lives’ with me being one of them and his friends and family being the other. We sat in silence for a few minutes before I said I was leaving, I remember my parting words were ‘I don’t know how I’ll get through this, but I will,’ to which he didn’t respond and I walked home. He hasn’t contacted me since.

I tried so hard to get on with his family but they were always so rude to me or ignored me…and he was never able to relies that and just decided that it was my fault they acted that way. His friends I found were not the nicest of people (bitched about people loudly while the person is a few feet away etc) and his best mate from uni openly said to me ‘he wasn’t taking any friendship applications as I already have an army behind me,’ which I found quite repulsive. All in all they were not really my type of people, but I was still polite. He started to be with them all the time and never invited me or tell me what happened. But I still stuck around.

165,"I’ve been wanting to get a cat for years, and I want to set a goal of getting one before the year ends. To show where my struggles are, here are my barriers right now:
1) I live with my parents, full time college student, they are against it, not completely but would take some persuasion, I will approach them with a solid case that I will be the one taking care of it, I will not hold them to any obligation whatsoever, all expenses I will pay for, including food, litter, vaccines... I will present this in a professional way to them.
2) I want to have an indoor cat, one that will bond close to me when I am home. Does anyone know any breeds to look for that tend to lean towards this, I am planning on getting my cat through my local humane society (which is a fairly large no kill shelter). So I know that they probably won’t have a specific breed but to just have a list of good breeds to look out for can still help since I am inexperienced and don’t want to pick an outdoor cat for an indoor lifestyle.
3) we have a beagle, she’s older (about 14 years old) she doesn’t antagonize other dogs, but she’s never been around cats, so it would be difficult to tell, and I know that one should take their time when introducing the two and monitoring their every move initially to prevent any conflict.

There's a girl I work with who I've spoken to for like 10 minutes total in person. We've only really talked through text messages and Facebook messenger. (I don't work there very often)

The first messages we sent each other were after she had a rough day at work. She was feeling insecure and stumbling with her tables (New waitress) I gave her some advice and then we started talking a bunch over text messages.

Someone I work with (not knowing that I talk to her) tells me that this girl has slept with a bunch of our co-workers. I created a Reddit post asking if it was rude to mention this and the majority of people said it was. I understand that my concern about this is irrational, and just my own personal bias. I don't think there's anything wrong with this girl, or what she's done. It's just my own personal hangup.

I'm a guy who has social anxiety and has had very little sexual experience. I didn't chose to be bothered by it, and it's not like I can just flip a switch and stop it from bothering me. Because of this I decided to stop talking to her originally. A couple days ago I was feeling a bit lonely and decided to message her.

She tells me that she's not doing well again. She's smoking cigarettes, eating shitty food and is really depressed. Again I offer advice, and motivation that I use on myself. Since then she's stopped smoking, started a meditation practice, went shopping for healthy food and is trying to stay off social media.

Recently  she mentioned that she used certain vices to cope with her anxiety and depression; ""sex"" was a part of this list. This renewed my initial hangup which was kind of on the back burner. She keeps pressing me about why I don't want to hang out. So far I've just skirted around the issue and haven't answered her.

What do I do? I literally cannot get this concern out of the picture. It's automatic just like any negative thought. I've decided i'm not going to ask her; but I can't just ignore it. If I ghost her it's really going to hurt her feelings, which I don't want to do. I don't think just being friends with her is an option.

So I just got offered my first teaching job - starting in January next year. (Happy dance!)

&amp;#x200B;

Because the school system differed slightly from mainstream schools I had to come in for 3 days on a trial basis. On the first day I met the co-teacher ""Emily"" who assists the teacher in the class with admin, support and teaching. She seemed a little offish, but I was nervous and wasn't sure how many visitors had come to the class so I put it to the back of my mind.   


However, on the 3rd day I was offered the job and accepted. Emily had not been at school for day two and three as she was writing exams. I find out that she applied for the same job and didn't get the post because her qualification won't be complete this year (some mix up on the university's side I believe) and that she will continue to be my co-teacher next year. (There were discussions about moving her to another class and bringing a student teacher to my class but that's not happening) Qualification or not, apparently the school decided she wasn't the right fit at this point.   


Here comes the advice part. I'll be going into school over the last few weeks to familiarize myself with the school environment. So far ""Emily"" has been at exams when I'm visiting and sometimes she'll pop in when she drops her daughter off, but she completely ignores me.   
The school is ""holding a space for her"" which means that we are mindful and supportive of her while she is processing all this and I really like this system. I was in a school where I was promised a position and then they announced someone else got the job without telling me I hadn't. It was humiliating to say the least.   
My question is this: how do I build and establish a good relationship with her over these last few weeks leading into next year? I'm already nervous about my first class and I can't think of anything worse than someone resentfully watching me in my classroom and taking note of my mistakes (which I'm sure there will be some, as it's my first time in this grade and it's two grades in one which is new territory).  


Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I suffer from anxiety and I really want to find a way to make things amicable between us.

Now she is in a relationship and her communication has gone down hill drastically. It's a poly relationship with two guys, so we talk about that sometimes, but it seems these days if we're not discussing her relationship issues we're not talking at all.

I won’t be hungry all day and won’t eat until 5pm; but will snack at 2am).  Does anyone have any tips on getting started? I’m so down on myself lately.

186,"I’ve never really had like a good friend my age. All my past friends, let’s just say, weren’t the greatest. They have all ended up the same and I don’t know if it’s me. My previous friends weren’t there for me when I was sick, backstabbed me, or were shitty in general. Now, I’ve started to make new friends here and there but I feel like I’m the only one who puts in the effort . I’m the one who tries to make plans, I’m the one who texts, I’m the one who checks up on them. I feel selfish at times, like I’m expecting too much. I understand we are all busy, but I wish they would plan stuff too. I also feel overbearing, like I’m annoying them when I text. I just want a friend. I feel like my only real friends are my family, and even then I feel like I can’t talk to them at times. It’s also hard for me to make friends because I can be very socially awkward. I’ve always gotten taken advantage of in my precious friendships, I just don’t want to go through that again. So confusing.. I know.. but help",15Nov2018,1
187,"I was over at my friends house this past Saturday and we both took 75ug and hit a dab pen all night.

Flash forward to 5 hours later, his mom and her 2 friends came home while my friend and I were sitting outside. This is the first time I’m meeting his mom so I have to do introductions while also being high as fuck. I very weirdly introduced myself and made some jokes with them (they were a little drunk) and my friend and I went inside.

When we got inside and into his room I just end up going “yeah I’m gonna go” and my friend walks me out. So I have to tell them that I’m leaving which seems really sketchy since I’m leaving as they come home. I struggle to take my bike out but end up being able to ride home.

After the fact my friend tells me over Snapchat that his mom asked him “is he okay?” To which he responds yes. He also mentioned that she probably knew that I was high, but she probably didn’t give a fuck. I also asked him if she was cool with it and he said no but she probably wouldn't care too much. But I still feel like she does care and that she’ll look at me as a bad person that her son shouldn’t be around.

190,"Ok. I'm dropping out of university. I can't. I don't fit in. I was a music education major and planning to go back to Grad school for Film Composition. I don't know how to break this to my traditional ""necessitas estudiar, echale ganas!"" (You need to study, give it your all stay in school) parents. They're old. Traditional. Divorced. Poor side of things.

I guess a little of my situation is that I'm the youngest in my family 19 M. Almost a whole decade younger than my sisters. I was an accident. My oldest sister finished college and paying off her debt already but lives simple. (This was years ago) She needed a place to stay so she came back home, got a job, paid my mother rent for compensation in coming back. Now, out of nowhere, my mother is selling the house and moving to mexico. My sister has had to sign a lease at a cheap apartment to live at. My other sister has recently got married and has a literal two room house. My Dad lives with his Girlfriend.

Where do I go... ""We have moved on with ourselves and entering new stages of our lives ourselves."" I'll never forget my sister telling me that on the phone.. I always knew it but I never thought I'd feel that ditched

Guys, I've always been wise. I've grown up all alone. Never had support. Always watching everything. Never was understood as a child. Molested, sexually bullied. I have no trust in people. I know what alone is. I know what distrust is. I'm a wise man. I have a beautiful ex girlfriend who I keep falling for is my mistake. I went through my different stages of life all without friends and no one to relate to. I figured things out for myself and made it this far. I've been ""weird"", ""edgy"", ""ghetto"", ""white"", ""spoiled"", ""humble"", ""wise"", ""great"" ""potential""...

It wasn't until recently where out of nowhere my family apologizes to me for not being there before. I have forgiven them

But now. I'm alone in a worse situation. Trying to tell my Dad I'm gonna drop out even though he's paying the rest of my 1500 in tuition. Traditional dad telling me to keep trying in school. Talking to him is like talking to a child though. He's depressed because reality is finally hitting him after he's finally woken up from alcohol abuse. Barely growing up. He feels alone as well only cuz he put himself in that position I guess. I don't know how to tell him I'm dropping out. I don't know where to go. The pressure is real. I don't what to do to find a job in a place like Houston where everything is business.

191,"Just as the title says.

I (32F) have been with my husband (38M) since I was 18, and we are super close. We have a solid, happy relationship as far as I know. 

When we were first together he was paranoid about cheating due to his first few relationships going bad. I'm not like that at all, I'm very loyal and never given him reason to worry. So we've grown past that and although he can still be a little jealous/possessive sometimes nothing's ever really come up.

But today I came across an app on my phone that I'd been using for the past year to monitor my productivity - it's called quality time and it tells you how long you spend on each app. Handy, right? I found out today that the app actually keeps a record of each day, and you can look up any given day and see what time you were using your phone and what apps.

My husband starts his day around 5am and I don't get up until 7am, I'm a heavy sleeper.
The app told me that I'd been regularly using my phone at 4 and 5am daily (DEFINITELY not me), sometimes for 20-30 minutes at a time. Opening my messages, Facebook, insta, everything. Only ever on work days when he's up early. 

Now he can be very defensive and I'm really unsure of how to approach him about this. We're otherwise really happy, is this even a red flag? Should I be worried that he's been doing this daily without ny knowledge, for no reason? 

I know I'm not hiding anything, we have eachother's logins but he deletes his texts etc and always has. I don't go through his shit. 

I'm tempted to mess with him a little (like plant something to teach him a lesson), but is that a bad idea? How should I approach him otherwise, and what could I say?

Tldr: caught husband snooping through my phone daily. How to approach him?

Any advice appreciated!",15Nov2018,1
192,"About 3 years ago I met this girl (Let’s call her A) and I chased her for a long time. Thought I was in love with her. In the middle of chasing her, I met another girl (let’s call her C). She was my coworker and definitely the type of girl out of my league. I had no interest other than I found her extremely attractive. I eventually found myself giving her tutor lessons (we worked at the college we were attending). We connected real well. We got together one night and from there, it took off. Not officially together, but I was the only person she was giving her attention to. Then I really fucked up, and decided that the girl I truly wanted to be with was (A). I was extremely wrong but I didn’t realize that til much later. My coworker was pretty upset and pretty much ended any contact outside of working together, and even that was minimum. Fast forward 2 &amp; 1/2 years later, I’m in a very severe state of regret and depression. I broke up with the (A) and eventually got back to being friendly with (C) but never past friendly. I did confess everything to her and she listened and helped me thru the break up, but nothing came about us. I found an opportunity to move away so I took it thinking it would make moving on from her easier. (A) eventually found her way back to talking to me. She actually helped me move. She paid for the truck and helped me pack and everything. Because of all of this, I gave into her wish, which was to get back together. Months later, I’m starting to enjoy my life a little and (C) messages me to say hey and see how things were. She told me she never forgot about me and and she always wanted to say something but didn’t want to since Me and (A) were back together. (It should be noted that I don’t want to be with her but felt like I owed her and I do break up with her again eventually) Some time goes by before I asked why she messaged me now but never before. She said she finally worked up the courage to say hey. But she never went past saying hey and talking for a day. She admitted that that’s all she intended to do, knowing how I feel about her. I’m now all messed up over this because she was apparently thinking of me for some time. When I go to talk to her about it, (C) tells me that it’s basically impossible to have anything between us but she won’t just tell me no. She says a lot would have to change. I confess once again how I feel. I then ask what she wants in life. She cuts me off for work and I ask her to think about throughout the day. Next morning I wake up to a message of her and her best friends baby in bed together, showing me the baby. Leads to no conversation. Now she complains about guys messaging her for a day and then getting ghosted by them after a day. Exactly what she did to me. 


I really am in love with this girl. I’ve been in enough situations to know the difference. This is the real deal and I can’t seem to move on or get past it. I fully believe it’s contributing to me having physical issues.

I can’t get myself to do things, and I’m alway so tired and my head hurts constantly, but I have issues sleeping. I have suicidal ideation, and every day I just feel more and more worthless. I haven’t been able to talk to my family about it truthfully, but I don’t feel as though I can talk to any of my friends about it because I’m scared of being judged, or burdening them.

My dad complains that a psychiatrist is too expensive, and insurance wouldn’t cover it, so I’d feel guilty doing that, and everyone in my house just sweeps it under the rug and tells me that I’m over dramatic. I feel so alone and worthless right now, and I hate myself so much that I cannot put it into words.

My boss is cool, but can be really disorganized, and RANDOM jumping all over the place, and I struggle sometimes to figure out what to prioritize or what I can do without instruction, in addition to generally thinking about processes in a different way than he expects.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory:

&amp;#x200B;

On 10/11 I was emailed an official job offer. I also was able to put a hold on an apartment in California that day. 

&amp;#x200B;

On 10/12 the movers came to pack my apartment and send it to storage. It was too late to change it to the new address in CA. I wanted to be as prepared as I could for the real world so I stuffed every inch of my car. I still had to buy a lot of things when I got here.

&amp;#x200B;

On the 4th night of driving and 2600 miles later I made it to CA. I was exhausted from the all the driving, searching for other possible apartments, and finally signing the lease and setting up services.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I messed up:

&amp;#x200B;

My dad and I had loose plans to road trip back to Washington State. He was not very supportive of my decision to apply for a job in California and had nothing positive to say when things were getting more serious. Since he had such a poor attitude and everything unfolded so quickly, I decided it was best to not tell him. He found out from my mom (who I had been texting infrequently) that I had made it to California. He really didn’t want to hear my side of the story or be reasonable so I read his last message and never replied. 

   

He hasn’t asked me where I actually moved. Or what kind of job I have. Or what company it’s with. Or how I'm doing. If I’m making ends meet. If I needed any help or how I’m adjusting. I hoped he might on Veterans day. 

 

I messaged him, but I’m not sure if I will here back to me. I don’t really know what I’m trying to accomplish here. I guess the whole thing just kind of stinks. Thanks for reading.",15Nov2018,1

Its not like we haven't tried it, its just so disgusting to us. It doesn't help there is literally no added flavouring to it, its literally just fish baked in an oven.

My family is not in any financial issues, so we can afford to eat literally anything else, but my dad goes and buys fish because 'its something different', then goes on to buy so much that we end up with fish twice a week.

He knows we hate it. My brother screams and cries about it all the time, but today, I had enough, and voiced my complaints, saying how it is so disgusting and I was wasting my picking at it rather than studying. Of course it was the same general response 'its something different'.

Its ironic, because my dad also hates Mexican and spicy foods, and just flat out refuses to eat dinner when my mum makes it for us.

203,"I have multiple chemical sensitivities and severe olfactory (smell/taste) aversions. I just moved into a new house with three longtime friends (I have known each one for several years), who all know about my issues. 

One of my worst aversions is the smell of smoke. Cigarette smoke is the worst and weed is second worst. It makes me pbysically ill to the point where I have to leave the house.

I have no problem with weed in general. I believe everyone should get to decide what to do with/what to put in their own bodies. I believe weed should be fully legalized with measures to address racist prosecution of weed possession/growing/distribution. But I absolutely cannot have the smell of THC in the place where I live. It's worst when it's either being smoked or used to cook/bake edibles. 

I said this up front to all three roommates before we moved in, in writing and face to face out loud. Everyone agreed no smoking of any substances inside the house ever.

Last night though, while one roommate (let's say roommate A) and I were out of town for a single night, another of the roommates (roommate B) started smoking weed inside. Roommate C also has the same kinds of conditions I do and she smelled it but was too nervous to confront B. (B and A are friends. A and C are kind of friends. C and B barely know each other. I'm friends with each one of them.)

So tonight C told me she thought she smelled weed inside the house but wanted me to check first to see. When I opened the door the smell was so strong it was like hitting me in the face. I went upstairs and immediately knocked on B's door. B did not answer.

Me: B? Are you there?

B: Yeah

Me: Are you smoking pot inside?

B: (after delay) Yeah

Me: I know we explicitly talked about this and I told you it's a severe aversion for me and you said you would never do that.

(silence)

Me: B? Did you hear what I just said?

B: Yeah

Me: So why did you smoke pot inside?

B: (long pause) I had a rough day.

Me: Okay that's valid but it's not an excuse to put my health in danger.

B: You're right. (Long delay) I'm sorry.

Me: Are you planning to ever do this in the future?

B: (pause) no.

This went on a little longer very similarly. Someone else was also in B's room several hours after he had said a friend who was coming over was going to leave. This other person didn't say anything the whole time.

I had told B before that when a previous roommate smoked weed inside, I had to leave my own place for 48 hours or more. He had specifically said he would never want to put me in a situation like that. 

I left the house and called A to tell him what happened. About 30 minutes later, the mysterious unnamed friend left.

The unnamed friend had kept shoes on (a violation of a house rule we all agreed on), left the house leaving both doors completely unlocked, and parked their car so it was almost blocking our driveway which is normally quite visible from the street and not hard to notice. 

Meanwhile C texted me that the house smelled even more strongly of weed and also cigarette smoke. I debated whether or not to poke my head back inside but I ultimately did and it definitely smelled like weed and cigarettes. Meaning that B basically did it three times. Last night, tonight before I confronted him, and tonight right after I confronted him.

He didn't sound that sincere when apologizing or saying he wasn't going to do it again. He's planning a party tomorrow that he'd agreed before would be only wine and beer, no hard liquor, and only edibles but no smoking. But now I don't trust him at all. 

We also live in a neighborhood with really small lots so all the neighbors can easily watch what were doing. Our lease has a whole separate paragraph threatening immediate eviction on grounds involving any criminalized substance use, which includes weed in our state. B knows about this too.

All four of us are survivors of abuse, neglect, and exploitation. B specifically has been homeless before. So I'm very uncomfortable with the idea of just trying to kick him out. But it's also physically unsafe for me to live with him if he's going to do this again. I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to be the asshole. But I am literally on another friend's couch right now because I can't be inside the house where I'm paying (75% of) the rent, which seems rather fucked. ",15Nov2018,1

I am a current sophomore at my uni, about to finish the fall semester. My grades are bad. Like, 2.5 cumulative GPA bad. These past three semesters I've been consistently struggling with keeping decent grades and its really taking a toll on my self perception. I was always decent in high school, although I did get by on A LOT of help due to the fact that I was going through treatment for lymphoma in the 9th grade that I kind of milked through the rest of my hs years (pulling the cancer card as I say). Looking back on that time, I can't tell if all my HS honors and accomplishments would have even been met had I not gotten that assistance. When I started college I no longer had that excuse and dove nose first into everything: full course load, working 5 days a week, joining the DIV 1 fencing team. It was a lot and it exhausted me (still does). I had to stop working, I never spent time partying or hanging out with people so that wasn't an issue. Instead I would come home from practice, nap for hours, and scroll social media till I slept again. Any effort to study or look at books just lead to me being frustrated at my lack of focus. My grades slipped and It's especially frustrating because compared to my teammates, my classes aren't hard. I'm not a STEM major or anything, I hardly know what I want to do with my life or major in. I hate doing poorly in school because I don't want to be taken for an idiot. I don't think I am one, I just don't know how to manage my life at all. I beg professors for extensions and hardly meet them, Im actually avoiding looking at my email because I don't know want to see what they might have sent me. I skip classes because im scared to confront them and would rather be safe at home. Its crippling me.

211,"Backstory: My parents are highschool sweethearts. They are still together. Married 24 years; together for 33. Wow amazing right? And my parents do love each other. They have a solid relationship. They struggle to still parent their 23 year old bipolar daughter who doesn’t make it very easy for them. Married 24 years, I’m 23. My mom got pregnant with me on her honeymoon. That night. Boom. Family. And my parents were together a decent amount of time beforehand. Moms profession she went to school for 6 years for was now obsolete. She was currently teaching computer programs like excel to temp workers. My dad didn’t tell her that he wasn’t using protection that night. Technically he sexually assaulted my mom. Technically I am a rape baby. She was so mad at him at the time. Now I really have no desire to discuss this with either of my parents. But it’s changed my perspective on both of them. I’m having a hard time separating my feelings about it. My parents have built a cozy life, they are upper middle class. And I love my dad. My parents have supported me through a huge amount of anguish and pain. But it really bothers me that my mom (who I also love but have a very complicated relationship with) had zero say in family planning. But if that hadn’t happened I wouldn’t be here.

215,"I wasn't in school for the entirety of Secondary (11-16 years old). During that time I was always very lonely, constantly desired friends and fantasised about having a normal social life. I didn't speak to anyone my age during that time, only my family.

Now I'm in college, and I've been approached by multiple people trying to talk to me, boys hitting on me, people in general just wanting to chat. I struggled with the conversations at first and assumed it was nerves and the newness of it. I wasn't really interested in the topics they brought up (majorly reality TV, drama with their friends, their depression/anxiety/mental health issues, celebrities) but I pretended to be. I figured a lack of common ground was my issue, and joined a club for writing. That didn't work either.

I've realised I just don't want friends. I much, much prefer being alone or with my family. I have no desire anymore to make friends, I get bored very easily in conversation (it's not that they're not interesting, they are) and I'd much prefer to do things alone. I listen to groups of friends my age and I get confused on what they're getting from it. I still participate in conversation when I'm approached and I don't isolate myself. I also have zero desire to be in a relationship, but I think that's normal for a 16 year old.

He feels pain from small movements like wearing his clothes, simple turning his upper body around...etc. Every mornings are his worse times because its so painful to get up and also doing his normal daily routine. He first saw his local Dr. And the Dr. Prescribed him with steroids which helped relieve his pains.

He was advised to see other Doctors so he went to Auckland city hospital (in New Zealand) they did MRI scan, blood tests, muscle tests..etc they found nothing wrong with his results but he is still in pain, so they gave him steroids as well for pain relief.

He saw chiropractors and they provided some temporary relief from adjustments. Saw the Physio and the Physio think it could be his central nerve system because after checking him, he described his shoulders are frozen and suggested to go back to hospital and start the tests over again.

Some professionals said he has to stop working and take it easy. So right now he is willing to try anything, so far I know he hasn't tried weed so pls if anyone know anything that may help my uncle, pls comment.

218,"If you're not sure if it's running the correct direction, in the winter it should be running clockwise from an underside point of view.  This is only if the fan blades are slanting down from left to right.  I think this is the standards orientation for fan blades, because when I Google searched fans all of the ones shown where this orientation.  But if the blades slant from right to left, the fan should run counter CW.

For a ""standard"" fan running CW, the blade moves from left to right.  As it moves this direction, an area of low pressure is created underneath the blade, and the air in the center of the room is sucked upwards.  An area of high pressure is created above the blade, which pushes air upward toward the ceiling (this air is hot, because heat rises).  This air hits the ceiling and is directed away from the center of the room toward the walls, then downward after hitting the walls.

You may be thinking: wouldn't running the fan in the opposite direction (CCW) push the hot air at the ceiling down on me?  It would, but the wind chill effect comes into play because this air will be moving fast.  This is what cools you down in the hot summer months.

With the fan (again, with ""standard"" blade orientation) running CW, the hot air has slowed down a lot by the time it gets to you, so it doesn't create a wind chill effect as it circulates throughout the room.",15Nov2018,1

Our most recent argument has lasted over 24 hours over a slice of pizza. We ordered a pizza, he went to cut my slice, and then I said ""Actually, I'd rather cut my own, you might make a mess."" It was a messy pizza. He freaked out and slammed the pizza cutter down. I calmly decided to let his tantrum go and decide to dig into my slice. Apperantaly this triggered him, because he made a huge scene about how he was able to cut his own slice. He cut it, and said ""Look! SEE!!! I can cut m y own slice without making a mess!"" This man is 35 years old, and made a big deal to show off the fact that he could cut a slice of pizza.

That was honestly my last straw. He is constantly defensive and takes everything personal. After 12 hours of telling him I wanted an apology, I agreed to face time. He answered and tried to joke and said he didn't feel like talking about the issue. He wanted to ignore my severe requests for couples therapy, and rushed to his room and started to whisper because he was embearrseed his roommate could hear his issues. I hung up. I was pissed. He face timed me 12 times within 65 seconds. I was trying to text him and say I needed space. I didn't have time to because he was blowing up my phone. I picked up &amp;  I blocked him. He then emailed me and said he would like a link to the couples counseling. I told him he needed mental help and said not to contact me until he saw professional help.

234,"Hi all,

Hope everyone is well. 

Seeking advice in regards to my younger brother who is making mistake after mistake and is in a really bad place...

History: My brother is 19 and is a 2nd year plumbing apprentice. He has smoked weed since young and has bad memory, motivation, suffers from anxiety and I believe some sort of schizophrenia or paranoia. He has a friend who is a pathological liar and is also one of those guys who can't hold a job etc... He lives in an expensive city, and barely afford rent. 

So every now and then he asks for money for ""food"", I usually go on about wasting money blah blah and he gives up. (he currently owes money which I don't not chase) I basically try my hardest to not give home money in an attempt for him to grow up. Yesterday he calls and messages saying he needs rent money or he'll get booted, I question him(as usual) and he tells me that he had to spend money on his car for repairs and therefore unable to pay rent. After some time he gives up, although an hr later says he has no option. After some converstion I pay the rent direct to the landlord.

Moving forward to today, turns out he crashed onto the back of another car while texting. No insurance. Also turns out dad paid him money for the repairs to his car... So now no car. Owes over $700 to family from 2days, is at least 1 week behind in rent and now has to pay repairs to another vehicle whilst having no car.

I fear that he's going to loose his job very soon (already has had many chances). Can't afford rent. Can't afford to pay damage to his or the other vehicle, can't afford to pay family back...

Some additional history for those who have read this far, he has stolen about 5k cash (estimated as unsure exact value) about 16 months ago from mum. Got over 2k tax back this year, which he has already spent (apparently on escorts) before paying money owed to family or fines that he had.
He has visited counsellors in the past although from what I understand does say much or lies (even though he goes on his own). He has had periods where he has stopped smoking and is a lot better. But never lasts long. He is skinny as a rake and looks unhealthy and like a drug user.

Seeking some help as I work long hrs, long weeks and have a high stress job. I always worry about him and wish he had my motivation and drive. It really makes me mad and sad for him. It takes a toll on me stressing about him and thinking about what he may do.

Tldr;
Brother got bailed out for car repairs and rent in last 2days. Crashed his car with no insurance today. How can I open his eyes to the world?

P.s I could go on for days about lies and all the other bits and peices.",15Nov2018,1
235,"So yesterday I came home early from work because I finished all my work for the day. My wife was out with her friends so I had to make dinner for me and my 9 y/o daughter. I have a habit of taking a shower right after I get home so I placed my change of clothes on the bed in my room right outside the bathroom. When I came out, the room door was open and it was then I realized I forgot to lock the door. My pair of boxers was missing on the bed so I grabbed another pair in the closet and went out to see if my daughter took it.

I forgot to mention it but the bathroom and the toilet is separate in our house.

I went to the toilet as the door was open and saw my daughter trying to flush the toilet multiple times to no avail. Apparently someone in class told her the toilet can flush everything so she's trying to see if what her friend said was true. I don't blame her because I know she's still a kid and doesn't know what is right or wrong to do. However the only toilet in our household is completely clogged right now and I can't seem to get the pair of boxers back. Whenever I tried to flush the water just goes up, almost spilling, and then goes back down slowly. It doesn't seem to be able to flush faeces if you try but maybe urine can pass?

Is there any way to unclog the toilet, to either make the pair of boxers flush or take it out (might bit a bit dirty to do)? My wife is coming back tomorrow morning and she's not very happy that I can't do housework so if possible I would want to unclog it before she comes home.

236,"Let me start of by saying this; my situation has gotten a lot better, and I am in no way looking for pity, I’m just not sure how to go about my relationship with my family.
[TL;DR ON BOTTOM]
So, I’ve had an alcoholic, verbally abusive father since the day I was born, but it really only started showing after my parents divorce, when I was about 8. Keep in mind my dad has been diagnosed with autism and bipolarity which makes it really difficult to have a conversation with him. When I used to live with him every other week he would never have a normal conversation with me, he would just yell yell and yell, pointing out that my sister is better than me and that I was a disgrace who wasn’t gonna get anywhere. Since then I have moved out and live full time with my mom, but the scars are still there. Since then I have gotten a lot more introverted and have lost all my friends. My escape has always been video games, and I now love being alone, but my mom doesn’t understand. She’s very happy and sunshiny all the time, has it very easy in social situations and love going outside. She hates that I go home every lunch break to eat at home to avoid bullying, she hates that I sit in our garage playing video games with people I love on the internet all day. She forces me to not talk to my friends online, and when I do she makes it very clear she does not like it, I feel like I’m letting her down and being a disappointment to her the same way I was to my father but I have to talk to these people to stay happy. She’s dragged me to multiple therapists which I didn’t want to go to because it would just tear up my scars. I’ve tried to tell her that I’m getting bullied, that I can’t interact with people in school, that my dad has completely ruined my social skills. But she doesn’t understand, she basically just has an attitude like “just eat in school, you’ll make friends!!!” And “why don’t you like going to school, the kids can’t be that bad” but they are, she doesn’t understand what I’m going through and it really hurts me because I don’t have anyone to talk to, to trust etc. I’m scared to go and meet my dad because of the past, I’m scared to try and make friends in school because I’m afraid of being bullied more, and I’m scared to talk to my mom because she’s gonna overreact and drag me to therapists and try and find me a “healthier for the mind” hobby etc. even though video games and talking to friends online is what keeps me sane. 

So my question is, how can I try and talk to my mom in a way that she understands that the friends I have online is what keeps me happy, that I DO get bullied in school and that my dad has completely ruined any social skills I ever had, how do I explain my situation to her, I’ve tried everything.

[TL;DR]
my dad has been abusive and made me scared of people, I’ve made some great friends online that keep me at least a little happy but my mom forces me to not talk to them and make friends with people in school whom I get bullied by.


Any and all suggestions are appreciated, I’m just looking to make my situation better.",15Nov2018,1

239,"I used to work in an grocery store as a cashier. I was a damn good employee as well but when starting out I did apprently have a few mishaps with money. However I did improve afterwards. One day I arrived to work a smug late due to a back up of traffic and once I got there instead of going to a register after clocking in I was put to stocking away items. At first I thought I was being punished for being tardy. Into an hour of me being at work I get called up to the manager's office where my manipulative seemingly nice boss told me that I can no longer work the registers because and I quote ""something up there isn't working. It's not connecting. "" she offer to reassign me to a different area of the store and only gave me 15 minutes to decide or it would be termination. Apprently I was overly under the amount in my register to the point it's utterly ridiculous. To avoid specifics it was nearly $180 under. Due to my stupidity the only thing that could have affected the large missing sum of money is when I needed to have one of the customer service people come and give me more money for my register or when one of them strangely took over my register on my username and password during my break. Regardless it goes back to customer service which my boss (she's second in command) is largely in control over. I choice to quit because she was basically pushing me into reassigning into the worst part of the store and I was getting the blame for something I know wasn't my fault. Absolutely no way especially since I made it such a priority to make sure every customer got the amount they were supposed to get. She's also known for getting people fired for no actual reason except accusations. Many people have warn me about her to. One time I was reimbursed for some items I purchase for a big event and I had plenty left over supplies to which she said I could bring back in and i did. Weeks later she's having a bad day I could tell from the moment I saw her. After my shift she comes up to me and accuses me of stealing some of the items which I told her i did not and if she was so concern about it just take it out my paycheck. I have nothing to hide and no way did I ever ""used her"". I acted civil and apologized and offered to pay whatever amount she accused me of ""stealing"".

243,"I posted this in offmychest too. But now I don't even know how to get it out of him that he did kill the cat. I'm not a native speaker so I apologize for any mistakes. My father got really sick last year, and since then he and my mother have been living back together after almost a decade of not speaking after a complicated bitter separation which included my mother having a nervous breakdown. Im an only child and I was told things by both of them that no 12 yr old or early teen should hear that haunt me to this day. It just so happens that I got really sick at the end of last year too, my three year relationship with my ex ended last December and between my health and how emotionally drained I was, I moved back into my mothers home with her and my father for the first time since I was 15/16 (Im 22 now) and it's the first time we've all been living together since I was about 12 or 13.  Because of fairly major surgery I had earlier this year and ongoing complications with recovery afterward, Im still here now. 

Now my father has always been prone to fits of rage, and he always hated any animals my mother had because and I quote, ""she always gave a fuck about the animals more than me"". He'd always compare himself to a stray dog and says he's been treated with nothing but contempt and people have nothing but bad intent and want your money. He puts my mother in that category. 

He built my mothers home, what it's built on belonged to my mothers mother. There used to be a small house here which my father knocked when my mother and I went to visit my grandmother many years ago and he knocked it without getting any permission from my grandmother (it was all still in her name, wasn't in my mothers  name legally until her mother died) and built a much too big house thats now basically falling apart that he didn't have building permission from authorities in the first place. That also means they can't legally sell the house and are stuck here but that's another saga. 

Long story short, my mother and I went out for the first time in years together last night. We just went on a drive and talked. It was the first time he and the cat were left alone together since he and I went back living there. We went out from 5-8.30 and by the time we came back, the cat was nowhere to be seen. The cat was a house cat, it was terrified of everything and everyone. It had no skills to look after itself and was just a really gentle little cat. It rarely went outside in all of its 7 years and my mother instantly knew something was wrong when she went inside and it was gone. 

Weirdly, my father was already laying in bed with the lights off when we arrived home. The hours passed by and by midnight my mother knew she wasn't coming back. My father pretended to get up and 'look' for her, but kept making weird comments about how he didn't 'get rid' of the cat and how he'd get himself 'hung' because he's making himself sound suspicious. 

It's almost 12 midday here now, still no sign of the cat, and he's still not out of bed. We've looked all around the area and there's no sign of her. He had made comments about 'strangling' the cat because she had peed on the floor the other day. Idk. It's only a cat, but it's just unnerving how he's looking me in the eyes telling me he didn't do anything, and pretending to go look for her when he knows exactly what happened. Watching my mother cry about the cat saying ""Oh. Your mother will be upset. Your poor mother"". The weirdness of it all is what bothers me a lot more than the cat being gone itself. How do I talk to him about this? How do you get someone you care about to admit to this? ",15Nov2018,1
244,"First off, I wouldn't identify as gay, I'd always thought of myself as straight up until now. So out of nowhere I get feelings or something for this girl I work with. She just randomly walks up to me sometimes and says
 'I love you' 
but I don't really know what she means.

 We have quite a few things in common and get along, she often hugs me (and to my surprise as a rather not touchy-feely kind of person - I like it).

 I knew her for a year before I felt any attraction and then suddenly one weekend, a few touches and a busy  but fun day, and I was wondering if she maybe had a crush on me, as she walked up to me twice and said 'i love you', told me she missed me and hugged me, as well as a few ignored brushes of my thigh in passing. Over the next few weeks she asked me about 
'previous boyfriends... Or girkfriends. Wait are you straight?'
Me: I dunno.. I mean, yeah I think so but uh, it's 2018 so anything's possible. Why, are you gay?'
Her: *shrugs* it's 2018, anything's possible

She also invited me on many occasions to sit in the office with her (which for reference is literally like 2mx3m with a bench skirting round 2 of the four walls and a tech cabinet taking up a fair space in the corner), sometimes we sit touching but neither of us mention that we're touching.

The other day when I came into work she said 
'I opened the office door because I looked at the clock and knew you would be coming in soon'

I came in early before my shift many times, so I could stand in the manager office and talk with her, this time she was waiting to talk to me too.

So the advice I need is on what I should do next. Is there a chance she could like me back, even though her Facebook specifically says 'interested in men'? Could she be into girls without realising it yet (she had an emo streak at one point, always wear jeans and shirts on a night out and wears flannels).",15Nov2018,1

246,"I have a sleep disorder that makes it impossible for me to fall asleep and wake up in time for school. I always go to school exhausted without any motivation (or ability) to do anything besides sleep. I literally waste 7 hours in school when I could've done so much more at home if I didn't attend school and slept naturally.

This is a recurring problem I'm having and I don't know what to do about it. Can I somehow skip all my classes and just read the material at home? Why do I need a teacher if I'm self-sufficient?

I could easily learn as much as (or more than) necessary at home in order to ace all exams. But when I have to wake up every day and attend school, I just get tired and fall asleep on my desk and get nothing done. Worse is that I don't get anything done at home either after I've slept poorly, presuming I didn't take a one to two hour nap after school.

Is there anything I could reasonably do to skip all my classes with consent if this is affecting my grades and performance adversely?",15Nov2018,1
247,"Hello r/advice! I'm on mobile, so bear with me on the formatting.

I'm a university student. I recently turned 18, but I've been in uni for over a year now. I moved out at 17 and always had a lot of fights with my parents. My family isn't rich exactly, but we have just enough that money was an afterthought in most cases as I grew up. If I was denied something by my parents, it was never because we couldn't afford it, but rather out of principle and so I don't turn into a spoiled shit. Because my parents earn enough money, I'm not entitled to financial support by the state. While I was still in school, I worked during holidays and built up a financial buffer on my bank account. Since I started uni last year, I have been getting 500€ a month. Last year, that was completely fine. I still lived in an extremely shitty apartment, but that was only 165€ a month, an absolute one-time offer in my city. So I had plenty of money left to live off. The apartment was shit tho. My mom wanted me to find something else and move out after a month. I was content there for a couple months, but some things changed in my life and I ended up moving into my own apartment three months ago (I lived in a shared apartment before that). My parents told me from the very beginning they would be okay with giving me more money if I got a better place. So I got a really nice place that's even cheap compared to what my friends have and what you would usually get for that price. I now pay 330€+50€ monthly for rent+electricity. Of course, my parents were shocked that my rent had suddenly doubled, and they struggle to accept that that's the price of things in this city. But now, instead of a good 300€ I have left for groceries, I live on around 100€ a month. Money is extremely tight and of course, my buffer declines quickly and is gone now. When I moved, my dad paid for a large part of my furniture. It wasn't cheap and he gave me hell for it, but I was finally moved in and didnt worry about it for the moment. Before I moved, I told my parents I would be willing to get a job to help pay for my apartment because even tho that's the cost of things, I understand that supporting 4 kids is a financial strain even when you're earning good coin. Now I moved and struggles to find a job I could do with my irregular class hours, but i finally found a great job. But as it is, my contract only lasts for December. That's normal for a job of that kind, my boss explicitly told me it will be renewed when I perform well (and I'm certain that's doable). It even pays minimum wage. My dad had bugged me about it for a long time. To give me an ""incentive"" (as he likes to call it) to actually get a job (like I don't have enough to do in uni already), he said he'd be booking a wifi contract for me when I showed him a signed contract. I can't book wifi for myself, I simply can't pay for it. He even hinted he'd be willing to give me more money per month once I had a job (that may sound objectively  stupid at first, but hear me out. The banger's yet to come). I haven't had wifi in 3 months and frequently visit friends to have WiFi at their houses. They gladly hang out with me, but it sucks. 
Several weeks back, I was able to convince him to pay me 50€ more a month. But that I could only manage by bugging him for months and laying out all of my personal finances of the past year to him. Is that too much?
Now I finally show him a signed contract. Guess what, he's not booking me wifi. I've been asking him three times the last two days and he wouldn't really answer me, and today he finally answered and said ""he would prefer to let it rest for longer since I only have a contract for one month. Also he'd like his money for the furniture back"". 
I am completely gobsmacked. I've been talking my ass off, for months. I'm studying every day and this semester is thougher than i had anticipated, a lot tougher. I'm 4 weeks in and I'm already far behind on studying. I have a history of mental illness and winter depression is showing its head again, So I'm not exactly on top of my studying game either. Im broke as all hell, I was promised at least a little more money when I moved, I got fuck all. I was promised more money once I got a job, and now I'm supposed to *pay* ... I just don't know what to tell them anymore. 

I see how I may sound very angry and entitled. I swear Im not asking for luxury. I understand how that's all a lot of money, since they have to support my 3 sisters on top of that. But living is not cheap. This city is not cheap. I got a good deal on my apartment. I moved out of the old one that my mom hated so much. I got a job. All I'm asking for is being able to pay for daily life without having my card declined at the grocery store. My parents treat me like I'm 12 and like I have no clue what I'm doing and riding on rainbow ponies in uni all day. My class schedule isn't full per say, but I have to study and prepare sooo much shit. My parents went to uni as well, but that was over 20 years ago. Things are different now, but they act like they *know* and it fucks me up. I have a very hard time talking back to them, it's not exactly like my opinion matters on a lot of things either. I'm stressed to the max managing my studies and my mental health right now, and I'm about to flip trying to talk some sense into my parents. I'm pretty sure if I start my job next month I'll fucking break because it'll just be too much. I had to fight with my parents over and over over just getting a bed for my new apartment. My dad considered it a luxury. I ended up getting an extremely cheap one on eBay and asking a family friend to pick it up with me, my parents got around to it and we're angry at me for asking him for that favor. When I asked them if I could at least have the minimum financial support (fixed by law) which, at the time, was 20€ more than I was getting, my mom was personally offended and ended the conversation right then and there. There's a guideline for financial support that entitles me to a lot more than that, but that's a guideline and barely something you can take someone to court over. I'm not trying to take my parents to court either, the relationship is fucked enough already as it is. 

What could I do? Am I asking for too much, am I acting like an entitled bitch?

248,"I have two very close childhood friends (24 and 26, known them for over 15 years). They are both ""NEETs""(Not in Education, Employment, or Training), live at home and it's been this way for 6 plus years now.

I get none of those things are THAT bad but new people have been coming into my life that have the same values as me, motivation for learning, new hobbies etc. Basically healthy two way relationships. 

I just don't know what to tell these two. I've tried helping them apply for jobs, signed them up for Uber/Lyft (they only work enough to buy Pot and food now), try new hobbies, working out and nothing seems to get to them.

249," I'm 25 to his 30. We've been sleeping together for almost a year. He has four kids, works a lot, and despite being a good person, is really attracted to drama and overall bullshit that I feel could otherwise be avoided.   


I don't have any kids. I earned my bachelor's about two years ago and currently have both a full time job and recently got a 2nd job. I own my car outright, live with my parents, so I don't have any real responsibilities right now.   


My issue was being taken advantage of, having already known this guy before, it was easier to have exclusive sex with him, keeping advantage takers away and allowing me the freedom to still continue on with working and building my career path.   


I feel guilty though because the dude has told me he loves me in the past, after we had sex, but recently with me telling him the truth, that we would never have an actual building something relationship, he has kinda changed up what he told me before, claiming I took what he said out of context. He has also been telling me stories of other girls wanting him and him telling them no because he's sleeping with me.   


This plan was originally supposed to be mutually beneficial. I wasn't being taken advantage of, and he was getting laid regularly with a clean girl. I'm worried he might actually be in love with me and while I care about him, I never want to be in a relationship with him.

I guess I don't feel it for two reasons, one I've never been in a relationship or in love, so I don't know what that feels like and two, we don't do things that people in relationships do. We don't talk everyday, go out to eat, or actually do anything besides chill at the house. I don't put any effort into this, don't wear my sexy clothes when I go to his place (I wear decent underwear and a bra), when we first started hanging out it was the same way, only difference is we talked everyday and hung out for a month straight. I don't know what is going on in his head lately, just because I've told him no several times when he told me he loved me.

256,"I stopped talking with a friend who was a girl for two weeks because she needed space, we've been on again off again friends since March and before that we were super close. After those two weeks we went on tour with our college band and ended up clearing the air on why I blocked her on Snapchat, my main form of communication (it was because I'm trying to better myself so I can be a better friend if there's ever a next time and just be a better person in general and if I'm constantly able to bug the person I hurt on there things will only get worse, she understood that reasoning and was thankful that I told her). We texted each other every day that week and always hung out thanks to mutual friends. 

On the last night of tour before the ride home we had a fight that started out small but took a turn real quick. I'll admit I was at fault for starting it but she escalated to a level that it didn't need to go to, her boyfriend even agrees with me on that. We sorta made up that night I couldn't really tell with the vibe and you never know with her. On the way back I tried to reach out 4 times and she'd leave me on read so after that I decided to go on no contact with her. This was 4 days ago.

Yesterday a package arrived at my door. It was this book I ordered for her. She saw it on tour and was genuinely upset she couldn't get it cause money's tight for her and she had to save it. I bought it because I wanted to thank her for the good time during tour, this was obviously before the fight. I gave it to her during a rehearsal and last night one of my friends sent me a tweet she sent that says ""so you cut me off as a friend.... and then buy me a gift you know I wanted? Cuz that makes sense 🙄"" Her roommate replied with a petty thing directed at me saying that I was told not to do that since it'd cause rage and unpleasant emotion which is absolutely not true, nobody told me that.

My plan is to continue no contact for a while but we do have our occasional run ins due to being in the same friend group and on Friday all of us are driving in one car for 1.5 hours to go see Fantastic Beasts (she originally wasn't coming but her boyfriend bought her a ticket 2 days ago, when I bought mine I specifically chose to separate him and I by one seat because I had a hunch he would buy her a ticket). Before I gave her the space for 2 weeks she flat out told me that she didn't want me in her life anymore and openly stated that we weren't friends. So apparently we're not friends but then when I decide to block her to focus on myself which she knows about cause I told her and everyone else she talks about how we were friends but I ended things?

I know this situation sounds confusing, hell I'm confused on it myself. We've never sat down and talked about things regarding our problems because every time I would try she would refuse.

Started working out when I was 16 due to wanting to improve my health.

I gain muscle pretty easily but the problem is with cardio and reps with weight, I’ll elaborate:

Let’s start of with my favourite:

Bodybuilding:

Muscle is easy to build for me, but strength and endurance and improving those aspects takes soooooooo long for me, and that’s because I just can’t push through the burning sensation and fatigue my muscular system feels during exertion.

Cardio:

I’m I think a big fan of cardio, but I love the sound of my body being able to do more and not feel as exhausted.

I’ve made some gains on this area but again, my problem is with pushing past the burn.

I just don’t have the mental strength to do so.

I’d love it if you guys could give me some advice on pushing through the burn.

It’s been 6 years since I’ve been exercising regularly and I’ve never been able to overcome this.

And i want to improve and get past this.

We were even more decided to move after such pressure so we decided to have the talk with my family. As always, mom panicked at the beginning but ended up proposing HERSELF we buy a house instead. (We wanted to do so ourselves, hubs and I, but don’t have the down payment) Her arguments were: you’re gonna pay a little more than the rent but at least the place will be yours, we can make a profit if we sell it in a few years, etc. 

Yesterday my dad calls me telling me that he wants us to do a urine test to make sure we weren’t lying and that we weren’t smoking anymore (which we were). My husband and I had a disagreement because I wanted to continue to lie (knowing my parents they will never accept us smoking) and he wanted to tell the whole truth. In the end, I called my mom and told her the truth, that we were still smoking.

The drama had been big and in the end my mom tells me “If only I knew that I was getting in the shit for this house for nothing, hoping you’d stop”. I do want to mention that it was gonna be my husband and I who do the mortgage payments and we were gonna give back the down payment in a few months. I also want to mention that we wanted to rent a place and calmly wait until we can buy by ourselves next year, but my mom said “why waste money on rent, let us help you now”. 

I’m way too emotional and may have omitted details, please feel free to ask. How do I explain to my parents that weed doesn’t change who I am and what my values are. We are still hard working and honest and responsible people, but that like to light up a joint at the end of the day. My parents view weed very bad and do not want to accept us smoking. 

TL;DR  My parents found out that husband and I smoke weed and are trying to control us through various manipulations for us to stop smoking. ",15Nov2018,1
270,"I’m a freshman in college. I get along well with my roommate, we’re both very quiet people and don’t really talk much. However, we have this mutual friend that we met at orientation who is just overbearing. 

She knocks on our door early in the morning before my roommate and I are up, so that they can go get breakfast together (I don’t get breakfast in the dining hall). 

She’s always in our room talking and giggling while we’re trying to study. 

She climbs all over our beds, and most recently, she’s been taking the railing off my roommate’s bed and jumping off of it (we have tall beds, taller than most bunk beds). 

She doesn’t seem to have an inside voice, so I’m sure our neighbors and the people above and below us can hear her jumping around and giggling. 

If either my roommate or I go out with family or friends, she’ll ask to come along (her family is closer, they visit about once a week while mine visit probably once a month, and my roommate’s visit not even that. 

She snoops through my stuff, and has apparently told our CA that I have a bottle of alcohol in my drawer (I do, it’s empty though and wrapped in multiple garbage bags, it isn’t something she’d have seen when I opened my drawers). I have other things I DO NOT want her to see. I don’t know if she’s seen them or not. 

She gets upset when people don’t give her stuff / she doesn’t get her way. There’s always people handing out free stuff around campus, she’ll go to those tables and grab a few of everything that she likes. One of our advisors told her she couldn’t have 2 cookies once and now she hates him for yelling at her (he didn’t yell). If my roommate or I (or even one of our friends) has something that she doesn’t have that she wants, she’ll ask for it, and gets sad if we don’t give it to her. 

Two days ago, my roommate and I were studying. She was on my roommate’s bed, horsing around and being loud, and I asked her to stop. She threw a fit and basically started crying because “we didn’t like her” and starting saying she would just leave and not hang out with us if we didn’t want her around and she would talk less. I then was trying to explain that I’m an introvert and need alone time (I’ve been exhausted lately. I get so tired of being around people that I just go hang out in my car for hours at a time) and she said she’s an introvert too and basically threw another fit because I called her an extrovert. 

She always talks about how her mental health sucks, but doesn’t seem to understand that other people’s does too. And she always wants to seem special. For instance, if I’m talking about music to a friend (like a new song that we both like), she’ll butt in and talk about her music which often has nothing to do with our conversation. Those are just little things that are pet peeves of mine I guess.

How do I tell her to give me space and privacy without making her throw another fit?",15Nov2018,1

I was getting played throughout my very first relationship, that lasted two years. I found out yesterday, finally, that this has been going on the entire relationship. not just one girl, but just.....hoes. and so many. 

it’s so hard to think about all the times i was so happy, in love, and a great girlfriend, when he was always living a lie. it all makes sense now. every doubt, every red flag. i should have seen it. he has played so many mind games on me these two years, i feel i no longer have a perception of reality. i used to think of myself as sexy, confident, intelligent, etc. and these years of mental, physical, and emotional abuse that i couldn’t see through have taken a toll on my self worth.

I work at a fantastic computer company in the city; not any special role as I’m not qualified yet, but when I am qualified on the IT course I’m doing with Open University I want to become a software engineer or something of the like. Lately I’ve kind of been in a slump. My girlfriend works from 5am-3pm; with me leaving at 5, I just don’t get a lot of time to spend with her. I also feel like, by working until 1am, I’m missing out on a lot of socialising I’m supposed to be doing in my twenties. So this is where I’m kinda just... stuck. I’ve tried changing my shifts at work but because our company’s based off another country’s time zones they’re all gonna be late ones. I’m really grateful to be a part of this company where everyone’s fantastic and the work isn’t difficult, but I’m weighing this up against the fact that I don’t have much of a social life and can’t do things with friends anymore because I’m working these hours. The only days I have free are Saturday and Sunday — Saturday’s for my girlfriend and Sunday’s ideally for my family, but they have their own bunch of problems that are stressing me out — I’ve resigned to the fact that they’re my parents and I’m not theirs and I can’t help them if they won’t let me.

275,"Soooooo, long story short I started smoking weed about 2 years ago, and my dad found out about a year ago. When he found out I was 17 and he forced me to move in with him. Seems important to mention he’s always been a bit paranoid with drugs, grew up in a different time with a lot of misinformation about drugs mostly here in Mexico. 
Ever since I moved in with him it’s been nonstop arguing and yesterday it escalated into a full on fist fight, during this he kept blaming a bunch of stuff on weed, and said I think your addiction is to dangerous i think I’ll have to take more extreme actions, by which he meant sending me away to rehab.

282,"Not sure if I put the right sub. Let me know if not?

I have a coworker who taps, drums, and kicks her desk constantly. I have an office across from hers. I can still hear it with my door closed. It’s driving me insane. INSANE. I don’t think she realizes she’s doing it. Since I noticed it, I can’t ignore it. It’s like nails on a chalkboard at this point. I have to work with my door closed every day just to try to tune it out. My other coworker has noticed, too. She puts music on and shits her door to drown it out. I hear tapping even when she’s not tapping now. I feel like I’m going to lose my mind!

She’s also got a terrible attitude. She’s super negative and always complaining about something or someone. I’m fairly new to my company, too. I don’t want to make enemies. She’s been here something like 15 years. She’s negative in our group meetings, but not quite as bad as when the bosses aren’t around. I don’t know if anyone has spoken to her about the tapping or the attitude, but I’m over it. Her negativity really drains me. I feel like I can’t approach her either. I try to be as nice as possible and “kill her with kindness,” but good gosh. Enough is enough!

I want to mention it to her some how, but I’m not sure how to approach it. Maybe I should tell my bosses (the owners) or HR or just her directly? I don’t want to come off as trying to start crap.

283,"Hi guys! I'm pretty nervous about posting this but recently I've been self-reflecting a lot.( Also, I HOPE I DON'T TYPE THIS OUT TOO MESSILY.)I concluded that in my life I only have 3 close ties (not including my parents, who i'm not close to but still love dearly) which are my 2 close female friends and my boyfriend. For me close friends are people I can confide to without any fear of judgement and people I know who are there for me (vice versa).

This all stemmed when one of my female friends (Let's call her Mary, close friends for 2 years), was talking to me about how many close friends she has as she has 'invested' her time and energy to them and they connected. Then I told her that besides the other two, she's all I have and the convo quickly turned to her being 'concerned(?)' for me saying that I need more people in my life, what am I going to do if anything happened to one of them. This made me think alot. Why do I not have many close friends? I do try to invest more in them (according to my friend's analogy) but I never get many opportunities to. My other group of friends are my college friends who I'm not close to anymore but I'm sure when we'll meet it'll be fine, my current university friends who honestly just seem like we're friends just because we attend the same school and sit together. I tried making more friends in my other groups (i.e: student council)  but it just seems like they're on a different planet, no ways mean or anything but I just can't bond with them.

I know that maybe I should try finding others but it's hard meeting new people.. I tried joining classes outside but to no avail.. I know I shouldn't force it but I have this aching feeling that I'm so lonely because I have nothing to offer others? Or maybe I'm just a boring person ahhaha.

I talked to my bf about this but he's the same. He only have 2 close friends but for him, he doesn't really care? He doesn't feel the lonliness. I talked to my other close female friend( Let's call her Jane, close friends for 5 years) and she took a really logical approach and told me that it's better to have a small group of friends rather than a large group, which I agree but my close friends dislike each other, so is it even a group?? 

I hope I'm not being petty or anything I'm just very troubled over this..

Any advice for me? I've been crying and losing sleep over this. 

Tldr: I'm losing sleep and crying a lot because I feel that I cannot bond with people and I feel very lonely because of that. ( also, i hope i added the right flair!!)

My sister and her fiance wanted the master bedroom and because of that we got the basement. It's pretty much a one bedroom apartment. It has a kitchen, bedroom, huge living room, bathroom and an office type room. All the kids bedrooms are upstairs except the baby stays with us. 

Now my issue is that my boyfriend has A LOT OF SHIT, AND ITS EVERYWHERE. We have been here for over a year and it he still keeps his sons shit in boxes in the office. It's scattered all over and there is like random paperwork and random shit all over the place. We have a shelf type thing that runs along the whole basement walls, and has a whole bunch of random shit on it. He has part of the counter and cabinets that sits next to the kitchen just full of shit on top, underneath. None of it is garbage it's like hats, hoodies, paperwork, random toys, bags, laptops, like just random shit. IRS DRIVING ME INSANE. like we have a huge amount of space being wasted because he will not organise his shit. 

I have asked him calmly for over a year to clean it up, and nothing got done until I lost my fucking mind about it like a month ago.

292,"Hi. Burner account. I posted here rather than r/Divorce or r/Relationships because I thought I might get a wider range of opinions, here. 

We (37F + 35M) have been married for 7, together for 10+ and have two small kids under 5.  In short, we are not the most compatible people. I think we have largely subsisted on mutual attraction and having fun together, but we would fight almost daily. Not knock-down, drag-out stuff, but he has a bad temper and I can be a condescending B. There has been a lot of verbal abuse. And, a lot of ""surface issues,"" as my therapist puts it: Extended family shit, sexless marriage. The underlying causes of our rifts are lack of trust and insecurity (on his part) and my enabling all of that for far too long.

There was a dramatic event in May that triggered the separation. He accused me of infidelity and ran with it. He raged with the fire of a thousand suns. He shattered my brand-new iPhone. He called my parents to ""come and get me,"" dramatically packing my bags and calling me really vulgar names, and based on what they saw, they supported my exit. Within days he realized his mistake, but I found a window of opportunity from escape from the abuse and I (eagerly) took it. I did agree to some couples therapy (by a woman who is treating both of us separately) but I wasn't interested in rekindling anything and I was too angry to try. 

We've been separated for 6 months now, custody is split 50/50, and we're working with a mediator. His comment to us was ""I don't know if you two are ready to separate, but my goal is to have you be friends by the time we sign this agreement."" It gave me pause. 

In a recent (solo) therapy session, I expressed a desire to ""maybe reconcile"" - she said that I would have to commit to it entirely, or not at all. She said that we would need intensive couples counselling, as we both ""mirror our past hurts onto each other"" and have similarly ""strong, stubborn"" personality types. We communicate pretty poorly and we can't reconcile until we learn how to do this on a level that most people seem to be at already. She also said that we wouldn't move back in together, we would have to ""date"" each other, and also that she wouldn't approve us getting back together unless a professional, like herself, deems it safe for me to re-enter a relationship that was, historically, domestically violent (verbal only).

She treats both of us, and has said that we are both doing better apart than we were together. But, she also thinks that with work, we can reconcile. She has ""seen worse,"" as she put.

The truth is, I miss him. And I can't discern whether this is loneliness, or a true desire to try and make things work with him. I really miss our family dynamic. Maybe it's the upcoming Christmas season that is making me feel nostalgic. Maybe the distance has me seeing things through rose-coloured glasses. But he loves our kids and was/is a very ""present"" father. As my dad put it, ""terrible husband, great dad."" The kids are okay, and I know that they will be okay because they're resilient and surrounded by lots of loving family members. We have provided a good and safe life for them.

But this is about me, and him.

Has anyone else succesfuly reconciled after a period of brief separation? Has anyone had these doubts, and then gone on to (happily) divorce their spouse, and move on? How do I jump headfirst into reconciliation when there are so many risks involved? ",15Nov2018,1
293,"I’ll apologise in advance if this is a wall of text. TLDR at the bottom. 

I’ve been keeping secrets from my family for months now. My parents are a little distant, despite me still living with them. I’m 24 and desperately saving to move out so I can have my own space. 

Around 5 months ago now, I realised I’m bisexual after meeting a young lady who has completely turned my world upside down. This crush gave me so much anxiety I had to start taking medication for it. I’ve had anxiety for years anyway and there were other precipitating factors, but this tipped me over the edge. 

I can’t come out to my family because they’re not supportive of the LGBT+ community and have some extreme views, so I’m waiting until I’ve moved out to say anything. 

Just to make things more complicated, she’s my physiotherapist. Now, I’m aware that while I’m her patient, I can’t do or say a damn thing and I don’t intend to, because it could ruin her career and mine and that’s not fair to either of us. 
I know she’s also into women because a friend of a friend knows her, so that’s something. 

I’ve been seeing a therapist for the last 6-7 months because I was depressed and suicidal and my anxiety was spiralling out or control. I didn’t tell my parents because last year, I told my mum I wanted to kill myself and the only thing she said was “well, you need to speak to someone about that”.... I had never felt less loved than in that moment. 

This part might seem pathetic or irrelevant, but I’m including it anyway.  I’ve been learning to drive over the last 4 years. It’s taken so long because I couldn’t learn in a manual and became disabled with a degenerative condition, so I’m learning in a car with hand controls instead. It’s much easier and it’s the only way I can learn. My test is coming up soon, but I haven’t told anyone because I don’t want to jinx it and the pressure is getting to me. 

I don’t know. I guess I feel a little lost. I still see a therapist and it really helps. I’ve made a lot of progress and I’m doing well, but all this stress lately is making my anxiety worse, I’m exhausted which makes everything worse too and I feel like my parents know I’m keeping something from them, but they won’t say anything and I sure as hell won’t. 

If you’ve read all this, thanks. I don’t know what sharing on reddit will achieve, but maybe I’ll get some perspective. I’m just tired of fighting all the time. 

TL;DR - the stresses of life and keeping secrets about my sexuality are making my anxiety worse and I don’t know what to do or who to turn to.

I dont get to spend time with my friends at all because he relies on me to fix him dinner or fix his lunch because he works 16 hour days. Everywhere we go is his idea and every argument always goes his way. He says we are compromising but we aren't. He always comes out on top..

I haven’t told anyone I’m interviewing for it because I don’t want people to know if I don’t get the job and don’t want to go round telling everybody I’m interviewing for this amazing job, in case I don’t get it.

I went to her wedding and she’s told me she sees me as a mentor. I’ve put her forward for awards that she has ended up winning and always talked her up and given her great references. 

Anyway she told me at lunch that she has been asked to interview for THE SAME job. I just smiled and said wow. I couldn’t bring myself to tell her I was in the running too. 

Now I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to tell her that I’m going for it too because 1) because I’m more senior than her, I don’t want to put her off and make her think she doesn’t stand a chance and 2) if she does get it the job, I don’t want anyone to know that I was beaten to the job by someone more junior and less experienced than me. 

But then what do I do if I do get the job? She’ll know that I knew all along and didn’t tell her... but then I don’t want to put her off... and I don’t want to have to face the shame of having to admit I didn’t get the job.

This is really confusing, I know I need to provide every little detail here. I can't wrap my head around it as to what really happened. I'm also using fake names.

I (22F) used to work with Nathan (23M) in a Telesales company in the city. Let's call that company Alias. We both started together in mid August, along 2 other men, one called Andrew (27M) and another one called John (40M). Andrew is a little significant in that story but not entirely. 

We had a week training where we spent a lot of time in one room with a trainer. On my first day, I was befriending Andrew, we are both from the same cultural background, he seemed pretty chill. For the rest of the week me, Andrew and Nathan used to always have lunch at the same time together and we'd smoke cigarettes on our lunch break too. 

On Day 4 of training, Andrew began hitting on me. I don't want to elaborate so much on that, but he did violate my space and although I wasn't very straightforward with how uncomfortable I was, I started making him feel awkward for it but in the nicest way, I mentioned having a boyfriend randomly, not taking his compliments properly, talking in a flat tone to him. After that, Andrew began distancing himself from me pretty quickly. I noticed Andrew always used to take Nathan with him, as if they planned on making sure I was alone during lunch. I confronted them a couple times but they spoke to me like I was nuts. I didn't take it too serious because that's a little silly. I remember after that ditching, Nathan always used to come to me asking me if I wanna smoke, I could tell he felt bad and also awkward. I questioned him about it and he wouldn't say anything. 

Nathan didn't pass his 1 month probation, he had to leave 2.5 weeks into the job. Andrew left for a better paying job a week after, while he was there he acting normal to me, I'd always ask him for help and he was friendly but still a bit distant. John left too.  

I exchanged numbers with Nathan before he left and he told me he had already found another job. He told me the job in MegaTrix is so much better than Alias, that the basic salary is £20,000 and for each sale he makes £20. He said he could get me a job there since they're still recruiting. I did thank him for the offer but I don't want to be too much of a job hopper. Alias basic salary is quiet low but the commission potential is high. It's how it normally works in sales, you either get high salary and low commission or vice versa. I thought Nathan may have been BSing because he may have been embarrassed to say he was dismissed in Alias.

Two weeks into MegaTrix, on September 23rd, Nathan sent me a picture of his payslip, saying he was paid £1,800 last Friday. I thought he was saying to me he got paid in advance, but later on he told me he got paid this for two weeks of working in MT. Saying that the sales are pretty easy to make, because the software is what many businesses need. 

I said my friend Maria is interested. I sent him her number. He explained the job thoroughly to her, got her CV and email address. She didn't really hear anything. 

About 2weeks later, on October 9th  I began being very sick of Alias, I asked Nathan more about his job at MegaTrix. That's when he broke it down very well and he showed me his latest payslip.  It was a picture of £4k before tax and student loan, he said that was his pay for this month. I will insert the picture here [https://imgur.com/a/869NgJC](https://imgur.com/a/869NgJC). He tells me they're currently situated in Bond Street, they will move to Liverpool Street the following week staying for 6 months before they move to Victoria. He also sent me the address for the one in Liverpool St since I was likely going to start there.

However I didn't realise very little time went by since his last pay check, because working a 9-5 I'm not used to it, so my concept of time is fussed. Very weird to realise that now. He got paid on the 22nd September and on the 9th October he shows me another payslip? He got paid 5K in 2 weeks?

On that day we spoke quiet a lot about Alias and how much they hid during the interview stages. Nathan tells me he met up with Andrew  today. Nathan revealed quiet a lot about Andrew with me, I will make a separate post to break down the Andrew situation, because I'm not sure how much of it is related to this situation. I may just end up editing this post and add screenshots of Andrew's messages. To make it short, Andrew lusted after me yet resented me so much, he did tell Nathan to stay away from me, that girls from my cultural background aren't like that. And by that he means that girls from my ethnic background don't drink and smoke. He only started distancing himself from me after I said I have a boyfriend twice. Andrew has a hair loss and thinning problem because of his constant use of drugs so it's all ironic. Andrew wanted Nathan to bully me into giving Andrew oral sex, Nathan never said any of that to me up until a month after both of them left. I didn't know about this oral sex part was going on even when they were still working with me, as Andrew was acting normal around me. Apparently even the entire month since he left he still mentions me constantly. Nathan tells me he never wanted to ditch me but he is just simply a passive guy. That's not how he said it but that's what he was trying to get at. He even showed me a screenshot of a conversation the very same day. Andrew constantly asked for my number, for my WhatsApp picture, and whether I still work at Alias. It annoyed Nathan so much that Nathan blocked him on WhatsApp. Andrew ten started texting and bombarding Nathan's phone with phone calls. That's when Nathan blocked his number. But then Andrew was still able to get hold of him by ringing through private nymber. Although Nathan never gave him any of my details It seemed very scary how adamant Andrew was. I asked Nathan to give me his number and where he works so I know when the right time is to report him for sexual harassment, Andrew never gave me any of it because he didn't want to go through the long process of going to the police. To this day, 2/3 months later, Andrew still texts Nathan about me. Nathan has showed me his texts and his responses to Andrew, so I knew it was all genuine from him.

I gave Nathan my CV and my email address. I asked Nathan if it is cool if I bring along 3 more people from Alias, and another friend of mine. He said sure, he is able to get all 4 of them in. I gave him all of their numbers and he messaged all of them. 

The next day I got an email from an Evangeline Clark, who worked at MegaTrix. She booked an interview with me the following week. I will include her initial email here[https://imgur.com/a/btGQFIX](https://imgur.com/a/btGQFIX) I can't give away the intimate information at the bottom of the email, there it says the Agency she is a Recruiter for and her number and her LinkedIn.

Of all the other 5 people, only me and Katie got an email from Evangeline. However only I was given an interview date and not Katie. I asked Nathan why, and he said because he's closer to me than anyone, he will get me and Katie (another colleague/ friend from Alias) in first. Maria messaged Nathan asking why she hadn't received anything yet, Nathan told her the same thing he told me. Nathan doesn't know Maria at all, but he knows the other colleagues from Alias a little. 

Nathan tells me he is thinking to leave MegaTrix, he found a job as good nearer to him. A day later he said he got picked for their football team so he might stay. They have free football, volleybal, and gymnastic classes for their employees - that sounds so good for a company to give their employees who have no experience or aren't graduates.

Since I was given an interview date, the others quiet often asked when they will receive an email. I can quiet say that a fuck off amount of times, Nathan said they should wait until tomorrow or next week. ""They should get it by tomorrow"" ""by next week"" is something we often heard. I felt bad that I was given an interview and the other people from Alias plus Maria are so desperate to leave and join an incredible company like MegaTrix.

The day before the interview, literally less than 24 hours before it, she cancels it. She postponed it to a week later. I will include a picture of the email here [https://imgur.com/a/3oDyqNY](https://imgur.com/a/3oDyqNY).

I questioned Nathan about it and how I've never had someone cancel an interview before. I asked what she's like, and he tells me she's nice but very Moody. I thought maybe it has something to do with how they're moving to a new office.

A week goes by. It's 30th October. And again, she cancelled it less than 24 hours again, and not giving me a date as to when the next interview will be. I will include the picture of it here [https://imgur.com/a/bcH4Koa](https://imgur.com/a/bcH4Koa). This one is fishy because of how she types. I messaged Nathan asking him if he's playing a joke on me, and that was his response. I searched up Evangeline Clark (not her real name btw) on Facebook, and one came up saying she lives in London and that she is part of some business. I asked him if that's her, he said no. That's a picture of it. Note how he types also. [https://imgur.com/a/yZPUGT8](https://imgur.com/a/yZPUGT8) they both put a space before a comma... who does that?

Nathan suddenly bumped into John (40M) and said John after leaving Alias early was still looking for a job and Nathan was looking to get him into MegaTrix. I didn't hear much update from there.

2nd November I suddenly get dismissed from Alias. They didn't even give me a week notice. They have a very unfair system but there's no way to prove it. Right now I'm still jobless. I told Nathan, he showed empathy. He told me he's leaving MegaTrix and he will pass down the job to me. He said that Eva is having personal issues and she's off for the week. That I should hear something following week (5-9th November). I have been applying for jobs but i told Nathan I will take the job at MegaTrix if it is offered to me, but I'm applying to other jobs in case

The entire week I heard nothing from Evangeline. On the 12th I asked Nathan once more, when will I ever hear from Evangeline. He said I should probably get something tomorrow. But he has already left MegaTrix the week before. This is very weird now

I emailed Evangeline again on the 13th. No reply.

Yesterday I went back to the VERY VERY first email Evangeline has sent me. I got some clues there. I used the number on the email and rang it, wasn't available. I see in the email she is a Recruiter for ""Real Talent Agency"" and I searched them up on google, they had a very similar number. I rang them, said I was meant to have an interview with Evangeline Clark, they said they didn't have my name in the system. 

Couple hours later, Evangeline rang me. I asked her to repeat if I am speaking to Evangeline Clark. She said yes.  I told her everything and she seemed very confused. The conversation was a little short, I was out and about while on the phone to her, and she gave me her number to text me on and that I should send her my CV. I texted her and she provided me with a completely different email address. I emailed her my CV and explained the situation. I used her number to search her up on Facebook, and it came up with the same lady Nathan said it wasn't!

She rang me this morning saying that the email address I put on the email wasn't her, she never spoke to me nor does she know what on earth MegaTrix is. She is a Recruiter for sales for Real Talent Agency but she never interacted with me. She was scared, because that is just stealing someone's identity. 

I tried to get in touch with MegaTrix, which is now part of another company, when I tried to ring the company they're a part of  they couldn't even provide me with a number. I wanted to find out if Nathan, since I got his real full name, ever worked there. I can't find that out. 

I don't know what on earth to do. I explained everything to Maria and the other colleagues from Alias. I messaged Nathan yesterday asking if he's free for a phone call and he said in 15 minutes but that didn't happen. From the way he writes to me, he does sound believable. Also this is reddit but you guys don't know him the way I do. He always seemed to be like a poor, passive little kid, especially when it came to the Andrew situation. But all the arrows are pointing at him. I really don't want to think that's something he'd do.

Since he supposedly got in the MegaTrix football team, he once randomly sent me a screenshot of the coach texting him, and his number is displayed there. I could ask this coach regarding MegaTrix and if he actually works there.

This whole free sports classes makes no sense either since apparently MegaTrix only has 15 people in their team. Why is there a free football, volleyball, gymnastics ? There isn't enough people to fill them all.

Please. How do I go about it? Maria, and the other people from Alias are super confused.

I could message John on Facebook to ask him regarding MegaTrix too, since Nathan told me he randomly bumped into  him and was looking to get a job there. 

Other than that.. I really don't know what to say to Nathan. From everything I explained the others and those in Alias who knew him, they wouldn't think he would play such an elaborate joke like that, up until time had exposed him. This has been going on for over a month, maybe close to 2 months.",15Nov2018,1

The dog is NOT well-behaved; if I come over to do homework, we basically NEVER get homework done because the dog is constantly whining and causing trouble. If doors are left open, the dog will destroy and/or eat anything. The dog (who is about 45lbs, some kind of lab/pit mix) also is prone to some kind of temper tantrums; I truly do not know what else to call them, but the dog just loses it and runs around super fast and refuses to let you catch her. This dog is a NIGHTMARE. Recently, my good friend has been asking me more and more to take care of her dog, asking me to spend entire weekends with it. I love my friend but I HATE that dog, and I am plenty busy as it is. What really irks me is she offers NO compensation and does not even thank me. I have spent entire weekends at her apartment caring for her dog and haven’t even received a message of thanks. I feel that I should be getting paid for taking care of such a badly-behaved animal. So now I am stuck. I love my friend and I definitely don’t want to lose her friendship but that dog is her responsibility and I do not have time (or the desire) to deal with her animal.

I just want some advice about how to approach this situation. So yesterday I decided to get a ""college senior"" photoshoot because my high school portraits turned out bad. The photographer I approached is known for her high school senior pictures, and she charges about 225 for an 1-1.5 hour session. When I contacted her I said I wanted the 225 session but she said that since I'm not in high school she would charge me less, only 180. Yesterday I went through with the photoshoot, and at the shoot was only 30 mins long. I didn't have the guts to speak up at the moment because she was already in her car and leaving by the time I looked at the clock and realized how little time has passed.
Now technically I do think it is my own fault for not clarifying the amount of time the session would be before I paid her my despoit (the $180) but I do just feel very sad about how rushed it was. Reading our emails she did say this would be a ""special session"" but she didn't clarify what that meant. I probably should have asked though. It was also super cold so I wonder if that was a factor.
Anyways, I was wondering if it would be rude to text her today and bring this issue up? Should I tell her that even though I appreciated her work, that the session was shorter than I expected? My ideal situation would be to have her shoot me for another 30 mins to an hour but I'm worried that instead my bringing up this issue would cause drama and make her mad.

303,"I just found out this afternoon that my mom has been constantly texting with a guy in her friends group. She has been going out a lot lately, which is weird cause she usually doesn't go out that much. I once saw her texting app password and when I opened it up, I saw that she has been texting with a dude that also has a family everyday. They meet each other everyday at a coffee shop and sometimes have dinner together. Yesterday afternoon she asked me whether there is any new movies on the cinema so she could go with her best friend. But apparently she went there with this guy ( according to the text I read ). I dont know how long they have been like this or how close they are since I only read a few days of their texting. They talked about how they love each other and how that guy wished she could be with her when she is sad. This really came as a total shock to me since she has always been a loving mom to both my dad and me ( I'm 17 &amp; I'm their only child ).

I later have a talk with my mom. She told me that he was nothing but her trusted friend whom she can confide in. But what kind of friend say dearing good night everyday ? She also told me that she would never let this get anywhere further and i have to believe in her. I just lost all my respect for her even though I know that my dad has been a little bit old-fashioned and hot temper for the past few years. He sometimes say awful things to her when he is angry but he always apologized and made it up for her later on. I know that my dad could be hard on us sometimes but he has always been a loving and caring father.

Hell no I ain't puttin' up with someone else's lack of hygiene it's not my fuckin' problem yo.

It's one thing to be stuck in a room with a kid that has bad B.O., but it's another thing to not be allowed to do anything about it. Yesterday I tried to take the fan and sit in a corner and blow the smell away from me but my teacher said no, and to deal with it. Fuck no.

I have a friend dilemma, so here goes:

I have a close friend from my college days whom I love and care for, a lot. She has just entered into her first relationship and the guy she's with just gives me red flags. 

1) When about 6 months had passed, she calls me and said that he was already talking about marriage. He even talked to her parents about a hypothetical engagement. She also told me how he'll ""joke"" about proposing, like he'll get on one knee and pretend. 

2) They met through Instagram (that's not a problem), but  she told me that he was basically asking out other girls prior to him and she's the only one who gave him attention.

3) The family that he lived with doesn't like him and kicked him out. Now she has this savior company lx and how ""their love is stronger than anything "" complex. 

4) More people in their neck of town don't want them to be together. 

5) I just get bad vibes from him. He seems very manipulative. 

They're both coming to see me and I'm an trying not to pass judgment on him but he just rubs me the wrong way based on how my friend talks about him to me.

311,"Hi Reddit. I’m starting a new chapter in my life but I’m afraid of starting over. I’m trying to keep the background info as minimal as possible. 

I’m graduating college with an engineering degree in December but don’t have any professional jobs lined up. I had about 5 interviews during the semester but none of them worked out, which was honestly a bummer for me since I have great co-op experience and a high GPA. It’s had an impact on my self worth and my parents don’t understand why I can’t get a job. Since recruiting won’t pick up until April graduation, I’ve been looking for less conventional jobs to pass the time while I seriously job search. I’ve always loved skiing, the outdoors, and traveling, so I found a job at a ski resort from January-April. I feel like this is a good time in my life when I have no serious family or work commitments, where I can do something spontaneous like this. I also don’t want to get comfortable falling into a routine living with my parents. My final reason is that I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years this summer and don’t want to run into him around town. This would be a good chance for me to be comfortably single and independent. 

I was excited and ready to accept the job and book my flight, but last night I had a panic episode and am rethinking everything. I’ve never lived far away from my family before, since my college is about 30 minutes away from my hometown. The ski job would be across the country. I think I might have separation anxiety problems. When I left for summer camp as a kid and for college I had breakdowns. Will I be able to start completely over socially? Also, I will be doing manual labor for 40 hours a week at the resort and sharing a bunk bed with another employee. What if I hate the work or my room mate? What if I’m stuck with a creepy coworker and have nowhere to escape to? Also, I’m concerned that potential employers will judge me for working at the resort instead of pursuing serious engineering work (which I still am!).

I used to be able to talk him down from his fits and have a conversation about it, but now he refuses to talk about his own behavior and it’s hindering us.

322,"This semester at college in an attempt to graduate on time I overloaded the number of subjects I would normally take per semester (6 vs 4 subjects). I also work full time hours and have found it difficult to maintain a good balance between work/school/well-being.

My health has been pretty abysmal as a result. I have always had a low-grade something and have had to repeatedly apply for multiple assessment extensions.

I have been particularly unwell lately and applied for 3 extensions for 3 different classes. I ended up needing to apply for an additional extension and did so on the due date of the assessment before the deadline. Or so  I believed.

I mistook the due date of the assessment I was applying for an additional extension for for the due date of a different piece of assessment with which I had also applied for a previous extension for.

So assessment piece was due on Tuesday but I did not submit my application until Thursday. 

The way my college approves extensions is by a standardised form that is emailed to you and I think because I have been extremely unwell I did not take not of the dates as I should have.

My college’s policy is that you must submit a request for an extension before the due deadline unless you have exceptional circumstances that prevented you from doing so.

My college has asked me to provide my exceptional circumstances (signed by a notary) to be reviewed by a board.

I guess I am seeking advice as to whether I should be totally transparent in disclosing that I mixed up due dates (not ordinarily a good enough reason) because I was really quite ill at the time (vomiting, dizziness etc) or zero in on incapacitation from the illness (which is not untrue). 

I have a doctors certificate that states I am unfit for academic work over the date the assessment was due that can corroborate I was unwell.

This assessment piece is worth 60% of my final grade and if I am not allowed to submit something for it, I will certainly fail the class as a passing grade is 50%.

I am really upset that I have put myself in this position and am still unwell and not feeling fully equipped to deal with this own my own. Sorry if this post reads like a mess.

I would very much appreciate some advice as to what you think the best approach would be.",15Nov2018,1
324,"Quite a few of my friends are willing to joke about darker subject matter, though the subject is almost always something personal to them and the joke is meant as a coping mechanism, e.g. joking about being poor when they are poor themselves, joking about depression when they are depressed, that kind of stuff. In a way these jokes could seem off-colour out of context, but within context it's someone making light of something they fully know the gravity of, something that affects them and they aren't just punching down and making fun of others with.

I was making one of these kind of comments (and I know it would help with the advice to give specifics, but I would rather avoid it if possible, out of personal comfort and also to avoid having the specifics control the discussion/divide opinions), and my friend chimed in with something that really just shocked me. He said something that was, in my opinion, really just over the line - in part because it dealt with something so graphic and horrible, but also because it was a subject that doesn't affect him at all. And he chimed in with it like we were just having a funny conversation. I got a little quiet, then tried to change the subject quickly and just pretended like nothing was wrong. 

I feel like if I call him out on this much later than the original discussion, it will seem 1. weird that I've hung onto it for so long and am bringing it up out of the blue (worried he'll deflect by saying ""WHY didn't you bring it up when I said it?"" when the answer would simply be ""it made me extremely uncomfortable and I was shocked you said it""), 2. hypocritical because I was making light of roughly the same subject matter (but in an entirely different way, and in a way that is wholly personally impacted by the subject matter whereas he is not), and possibly 3. cause a rift in the friendship where he doesn't see *why* it was specifically in extremely poor taste and thinks I'm just saying he can't make any slightly ""dark""/""edgy"" comments around me ever (starts tiptoeing around conversations or acting like I'm some sort of gentle snowflake).

Is it worth bringing up? At this point I think I'm just too scared to bring it up because I think it would do more harm than good, and not solve any problems, but at the same time I keep feeling like I need to do or say something about it to get it off my mind/stop replaying that moment in my head. I don't know, either, if it's fair to him to be so bothered by something he said and pretend everything is fine - it kind of feels like I'm hiding something, or lying.",15Nov2018,1
326,"Hi, it's my first post, and I usually consult my friends, but I think I need more perspectives so that I can make a decision I won't regret.

I made a friend recently, lets call her K. I signed up for lessons at a Local Language School, to get over a certain friendship I lost in the early parts of the year, to distract myself basically. K was a girl who entered my class somewhere in the 9th lesson, where she asked me on her first day whether she could borrow a ruler. Skipping time a little, we realised we had rather similar interests, I surpressed my anxieties and asked her for her number and we began talking a lot, and sharing a lot about our lifes. We met for dinner outside of class, and one day, a month after that, the atmosphere was alright so I asked if she wanted to date. I haven't dated in 8 years, and she told me I was probably her first serious relationship, but she told me she thought things were going too fast, at her door before she left to go home, I told her that's it's alright, I'll wait for her.

K is a really busy person, she works regularly at a company from 8-6, and goes for classes with me twice a week, and teaches/is pursuing a musical diploma on Saturdays. From what I know, one of her uncles is also having health issues, so she will visit him often. The problems started when she told me she had work problems, where she felt pressured and bullied by her superiors. I told her at dinner that if she believes in what she did, (which I believe she is, since she's a really good girl imo), then she should stand her ground. She tendered her resignation that day and cried a little, I sent her home and assured her I was with her.

That's where the problems started, the work problems escalated closer to her resignation date, I would see her getting more and more tired, missed class once, and to cheer her up, I would write her cards to encourage her. I bought her some chocolates (since she liked it) and even a pair or earrings and all to encourage her. However, one day, she told me things were moving too fast and she asked me not to send her home anymore . At first I persisted but relented after she told me no. Things went a bit downhill afterwards, she started not to reply my texts anymore, and we started to get a little more distant, bit by bit. I stood by her nevertheless, and waited for her official day where she left her company. She informed me she would be teaching full time in her Saturday job as her new job now, and it was a flexi schedule, but only to her boss. 

After her last day was over in the company she was bullied in, she regained her smile and laughter in class (our teacher is quite funny), but nowadays when I walk her home halfway, she rarely talks anymore. She would usually just reply me coldly, or be looking at her phone and stuff. She no longer really waits for me, and seems to be in a rush. I feel like she is trying to run away from something. She talks to our other classmates normally irl, but it seems more of a ""just for formalities"" kind of talk. I tried many times to talk to her to ask her what's happened, but at the advice of my friends, I decided to tell her how I feel but nor probe. She recently told me not to give her gifts anymore, even though I had prepared one for her upcoming birthday, and in this two months, I felt like everything crashed down.

I just left her a few hours ago, and usually I'll ask her how she's doing or what she's up to, but today she just seem frustrated and say she was working. We have about 2 more weeks of lessons before our exams begin, and we'll probably not see each other again. Next Thursday is her birthday, but I have an exam on that day, and I am trying to rush to the place we usually meet to wish her Happy Birthday in person, but I don't thnk that's a really good idea now.

I just texted her 30 mins ago, saying I'm sorry because I know it'll stress u, but next Mon, after class, I feel we really need to talk to try to save our rn, or more so, our friendship. We talked once about it, but because I didn't probe, she said to just be normal friends. For 2 lessons straight after that, I tried to not initiate any conversations irl and it was literally silent hill all the way back home. I feel like it's now or never that I have to solve this problem, so I'm seeking for advice on what's the right thing to do. Thanks.",15Nov2018,1
327,"Names of people and places will be changed as to not expose identity. So, I am an 18 year old male. I grew up on an island called Nanoose Island. I moved off with my family when I was 12. I am a Christian, and went to a church on this island. This church is run by all of my extended family on my dads side. It is a little weird for a church to be run by just one family. Now I have a number of slightly “off” encounters with my extended family. One day I am in the church service, playing with my second cousin, jack. We are moving around, as you’d expect from 5 year old boys, then after the service, his grandma, Sarah, yells at me for “exciting him”.  She is clearly very unhappy with me.Now keep in mind, our last name is Jameson, these people put our last name on a pedestal and won’t stop talking about how great they are. We were left out of this “Club” because we would not join in praising them. My other cousin, josh, jack’s older brother, hit an insane growth spurt at about 11. He grew like 6 inches and was taller than any other kids in our family. Whenever we had family get togethers,  they would say, look at josh, look at the strong tall man he is becoming. Jack on the other hand, got no such recognition for the same thing. Constant arrogance and attitude of “We are so great”. Next instance happened when I made some friends that weren’t from the “Jameson clan”. So I became friends with this family with 2 boys. We eventually all got together and had a party. Now whenever josh and jack would play with these new boys, they would always try to draw their attention away from me, and my sisters, so we couldn’t join in on the playing. It still bothers me to this day that because of them, my childhood was so void of actual friends, I can only think of one that was an actual friend and not manipulative. Josh and jacks’ mom is very manipulative, and she instigated most of it. Everything had to be a competition with her. It was bad if we were doing something better than their kids. Here’s an example. I was 2 years ahead of Josh in math. So every time we would get together, she would mention that I was ahead of him, and tell him he needs to work harder at math. And it still is! She is unsettled by the fact that my sister is getting a better degree at university than Josh. They even didn’t bother telling us when a distant relative, (Who I still respected) had died. We had to find out from our friends who still lived on nanoose island. My grandparents are even bought into the ides that “the Jamesons are superior”Now here is where the problem is, I have moved away from this island, and am trying to forget about it all. I am having some success, but, my grandfather’s health is declining, and I know they would be at his funeral. There would be much conflict there, considering all that has gone on, and I doubt it would be a pretty sight, because I would most likely ignore them. Over our lifetime, they have treated us inferior to themselves, and this is why I want to make myself forget their existence.

There are many more examples, but what would you suggest I do when an inevitable circumstance happens, like a funeral on my side of the family?

Please forgive my gaps in the story and the information dump. The memories are coming back a bit randomly.",15Nov2018,1
329,"WARNING: I'm going to be mentioning past of sexual abuse, so if this will bother you in any way I'd recommend skipping this read. 

..............

&amp;#x200B;

To start, this is a burner account since my family and friends are active Reddit users. They knowww (???kinda) of some things that have happened in my past, but given what I'm about to talk about happened last night I don't know how comfortable I would be telling them about it face-to-face. Lel so hello interwebs.

A bit of background about the situation- unfortunately I am not new to sexual abuse. I feel as if I've been sexualized starting at a young age. When I was 12 a man tried picking me up on the side of the road when I was walking to school. And I think that was the beginning of my ""Oh shit. I'm a girl and girls are desirable."" mindset. But shit started getting bad whenever I started dating the boy I lost my virginity to at 15. He was very sexually coercive and refused to let me say no. And this is where my problem lies. I can't tell to what point I'm being raped or sexually abused. I would refuse his attempts but he was relentless and that was my boyfriend so after a little I would just concede. I thought that was the right thing to do. Eventually when I stopped seeing this person completely (took about 3 years), I met the man I thought I wanted to marry. I was 17 when I met my most recent longterm ex at work (m25 at the time). He was very manipulative from the beginning and now I realized he was always like my parent or boss. Because even though he was my SO, I had to play by his rules. And that meant when he wanted to have sex I would either do it or he'd pout. It was rare that I refused but when I did it was awful. We ended up splitting up because shit was really toxic and he cheated about a year ago. So to keep a long story short, I'm used to sexual coercion. 

Recently I started dating someone new. My most recent ex that I just mentioned and I broke up permanently about 5 months ago. I'm 20 and my now SO is about a year and a half younger than me, and on top of that I don't know how the hell to date anymore. We've been actively seeing each other for a little over a month now and we are sexually active as of a couple weeks ago. Last night we finished watching a movie and at about midnight I just crashed. I remember him saying he wasn't really tired and that's the last thing I heard before I fell asleep. I'm not really the heaviest sleeper, but if I'm super tired it takes a good bit to wake me up. I remember slightly waking up from deep sleep to him touching by breasts but I did't fully wake up so it was more of a ""huh?"" then pass back out thing. I woke up again later to him touching my genital area. I in no way can say how long the time frame was between the breast touching and the lower-region touching, but I feel like it was a good bit of time. I woke up fully and ended up having sex with him because, honestly, I was totally down. But in the midst of things I had a sudden realization that, holy shit, that isn't very okay. After we were finished I checked my phone and saw that it had just turned 3am. So it was a good couple hours after I remember falling asleep. Obviously there's no way he could have thought I was awake. I mean the room was pitch black but even then, I was dead asleep. I don't believe he had any ill intent with what he was doing. He's the sweetest person I think I've ever been involved with to the point where I don't even know how to handle it. I'm not used to guys who are actually good to my. My whole reason for posting this is because I know that if I said something to him about it he would feel God awful. I'm not angry about this and honestly I think I'm only a little uneasy about it because I *should* be- because the world would tell me I should feel that way. 

I just don't know if I should say something or just move on with it. I hate confrontation as is so that would be my only objection. ",15Nov2018,1

331,"Hello everyone,

**I'm desperately looking for advice.**

I'm a **26-year old guy** and I still have **acne, red spots and blackheads** all over my face, especially my on my **cheeks** and **nose**. Also, my face gets **oily** very quickly...

//// Things to consider: ////

*I stay in a tropical country at the moment and it's always very hot, humid here.*

*When I drink sugary stuff, my face gets extra red, more acnes appear and those spots hurt when I touch them.* ***So I stopped drinking sweet beverages****. I only drink water, soda water and Coke Zero sometimes. Now my face looks a little cleaner but time-to-time redness, inflammation and acnes still appear. Face still gets oily every day 'tho...*

*I use a facial foam every day to clean my face. It makes it dry and feels refreshed but the acnes never go away. It gets oily after a few hours.*

*I tried dozens of acne gels and creams. NONE of them worked. None of them made my acnes and redness disappear... Waste of money and false hope. And I'm talking about years of trying. I just don't want try any more of those creams because I know they won't work for me.*

*There are* ***tiny blackheads everywhere all over my cheeks and nose****. I tried that black face mask but, of course, it didn't pull them out. I don't know what to do with blackheads... Unfortunately they cause oiliness and outbursts, I think.*

***FYI****, I don't pop the acnes because they hurt a lot... I just let them disappear. But it takes WEEKS for them to go away. Then others appear on different spots.*

**So:**

**Should I go to a clinic and get a facial treatment? If yes, what kind of treatment do I need? How much does this kind of treatment normally cost?**

**Should I take antibiotics? I never tried that before. Do they work?**

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any suggestions, please, let me know.

I would really appreciate it. I tried everything and nothing worked. No cream, no gel, no foam, no mask, no nothing.

333,"Hey peeps..

As the title says, I realized I was a toxic person, I became aware of it after my ex (we stayed as friends after split) decided that she no longer wanted to be friends because I gave her bad vibes etc and that she’s speaking to a new guy and she didnt want to disrespect the “bf”. 

I’m not saying that’s how I realized it, how i realized it was the same pattern kept occuring over and over and it smelt like shit everywhere I went.. so i checked my own shoes and what do you know? It had been me all along, the unhappiness, the pessimistic attitude, behavior and perspective on life.. I was at fault for 95% of the things that occured within the last 7 years, I am 24.

Upon realizing, I accepted the fact that I was toxic and I admitted it to myself and to others that I had done wrong, ever since then my attitude, perspective and thinking process shifted into a much more optimistic state.. I wanted a new slate, a fresh new start. I removed myself from peoples lives that I knew I never was a part of and started to think about myself, think about my health, put my actual needs first and start making myself grow..

I know the things that I need to do, such as getting a job, buying a gym membership and living a healthy lifestyle, save up and invest and such..

Anytime that someone messages me and wants to be friends, or anything of the sort, I get super anxious and end up not talking to that person.

When people I've known in the past have tried to meet up with me, I am always awkward, and I never talk or anything. It's so hard to have friends.
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I had a heavily emotional and partly physical abusive relationship when I was 15-16. I'm not sure, it sorta started after that.

340,"I'm a typical 16 year old high school student and my best friend, who I had since 3rd grade, and I were once in the same chemistry class. I since talked to my case managers and managed to switch classes, while my friend still remains. The reason I wanted to leave was I felt my future was in great danger. I'm talking about my chemistry teacher.

My experience with her was very unpleasant. She had angry issues and constantly yells at us. One time she threaten the entire class with detention because someone was whistling the Twitter notification. When I try to explain small issues I had, like missed work or not getting the test, she wouldn't be flexable and instead would piss me off with her negative attitude as she refused to help me. When getting back my tests, some questions were marked inncorrect because the wording was slightly off, even if it had the same meaning. One time, one of my friend's bullies and my friend were standing at a crossroad. My friend allowed the bully to go first to be nice but the bully refused to move. The teacher was behind my friend, pushed him out of the way, while yelling at him to move. The bully grinned and wasn't punished while my friend was yelled at.

This one time is very personal. I suffer from anxiety attacks, as part of my autism. When I receive them, I MUST leave the room or else I would cause a scene and the anixety will get worse. One time I recieved an anxiety attack and asked the teacher if I could leave. For context, this is not the first time I had one in her class, so she is aware they exist. So when I asked her, she said no and was focusing me to complete a sheet. I can't do work when I am anxious. It only adds to the stress. But she was refusing me to leave so the anxiety kept growing. I eventually got up and left the class without her permission. The next part of the story comes from my friend's point of view. Apparently, after I left, my teacher went into a pit of rage and was threating to give me detention. My friend, in response, was defending me, saying I was having an anxiety attack and I HAD to leave. Remember, we known each other since 3rd grade. He understood my anxiety and eventually conviced the teacher not to give me detention.

My friend, however, wasn't so lucky with detentions.

Chemistry class is Period 3. Spanish class is Period 2. Spanish and Chemistry are on opposite sides of the building and our school is huge and everyone walks slow. So some days we were late, but after explaining the late situation, she promised she would not count for those lates. However, she then backed down on the promise when my friend was actually late for the first time and gave my friend detention and a ROM. However, when my friend arrived for his detention, she said a couple words then told him to leave. It was a complete waste of time and he missed the bus that day.

At this point, I have switched classes. I feared what my chemistry teacher would do. My college experience, my career, my life...That could've all been taken away from me by this evil, tryannical women.

However, again, my friend wasn't so lucky. Recently, he got a second ROM. He was at the media center as he lost his personal school-issued computer and was asking where it could be. After the meeting, he recieved a pass and headed to chemistry. Even though he had a pass, the teacher gave my friend a detention and ROM for looking for his computer and being late. Even though, as I mentioned 2 times before, he had a PASS.

My friend was given a ROM for the dumbest reasons and now his life is ruined. He can't go to the top colleges anymore. He has detentions on his record. All because of our teacher.

343,"I am at the end of my first semester as a software engineer at the Technical University of Denmark and can't think about anything other than the possibility of dropping out and starting fresh at another university.

Of course the obvious answer is ""keep trying"", but I'm just underwhelmed by my university experience so far because I have no social life (I'm the only international student in my course) and it's very hard to keep up with the lecturers.

Unlike in the UK and USA, clubs and societies are almost non existent here and I really can't see my social situation changing. I also constantly feel like I'm behind and am very slow to learn.

5 years of my life would be completely erased. The pressure, the all nighters, the 12 hour homework sprints, the constant fear of failure, all for nothing. I don't think I'll ever be happy again and I don't think I'll ever make it in life. My life is a god damn waste and there's no making up for it. Most of my life so far has been a waste, I've fallen so far behind and it just doesn't mean anything anymore. I don't feel like anything means anything anymore, I don't feel proud of anything I do. Anything I do isn't worth it because I'm always late to the party.

I don't have a plan for what I'd do if I dropped out. I don't want to take a leave of absence because then I'll constantly feel stuck in life just waiting to go back to college. If I'm leaving I'm leaving for good, one way or another.

I don't want to be here anymore. I think I could just kill myself right now and nobody would care.

I think I snapped. It's taking whatever shreds willpower I still have to even pretend to pay attention in class and not literally scream out in an autistic rage because I want out already.

If only I dropped out sooner, maybe my parents wouldn't keep telling me ""you're so close!"" And actually be ok with it. I should have stopped trying to make college work. I hated every second of it, and I would have been better off not going.

I really don't want to be here anymore. I regret going so much. I know I only have one or two classes left after the next month of projects and finals, but even that seems unbearable at this point.

I've made it this far but I don't think I can go on anymore.",15Nov2018,1
345,"So we moved out of our house like a year ago and my parents couldn’t find the boxes so they didn’t return them, but how would the cable company get my number? My parents aren’t this type (at least I don’t think), but now I’m paranoid they put the cable bill in my name and my credit’s shot. Every time I try to pull my credit on Annual credit report it says they can’t verify identification. Probably because of a thin file, but I’ve also move three times recently so that might have something to do with it. Have to get a new license with the right address to send the picture in to verify. Could the cable company somehow get my number if it wasn’t in my name? They don’t say my name or anything but I’m really anxious over this ",15Nov2018,1
346,"Today at school, I was hanging with some of my friends in class, let’s call them Tom, Chase, and Malcom

We all know each other from football and stuff, so we’re all very good friends. However, one of my friends, Chase, is brutally honest. He’s hinted once or twice he might have ADHD or something that makes him more outgoing and honest then the rest of us, but he basically says whatever’s on his mind if he feels like it. He’s like 6’7, so if a 5’2 or 5’3 girl walks by he’ll be like “Holy shit she’s short” in hearing distance, and I’ll always tell him off.

Well today, he was making fun of my friend Malcom because something happened with this girl. The girl in question was a little overweight and tall, a lot bigger then my friend Malcom. Well, Chase said some pretty rude things about the girl who was right across the hall and just awkwardly stood there. I told him off, then said “Dude, you might actually cause a shooting one of these days”

Yea, it was unfunny, rude, and stupid. Some other kids in my class heard me and chuckled a little bit, but told me I probably shouldn’t say that. I left school after that class and I got a text an hour ago from Chase claiming that a security guard came up to him and asked him why someone said he might cause a shooting.

I’m fucked. Chase told me that I should just say it was a joke, and I didn’t mean it, but I know that won’t play off well. I’m basically in a pretty fucked up situation, and the best thing I can do is tell the security guard the only reason I said that is because Chase is constantly making fun of kids. I’m super worried right now, and I don’t want to betray my friend and sell him out. Bullying isn’t cool and can really fuck with people, and maybe he deserves to be in trouble, but I can’t snitch him out. 

I really need some advice on how to handle this, preferably with my parents never finding out and me walking away without any punishment, but I doubt that’s possible. ",15Nov2018,1
347,"A few years ago, I lived with an acquaintance for 2 years who happened to work at my same large company in a similar role, different department-- we went to college together in different years so had mutual friends.  Over that time we became friends, went on a few short trips with our other girlfriends, celebrated birthdays together etc., and went through some sh\*t too (one of her parents died by suicide, we had job drama and personal relationship drama, dealt with a natural disaster that meant we didn't have a place to live or work for several weeks etc.).    

I moved in with my boyfriend, she got a new job, then moved to another major city to be with her boyfriend.  I married that boyfriend 2 years ago and it felt natural to invite her-- we had been keeping in touch and were still very friendly.  She flew back to my city to come to my wedding-- her boyfriend ""couldn't make it"" (or didn't want to come) so she asked if she could bring one of her friends who I really like and get along well with as her plus one, and I was happy to oblige.  Good times seemed to be had by all. 

In the time since my wedding, we haven't been in touch as much, and when I have reached out she's been much less responsive.  I've had issues with my health and my parent's health (which I haven't talked to her much about) which has sort of made me retreat a bit generally both in real life and on social media but I couldn't honestly tell you why this has happened, at least from my perspective--certainly nothing specific happened that I'm aware of that would prompt her to change her view towards our friendship.

I found out (from her) last year a few months after it happened that she got engaged, and then, not through her, found out that she'd be getting married in my city, where she doesn't live anymore and neither her nor her fiance have any family.  She didn't invite me to the wedding and I felt like it wasn't appropriate to ask her about it beforehand because I didn't really want to put her in an awkward position/I know how stressful the whole wedding planning process can be...of course she didn't HAVE to invite me but I have felt pretty hurt about it, and upset more generally that she has sort of fallen off with me more broadly.  

I am considering sending her an email just to say, hey, I'm sorry if I've been a bit out of touch but I've been dealing with some heavy things and you weren't as responsive or engaged either, and while I am of course not entitled to an invite it did hurt me that I was left out an wasn't told why.  Part of me wants her to know it hurt me (and it's a shit thing to have done), and the other part of me knows that likely nothing productive will come of it...  Worth it or waste?  My understanding from a couple other people is she has been sort of a sh\*tty friend as of late, but surely that's not the case with everyone.

tl; dr: Friend who attended my wedding sort of fell of in communication and didn't invite me to her wedding (in my city) recently-- upside or downsides/worth it to let her know I know and the lack of invite/general fall off of friendship has hurt me?",15Nov2018,1

349,"I'm 17 and currently in my 2nd year of 6th Form (UK). The 6th Form is a part of the same school I did High School in, so I've come through the school with this guy. He was alright back then, so I thought I could trust him, and so would talk to him about things getting me down. That was until about a year ago, when he started using those things against me, as well as a whole bunch of stuff. There's too many to list all of em, I'd be here all night, so long story short he's just like really emotionally abusive, so I haven't opened up to him about things in ages (but ofc he already has that ammo now, which he continues to use). 

In addition, he's gay (and I can't express enough how much I don't have any problem with any of that kinda stuff) and over the year, especially very recently, he's been dropping hints that basically confirm he's got a thing for me. I'm straight, but even if I was gay or bi or whatever, I'd never get with him if we were the last humans on Earth. He doesn't seem to get the fact that I'm not interested though and is always making me feel really uncomfortable and passing WAY BEYOND the boundaries. He'll like play with my jacket and lean on me in a ""lovey-dovey"" way, poke me all over, feel my leg (yeno in like the thigh kinda area), and on multiple occasions has poked my penis with a pen (and who knows how long until it's just his hand). I've told him over and over firmly that I don't want him to do that, but he thinks it's all some big joke so me telling him to stop just goes in one ear and straight out the other. I'll also forcefully move his hand away from me but again, he thinks it's like some kinda playful tug of war type thing. 

I also wanna mention that throughout him doing all of this shit to me, I've been nothing but nice to him, always supporting him when he's come to me with his ""troubles"". The furthest I've ever gone to being mean is just being a bit distant when he's tryna talk to me during the day, which he actually also uses against me, saying that I am, and I quote, ""socially retarded"" and ""unable to hold a conversation"". I know full well that I'm not either of those things, but ofc it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. 

As well as all this, there's just a bunch of shitty things going on for me rn, so a few weeks back, after bottling all of it up for ages (as I always do, like many people do), the flood gates burst and I just had enough so I went into my parents at like 2am, crying and just went all out. Mum's gone and spoken to the head of 6th form about stuff, including what this ""friend's"" done, but she said not to deal with him yet because I'm scared of the consequences it might have.

Likesay, I go to the 6th form from my High School, so all the friend groups have already been long established and I don't wanna seem weird trying to force myself into others. I am friendly with all the others in the year, and they're friendly back, but I'm kinda stuck in this tiny group of me, ""friend"", a semi-""friend"" friend, and this guy who I'm sure has a lot of problems himself but he's really quiet. I say that that guy's a semi-""friend"" friend because he'll sometimes jump onboard ""friend""'s train, back him up on what he's saying about me or whatever, but most of the time he's alright. Anyway, so basically I'm scared that if I was to full on confront ""friend"" about this stuff, it'd leave me completely alone until we finish in like June, even though he's making my life all the more miserable. Despite that as well, I'm also scared of like making him feel really upset as well, even though he clearly doesn't care about me (but... he also.. does?)

Everyone in the year doesn't see this disgusting side of my ""friend"", they all think he's this perfect, lovely guy. He's also headboy btw. When the 'election' for headboy came around, and the teacher was reading out the people going for it, when they read his name out, all the girls went ""Awwww!"". People also talk to him a lot more than me, whilst I'll just get like a sentence every now and then. Another thing is that all these people also ship me and this guy, like just the other day semi-""friend"" was talking to some of the girls and they asked him if we were a couple. He told them no but when they asked if I was gay, despite him knowing I'm straight, I'm sure, he said ""ooohhh, maybe, we're not really sure"", which makes me out to be a closeted gay. There's literally no reason to be closeted cos everyone's super cool with that stuff, and ik my parents would be as well if I came out gay, so it just seems almost cowardly. And again, I have no problem with LGBT stuff, but ofc I don't want people thinking I'm something I'm not. 

Oh yea and sometimes ""friend"" will say something that deffo doesn't offend me, but later on, on snapchat he'll be messaging me like ooh I hope I didn't upset you babe (not exaggerating him being gay, he always calls me babe and boo and shit like that) and I'll be sat there thinking like how tf can you think that upsets me, but then you're completely fine with saying all this other shite. I mean it's all probably part of his grand evil scheme but still. 

Also, if I ever have more of a stronger reaction about something he's said or done than usual (which likesay isn't strong at all), he'll start saying shit like ""why are you acting so serious babe, it's just a joke"" ""you're acting autistic"", when in fact he's the one who always takes shit too far. A few weeks ago he said it was cold when there was just a bit of a light breeze and it was sunny, so I said ""nah I find it just quite cool"" meaning like a comfortable temperature on the colder side, but he starts arguing his case about how I'm wrong and he's right and that cool = cold, and he actually later sent me a link to the definition of cool, one of them saying ""to make something colder"" and he's like ""see bitch I told you"", and obviously it's quite a mild example but it's always the same, you can never win with him, he always has to be right no matter what it is.

Another thing is that he clearly despises me being straight. Like it sounds completely fucking mental but some of the things he says are almost (ugh) 'heterophobic'. And if he's saying like would you fuck this guy and I say no because I'm not gay, apparently that's overcompensating, and just every little thing I do seems to indicate that and a fragile masculinity. And at times I feel like he's almost tryna convert me and saying certain things I do like caring for my appearance by moisturing, etc. or even a fucking high five to quite mate is apparently gay, and recently he's been sharing a lot of ""gay memes"" with me. Like what am I gonna do turn around and go o wow guess I'm gay after all because I look after myself. 

Anyway, so after that meltdown a few weeks back, as well as Mum seeing head of 6th form, she also booked me an appointment for this counselling session, and I've continued going to them. The woman's really nice and I've told her all of this stuff and more in the sessions. But yea so every person I've talked to about this has said like it's manipulative, abusive, sexual harassment, etc. And ik all that and I really do want him out of my life. One big thing was that everyone's also said like imagine if this was a straight guy doing this to a girl who didn't want to be touched and stuff, he'd be like expelled or something and really it's no different, and I need to sort this out cos he is making me miserable but likesay I'm scared of how miserable I might be if I end up all alone, as well as how awkward it would be cos it's a really small year group and 6th form, relatively speaking.

I could go on and on and on about all this shit but I've been writing this for over an hour now so I kinda need to wrap it up. 

So yea I just feel really stuck like I can't do anything but continue to take all these blows he's dealing, even on top of all the other stuff he's not directly involved in, until we finish next year and I can cut him off. I just really don't know what to do and I don't know what good writing this will do but I just really need anything that could help me because I have no idea what to do. And cheers if you've read all that cos I have actually just written a damn novel. Soz about that ",15Nov2018,1

353,"Let me start by saying I’ve never been in any sort of serious relationship, but lately it seems like even my friendships are lacking. I feel like nobody knows or understands the “real me” but I can’t seem to figure out who that is.
A little background for context: I’m a 21 year old woman and since I’ve been 18 I’ve been in and out of psychiatric hospitals. At the moment I’m doing great; I have a job, all As in my classes and plenty of “friends”. I don’t have trouble making friends or getting into relationships. In fact, as long as I don’t express any of my actual thoughts I can make friends with pretty much anyone I want to. Usually I can’t be bothered to make the effort and just do what I want, which leads to me becoming alienated from most people. 
Lately I’ve been feeling lonely and disconnected from everything. Whenever I try to relate on a genuine level with my close friends they never seem to understand my feelings or reactions. It seems like the more I try to explain my ideas and feelings to them the less they understand. I understand that I experience emotion slightly differently from other people (I’m diagnosed borderline personality disorder and schizoaffective bipolar type) but even when I’ve tried to talk to people in similar situations I don’t find understanding. 
On the flip side I rarely form any kind of emotional bond with people; I don’t understand and can’t relate to what they’re feeling which leads to me not caring whether they’re in my life and possibly coming off as cold because I don’t feel any connection. 
I guess what I’m asking for is any advice on how to find people who I can understand and relate to and who can understand and relate to me. I’ve tried online communities of every kind but I never know what to talk about or what I’m even looking for. Whenever I try to talk to people in mental health support groups or professionals I’m met with overwhelming responses of people who are depressed or assume I must be depressed even though I’m very happy with my life.

354,"I have been renting a room out of my best friends house for over a year now. Her and I have been inseparable for 13 years now. Well, I am finally at the point where I don’t think I like her as a person. I don’t like her attitude, I don’t like her ideas, I don’t like her work ethic, lack of respect, blatant laziness around out house, etc. 

The hard part here is that her family basically adopted me when I was 14. My family has always been rocky and they kind of took me on as their own. I have always been appreciative of the help I’ve been given, and I’ve done my best to never take advantage of this family. This family is wealthy beyond belief. 

My best friend is 24 and she has never paid for:
1. a vehicle (buying the vehicle herself, maintenance, car washes, gas, insurance, tires, etc.)
2. Phone. Her father buys her a new phone twice a year and pays for it every month. Since she was 12. 
3. He bought her the $160,000 house that I now rent a room in. 
4. She has never paid rent OR utilities at our home, at the apartment she lived in, or the duplex she rented while attending University. 
5.  He pays her health insurance. 

Basically, she has never learned responsibility. 

As someone who has always had to work hard for everything I want and need, I am growing resentful. I have tried to sit down and talk to her on many occasions to ask her to be a little more conscientious of my money situation by not leaving every light on, not leaving the AC on when it’s 46 degrees outside, not running the dryer three times for one load of clothes just because “I like when they’re warm.” I’ve had to ask multiple times for her to not trash the house. Clean up common areas, take trash out, wash your own dishes. NORMAL ADULT THINGS THAT COME WITH HAVING A HOME AND ROOMMATE, but she shuts me down every time. 
“It’s my house..” 


Where do I stand? 
If I stay, I’ll be living in a hoarder’s paradise with fruit flys all over, averaging $350 for utilities, and a shitty best friend/ roommate, or I can move out and potentially really struggle on my own and maybe build our relationship back to what it used to be?

355,"I’ll try to keep this short, but there’s a lot of backstory to this so here goes:

I had this friend, and for privacy’s sake, let’s call her “Samantha.” Samantha and I met sophomore year of college, and we instantly clicked. We met in class, and it turns out we also had another class together that semester. So basically, we saw each other every day. She ended up joining an organization that I was heavily involved in, and we got even closer. When sophomore year ended, she called me her “best friend.” I didn’t really like that term because of the unsaid pressure behind it... but I really enjoyed being her friend so I just played along and called her my best friend too.

Junior year was when things start to go downhill for the both of us. I entered a job that drains me mentally and physically, and Samantha got in a relationship that turns from sour to toxic. Despite my stressful situation, I did whatever I can to help her out and be there for her. She eventually left the relationship, but not without scars. 

Our final year of school was very rocky. She projected her insecurity onto me and would constantly accuse me of not being a good friend. She would send giant text messages for me to figure out how I could be a better person to her. Finally, one day, I had enough and told her to stop doing this. I tell her that she can’t do this to me and that I won’t stand for it anymore. She apologized and told me she would change. We both graduated together and spent the summer in our college town. Before I left to my new job in a different city, she did something totally unexpected. She met with me and told me that she didn’t want to be friends anymore.

Now, present day, almost 4 months later, she texts me saying that she’s sorry. I’m meeting up with her next week, and I really don’t know what to say. I know that my side of this story can be biased... and I’m not the greatest friend either. I do truly want to forgive her, but I’m not sure if I want her back in my life. Any advice?

She was my coworker and definitely the type of girl out of my league. I had no interest other than I found her extremely attractive. I eventually found myself giving her tutor lessons (we worked at the college we were attending). We connected real well. We got together one night and from there, it took off. Not officially together, but I was the only person she was giving her attention to. Then I really fucked up, and decided that the girl I truly wanted to be with was (A). I was extremely wrong but I didn’t realize that til much later. My coworker was pretty upset and pretty much ended any contact outside of working together, and even that was minimum. Fast forward 2 &amp; 1/2 years later, I’m in a very severe state of regret and depression. I broke up with the (A) and eventually got back to being friendly with (C) but never past friendly. I did confess everything to her and she listened and helped me thru the break up, but nothing came about us. I found an opportunity to move far away so I took it thinking it would make moving on from her easier. (A) eventually found her way back to talking to me. She actually helped me move since I was completely broke and on the brink of losing everything . She paid for the truck and helped me pack and everything. Because of all of this, I gave into her wish, which was to get back together. Months later, I’m starting to enjoy my life a little and (C) messages me to say hey and see how things were. She told me she never forgot about me and and she always wanted to say something but didn’t want to since Me and (A) were back together. (It should be noted that I don’t want to be with her but felt like I owed her and I do break up with her again eventually) Some time goes by before I asked why she messaged me now but never before. She said she finally worked up the courage to say hey. But she never went past saying hey and talking for a day. She admitted that that’s all she intended to do, knowing how I feel about her. I’m now all messed up over this because she was apparently thinking of me for some time. When I go to talk to her about it, (C) tells me that it’s basically impossible to have anything between us but she won’t just tell me no. She says a lot would have to change. I confess once again how I feel. I then ask what she wants in life. She cuts me off for work and I ask her to think about throughout the day. Next morning I wake up to a message of her and her best friends baby in bed together, showing me the baby. Leads to no conversation. Now she complains about guys messaging her for a day and then getting ghosted by them after a day. Exactly what she did to me. 

She’s smart, gorgeous, very caring, goal-oriented, responsible, goofy, etc. she has it all. Everything. 

I really am in love with this girl. I honestly see myself having a future with her. I’ve been in enough situations to know the difference. This is the real deal and I can’t seem to move on or get past it. I have an opportunity to move back closer to her so distance wouldn’t be an issue.

I'm 22, I currently rent the main floor of a bungalow with my wife, my sister and 1yr old nephew. I've had a hard time with employment for a few years. There's not a lot of full-time work in my city and the full time that is available usually means living in fear of being canned on the last day of probation without explanation (this has happened to me 3 times in the last year)

I want to go back to school so I can live a better life but I have no idea how I would possibly be able to go to school and pay for rent,living etc.
I also have Aspergers which has made coping with stress in a healthy manner and communication hard for me. I'm very high functioning so many people don't really understand what I'm struggling with because I 'seem' normal. 

Another issue is I've been in 2 programs in the past that I wasn't able to graduate. I'm scared to enter another one even if it is possible because I might just fail again but I can't keep living like this. The anxiety and betrayal that comes with starting to like a job and then being cut on the last day is unbearable and I need to change my situation. 

We're barely making ends meet as is and I'm starting to lose hope on my future. 

When I'm passionate about a topic my grades have always been very good but when I get stressed they start to slip and everything in life becomes hard to focus on. 

Rent is very high in my area at least compared to pay which is usually minimum wage. If I found a program, possibly even part time. I still don't know how I could make enough to keep us alive while I'm in school?

Please any suggestion or advice would be appreciated",15Nov2018,1

He has said things like ""when we would get divorced"" and they really don't know how to talk to another. They even live far apart but only see another on the weekends. Every year it gets worse and now they seem like the dysfunctional couples on reality TV.

I am so scared of what would happen when they would get divorced. My mom would go into full crazy mode and my dad would have no idea what to do. Now I'm just awaiting it to happen. How do I cope?? Can I prepare myself or forget about the possibility of this happening?

Out of anxiety, I’ve been binge-eating sweets, which has been triggering my body dysmorphia, and my stress rashes have been appearing on my hands.

Although I have friends and family to talk to, I live by myself and I feel so alone and disconnected from everyone. Even the guy I’m interested in has his own shit going on and I wish we had more of a chance to connect, but I know he’s grappling with his own issues and neither of us have the time now. I’m also struggling with a lot of self-esteem issues (also exacerbated because of work) and I honestly don’t know if I am ‘enough’ for this guy for him to take me seriously and include me in his life as a significant other or anything like that.

373,"My cousin is 5 months younger than me (we’re both 25). However, our lives are completely opposite. She didn’t finish college, but has a few certifications that she doesn’t work in. She’s had jobs, but doesn’t work consistently. I went to college/grad school, in the military so don’t make an abundance of money. I’m married to someone who does well, but right now we’re focused on paying my student loans off and we have two separate households (military stationed in different locations). Her father was the patriarch of our family and she had everything she could desire growing up. My mother was a single mother who did her best, but there were definitely nights of me studying in the dark because we couldn’t pay the electricity bill or no water because we couldn’t pay that either. But I busted my ass to get to where I’m at. 

After trying to figure out what’s been going on for the past few years, she was finally diagnosed with MS a few months ago. She works on/off due to this. Even prior to the diagnosis, she always talked/still talks about killing her self on her Facebook and is always asking people for money, whether directly or posting her GoFundMe or CashApp link. She complains about not having enough money to eat or live or even pay for her treatments. Her brother who lives in the same area (also military but does not make a lot of money) gives her a lot of money and tries to support her as well.

A few months ago was her birthday, and she asked for money so that she could buy a $400 camera to get back into photography. My uncle (her dad) and my mom and a few others gave her the money. I couldn’t get myself to do it. The other day she asked all of my cousins in our Facebook group chat about sending her money. 

I see her snapchats of food when she goes out to eat (at least multiple times a week). The other day she claimed the man at the pho place she goes to knows her name by heart. She smokes weed/vapes because she claims cannibis helps her pain (which I am not doubting). She has an animal (I understand the attachment and bond, but she was never in a financially sound place to own a pet to begin with). I see her purchasing small items, like a Harry Potter mug, make up, etc. or going to the movies. Lastly, when she moved out of her moms house many years ago, she was never kicked out but chose to leave and live on her own. 

I was thinking about deleting her off of Facebook. I feel horrible but honestly her posts are so negative all the time. Additionally, when she’s posting about not having enough money to live and how hard her life has been, it takes a lot out of me not to comment back things about her dining out and poor financial decisions. I do see her on holidays, maybe once or twice a year. Please tell me if I’m being unreasonable/unsympathetic. Thank you. ",15Nov2018,1

Despite that he has held strong and continues to be the friendship glue person. He's always there for everyone, keeps going and working hard in his own life despite how hard things have been. He's always very generous with all of us. 

One of the difficulties is our friend group has fractured a bit. Not in a bad way, we just all moved all over the world at the same time. For some reason. So this poor friend, after all his support and hard work and existing difficulties, doesn't even have his crew around like he once did. And he *lives* for us. We're all like a big, happy family.

384,"TL;DR Camp Fire in California is making me way too sad. How do I separate myself from the empathy I’m feeling for the victims?

I work as a CNA at a hospital in Butte county, California. The Camp Fire has destroyed much of Northern California, leaving thousands of people displaced from their homes, 50 dead, and over a hundred still missing. Many of my patients right now are discharging to a shelter or a family’s home because theirs has been burned down. If that isn’t enough, there has been a norovirus outbreak in some of the shelters, so many victims are also dealing with that. It’s been a week since the fire started and I am still utterly devastated. It’s all I think about. I can keep it together at work but after hearing stories from the people who barely made it out alive, and seeing  everything on social media, i can barely get out of bed in the morning. It’s making me question whether I should still become a nurse. If I can’t handle my own empathy, I’m worried that nursing might put me in a perpetual state of depression. Does anyone have advice on how to let go of this sadness?

386,"Me: 
Hey sorry for blocking you and running off to work the other night. I was taken by surprise. I was also fucking pissed beyond belief. Why I blocked you and didn’t want to talk was so I didn’t blow up and regret my words. But you deserve to know why. 

I gave you another shot and continued to see you despite me feeling unwanted and unfulfilled and generally shitty about myself when I started dating you. And you didn’t apologize for the things you did that hurt me and I honestly don’t think you believed you fucked up at all. You don’t invite someone over then just ignore them. Especially when they’re about to go out of town and work for the next week straight. I even tried to fuck you and you went right back to what you were doing. I don’t want to have to tell someone I like to act interested in me. I’m not going to do it. It fucking hurts to do that. If you really valued me you’d do shit to make me happy too and be interested in me. That’s human nature when you genuinely like someone. 

At the end of the day we aren’t compatible. The issues I have are about basic relationship things that I shouldn’t have to tell someone who genuinely is interested in me. I feel you just don’t want to be alone and I’m convenient at the moment. I’m not going to waste my time being someone to pass the time with. I’d rather be alone. I think I really tried my best to make you happy and to make you feel valued and special. I never really felt like I got that in return. 

I don’t want to see you again. 

And him: 

I am sorry for making you feel that way you are a good person and I hope you find what you are looking for. 

I wasn’t planning on seeing you again either thats why I came by the other night to make sure I was right that you were blocking me and to end things which I thought I did. I might not have been the best boyfriend but I am looking for someone that Is at least willing to deal with things head on not txt message bullshit or go the ghost route and honestly I think if you liked me more you’d have either wanted to talk about things instead of just bail every time and maybe focus on some of the good things we had going too and yea If I liked you more it prob would been more natural for me to show the type of interest you are looking for. I am fine being alone as well and you definitely were not easy or convenient with your schedule and how fickle you were but I did like you and thought maybe if we got through some initial hardships we could find our way. 

I am not mad or anything at you and hope you don’t take things personally you are a cool girl and sometimes things just don’t work out at least we found out pretty early and it wasn’t overly dramatic I understand that you are mad at me but I was not trying to be a bad guy or anything to you and I think you know that. 

And again sorry for making you feel that way while you were with me you definitely deserve to be with someone that makes you happy and it seems like you know what you want so I hope that you do find it! I hope you enjoy your new place and your future vacations and stuff are filled with fun, best wishes to you 🙏 ",15Nov2018,1
387," TL;DR:  Moved to a new city two states over a year ago. There is a lot  happening in this place and we love it, but we are struggling  financially (and socially). Should we stay and continue to try to build a  community here, or move back home where everything would be easy (and  VERY cheap) but the weather sucks and there is absolutely nothing to do?

So  there's some important context here. My wife and I are both in our late  twenties, we have a two year-old child, and I am currently working full  time as well as taking three classes online (11 credit hours). I have  very little free time, and we have no disposable income to put towards  paying babysitters to go on even the occasional date. We love everything  about the city we now live in, but we rarely get any opportunities to  avail ourselves of the amazing things it has to offer. We packed up and  moved away from our home town (which is about a day's drive from here)  exactly one year ago to get away from the miserable weather and the lack  of anything at all to do for fun. (I'm not exaggerating when I say that  this place has exactly nothing to offer anyone. It's a small town with a  lot of ignorant and intolerant people, in one of the most hideous parts  of the country, with a climate that prohibits enjoyment of any kind of  outdoor activity for nine months out of the year--and we do thoroughly  enjoy our hiking and biking.) After a year of being away, however, we  are realizing that it is in fact extremely difficult to make new friends  in a new place as an adult who is constantly busy and trying to raise a  toddler. We miss our friends and family, and we dearly miss having the  resources to make time for each other and keep our relationship healthy.  The question is now, what is it worth to live in a great place? Or,  inversely, what would make suffering through living back in that  unpleasant place worth it? I can say with near certainty that we would  have a place to live that would be either free or close to it, that my  wife would have a job waiting for her, and my income wouldn't be  affected (I work remotely). Essentially, in making this move, we would  be gaining at least 1000 dollars each month. (This would be a tremendous  benefit to our current financial situation.) I have another concern  that my wife doesn't exactly share, and it is that we might get stuck  there if we go back, which is a thought that utterly terrifies me. She  seems to think that we'll have no trouble leaving again when we're  ready, but I worry about how much more attached we'll be, especially  with a young child and grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles, etc.  being so close. So this is getting verbose, but that's pretty much the  gist of it. If anyone has been in a similar situation and could share  some insight or offer advice, we would appreciate it immensely! As of  now, we're completely crippled in this process.",15Nov2018,1

Instead of asking what he could do to help, my father gave him a big speech about how my brother lacked initiative, and how he was pissed off at him for not getting a job. At that point, we had all decided to go our separate ways for the day, in an effort to calm down. A few months later, my brother decides he wants to move,and that he would be visiting the friends house he would be moving into. My parents are shocked, and they beg him not to go. Once he left, mom and dad talked about how he never did anything in the house, or how he abandoned them.

My father has refused to get a normal job, stating the thought of it ""makes him sick to his stomach"". In lieu of this he has attempted to sell his children's book, which has currently earned a total of $0 for us, he's been trying to make it work for the entire year.

When I bring up the idea of getting a job or the fact that he has no income of his own he gets very angry with me and says something along the lines of ""You know what I'm trying to do! So get off my back!""

I've already stated that I'm moving out when a friend of mine graduates college, but the date of that graduation has been getting pushed back because of him switching majors. I want to move out sooner than his graduation (estimated to be in 2020 now) and I want to know how to convince him to do something other than sit around waiting for his unreliable brother to try and sell the book to stores for him. (his brother has connections at Kroger and Walmart but currently nothing has come of them.)

He has attempted to justify his by saying ""well I supported you for 20 years (18-20 I was a NEET) so that makes it fair) even though he didn't want me to get a job (he has a delusional paranoia that a government sleeper agent is going to burst into the factory I work at and shoot me in the face.

He's an artist and is able to do freelancing work, but he's very bad with money.

He's also quite unstable mentally, has even threatened us with suicide, although that was only once and a few years ago.

I keep some of his savings for him, because he's aware of his spending issues, but every few weeks he asks me to give him back because he wants to buy some crap, and I have to try to convince him not too.

I've heard of many similar stories about troublesome family members, so I thought that maybe people have come up with solutions on how it's best to help them. Maybe there are even books about that? I think that professional help is out of question, it's the last thing he would agree to.

To keep the advice generic we can concentrate on the financial issues. Say he's gotten into debt again - what to do, pay it off for him or make him suffer? He gets very miserable when that happens.

Also I want to come up with a plan for when our parents aren't here anymore. For now I'm thinking of some kind of fund that he gets paid out from every month, some kind of minimum wage so he can survive. Does anyone have experience with something like that?",15Nov2018,1

398,"So this just happened about two hours ago. I’ll try to explain this as best I can, I was waiting to cross the street at an intersection, pressed the button and everything. This wasn’t a big intersection. Imagine two lanes in front of me where cars from the left were going down the street to the right, and cars from my right were driving down the two lanes that would have been in front of the post I was trying to reach, from right to left down. There were cars coming both ways but it started getting congested to the point that, even though the light was green, people weren’t driving forward with their cars anymore, they kind of stayed on either side of the street to avoid blocking the street in case the light turned red. 
In other words, even though the light was green, because these cars weren’t moving forward, my path to walk forward was essentially clear. Now, before I start crossing, its critical to note that there are two lanes in front of me congested to the point that people are willing to not cross the street, meaning when I started walking, I could only see through gaps when I started crossing the first two lanes, trying to weave through the cars because they weren’t moving. As I was walking, I passed that threshold where I went from the second lane where the cars behind me were going from my left to right, now crossing into the lanes where the danger is coming from the cars coming from right to left. I already know there aren’t any cars coming from that way but I double-checked anyways. As I double-checked, taking a quick glance to my right, a car also noticed no cars were coming from that day, and drove on the wrong side of the road trying to reach this third lane that was slightly ahead that allows you to make a left instead of waiting in line to go straight. 
So when she left the line she was in, which would have been the 2nd lane that was ahead of me before I started crossing, she crossed into literally the other side of the street where there would have been oncoming traffic, I’m not sure if I’m making that clear. So once I took that step into the third lane of the intersection, I was hit by that car going like 25mph and I went flying like 3 feet. Idk why but I got up right away before the lady who hit me came to me and I went to her driver side door and asked her if she was ok. I could tell she was relieved I was walking but she was clearly shaken. She had her son in the passenger seat call his dad. I felt fine at first, and I was walking so I thought how bad could it be. People were stopping there cars even though the traffic ahead was clearing up, telling me I shouldn’t leave till I call the cops and that I should call the ambulance. I would say everyone stopped there cars but four people were literally yelling at me not to leave the scene until I made sure of everything. 
I didn’t know what to do and I felt bad for this lady because I thought we were both in the wrong, I crossed when I didn’t have the go to and she drove on the wrong side of the street. And I was able to get up so I just exchanged name and number with her and said I’ll contact you later. Now that it’s been a while,
I’ve been to get it x rayed and examined and I’m waiting to see the results, but I was given some pain meds. I’m home now and I can barely walk. What should I have done and what should I do now?

400,"First off I have panic disorder which is a type of anxiety disorder not usually triggered by anything in particular. For weeks on end I’ll have panic attacks every single day, multiple times a day, and they’ll be absolutely debilitating. I also have some general anxiety, and other issues. It’s been better lately after a horrible period from about June or July to October, but I feel it getting worse again.

I’m a licensed esthetician. My only job at my work is to do facials and other skincare services. Seems easy enough. Except my manager has lately (past few months) been telling me my sales (just on products) are shit, that I may not “be cut out to work there”. She doesn’t care about how much my clients love me or that I get a ton of repeat requests—she cares about me selling $80 moisturizer to some poor saps (when we don’t even get a penny in commission until we hit a certain amount of sales per month). I 1. Don’t feel honest selling my amazing clients stupid ass $100 serum when there are better ones on the market for much cheaper. Maybe I’m NOT cut out for the work.

I called in on Wednesday (yesterday) because I had a fever. They complained for me not giving 24 hrs notice (which I understand, but sometimes getting sick just happens), and told me I need to do a makeup day at the spa (which I can’t, because I have another part time job and other priorities).

I’d quit the spa because of how much anxiety it’s giving me (panic attacks every time I’m there that I have to just pull thru when I’m with clients) but my other part time job is closing in a month.

I have an interview with a new spa on Monday, but who knows how that’ll go. I’m confident that I’ll make a good impression as I usually do, but my beauty school never taught us how to do Brazilian waxing and that’s a necessity there, and they may just turn me down.

But about a week after cross country, I lost that motivation.

It's the same with anything written, he has had important applications returned or rejected because of serious mistakes.

414,"Hey all. So I've had my sofa for about 3 years now. About a week ago I started getting irritating bite-like lumps and raised bumps on my skin. I thought at first i got some irritation from random debris but it keeps happening every night now.

Here's the facts:
- happens in the evening when I sit to game/watch tv. Tends to be legs exclusively. I've slept on it and I don't appear to get bitten much during the night 
- I don't have any pets
- I have a fabric sofa
- It seems to happen even through my thick winter pajama bottoms

I have checked for bed bugs and fleas and followed a bunch of tips from the interwebs but I found no evidence so far. I've been sitting crossed legs for half an hour and just discovered another one behind my knee. How did the damn thing get there?! I've tried sitting and just watching my legs and checking them but can't find anything.

426,"Okay. Hi. This post will probably be a long one, but it’s an odd situation so I want to include as many details as possible. Skip below for a tl;dr. 

I’ve been a webcam model since June, as a way to make some extra cash for school. It’s a fun side job but privacy is very important to me, so of course I use a fake name and don’t share with a lot of people what it is that I do. I have what people would call a “finsta” which is a private instagram account where I post silly and sometimes personal things to a small following (all people that I know well and trust IRL).  Late august I posted a suggestive picture that inferred I was a webcam model. I deleted it the next morning. 

On september 5th I received a fishy snapchat from an unknown user. They had added me a few minutes prior. They said that they were somebody I know IRL but were too embarrassed to share their identity; they wanted a link to my camgirl profile. I told them there was no reason to be embarrassed and if they told me who they were I would give them my link. After going back and forth with this person for a while they eventually told me that their name was Taylor, a girl I knew 2-3 years ago as my high school boyfriend’s stepsister. This was weird. I knew that she was very introverted and not many people knew she was related to him (or me, in any type of way). I know they were lying. This freaked me out, because this person does not follow my finsta. After this I removed all sketchy accounts and people I knew less well from my finsta following. Fast forward a few days.

I get a text from a text-free number from the same person asking why they blocked me, that they were telling the truth. I let them know I had reached out to Taylor and told her someone was using her name and identity to catfish me. They didn’t care that they had been exposed, they *really* wanted my camgirl link.

They threatened to blackmail me if I didn’t give them my link, that they would tell all of my facebook friends about what it is that I do. 

Since then that person has reached out to me on 3 separate occasions, all via text-free numbers. The conversations usually started as them trying to reaching someone but having the wrong number (my phone number.) After I let them know I am not the person they’re trying to contact, they initiate conversation anyways. Weird. 

“Oh sorry! This girl from tinder must’ve gave me the wrong number.” 

I reply, “I’m sorry. Tinder sucks anyways!” 

“It’s probably because I told her The Pixies and The 1975 were better than Kanye West.”

My 2 favorite bands.... interesting. How did they know? 

I don’t respond and they say something along the lines of “Anyways, my name is blahblah. What’s yours?”

I humor them and write back, and they always take the conversation to the subject of sexwork and nudes. This is how I know it’s the same person. Then I tell them to leave me alone and lose my number. 

The last time they reached out to me I told them I know who you are, stop harassing me, I’m just going to keep blocking you. And they stopped. For a few weeks. 

Last night I received a DM from a sketchy twitter account, who’s tweets were fine-tuned to my interests. RTing pictures of lana del rey, pictures of weed, etc. This person’s picture and profile are obviously fake, as are their followers. I returned their message and have been small-talking with them over the span of a few hours. I want to catch them this time. 

Keep in mind this person already has my finsta, snapchat, twitter, and phone number, all platforms which I do not give out to just anyone. I have a lot of reason to suspect they are someone I know in real life. They aren’t very good at catfishing, I’m able to spot them after talking to them for a minute. 

Some things I know about them:

• They know me or one of my friends well enough to get my personal info.
• They use Verizon Wireless
• They live in my current city

TL;DR: The same person has been catfishing me on and off for a good 3 months, and I think it’s someone I know irl. They know my finsta, my snapchat, twitter username, full name, and twitter. They have threatened to blackmail me and are very persistent in getting some more of my personal info. What can I do to determine the identity of this person?

I found [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/09/28/how-to-bait-and-catch-the-anonymous-person-harassing-you-on-the-internet/)a month back after their last attempt of communication. I already have a fake website determined to catch their IP address, but after testing a lot of the free IP search websites with my own IP, I realized they’re not very accurate. Couldn’t find any way to track the text-free numbers either. 

Please, let me know if you have any advice on what I should do. ",15Nov2018,1

Last week my wife decided she doesn't love me enough to continue our marriage(literally 2 months). I tried to speak to her about it and tried to convince to atleast try to get everythig resolved and try again. It didn't work. Im heart broken. I know we weren't perfect but never thought it would get like this.

She says she has feelings for someone else but hasn't done anything,I don't know wether to believe it or shes trying to not hurt my feelings more. 

Worst part is Im trying to be fine,we have a 19 month old and I don't want her to see me upset. I do the same at work since Im at retail and we have to be okay and smiling. 

Last night I had to go into the cigarette cupboard(work in the kiosk) and I literally had a panic attack. They know about the situation but not about my mental state taking a dip.

I have to move out after Christmas(mother in law also lives there so I can't stay) and with my wage I can only afford a single room in a shared house cause I work part time as I stayed at home and put priority to my daughter and wife,and she worked full time. 

I woudnt be able to have my daughter there over night as it isnt allowed and I wouldnt have the room. 

Luckily my mate and his fiance offered me their spare room. And also said she could stay overnight a couple of times a week. My (ex)wife isn't happy and thinks I should be alone to get independcy. I dont want to be alone,my life turned upside down and I don't have family to turn too.

I spent hell of alot of time and effort with my daughter,leaving her is going to break my heart(just typing this is starting to make me cry),my exwife said she won't ever stop contact as she knows our daughter loves me(she wakes up and always asks for her daddy).

My mental state has gone,I just want to cry all the time and I'm bitter with my wife about everything. But I have to be okay for my daughter. I'm struggling with my daughter because whenever I see her,I see my wife aswell I should be happy but Im only sad.

At the moment I spend most of my time looking after my daughter(while Im still here) and the house. If im not doing that(or working),I spend most of my time watching videos on youtube and thats it. While I enjoy watching my favourite youtubers,it isn't exactly fullfilling or productive. 
I don't have any hobbies or interested really. Used to do hell of a lot walking playing a mobile game called Jurassic World Alive,but I got too busy to continue it.

I checked online to see if any sex offenders live close to the house and it turns out that one currently lives there! The man is 71 years old right now and in 2012 he was convicted for “indecent behavior with juveniles” and “pornography involving juveniles.” It also appears that he spent 2 years in jail for it.

Backstory: 

My sister and I were raised by our dad the abusive addict. My dad never taught us how to brush our teeth, or explained the imporatance of dental hygiene. He never took us to dentist growing up. My sister has always been insecure about her teeth especially because a front tooth is visibly rotting. She never smiles in photos. She was constantly bullied growing up, she had acne (still does). She cant enjoy cold drinks without being in pain, or even eat ice-cream. 

 I cant stand to see my sister hate her self. We have been to the dentist under Medicaid when we were 18 but they only offer cleaning and cavity fills, and few other basic things. Even then Medicaid won't pay for braces once your past 12, but that didn't matter considering her teeth were determined too weak to sustain braces. Now we are both very broke college students, working full time jobs. My sister needs dental implants, each tooth cost around $900-1500. Its not fair that she has to suffer from my dads neglect to our health. I have thought about making a go-fund me page, but neither of us are comfortable sharing with friends of our past situation..  Does anyone know of any pro-bono dental implants lol. or a organization that would help?? or any suggestion to help her get by while she has to save up this expensive implant??",15Nov2018,1

The first time happened in Edmonton at a country bar. We went for New Years and I met a girl out there who I hit it off with quite well. I remember my buddies and I buying shots and having a good time but after about 1 AM I don’t remember anything. I woke up naked and had no idea where I was. My phone was dead and I was pretty scared. She woke up and I asked her what happened. Turns out she asked me if I wanted to go to her place, I said yes and we ended up having sex in her house. I ended up getting an Uber and going back my hotel that was 20km away. 

The second instance was pretty much the exact same thing but I woke up in the back of my truck. 

I felt extremely disappointed and gross for putting myself in these situations, I’ve cut down my drink significantly since the second time. I can’t remember if the two girls were drinking or not.

433,"Tl;dr: took out nexplanon birth control at end of year 2 because of full periods (not working like it used to) and switched to depo shot. Insurance won't cover because doctor says it was still working so this was elective, not preventative. 

I'm at the end of my rope with this so any help is appreciated, if there's even anything I can do at this point. Here goes:

I had my second nexplanon birth control (the implant in the arm kind) in and at the end of year 2 I went from no periods ever to full-blown, week-long periods. I was concerned the device wasn't working (they'd prescribed birth control pills to supplement the device and stop the periods) so at my physical in April this year they took it out and I started back on the depo shot the same day. 

When the bill came I was expecting it to be $0 because BC is considered preventative now and covered 100%. Nope. Almost $300 for the ""surgery"" to remove the nexplanon. A fun aside: I had to assist in that surgery for about 10 minutes cuz the doc had such a hard time getting it out, I almost passed out lol. 

Fast forward to November and after much back and forth between me and Medica, my insurance company, and me and the hospital, there have been many claim reviews, coding reviews, etc. and I got the latest explanation: the doctor's notes (the doc is no longer at the clinic) say that the device was still working and we took it out due to breakthrough bleeding which is considered elective and not preventative so it's not covered. I'm so frustrated because if I'd known it was going to be considered elective and cost $300 (if the doc had just said that, I'd have known the impact, I've dealt with insurance/ billing/obamacare a fair amount) I'd have just kept the dumb thing in and kept taking BC pills to supplement it for the last year of its life until it was ""supposed"" to come out.

I don't know what to do next but I'm certainly not paying this bullshit bill. Anyone out there dealt with something similar? Should I file an appeal or a complaint with Medica/insurance company? Same thing with the hospital? If you've read this far, thank you for your time and for any advice you've got. ",15Nov2018,1

452,"So, I am a Master’s student and I have a huge crush on a girl in my cohort. When we met last Fall I knew I liked her and I tend to behave like a little kid by “playfully” insulting my crushes. The problem then was that there are some big cultural differences that I was not aware of at the time. I’m white and she is Taiwanese and since then she has told me that in general she is intimidated by white people and my supposedly “playful” banter was not very playful. 

Since then we have become very close friends and my crush for her has only grown. When we first met I was in a relationship and still coming to terms with my sexuality. In the last couple months I have finally come out to everyone and so that complicating factor has been put to rest. But, since I had told her I had a boyfriend when we met I think there could have been something between us that was quieted due to that. 

Presently she is dating someone and has for about 6 months. They come from similar cultural backgrounds and both speak Chinese. She tells me about the issues in their relationship and that she is not happy and doesn’t want to break up with her because she is “procrastinating” and will just break it off when we graduate. 

We are both applying to Doctoral programs and may not even be close to each other next year but we have said we will always be friends. I’m wondering if it is selfish for me to tell her I like her or if it could be freeing for the both of us to just put it out there with expectations.

453,"I’m 19 and have had a pretty bad diet all my life. I remember for most my childhood I would only eat chicken nuggets and chips for dinner most nights. There have been things I would eat when very young that I just started to dislike such as cottage pie, liked it as a little kid and suddenly found it disgusting. I would occasionally eat fruit and veg as a kid but it was rare, maybe like once a week. When I was around 10 I started eating a bit more, so now I have a slightly better diet. 

I still however don’t eat enough fruit and veg. Most of my diet consists of stuff like chicken nuggets and chips, fish fingers and chips, pizza for dinner. Then just buttered bread and crisps for lunch and junk food snacks.  I try to add a vegetable to each evening meal but I don’t think I end up eating enough of it for it to count. 

I don’t like things most people like. For example I don’t like pasta because I hate the texture and how it’s a mix of sauce and solid food. I don’t like any foods that are mixed so anything with sauce is disgusting to me. Another example of this would be like a cheese and ham sandwich, I like ham on it’s own but can’t stand it in a sandwich or with cheese. Then If I eat ham I have to find specific brands I like. Tomato ketch up is the only way I can eat vegetables, if I put ketch up on them then they can actually be nice. I have tomato ketch up with almost every hot food. I ‘like’ most fruit but can only put up with eating a few mouth fulls before I get put off by the texture of sharp taste.


It’s not like I don’t try to eat healthier. I try new foods all the time. If there is a food I don’t like I try it again and again hoping I will get used to it. Most the time I end up having to force my self to eat healthy stuff and then after I feel sick for doing so. Then I end up feeling unsatisfied so go back to eating badly. I think I have some sort of sensory issues as well because all my life I have been extremely sensitive to the way things feel, I would refuse to wear certain stuff as kid and still don’t like most clothes now. I think that could be related to why I’m such a fussy eater.

It would be great if anyone has any advice on how I can eat better. I’m starting to feel tired a lot of the time and think it’s to do with my bad diet. If I go out to eat I normally order off the kids menu or get fish a chips because it’s all I like but I feel weird for doing so.",15Nov2018,1

458,"Yesterday, my school hosted a sports meet, in which teams from several other schools came too. As the host school, each member of our team was supposed to bring some beverages to the meet for our ""guests"". I had originally forgot that there was a sports meet that day until a friend reminded me during school, so naturally, I wasn't able to bring any drinks from home. So, I decided to buy some drinks from the school cafeteria and bring it to the sports meet, which I didn't see anything wrong with- the cafeteria drinks were fresh, just as good as the ones sold in stores, and bought with my own money.

When I told this to my coach (who works as a math teacher at my school), he told me back in a joking manner, ""Oh, haha, those drinks don't count."" So, I decided that since those drinks didn't count, I would just drink them myself. However, when I went to use the bathroom or something, somebody (I still don't know who) took the drinks I bought and put them with the other drinks that our school was providing for the meet, without my consent. When I came back and found out my drinks were missing, somebody told me what had happened. I was really thirsty but also wanted to be generous, so I just took out one of the drinks I bought, and left the rest in the pile. 

A little bit later, the coach found out that some cafeteria drinks were in that pile, and basically gathered the team together, told us about it, and said to us, ""Anyone who was involved in this, please explain how those drinks got in there."" I decided to be honest and tried to explain what happened, that somebody had collected people's drinks without their consent and ""donated"" it. However, as soon as I stood up, before I was even able to explain this, the coach completely flipped out at me, and started yelling at me in front of everyone. This attracted so much attention that my entire team- and most of the other schools as well- all stopped what they were doing to watch this.

I tried to say that I only explaining what had happened and didn't actually do it, but the coach cut me off and started shouting, in front of my school's team and many other schools, that I was a complete disgrace and embarrassment to the school, and that he was ashamed of me and that my parents should be too. He then proceeded to call me a disgrace and embarrassment several more times, and even threw the bag containing all the cafeteria drinks (that bag filled with all those bottles was actually quite heavy), which ended up hitting another student. And this was all in front of at least a hundred other students- who all were watching exactly what was happening. It took all the strength I could muster to not break down crying then and there.

He then took me to the school's assistant principal and said that I was disgracing and embarrassing the school by trying to be funny by donating cafeteria drinks. Only then, with the assistant principal, was I able to explain that I didn't actually do it and was only trying to tell the coach what had happened. The assistant principal then dismissed as a ""miscommunication error"", and said we were both at fault. She then had the coach and I apologize to each other, and I rejoined the meet.

These are all the hard facts about what had actually happened. Now, this is how I feel:

1.) The coach was being extremely impulsive, unprofessional, and rude. 

That coach, a full-grown man who taught for several years at my school, had completely lost his temper, threw a heavy bag that could have injured someone, and heavily insulted me, his team captain, a scared and helpless 13-year old boy- all in front of almost a hundred people from around the county- all because of something as small as four bottles of school milk/juice, all because of such a small donation that I wasn't even involved me. I was literally unable to sleep yesterday night, and unable to focus on any thing today, because of his words towards me, and because of how much embarrassment he caused me. I had never been so emotionally traumatized in my life, especially by someone I used to look up to and respect. 

2.) That hypocrisy though....

I still don't even know what's wrong with donating school cafeteria beverages to this sports meet. My elementary school used to provide *only* school cafeteria beverages for their events, which were not only attended by other schools but also by parents and family members. What's embarrassing about cafeteria drinks?

However, what *did* embarrass our school was the coach. Seriously, what would you think of schools whose teachers acts like that? What kind of example was the coach setting by losing his temper like that?

&amp;#x200B;

If you've took the time to read all this, then thank you very much. I posted this in the advice section for a reason- because I wanted advice. I feel like I was being verbally abused and publicly humiliated by that teacher- however, I don't feel that this incident is ""strong"" enough for anything to happen to him. I feel like I may be overreacting to this, but I also don't want that coach to be able to get away with doing stuff like this. Sure, he apologized for not giving me the chance to explain, but he *didn't* apologize for humiliating me in front of so many people, for scaring me and hurting me to such an extent. I feel scared to say anything to him though, because this year I am applying to a very selective high school, and I'll be pretty much rejected if he tells that school anything bad about me. I've also found out my coach is very short-tempered and unpredictable- if I seriously piss him off in any way, he'll basically try to ruin my life as much as possible, and I'll have no power at all to stop him. However, I don't feel like I'm able to just let this whole situation blow over, because the coach has not explained this to the other people, so they still think it was my fault.

What should I do?

On Saturday, we had a massive falling out at a party. I’ve been in love with him for a few months, and I struggled to watch him flirt with other girls drunk. I was dealing with some extremely heavy shit as well, so that was the straw that broke the camels back.

We are open and honest with one another, so I told him on Sunday. We had a chat about it, where I decided to stay as close as we were and let me continue to get over it. I don’t want to lose the closeness and I believe wholeheartedly that I can get over the feeling I have with time. I had done it before.

That sunday night, he talked to one of our mutual friends for a few hours. That friend (rightfully) didn’t tell me anything about it. But what I did get told, was that a years worth of problems came out that night. Our mutual friend believes that I have been “a little” emotionally abusive.

I rely on my friends a lot to get me through things, because I don’t rely on family. He was one of those people. It became so common, that we talked the tuesday before, and both agreed that we needed to find a happier place for our friendship.

But my close friend told me on monday he needed space, that he didn’t want to talk about it.

I’m an emotional person, so I struggled greatly with this. We have such an open and honest friendship, what has gone so wrong that he couldn’t even tell me? So we argued, but I have kept my cool. I called him on thursday, stating that I couldn’t wait forever, that I want to resolve the situation.

He has told me he has been “too busy” to think about it.

I don’t understand how, since it’s been pretty much all I’ve thought about.

I don’t want to lose him as a friend. I know this is selfish, but I also don’t want to lose the closeness we have. I know that we have problems, but he didn’t give me anytime to resolve them. He made the decision to take a break from me.

My question to you guys is, is there a world where we come back to being as close as we were?

460,2 months my mom passed away at the age of 48.  I'm currently 16 years old and ever since she passed away I have a heightened fear of death and I can't shake this fear. I was wondering if you guys and girls can help overcome this fear and move on with my life. Please be nice with me because I have bad anxiety. I'm also not religious so please don't comment anything religious. Also if any of you guys or girls have had this fear before and you managed to overcome it please tell me tips how you did it.

462,"Hey reddit,

I'm a 23 year old guy and I live in a house with 4 housemates. I have been with my girlfriend for about ~2 months. My house is about 2 blocks from work, so my female coworker asked me if my house had anyone in it. I said that two people recently moved out, and there are extra rooms. 

She asked to speak with the landlord. I told her that I wasn't sure if I was comfortable with her being there, because I have a girlfriend and she might take it the wrong way. This female coworker is 27 years old and is fairly attractive and social... but she also told me that she was having financial difficulty, so I gave her my landlord's number out of hesitation, not knowing what to say.

I obviously have *zero* say in whether or not she can live there, but I know that my girlfriend will be a little off-ended about a cute little blonde girl moving into a house that I advertised for her (her room will be 20 feet from mine, and we also work together, so it sounds a bit fishy)

How do I deal with this? What should I say to anyone? To the landlord? To my girlfriend? To my coworker? Is this undoable?

My landlord technically isn't my landlord... she simply collects the money *for* the landlord and lives in the house herself. She is reasonable and seems like a genuine, young person. Should I bring it up to her?",15Nov2018,1
463,"I don't know the way forward. Any advice is welcome. I am currently jobless. I've been seeking employment for sometime now. 

I've been wondering if my credentials are an issue. You see, I'm an American with a foreign degree. I studied and earned my bachelor's in Philippines, where my parents grew up before migrating to the US; I majored in chemistry. My parents wanted to save money since it was the peak of the recession in 2008 and my brother still needed to go to college in a few years. Thankfully, my brother has since studied and graduated from the University of Maryland and is now duly employed as an IT Specialist. I, on the otherhand, have had a little less luck. 

I've had my degree certified by both WES (World Education Services) and AACRAO (American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers) as equivalent to a US degree with a 2.7 GPA. This year, I also took time to review and successfully take the exam to be a licensed chemical technician in the Philippines. I thought it might bolster my credentials. I tried for a master's, but found that I'll find myself knee-deep in loans after a semester. I'm still trying to pay it off.

I'm not picky about jobs. I worked night shifts at a call center in the Philippines. I worked as a research assistant for my university for a couple of years. I've worked as a lecturer at a review center in the Philippines. 

However, its been six months since my last employment. My parents would like me to come back to the US so I'm trying to find a job here. I don't want to become a burden. However, I am either overqualified for a position or underqualified. For example: I applied to be a housekeeper at an inn, but I was deemed overqualified. I applied to be a chemist at a pharmaceutical, but was determined to be underqualified.

464,"My 22 year old daughter’s neighbor underneath her started a fire that also caught my daughter’s apartment on fire. Idk how the fire started. Luckily my daughter was not at home at the time but she essentially lost everything. She did not have renters insurance. She didn’t know she needed it and doesn’t have a lot of money. I blame myself for not giving her the advice to get it. We live 1200 miles from one another or I’d offer to move her back in. She could move here but has just started a really good job that has great health insurance and she has epilepsy so that is very important, as her medication is quite expensive. My ex has helped her get into a new apartment and bought her a mattress but she doesn’t have any clothes, furniture, dishes, etc. I’m single and don’t have a lot of extra funds but I want to help! I’ve already suggested goodwill for furniture and dishes but am looking for some creative ideas to help her get back on her feet. Poor thing. Says she will be fine but just lost everything.

465,I invited her to celebrate my birthday which is right after Thanksgiving and she said she won't know until last minute. Fine. Told her it would make me really happy if ds she came. All the sudden she went off on me. She told me I was disgusting for expecting her to be there when apparently her grandma is dying and she has health issues. Mind you she is always selfish and I have never undermined whatever was going on with her health and I had no idea her grandma was dying. Anyway I'm not sure what prompted all this but she goes on to tell me how I've been having mental health issues and just was horrible to me. I ended up not well after that conversation and she abandoned me. We still have not spoken and somehow I am to blame. I know I suffer from depression and anxiety and can sometimes say things i dont mean but she just seemed really over the line. Long story short I ended up in the hospital because I was so depressed and she told me I was using my depression as an excuse even though she knew I was getting help. Not sure I can forgive her for abandoning me like that. Unfortunately I let it get to me and it caused fights with some other people too. Even if I could reach out I'm not sure I should.

467,"About eight months ago I started talking to a teenage girl I met in a Discord server. She was deep in depression and going through a rough patch, which triggered my innate paternal instincts and led me to take up a therapist/mentor kind of role for her on the server. At first I mostly just explained or simplified English words and phrases so she could better understand what people were saying on the server and feel like she fitted in, but that rapidly evolved to talking to her about her social anxiety, then her depression, and more recently the underlying causes for it. She's taken great strides since I started talking to her, she self-harmed constantly when we first started, and was seriously considering suicide as a way to end her problems; but now she almost never harms and seems genuinely happy with life most of the time. She regards me as her closest friend, I've helped her more and understand her better than anyone else in her entire life, and if something happened to her family I'd adopt her in a heartbeat, but something has come up recently that I have no idea how to help her with.

470,"Hello, fellow Redditors!
Alright, before I begin explaining, here’s some context- I’m a 14 year old kid, living in a small, usually quiet household. I’m not a rebel or anything; I do all my work and I have straight A’s in school. I’d say I’m a decent person, albeit my laziness.
Anyway.. Where do I begin? This post’s titled family, so you probably know what I’m about to say.


Today, I came back from school. It was snowing, and on top of that, the weather was just quite bad. My mom always stays home, so yeah, I came back and she was there. Anywho, I take off my things, get dressed and all that jazz and I hand her.. My algebra test. As I mentioned before, I am a straight A student, and I intend to keep it that way. So this time, I got an 87 on my my test, which.. Isn’t awful, but it’s a bit low for my taste. Oh, we had an extra credit quiz, so +8 points would be added to my score, getting us the grand total of *95.*
So I hand my mom the test, and she goes *crazy.* She starts ranting about how it isn’t good, how I’m a failure, etc. She doesn’t want to believe the points will add up as well, for some reason. So, up to this point, her reaction was a bit extreme, nothing serious. 
I have social anxiety, and I’m pretty sensitive, so I started tearing up a bit due to her obnoxious screaming. Here’s the real kicker, though- She **LITERALLY** says that she doesn’t want to raise me, that im a failure, then grounds me; giving me an hour on my phone a day (this might not be extreme to some, but again, I have social anxiety, and video games are my only way to cope with stress etc).


This has been happening every time I get a grade under 92.. I’m almost positive this is verbal abuse, but I don’t know what to do about it?

And that’s it, uh. Help would be appreciated, kinda why I’m posting this lol",15Nov2018,1
471,"Okay, so.

I'm currently in a steady, committed, 8-month-long relationship with the love of my life. Without getting too personal into stuff, I've worked very hard to get over past negative experiences to give this person my everything because they are the only person I've ever loved and they are the only person I want to be with forever. I lost my virginity to them, but have fooled around a little with someone I used to be with (we never went all the way, and a lot of it was honestly non-consensual). I've worked very hard to make us happy and I'm afraid this will ruin it because lately I've been in a few situations where people aren't believing me when I tell them things. Here is a text log I have ongoing right now.

&gt;**\[Random number\] Monday the 12th at 9:44PM**  
My phone was stolen 3 days ago. I JUST bought a new phone.  
&gt;  
&gt;**\[Me\] Monday the 12th at 9:44PM**  
Who is this?  
&gt;  
&gt;**\[Random number\] Tuesday the 13th at 7:33AM**  
A man you used to have sex with.  
&gt;  
&gt;**\[Me\] Tuesday the 13th at 10:45AM**  
Sorry, I think you've got the wrong number.

I said the last bit to be polite. Whenever someone calls me and they have the wrong number, I say I think they have the wrong number. I would do the same, as shown, if anyone texted me with the wrong number. I wouldn't wanna be ghosted thinking I have the right number when I don't. 

Yesterday, I genuinely thought it was a wrong number so I told my boyfriend and he laughed because, like, what a weird way to text someone, right? We laughed about it and moved on. Then this happened today.

&gt;**\[Random number\] Thursday the 15th at 9:00AM**  
Ok \[*my real fucking name*\]  
&gt;  
&gt;**\[Me\] Thursday the 15th at 9:00AM**  
I've only ever had sex with my current boyfriend, the love of my life. I'm unsure who this is, how you got my number, or why you think we had sex, but you're wrong.

I'm genuinely afraid. They know who they're texting, but I can say with 100% certainty that they are wrong. I've only ever had sex with my boyfriend. 

And notice how 2/3 times I texted the same exact time they texted me but it's taking them forever to text back (it's currently 4:55PM).

I have a theory as to who this is but it's got a few holes: I had an online friend a few years back who I sort of had a thing with but ultimately we never became anything official or exclusive (thankfully), and stayed friends. He got a girlfriend who didn't want him to have friends that were girls so he dropped me. When I started dating my boyfriend, long story short, he ended up pointing out to me that this guy had been using me and was very disingenuous. I didn't realize at the time, but he was right, so when a few months ago he contacted me on Facebook saying something like ""me and \[girlfriend\] broke up, let's be friends again"", I said something like ""lol the audacity, never talk to me again"" and blocked him. Then his friend added me, so I blocked him too. 

This theory would make sense because my mom called the number for me (I tell her everything and needed to tell someone about this, as my boyfriend's at work right now and I'm honestly a bit afraid to tell him because again, recently I've been in a few situations where people don't believe me when I'm honest, and this is a bit of a touchy subject with my boyfriend and I) and it went to voicemail. The voicemail said ""hi, this is \[name\], I can't get back to you right now, please leave a message"" (their voicemail was full, but we wouldn't leave a message anyway so whatever). The name on the voicemail is the name of the friend I just talked about.

The holes are that I have no way to say if it's the same voice, because I don't remember that guy's voice from a few years ago and I don't recognize it in relation to anyone I know now (nor do I know anyone by that name now). Also, I looked up the number and it was a number from a city close to mine and this person lived far away from me. But they're the only person I can think of with that name who might do this. 

The name, number, and city the number's from is the only info I have, but my mom is offering to pay a service online to track the number and find out who the fuck this is. Should I do that? If so, what one is trustworthy (and preferably cheap)? This is fucked up and I don't need this going on right now. If I shouldn't do that, what *should* I do?

472,"Or is this just a story people tell others to make breakups not so hard. 

I broke up with my boyfriend and he said if I had only constantly communicated what I wanted in the relationship we would have been good. But she assumed that I would want to do certain things for her if I was crazy about her. Like make time for her, text her often, get her surprises, etc. without her having to explicitly tell me these things. He said I grew on him and he learned to like my quirks. He also said that he doesn’t totally go all in relationships at first because he doesn’t want to get hurt. I said life is short. You like someone, try to go all in with them so you don’t have regrets and don’t leave them confused. 

We have such a fun time together but he is such a fucking idiot with basic relationship stuff I broke it off so I wouldn’t get hurt anymore because I was putting in the effort for him and I felt I had to hold his hand every step of the way. He is in his thirties. And has had a super long term relationship before. ",15Nov2018,1
473,"There's this girl I like. I play with some online games on a daily basis with her for about a year and along those lines I fucked up, I was kinda drunk and by mistake while we're playing I said a below the belt joke pertaining to her and because of that incident she won't interact with me up until now.

After that incident fast forward to the month of October. Me and my group of friends went on this gaming convention in which she also went and here's the thing, because of the incident that happened between us I was preparing myself that she won't even come close to me to say hi or anything which happened. After a few days one of our common friend said to me that ""She's not mad at you already after what happened to the both of you actually she wanted to interact with you at the convention. She even asked me if she should approach you to say hi, I told her her go for it but you were kinda hard to approach and away from the group."" and by hearing that I was kinda down because I was selfish for not letting her having the chance to interact with me. From that I tried reaching out by initiating a conversation with her but we are both back to where we started. She didn't even reply to any of my messages.

So now I don't know what to do. I thought we we're cool already apparently not, I thought she wanted to approach me and now I'm the one doing it she won't even interact with me, am I the one who is being selfish or she's the one?",15Nov2018,1

475,"This is pretty embarrassing, but basically, our upstairs neighbors have very loud, bed-squealing sex several times a week. We understand that that’s what happens when you live in an apartment, so we haven’t  brought it up with them or even seen it as an issue. We just put ear plugs in to go to sleep if it’s happening. No biggie. 
However last night, my partner and I were being intimate and while I didn’t think the bed was squeaking, about 5 minutes in the upstairs neighbors started making the loudest bed-squeaking we’ve ever heard. It only lasted for a minute or so, and since it wasn’t accompanied by any of their voices (which are usually very audible during on of their sessions) I interpreted the act as being a way to shut us up (in other words, I don’t think it was a coincidence and that they were also having sex. Rather, I think someone was applying force to the bed to make noises that would let us know we were being too loud).
So I guess I sort of have two questions: since we’re on the bottom floor, would they be able to hear our bed squeaking? I thought it was a result of living underneath a bedroom and wasn’t an issue for first floor dwellers (the issue of being heard, that is). 
If it wasn’t a coincidence, what the hell am I supposed to do next? We’ve never been assholes about the situation because like I said, we know that’s just one of the sacrifices of living in an apartment. But now I’m paranoid to have sex again out of fear that our neighbors will “let us know” they can hear us, which freaks me out.

477,"Hello r/advice,

Australia, I'll try and keep this as short as possible. My Mother looks after an enables a 30 year old violent drug addict that (not surprisingly) abuses both her children in all sorts of ways. My siblings and I spoke out against my mum enabling her and letting it happen and my mum responded by disowning all of us and basically adopted the drug addict 30 year old (mum has narcissistic personality disorder so this isn't shocking). 

Anyway 4 years ago whilst the drug addict lived with our family she would constantly abuse and neglect her children so we all (excluding my mother) reported her to FACS (child protection) and FACS said they would investigate it. 4 years later and the drug addict has been to rehab twice and had her kids taken off of her then given back to her a few weeks later.

It came to my attention that one of the drug addict's children was being sexually abused and the drug addict and my mother were well aware of it yet my mother defended it because she said ""it's less traumatic to get sexually abused than it is to be taken from her mother, which is what I'm trying to prevent.""

Both my mother and the drug addict have been (and continuously are) reported to the police and FACS multiple times yet nothing is happened in the last 4 years. Who else do I turn to? What do I do in the best interest of the children? This honestly keeps me up at night.",15Nov2018,1

479,"I'm disabled, aspergers, severely visually impaired, have other mental problems, i guess people find me generally annoying at one end of the sprectrum, usually on days that i think i am doing well and engaging with them well socially, and rude on the other end where I have days that it becomes impossible for me to speak out loud and where sensory overload issues make it so I've constantly got to stick my fingers in my ears when people do gross things while eating, sneezing, burping and generally being ...well gross!

I have tried all the bad ways to meet people....apps like tinder, where all the men get mad if i say i am asexual.....

posting in the activity partner section of craigslist (did you know asking for someone to take a walk with you, or come over and crochet and watch movies is secret code for adult activities....really???)

going to local meetup groups. that have so far panned out to people getting mad i do not want to pair off and get down to some dirty business with them.

I have gone to mental health support groups and to disability support groups, i have been to singles mixers, to walking groups to craft classes....and i either meet other lonely people who are only looking for some sort of hookup, or people who just are not on the same level as me, ideally it would be someone near my age but not someone who has kids they want to drag along at every time we hang out.

I'm not really that hard to get on with....i am 37, I identify as a lesbian, but am asexual most of the time, i guess it could qualify as demi-sexual but the gift of it is i don't want to talk about the sexy stuff for a long while into knowing someone and to me this seems normal but lately i am being yelled at for how absolutely prudish that is!

I enjoy crafts such as crochet, weaving, cross stitch, plastic canvas and art journaling in various forms, paper crafts, some water color and just random things i like to try.

i enjoy music, and theatre, i like to sing, act and perform, but because of my disability being in large groups of people just does not work out for me so attempting something like that has become out of the question.  but i do play the guitar, pieno, drums, and i love listening to a lot of different types of music.

What i want to find are people i can hang out with one on one or at the most 2-3 people at once but because i can't do anything loud and need it to be quiet they always end up thinking i want them to come over and do adult things and i don't want to do that at all....

to be perfectly honest i function emotionally as a child most of the time and that doesn't mean i need taking care of, but that i would rather most conversation and activities be G rated things such as kids movies, crafts, music, walking outdoors occasionally, sometimes i like to go out and play pokemon go too!....but staying away from events with lots of people and noise, smells and flashing lights that i can't handle.

Is there any way i can safely find this type of thing?

I don’t know what to do. I’m worried about addiction and health risks mainly but am also pretty upset I don’t get a say in this, I don’t know how to convince him that it affects me too. ",15Nov2018,1
482,"Hey reddit,

I'm a 23 year old guy and I live in a house with 4 housemates. I have been with my girlfriend for about ~2 months. My house is about 2 blocks from work, so my female coworker asked me if my house had anyone in it. I said that two people recently moved out, and there are extra rooms. 

She asked to speak with the landlord. I told her that I wasn't sure if I was comfortable with her being there, because I have a girlfriend and she might take it the wrong way. This female coworker is 27 years old and is fairly attractive and social... but she also told me that she was having financial difficulty, so I gave her my landlord's number out of hesitation, not knowing what to say.

I obviously have *zero* say in whether or not she can live there, but I know that my girlfriend will be a little off-ended about a cute little blonde girl moving into a house that I advertised for her (her room will be 20 feet from mine, and we also work together, so it sounds a bit fishy)

How do I deal with this? What should I say to anyone? To the landlord? To my girlfriend? To my coworker? Is this undoable?

My landlord technically isn't my landlord... she simply collects the money *for* the landlord and lives in the house herself. She is reasonable and seems like a genuine, young person. Should I bring it up to her?",15Nov2018,1
483,"Hey guys. I posted here a few weeks ago about a guy I babysit for withholding payment. Well, he paid! Except now, I'm back to square one yet again with the same guy. This time, he owes me $120 for three days worth of babysitting. 

He has told me three times now he would pay, but has given me nothing but excuses. First, he said he'd pay on the 9th. Didn't happen. Then, he said he'd pay me Wednesday and needs me to watch his kids also. Sure. No problem. I get there, and as soon as I walk in, he says he can't pay me today but will tomorrow. 

At this point, I'm already beyond pissed off because it's now been three weeks since he's paid and I have my own bills due. My car broke down, and the money would really help me out. I somehow manage to keep my cool until yesterday. He calls me as he's supposedly withdrawing the money and claims that the ATM malfunctioned and he would take care of it tomorrow, but could only afford $100 out of the $120 he owes. 

So, I basically have no choice but to sit on my hands while I get fucked over by my bills because he can't be bothered to pay when he says he will. I'm absolutely furious and ready to put my foot down. I've decided this isn't worth my trouble, and when/if he actually pays me today, which I doubt, I'm telling him I'm no longer watching his children due to his inconsistency. 

I thought I was being helpful by not demanding payment upfront since he's a single dad, but at this point, it's obvious I'm being taken advantage of. I literally just want the money I earned so I can pay my damn electric and car insurance. 

I don't know how to ask without being pushy. I've become short with him out of the pure frustration but on the off chance he actually plans to pay I don't want to piss him off because I have zero recourse. 

I've never had to deal with something like this. I've had parents forget to pay, and they've always paid me back as early as they could and I trust them. This guy, I've watched his kids at least 12 times already, and it's never been such a long stretch. I'm wasting gas driving there and leaving with nothing.

 I just need to be paid so I can get through the month. How do I ask again without being pushy? ",15Nov2018,1

485,"I’ve been taking medication for depression and suicidal thoughts. The medication can’t do anything on the outside.
It cannot change the environment I’m under where I slowly start to lose myself more and more.
I cannot actually tell my caregivers that they’re the problem. Believe me, if I’m on drugs and still miserable, it’s them.
I’d have to kick them out of the room and talk one-on-one with the therapist if I want some change. Or... Should I just come out and say it?

I’ve always thought of myself as below other people, just... just down in the dirt broken and useless. Why concern other people with my problems?

And before you say it, sure they may ‘love’ me, but in ~15, I cannot tell them any sort of truth without wanting to be an inconvenience. Also, part of me feels like I just exist so they farm my SSI money (Disabled, Autism and other numerous things).

487,"**Backstory on our friendship:**

I'm a 16 year old girl, and she's 18. About three months ago, i moved from my home country, to the country I'm currently staying in, so i can attend beauty school.

I moved by myself, my friends and family are still in my homeland. This girl I've been talking too is one of my only friends in my school, and also in the new country I'm living in.

Sometimes we meet on the train on our way to school, and walk in together. We have added each other on Snapchat, we have streak, but I'm not on the Snapmap

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem itself:**

We were just talking like we usually do, when she mentions an app called Zenly. She said ""OMG you *need* to install this app. It's called Zenly. We can use it so we can see where we are all the time! It's also better than Snapmap, since it's more precise. This way, i can see how close to the school you are in the mornings.""

This girl is the type that plays Candy Crush, and she mentioned something about the more friends you have, the more rewards you get.

I did end up installing it, since I'm too polite to just call someone creepy. But I have this paranoia of, that someone is tracing me through my internet search history, or looking through the webcam, so asking to put a tracker on my phone is just a big no-no. Big brother scares me.

 I don't know why I'm even posting this, I don't think i ever will gather the courage to talk to her about this, but i would still like to hear your advice and opinions.

I installed a tracker on my phone, because a friend asked me to, but it kind of creeps me out.",15Nov2018,1

As I'm sitting in my dorm alone (no roommate, moved out) and watching the snow fall outside it hit me that I have literally no one to share it with. That I have shut out everyone behind this facade of I'm fine. I have been crying for almost two hours now and just need to know where to go next.

496,"To begin, I’d like to say that I don’t do drugs. I haven’t touched anything besides pot since sophomore year in high school. There was one instance where I was caught at school with My friends tiny homemade pipe because she was about to get caught but this was before I ever even smoked pot and was let off. I was a stupid 14 year old, simply put. My parents were pissed but they didn’t even bother to drug test me. This was about 10 years ago. I don’t smoke pot anymore for any reason, but even when I did, it was discretely done here and there to help manage anxiety. I never told anyone, I never used in front of anyone, and it was after I left home and started my own life with my now husband. I had very little contact with my family at that point.
Anyway, I am now a married mother of 2. I live a very clean life, I don’t even drink alcohol. Very rarely will I have a beer or a glass of wine with my husband and friends. We eat healthy, our children are well taken care of, we are typical. And I enjoy being sober, I don’t like mind altering substances. 

So here is the issue... Occasionally my grandma will say things like like “you’re very lucky nothing ever happened to (my oldest daughter) and that she developed properly.” I asked her what she meant by that and she says “using drugs while you’re pregnant can cause serious problems, honey.” 
I instantly told her “grandma, what on earth? I never used drugs while pregnant with my children. I haven’t even touched anything that would be considered a drug since high school. Where are you hearing these things!?” Apparently my mom or my sister, I’m not sure which, told her this. But neither of them have confessed. She will say things like “(your daughter) acts so much like (my highly disturbed cousin) did when she was a child.” And will hint at drugs again, Which is completely absurd. 

Yesterday I had a job interview and brought up them needing to do a background check. She asks me if I’ve ever been picked up for anything concerning drug use as if that’d be a normal thing for me. She talks about it like I’ve been using meth for fucking years or something and I can’t stand it. I told her no, there is no reason for me to have anything bad on my record and left it at that. 
These 2 examples are just the tip of the iceberg.

She gossips so much to everyone and I wonder how many of my extended family members think I’ve used hard drugs. I work very hard to preserve my little family’s clean image so when I am constantly being reminded about how my entire family probably thinks I’m a drug addict it makes me want to cut all contact and cut my losses. I really don’t know what to do anymore. Every time I tell my grandma that these rumors are false, she seems to understand but then the next time someone brings up drugs it’s like she forgets that I’m not, never was, and never will be a hard drug user. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated. ",15Nov2018,1
497,"A bit of back-story: (Apologies for the wall of text)

I’m 26 years of age and Male. I have always had a slightly strained relationship with my mother, throughout childhood I had dealt with her alcoholism silently, and other things that I do not wish to divulge. 

My mother and I used to run our own successful business together - it was in this establishment she met and fell for her partner. He was abusive (physically &amp; mentally), addicted to Class A illegal drugs, and he would abuse alcohol. He caused a breakdown in relationship between myself and my mother; around 5 years ago he attacked me, viciously, with a deadly weapon. My mom begged and pleaded with me to forgive him, for her sake and for me to not take it further. I slowly but surely allowed time to be my healing factor, and lied to most people I know about my scars (including my Dad - which I feel terrible for).
18 months ago my mom had called me to go to where she lived, as he was abusing her. I arrived, and he was drugged up, full of aggression, and made it clear that he had a knife on his person. 
I’m not ashamed to say I ran, ran back to my car so that I could phone the police. He followed me out to where my car was parked with the weapon on show - my fiancée, who was pregnant (we didn’t know), jumped out of my car and jumped in between myself and him. He hit her with a small flick knife that was placed in his knuckles. She suffered minor injuries, with the paramedic explaining she was a centimetre away from being blinded, the police were called and criminal proceedings followed. 
He was subsequently bailed, and spent the flowing days harassing and hounding my mother, she refused time and time again to report his behaviour to the authorities. She promised me that this time she would leave him for good, but lo and behold, a week later she was seeing him in secret and their relationship continued.
Her actions pushed me over the edge, I flipped, walked out of the business that we ran and cut all contact effective immediately - we hadn’t spoken for just over a year and the court case is still pending. This morning I received a phone call from her sister, informing me that he had taken his own life - that my mom had left their apartment overnight and gone to work, and when she returned on the morning there he was - on the stairs, hanging. He had used a piece of her clothing. My mom is completely heartbroken. I get the sense that she will now want to be a part of mine, my fiancé’s and my 7 month old son’s lives. 
I do not mind if I am labelled cold or heartless, but I do not want her to be a part of my son’s life - I love him with all my heart and would lay my life down to protect him. People tell me I should be happy that he has died - but I have no feeling. It’s not sadness, it’s not happiness, it’s just nothing.",15Nov2018,1
498,"My boyfriend is going to be 20 and I'm quite surprised how little he was exposed to different types of foods growing up. His parents were both working full time (his dad 12 hour shifts, his mom full time but still home with him and his brothers)  didn't make home cooked meals except during Christmas, but that's about it, so therefore him and his brothers grew up on microwaveable meals or chicken tenders, a lot of chicken actually. My boyfriend doesn't know how to cook either. I went shopping with my boyfriend once and he bought frozen chicken wings, chicken breasts, breaded chicken breasts, and chicken lunch meat. I'm not sure how he's survived this long. Anyhow just to show how little he was exposed to different foods growing up 

*He has never ate an actual blackberry, only had blackberry flavored things

*Never had cantulope

*The last time he had watermelon was 13 years ago 

*He's never had squash or zucchini (which is actually crazy because the state we live in these things are cheap and abundant in the summer) 

*I asked him when was the last time he ate vegetables and he said it was a few years because he's been living off microwave meals. And it's not like his family was poor, they were smack dab in the middle class, I'm guessing they just didn't feel like cooking.
  
I told him I wanted him and I to start cooking together since we now live together. I wanna know what things I could introduce him to the only problem is that he's picky about certain things. He doesn't really like fruits (what fruits he tried), isn't very keen on vegetables, does not like mashed potatoes, is okay with cheese but can only stand a certain amount of it (there are exceptions like lasagna or beefaroni), likes to have meat in every meal which hey I'm not complaining but if I eat meat multiple days in a row I get bloated, gassy, and constipated so i limit it quite a bit for myself.

I'm a very introverted person and only have a few friends, which wasn't always a problem but lately I don't feel like I can depend on the anymore. They don't really seem to care or understand my situation. I'm at university for around a year now (I also moved to the city of the university) and I have maybe 3-4 people i KNOW, not even talking about hanging out a lot just people I know. I always had problems with social interactions and all that but I hoped/thought that things would get better but I don't seem to find any person I might be interested in having as a friend or even more. It's not like I just don't like people but I have problems actually getting in contact with someone and even when I talk to someone in a class it's just a conversation of a few minutes and I will never see that person again. I think a huge part of my problem is my low self esteem. I was bullied a few years in high school and I don't think I ever really recovered from feeling worthless. I'm also kinda ugly. I'm not fat or anything but I am very pale and have dark hair and not the best skin. My biggest problem are my teeth. When I was little I didn't really take brushing my teeth to serious and now I suffer the consequences. I can't even smile in pictures or at people because all I can think about is that everyone will judge me for my teeth. Thats part of the problem why I don't really talk to girls because no one wants to get to know somebody that, well looks like me. 

I honestly have a lot of other problems like my ex girlfriend, my current situation at the university and all that but I'm not here for advice on that. I just needed to get this out and possibly get some help. I'm very sorry if this wasn't very informative or didn't fit the subreddit. ",15Nov2018,1

my roommates friend (were gonna call her D) is only close with ONE of my roommates (let's call her T) and not the other (whom we will call K). Me and K have always been best friends and done everything together, but this fall she went away for 2 weeks and while she did my roommate T and me were alone. During this time I found out that T had been doing heroine in the house all summer while I had been gone and K had been fine with it. T brought over her friend, D after her boyfriend overdosed and died, and she had nowhere to go . During this time they were both doing heroine in my house on my couch for 10 days. Until I put my foot down and said no more so T asked her to leave which was a big deal and I got some passive aggressive backlash from that but they were telling me they weren't doing heroine in the house when i was clearly finding needles and burnt tinfoil to smoke out of in our bathroom, foyer and couch. me asking D to leave was essentially me vs T and everyone around me was calling me crazy because;

 a) i smoke weed so how could i judge someone for doing heroine 

b) her boyfriend just died so i should be compAsSIONaTe 

c) we all pay rent here so i cant just make a rule without everyone contributing to it

but its not like I want to paint the living room purple, or make a no noise after 10pm rule... i just want this girl to stop doing drugs in our house

Last night it kinda came to a boil when D was in the bathroom for roughly an hour- I had to pee, K had to shower and T was just brushing it off like people are normally in the bathroom for an hour without using the shower or toilet or sink once? (and just sniffling the entire time and banging the counter) and when i accused D of using our bathroom to do drugs in, K started accusing me of being hypocritical because i smoke weed and my bf hangs out at the house...i got so upset that i just left and went for a walk.

when I came back they were all sitting in the living room talking about me and how crazy i am, how neurotic and I think i can just tell people what to do... when they heard me come in they summoned me to them and said we should all talk and i should take a seat. I told them i didn't want to talk and honestly i was so upset and felt so ambushed i don't even remember the rest of what I said, mostly just brushing them off and went into my room.

Later T came into my room to tell me she wasn't mad at me, and wanted to know if i had proof.. I told her i didn't care if she was mad and that no i didn't have any specific  proof but that i didn't believe a word that came out of D or T's mouth and that i felt lied to and gaslighted. she just kinda backed away and kept saying Oh well...

I feel like I'm crazy and totally alone living in this house... can someone please make me feel like I'm not a bad person for asking this?

I've tried bluffing to call the cops, ive tried asking/ telling T  to stop but she just lies to me, ive tried talking to K and she just defends it and i cant move out because im actually the only one out of the three of us that has been paying rent on time and my landlord will boot us all if i go

505," General overview: Working in a company for 2.5 years, senior role- Dont want to work mandatory overtime for free - gets yelled at for 40 mins  


This happened yesterday.

My boss, i believe is pretty phychopathic and is all 'door is always open - i want to be your friend!' then, when anything happends or is said or even he feels you are getting too comfortable with him, he snaps and is all ' i'm the MD you cant speak to me like im your friend!)

I'm 25 F - i speak my mind and dont mind calling a spade a spade but after the shock of last night.. I'm in two minds. One half of my brain is ""maybe you are wrong, what makes you so special - people have worse jobs - count your blessings - maybe you are out of line here"" Then the other side is saying ""Fuuuck no! He is MANIPULATING you!! It's so obviou, you cant fall for this bullshit! If ANYONE you knew was in this position, hearing these words, you wouldn't stand for it for a second! Fuck. This. shit.""

So yesterday work came on my desk at 17:00 (im off at half) I expressed (as i have done for the past year as I have worked overtime for 1.5 years nearly everyday and had to commute by train 2hr avg a day up AND back) My boss pput me up in a hotel on a few occasions just, but just so i could get in early - did i mention that the hotels were so dirty and derelict that it made me break down (to be fair ive silently suffered depression for some time.)

Anyway, My manager brought me into the boss becasue he was sick of this conversation and the boss just shouted at me (at times with tears in his eyes) for 40 mins - I expressed my annoyance at being asked to work late/ overtime with no extra pay or compensation, time in lieu or what have you. He immediately stood up and was like ""are you fucking serious"" etc. (detailed in notes below).

He started shouting then for sometime, repeating points, exasperated questions and pulling up ""brownie points cards"". I felt in the moment that primal part of my brain kick in, the one that tells you that there could be a fight. It just felt like such a threatening situation. He was just shouting without me able to get words in properly, I was able to remark on his comments as he said them as calmly as I could without getting too emotional. It felt like i was being just picked on really. Like the floor fell out from beneath me. I had to tell myself in the moment that I was perfectly in my right to say this, this has been brought up before by me, it has gotten a lot better but It got better previously and I was content it got worse. (you give an inch they take a mile sort of thing)

I think he could tell that him standing and screaming made me uncomfortable so he sat down for the rest of it.

He had a small amount of content but kept repeating himself over and over, in a hysteric stream of shouts, where i could only get one word remarks( correcting incorrect comments and exaggerated points). Eventually i could do nothing but stand there and take it.

I have a rough transcript of what was said and I'm planning on writing an email (with the help of my dad, HR sister and lawer bro) to apologise for making him upset but also reiterate my points mentioned about not wanting to work late for free.

He kept bringing up that other people do it , that im not a team player then, how dare i and i should reassess all of this. That he knows all of the MDs and CEOs in the city and the'yll all tell you and that everyone works late its the (arch and design industry) .

What so i do, am i wrong? I dont mind working overtime to get a job done on time, especially if ive been working it. But i draw the line of being told last minute and that its mandatory!

The shouting was so threatening and making me stay feel like im just trapped. (I, like a lot at the mo am battling everyday with serious depression and anxiety silently and like this is just fucking with my brain - i feel like im going mad!)\~

I was in such a state of shock after that, while waiting til 19:30 for the job to come in to me, I found myself working and on different social websites and not remembering how i got on them, i was so out of it. I dont know. I've been over thinking this, would appreciate advice!

**TLDR;My boss makes me work overtime, last minute for free. He shouted at me for 40 mins when i tried to express that its not my problem and he cant do that to me without paying me more or compensating time back to me. he wants his cake and wants to eat it too. Help!**",15Nov2018,1
506,"I’m in senior year of high school and I typically hang out with around 10 ppl everyday (at lunch, in class). Recently (for the past three months) Ive found myself growing more and more tired/annoyed with them. I feel like I can’t really be myself without getting judged or made fun of. they make references and jokes I don’t understand and I constantly feel like I have to put on some fake personality to fit in with them. Don’t get me wrong, i don’t hate any of them and sometimes we do have fun but i don’t think we’re clicking anymore at least not like we did freshmen and sophomore year. I never know what to say anymore w them and idk I’m just tired of hanging out with them. My problem is that since it’s the last year of high school everyone has already been divided in their groups and it’s really hard to hang out or make friends with new people. Should I just stick it out and continue to hang out with them (even if I don’t enjoy myself 70% of the time)? I don’t want to be alone but I just feel a big shift that happened in my friendship with them. ",15Nov2018,1

508,"I have lower back pain, I can’t remember what the doctor called it but it’s common with a lot of viral infections.
I also have;
Sore throat/super stiff neck.
Extreme body aches- it hurts to pretty much move.
Hot flashes.
Chills.
Severe fatigue.
Nausea.
Loss of appetite.
Night sweats like a mother fucker. 
Not sure if it’s a headache or a migraine but I’m pretty sure it’s more of a headache because migraines are a little more intense. But it’s made me extremely sensitive to light but mostly sounds. I had a toddler and if she makes a streak of joy or even cries it makes it feel like my whole head is going to explode.

I’m only listing the symptoms because if it is something viral they’re pretty much not gonna do anything about it because there’s not much they can do. So I just want to know if anyone has any advice on anything I could do to alleviate any of these symptoms. 
I appreciate anything and everything.",15Nov2018,1

510,"I’m seventeen and still in high school, my friends are going through the rebellious stage which I get is completely normal, but they are taking it way too far. They smoke, drink, and repeat as if it were some kind of game. I’ve tried telling them that it’s extremely bad for their development but they don’t care since they use the excuse I’m going to die anyway. Of course they don’t have suicidal tendencies, but sometimes I wonder if they do. They are also the type of friends that don’t like to open up, so it’s really hard for me to try and help or listen to them. I had been through some obstacles and I worked really hard to get where I am mentally, yet my friends are the opposite. They don’t care about their mental health whatsoever and joke about it all the time. Idk where I’m going with this, but I just wanted to ask if I should stick around since they are my best friends or should I find new ones since clearly we don’t see things the same way. Also I wonder how do people find happiness? I am still just a kid but I want to find it as soon as possible. ",15Nov2018,1

Peers, co workers, family, yet i feel lonely. I feel like i won’t have ever have close connection with someone. I feel like nobody will like me, even though good co workers/friends tell me

512,"There’s this guy I want to befriend in university. We only have English together on Fridays, so that’s why I’m writing this now.

He’s closed off like me, so that’s what made me notice him. I’m really closed off (and socially anxious) as well. He always sits in the corner of the room by himself. And that part of the room is empty for the most part. But, I gathered the courage last Friday to go up to him and asked him if I could sit next to him. I wanted to introduce myself and get to know him, but the teacher came in and we had to move to another part of the room and start working on our assignments. That was partly my fault because I had 15 minutes to go up to him, but I only did it like a minute before class because I got anxious.

Would it be weird if I sat next to him again tomorrow? He didn’t really say anything during the lesson, so he’s really closed off and introverted I guess. If so, how should I approach him? I mean, he definitely remembers me, but I don’t know if I’d be pushing it.....",15Nov2018,1
513,"I had something from eBay shipped to a place I used to live in, but now rent out to tenants. I don't have direct contact with the tenants or the property manager.   
The item itself is now currently in transit to their address - I didn't have luck intercepting it at the post office. Should I

1. Use the keys I have to check their mailbox sporadically
2. Leave a note asking them to return the item to sender (the item is not valuable and I didn't pay for shipping so I don't care about this)
3. Leave a note asking for me to pick it up
4. Do nothing and hope they just return to sender or throw it out.

I am a bit avoidant so I don't want to actually talk to them, and I also really don't want them to open my mail. I would even leave a note asking them to just throw it out, if that didn't seem like bizarre behaviour and would probably result in them opening it.",15Nov2018,1

In the past friends have come about from work environments, even then it took a while before I found people I could get on with, it's normal for me to be completely isolated even in busy work environments - I don't suffer social anxiety per say, certainly no I'm antisocial and I'd not consider myself an introvert, I just honestly don't know how to make friends.",15Nov2018,1
515,"So a quick background; I'm 17 and a junior in high school. My girlfriend, who just recently turned 18, graduated last year. We'd been dating for about a year at the time. She told me she was moving about a month before she actually did move. She was moving because she wanted to go to school in Minnesota, and her family decided it would be best if they moved out there. Now, I realize that it wasn't totally her fault for moving, but it's like she doesn't understand the stress and pressure that it puts on me. It's been almost 3 months since she moved, and I still don't know how to deal with it. Every time I try to bring up the fact that this is slowly tearing me apart emotionally, she tries to get me to think about how it'll pay off in the future, or that she can visit me in the summer. I don't know about you guys, but seeing your significant other 3 times a year doesn't really sound like a fun option to me. I have a lot of problems with overthinking; I've done it since I was a kid, and I still do it. Something with issues about my past and how I was treated in comparison to others is really what caused it, I won't go into specifics. Now here's the kicker; her and I were supposed to see each other in the Spring, and she just told me about an hour ago that she was offered to study abroad during Spring. I asked her if she would take it, and she said she wants to, but money is a problem. I then told her it didn't make me happy that she was leaving, and then asked her if the money was the only reason she didn't accept it; she told me that the fact that she can't afford it right now is the only reason. She said this has always been a dream of hers, to study abroad, and if I'm being perfectly honest I'm not handling it too well. My hands have been shaking and still are at the time I'm writing this post. I really don't know what to do; i don't WANT to break up with her, but I can't keep living like this. I can't spend the next 4+ years knowing that this is how it'll be for all of them. It's like I've hit rock bottom but I just keep falling.",15Nov2018,1
516,"About a few weeks ago, I got this crush on this girl during my lunch period. I did something I've never done before... I spoke to her. Pretty impressive, right? After I spoke to her, I never really spoke with her again. However, I did notice that she was looking at me a lot more often. We've made eye contact WAY too much the past few weeks, and I told my friends about it and they encouraged me to go talk with her again. They kept telling me that chances are she wants me to go talk to her again. So I just did that today... and wow. It went horribly.

When I approached her she was looking down at her phone, and I said her name as like a question, in a way where I was saying it to confirm with her that its her name (if that makes any sense, its hard to put it into words). Immediately within like 0.2 nanoseconds I got this weird vibe. Something didn't feel right. I then asked how she has been. She looked extremely nervous, and looked like she didn't want to be in this conversation. When she said that she was doing good, I made sure to just cut the conversation short and that was it.

In the end, I'm more relieved than upset. Sure I would've been ecstatic if this went somewhere, but I'm also really confused. What did I interpret wrong?",15Nov2018,1

519,"Hey everyone. I know this should be an easy talk with my parents but it isn’t. I’ve Wrestled my whole life and I’m 15 now and wrestle in the state of Ohio. I’m a freshman on a high school wrestling team who is ranked 25th in the whole country. Not trying to sound cocky, but I am a very, very good wrestler, taking 2nd in the state once and beating nationally ranked wrestlers at Virgina Beach Nationals. 
     Anyways, this sport takes up 7 days a week of my life and I just don’t love it anymore. Our practices are insane, 2.5 hours of hard intense conditioning and drilling. While I could get through it the rest of my career, I just done love the sport. The only thing keeping me wrestling is the fact that I love winning.
    In about an hour when my dad gets home I’m telling him I’m done. My dad has anger issues and he will probably cuss me out and say that I’m not going to quit (he loves watching me and the sport). I’m scared but need to be honest.
     If I quit, I can focus on my studies more. As of right now I have a 4.091 GPA and have other passions. I want to be able to hangout with friends, I love ping pong and plan on joining the ping pong club if I quit wrestling, and just want to relax. Everyday I dread the thought of going to practice and it’s making me stressed. I know I’m throwing away possibly a full ride to a college but I can get a lot of my college payed for with Academics alone.

Now while I can pay for a new set of tires when I get paid Tuesday, I still got two (three if you count Tuesday itself) days I have to make it to work. Its abouts a 14, 15 minute drive there, maybe longer due to the snow and ice storm we just had.

525,"Hey guys. I will try my best to keep this as short as possible but basically, one of my ""close"" friends ghosted me for a month as I tried to reach out to them regarding a promise they made me.

I lost my job about 5 weeks ago and I was upset but felt like this could be a chance for me to start over and do something I care about. I reached out to my friend that I have known for years and runs a music business (something I'm very passionate about) and after a night of chatting, I proposed to him the idea of me working in his business without a salary for a few months to see if it's a good fit.

What followed next exceeded all my expectations as he offered to make me a part of a new business he is starting that raised an obscene amount of money. After literally 7 hours of going through the business plans and details, I was in awe but had my wits about me. I asked him if he was offering me the role out of pity which he immediately denied and went on to explain how he sees my experience invaluable to his plan and that he wanted to talk to me about it anyway even if I hadn't approached him. The night ended with me almost in tears, grateful for the opportunity while he ended our meeting by saying ""everything happens for a reason""

We had agreed to meet twice a week to discuss more details as we get closer to the launch date of the business and had agreed to meet the following Monday. 

Monday comes and I call twice before he returns my call that night and asks to reschedule to Tuesday. I of course don't mind and agree to meet the next day. That unfortunately was the last time he responded to me. What followed was basically me calling him two or three times a day for two weeks without a single response in anyway from him. My sadness over the situation eventually turned to anger and disappointment so I sent him a message saying literally the following ""Its really upsetting that you won't return my calls or even take a single minute out to message me back"" and decided I was done trying to reach out to him and tried to put it all behind me.

While this was happening, I reached out to a common friend only to find out he and my other friend talk and meet still. He offered to ask him why he isn't responding to me, which I initially declined. Finally, I asked him to help me understand what was going on and this is the part that I genuinely do not understand. My friend who is ghosting me explained he is avoiding me because I ""spammed"" him with calls, offering to show him the call history. He was also very ""angry"" at the message I sent him and claimed that I was being dramatic and overly sensetive so he decided to ""leave me alone""

I had already decided I wasn't going to talk to him anymore until our common friend calls me and says that the friend who is ghosting me wants to meet and makeup. He said that we both have the right to be angry as we have different point of views. As of now, I have refused this meeting simply based on the fact that he didn't even try to call me and invite me personally since that qualifies as ""negative stress""

Am I over reacting to all of this or should I be seeking to make amends and hold on to a friendship and a dream job?",15Nov2018,1
526,"Hello,

I am in my mid-20s, and my girlfriend of 5 years is living abroad in another country as of a year ago for her job. We intend on marrying but the struggle of a long distance relationship is definitely causing some problems. 

Because I have minimal responsibilities, we spoke about me leaving my current job and going to be with her for a few months and try to get a job there. I’ve never lived away from my own city, so this would be a big move. I’m financially able to support myself for a while without a job and wouldn’t have rent since she’d be paying for it. Furthermore, I’ve never lived abroad and experienced a new lifestyle, so I think it would be good for me - but - I wouldn’t have a job at least for a bit (potentially 3 months).  But isn’t now the time to do this kind of thing in my life?

The kicker, is that I was just offered another job that pays quite a bit more. It’s also closer to the field I’d like to be in. Now, I’m completely lost as to what I should do. If I do this job, I’ll further jeopardize my relationship and not be with her and not get the experience of living abroad. I’m also young still, so do I want to do this? If I decide to turn it down, is that irresponsible and I’ll regret it? Am I sacrificing too much by turning this role down? I really don’t know. 

Can anyone offer any advice? Maybe you have personal experience? I can answer any questions anyone may have if they want. 

Thank you very much",15Nov2018,1
