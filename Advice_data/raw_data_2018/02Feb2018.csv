0,"I loved my mom unconditionally. She was my best friend and mentor. She is one of the reasons I fell in love with my profession and guided me through my fears of being a parent and an adult. With that said, she's gone and I don't feel like anything I take from her will ever replace what I've lost. I do feel protective over her things, but I have no desire to own the stuff. My siblings are worried I'll regret this later and now I kinda have that fear as well. I have taken a few trinkets (medals I earned in the military and gave to her, things my son has made for her, photos of her and my dad, etc etc,) but nothing like furniture, jewelry, or anything of value which they have chosen to taken.

Are they right? Am I going to regret this later? It's still hard for me to even go through the things and I can't even go through the photos without choking up, so I'm afraid that the grief may be affecting my decision.",02Feb2018,3

4,ok i haven’t read the rules or anything but i’m really freaked out idk what to do. so the story is that me and my friends (three of us) were sitting at the benches on our school campus after hours and we were dumb and decided to smash 2 glass bottles on ground (it shattered) and as we were walking away a school counselor ran towards us and demanded to get our names and took pictures of us on his cellphone. we got scared so we went back and cleaned up all the glass with our bare hands. i CANT get in trouble with my parents and i’m scared what do you think will happen ? will i get detention or something? we cleaned up all the glass and did we break any specific rules ? we cleaned it up so will they pretend like nothing ever happened or would it get put on a record ? thank you so much i’m on mobile and freaking out sorry if my grammar isn’t perfect ,02Feb2018,4
5,"All right, so I have some dilemmas I need help working out. Over the last year, I've lost about 70 lbs. I'm 5'11"", and currently weight 200 lbs., so I still have some fat to lose, along with some loose skin to tighten up. I also want to start putting on muscle. 

The aspect of all of that that throws me for a loop is dieting. As somebody who spent his entire childhood overweight and not caring what I ate, nutrition just overwhelms me completely. I've spent a lot of time on google looking for answers, but I've found a lot of conflicting answers (even though I guess this is the same idea). I'm just looking for somebody who can get me started on the right track, or at least point me to a place that can. 

I understand that everybody's body is different, so trial and error, at least to a degree, is inherent to this process. my main questions are: 1) How much should I be eating, or how could find that out? 2) How should I go about keeping track of all that? 3) Is there a way to go about this relatively inexpensively?  4) What are some general guidelines to follow?

I know that these things should be considered a new lifestyle, and not just something I do to get in shape. I hope what I'm asking is clear. Maybe I'm just asking for too much about something so broad? I just don't want to waste time and not make results because i'm doing something blatantly incorrectly. Maybe I'm overthinking this, but that's just what I do. I'd really appreciate some advice on the subject. Thanks!",02Feb2018,4

15,"Hello, people of Reddit. I'm a Malaysian currently awaiting results for my national examination results called SPM, which is similar to O-levels.

I'd like to pursue my tertiary education in the US (specifically Oklahoma State University, I'll talk more about it below), however finances are a big issue for me as my mother is the only source of income and earns just enough for my family of six to get by. My grades are quite okay with an estimated 3.5 GPA based on my previous examination (we use a different grading system, hence my uncertainty). I'm a state level tennis player and I've had a few national achievements throughout the years I've been playing. I plan to start doing art commissions soon to earn some pocket money. I aspire to be a game character designer or an illustrator, but most careers regarding visual art is fine by me.

As I stated above, I've been thinking of continuing my studies at Oklahoma State University to earn a degree related to Visual Arts. I am also interested in English and Physiology but that's not my main focus. Still, I'm open to the idea of pursuing degrees out of my desired range. Back to OSU, the cost of attendance for an international student is roughly USD44k a year (times four in my currency). Tuition fees are 23k while the rest are room and board, textbooks and other miscellaneous spendings. The maximum scholarship amount I can receive by the university is 10k a year for four years. There are other departmental scholarships in which I will be eligible for only if I apply to OSU. I can also take out a loan through a co-signer but I'd prefer not to go through the hassle and burden if possible.That being said, I still am open to other options of getting a degree in the US, for example attending community college first or studying at another (preferably budget-friendly) university. What are ways that I can achieve what I want and at the same time make sure that I won't put a huge burden on my family, as well as myself?h

Another thing I'm torn about is that is it worth it/practical to major in the visual art department? Or would I be better off with liberal studies or sciences instead?

Thank you very much for your attentiveness if you read through this entire post. If there's anything that requires further elaboration, please do tell me about it and would be more happy than willing to explain/fill in the details. Please feel free to recommend anything, share your opinion or advise me regarding this topic!

I can understand why I don't trust any of my classmates bc in the past when I was more open about stuff to them and they have betrayed my trust by telling other people without asking me if its ok or not. I never have done this to anyone ever bc I know how frustrating it is to be stiffed up like that.

25,"I'm having issues with a coworker who obviously has some kind of fixation on me. I do not know much about him, aside from the fact that he is probably in his late thirties or early forties.
There are several reasons why I do not date. I also refrain from casual sex. I don't even ""sext"" online with strangers. This isn't anything I tell others in person, but I have serious psychological problems that seem to really debilitate me when sex or romance become involved. Also, I'm very unhappy with where I am in my life. I am on a 3-year deferral (from a very good law school that I will not name), but no one knows this because I didn't want it interfering with job prospects in my city.


The coworker jogs or walks around the office and I walk from my apartment, which is close by. He does not know where my apartment is, although he is always offering me rides to work and back. I firmly say ""No"" each time. He has followed me home or has asked me if he may join me for part of the way. It's part of his ""workout"" routine.


I was hoping he would understand that while I'm all for being cordial, I joke and have conversations with most people at work, mainly in an effort to ""practice"" social skills and not get in trouble, like I did at my previous job. My laughing at his jokes and saying ""Hi"" doesn't mean anything. I've caught him staring at me several times and he often giggles and blushed when I walk past his cubicle. He frequently wanders into my cubicle in the mornings and gets so close that I can smell his perspiration.


In December he got me some stocking stuffers and gave me his phone number. I lied about spending Christmas with some people when he asked me if I would like to spend Christmas at his place. He told me to call him after spending time with ""some people"" and said he wanted to take me out to lunch. I threw away his number and I never stored it in my phone.


Yesterday, he walked with me for part of the way home. I tried to drop hints that I'm not interested. We talked about coworkers I thought were funny. They're dudes. He immediately bad mouthed them and told me they were weird and incompetent. He likes to talk about how he is the most competent employee in his department. We talked about coworkers who were having an affair and how our office has a ""no sexual relations"" policy. He awkwardly said ""I don't agree with it."" I said, I don't think it's a good idea to date or have sex with your coworkers."" He said, ""Maybe you'll change your mind."" Then he told me ""We need to go out for drinks to celebrate your promotion."" I told him I'd rather not. He kept pressing the issue and then I parted ways with him.


Today he was acting very strange. He made my coworker in the cubicle next to me very uncomfortable. He was loudly attempting to flirt with her in hopes that it would catch my attention. He stopped me down the hallway and thanked me for walking with him yesterday because I made him ""feel safe."" He would noticeably stare at me and then abruptly turn away when he caught me catching him. I chatted with a coworker who sits near his cubicle. I saw him look at us and then pound his metal cabinet with his fist. He shook his head for a while and glared at me after I was done chatting. Yes, he keeps a fedora in his cubicle space. I'm not lying.


I don't want to report this to HR but I'm getting tired of people who don't understand that I'm not interested and that they don't need a reason for my lack of interest. How do I establish that I'm not interested and never will be?

35,"""Hi there.

I'm looking for advice on how to support someone.

My best friend, Serena, is 14. She's an amazing person and I love her to death. She was walking from our school to her dance studio which is only about a mile away. Right outside of the school, a silver car was parked. There is an elementary school directly across from our school, and a middle school a few miles north. The car had tinted windows and she didn't think anyone was inside. She walked by it, and accidentally hit the mirror. The door opened and she apologized, and an older man asked her if she needed a ride. She declined and continued walking, but he grabbed her wrist and bag and tried to force her into the car. She kicked his knee and ran. A police report was filed, and they're trying to find him.

I want to know how I can support her. She said she doesn't wanna talk to anyone, and I understand that. I just want to know what I can do to make sure she understands I'm here for her.

Do I talk about random things to keep her mind occupied? Do I push her? Do I leave her alone completely?

I wanna do something that would actually help her.

Thank you.""

55,"This is going to be a wall. I apologise.

Some backstory: homeschooled until I was dropped, clueless, into high school (all while being raised in a cult with divorcing parents). I'm a little fucked in the head, but everyone has their shit. Graduated high school and an now on a whirlwind tour of ""getting the fuck away where I was born an raised.""

So that said, I'm basically about to go insane. I'm trying to run away from everything at home but it feels like it's following me. Back there I didn't have a lot of friends, the few that I did were girls. I ended up pigeon-holeing myself as ""the straight gay friend"" for a variety of reasons. I'm trying to get away from that.

Trouble is, I realized that has literally become my identity. I am mentally and physically exhausted 24/7, so I do very few things as hobbies. I'm traveling right now, so that's sort of taken on that role but still. I'm easy-going, trustworthy, and comfortable and also rather reserved. I know I put myself into that position by who I am, but I have no idea how to even start changing that. It is, simply put, the person that I am.

I'm also rather socially... Inept? I act like a 40 year old married dude, basically on account of that whole upbringing thing. I try to let that go, but it's not that easy. It's very difficult not to define myself by my mental fuckedupness because there's honestly not a whole lot else that defines me. There really isn't a lot to me. Even the things that are remotely interesting about me aren't really that interesting to other people.

I don't like to bring this up, but fuck I might actually be suicidal. Short of going on a coke binge for literally the rest of my life I cannot see any way to make things better. I'm just tired of being tired.

So that leaves me on an island in the Caribbean, exhausted physically and mentally despite literally having done nothing but rest for the last week. No need for a lawyer, already exercise, and purged social media (not that I ever used it much). So basically, how do I fix this? I am completely and utterly clueless.

ok so i basically got invited to two birthday dinners. one was my friend d’s and i’ve known him for years. he’s one of my really good friends and i hadn’t seen him in months. the other dinner was my “friend” k’s and i’ve only known her for four months. she’s always been a bit rude to me and uses me. anyways, i decided to go to d’s party and told k that i couldn’t make it due to “family plans”. d posted a group picture of us all at his dinner on social media and k saw it. she blew up and called me a “backstabbing douchebag” and told me to “never f***ing contact” her again. so i’m fine with not being friends with her as she was toxic anyways, but we have a whole friend group. everyone says they’re not picking sides and that if they were then it would be mine, but they all have fun times with her and she goes out of her way sometimes to make me feel like a loner. i deal with depression and severe anxiety and i don’t really know how to cope with my feelings, especially because i’m already bullied and pretty lonely. what should i do? my friends all tell me they love me and they’re always here for me, but at the same time they say that they hate k but still hang out with her.",02Feb2018,1

63,"I am 15 and this all started because I have ADHD and wanted some Vyvanse to help focus on school during exams. My step-dad is a doctor so I asked him if I could schedule an appointment at his office with another doctor. I went to the doctor, got a prescription for 30 Vyvanse, and went to the pharmacy next door to fill my prescription. Later that night I opened up the bottle and it didn't seem to be full, so I counted the pills and it turns out there was 20 instead of 30, I didn't think much of it and let my mom know.

A couple days later my step-dad found out about the 10 that were missing from the bottle, and he thinks that I sold them or gave them away to my friends (I didn't). Becuase of my past experiences as a teenager who has been caught by my parents smoking and selling weed/vapes along with drinking alcohol with friends, They find it hard to believe I had nothing to do with the missing pills, even though I have been honest about everything else, and I swear on my life I had nothing to do with the missing pills

My step-dad said I will be grounded until I tell him the names of the people I have sold the pills to, which was a problem since I had nothing to do with them.

My parents are now treating me like garbage, calling me a failure of a son, taking away everything they can from me, and they might send me to live with my real dad or even send me to boarding school. (I don't want to live with my real dad because that would mean losing all my friends and relationships)

As a stupid teenager I have thought about running away, but obviously, that will do nothing to help me in the long run.

What can I do to regain my parent's trust?

So I’ve been trying think of things that I hope can replace friendship/human companionship in general. I’ve tried books, TV, Netflix, but they all just end up making me even more lonely.

66,"Hey there just trying to find some advice any would be helpful.
So, the thing is I am 20 yrs. Old, dropped out of college and just started this factory job, and been working there for 4 months now. I like it but started to dislike it because there is no one my age working there. I only hang out with one person an hour once a day for a week for gym and out of that is like twice a month for shoe releases which is the only thing we really have in common. I kind of feel he is “friend” I really don't know what a friend is since ever since childhood I have been moving to some new city every three years so people rarely keep in touch with you after you move. The reason I am asking for advice is that today after gym we started talking and then he tells me that next year he is going to go to NIU and live over there. Then it hits me that the person I only really hang out with is going to leave and I am going to be by myself. After that I started thinking how all the people I know are going to college or university going forward in life and I am still here stuck in this job.
Adding more info on my life I am the second oldest of four, older brother lives in Mexico because my parents crossed illegally. 20 yrs. later my dad gets his permanent residence card and is able to work without worry of getting deported and now we’re working on my mother for her to get her papers. Since I am the oldest here in the U.S. I had a lot of responsibilities as the oldest usually has. Fast forward I hit 17, started working part-time and going to HS, felt it was easy. I am 18, graduate, below average grades, real low GPA, and start working full-time at factory jobs and full-time college student gets harder but still into it. I am 19 dropped out of college could not handle the stress so I stuck to working factory jobs and quitting or got fired from a couple throughout the year. I am 20 years old now worked in one job for 7 months and then quit for a higher paying job which is where I work right now.
So, as I was saying I am thinking of what I should do career wise as I don’t really have anything I am particularly interested in and I really want to go back to school to interact with people my own age.   I just want to be able to get a field of study going to have a career and not work at a dead end job going nowhere.

68,"Hey guys,

First time here, so hopefully I've followed the rules and this is the right place for a bit of help.

Bit of backstory about the roommate:

- Broke up with his gf of less than a year because she disclosed something personal which happened to her in her teens, and he felt as though he was the victim somehow, and cried like a bitch for a week after. 

- In the week of crying, said weird things from literally out of nowhere like ""Maybe you are more of a man than me"", or ""I thought I was good with women but you are the master"" 
[Side-note, I know that seems almost like some sort of brag on my part, it's really not I promise you, &amp; he literally said that dumb shit]

- After the crying was over, he claimed how he was glad to be single and back to his ""playboy ways"", so he downloaded tinder of all things... went on 3 dates in 2 weeks and only one of the girls was interested, and her English wasn't great so there's no way she would be able to weed out the weirdo in him.

- After fucking the first time with her [ I left the apartment and came back 2 hours later... only THEN did he decide to go to the bedroom with her. Anyway there was no noise, which is what it is...but the next day he came with the fake ego bullshit again
""I think I might have to write a letter to trojan because I split 4 condoms last night""
My response: ""Maybe you should have turned her on and actually got her wet before tryna fuck her then...Smh""

- About a week goes by and her visa is up so she's gone back to her home country &amp; he has now bought a plane ticket to go visit for a week (they've banged once, and known each other less than 3 weeks IIRC)... So much for being a ""playboy""

- He also ate jam out of the jar with his fingers for about 5 minutes stood in front of the fridge...fucking disgusting.

**OK...**

In the last month or so, he's started copying more shit that I do... 
Copying things that I say like small mannerisms and such, trying to act like he lives my kind of life, and even pretending that he likes ""Manchester Grime"" (I'm originally from near there)... Also nobody likes that shit, even people from there so just stop. 

But now it's at the point where I can't take it anymore... 

Music is something I love, I spend time searching for smaller artists, and certain types of songs that I just enjoy and what not. 

And I've got a decent speaker I'll play them through.. but lately he's been doing this weird shit where he will just hang around in the living room with me while im playing music so that he can shazam or google the lyrics, and then go play those songs on his laptop in his bedroom! 

And the problem is, when he plays a song, he KILLS IT by playing it on repeat like 20 times. 

How do I get this shit to stop other than telling him he's being a fucking weirdo? 

It almost feels like he's stealing my individuality or something

Battled depression my entire childhood, it hasn't let me live my life fully, pushed everyone away from me, recently finally began to move towards a more productive future, depression came back and kicked my ass, realizing I may have to live with it I had come down to two choices.

Sadness or absolute anger. Anger was new, sadness was old, so I picked anger. I'm angry at everything because I hate everything, what I like is that I don't think about it much, nobody can see it, it makes my mind shut up and i'm honestly okay with that.

**TL;DR:** Depression -&gt; Finally change for the better -&gt; Depression comes back worse -&gt; Decide anger is better than being sad all the time, helps cope with depression.

There are very little things I care about anymore, my anxiety and self-loathing are gone, I've lost the ability to see anything positive in something so I've lost hope, anticipating everything to be bad removes surprises, I'm at peace. Still, somehow I know this is wrong. I feel like a robot but after years of pain I'm finally at ease, if being happy honestly means stressing about shallow crap like what other's think about me or if I make enough money to afford luxury, then I don't want to be happy.

He didn’t say anything and before I knew it he was kissing me and honestly I didn’t stop him and tbh we ended up having sex right there on the couch. 

I was drunk, but I remember how good it felt and afterwards we fell asleep cuddling.

87,"So this is my first Reddit post so please pardon the newbie mistakes. I’m hoping to find some advice on how to be less formal, and dry. 

I recently just went through a really painful situation with a friend with benefits. I wanted much more out of the arraignment, but it just didn’t work out that way, and I’m utterly crushed because I am unequivocally in love with them. I always knew from the beginning that he was way out of my league, and that it would probably end badly, and frankly he kind treated me a little shitty when we drank.  Nonetheless though I’m pretty broken up about the whole situation. 

After we decided to just be friends (we see each other everyday), I came to the conclusion that I really need to dramatically change my life. I’m going to gym about 5 times a week, gave up all the crappy food, meditate 20 min a day, and have taken up intermittent fasting. I’ve been doing all this nonstop for the past 2 and half months, and actually feel pretty good. However, I know that there are still parts of my personality that I need to change. Chief among them is that I am very tightly strung, and part of me believes that I missed out on a relationship because of it. 

I’ll admit I am a workaholic. In the past two weeks I’ve worked over 200 hrs, and I have taken only one day off since Christmas. I’m good at my job and I’ve literally saved my company probably close to a hundred grand since I started 8 months ago. I need advice on how to let go of the office, stop worrying, and find a way to be more fun.

When I try to have fun or cut loose it just feels awkward and looks unnatural. For example, I incapable of dancing and that is something drove my friend crazy since he enjoys it. I’m not afraid to dance, it just looks weird and I find no enjoyment in it. Frankly that’s just the tip iceberg, because when it comes to a lot of other fun activities, I usually just skip them because it feel awkward for me to participate in them.

Our rental agreement was that it would be an open-ended term, with no minimum amount of months I have to stay, I could stay for 1 and leave if I chose to, I could leave at any time. The only thing, is that I need to give him 30 days notice. We agreed on $650 a month plus a damage deposit of $500.

I'm there now and couldn't be happier. off topic but I'll never do room-rental again. It's so much better to fork out a little extra $ and have something to yourself. 

So basically here's the disagreement. I moved out on the 3rd of 4th and he posted an ad on Kijiji right after with the room for rent. I know from people who have been messaging him for me that he's been taking his time on purpose to respond. So obviously he doesn't care if he rents it out for January because he has his rent of $650 even though I was only there for three days, I get that. I chose to leave voluntarily. Anybody in my position would've too. Anyhow, he also thinks he's entitled to my damage deposit to cover it for the month of February since it's February 1st  and he still hasn't found a renter.

But since I technically gave him my notice on January 1st, would that not cover me up until January 31st? Meaning I should be entitled to my damage deposit back, right? I'm trying to convince him of this but I'm getting tired and am honestly thinking on filing a complaint in provincial court against him if he doesn't come around.

Before I do that, I just want to know what you guys think. Am I in the wrong, or is he?

I simply just look at is like, I gave him $1100 for three days. I'm frustrated because I know he has my money and won't actively start trying to market the room for rent until he needs to but that's out of my control.  But I think he's stepping out of line when he says he's keeping my deposit. 

Rent for the entire month of January? For sure. But not my damage deposit. 


ALSO... The only thing I have in writing with signatures on it is the rental agreement. I did not give him written notice of my departure but I do have text messages with his phone number on the 1st of January.  I have a text going to his number but that's about it. I don't know if that will be his ""get out of jail-free card"". It's obviously not a monumental loss ($500) but if I am in the wrong, it's a great example for future reference. ",02Feb2018,2

94,"I'm having mixed feelings at the moment about a friend of my boyfriend's.

For some background we decided to going into college dating, while going to seperate schools, as what happens the majority of the time we ended up breaking up. There were a lot of factors that played into the break up. He ended up doing a lot of things that made me uncomfortable, but never phsically cheated, emotionally yes. There was one girl in particular who didn't respect our relationship. After breaking up with him they had sex. 

We are back together now. To be clear I'm not asking for advice on whether or not I should be in this relationship, I am asking should I be okay with them being friends?",02Feb2018,1
95,I live on a corner lot and the neighbor behind me has been parking and driving on the side of my lawn destroying it. There are deep tire marks about half a foot deep and they run  at least 15 yards long going into my yard a good 3-4 feet. There are more than 1 set of tire marks as well. His property is right behind me with his flower bed and mail box as the first thing on his property so he's not driving from his to mine as he pulls off.

96,"Ok, so, a little context.. 
We have been together for over two years. We have talked about if an accidental pregnancy were to occur and have both decided that we would terminate the pregnancy.. not that we don't want to have a family someday, we just don't want to have a child if we are unable to financially support it and give it the best life possible. 

We are both in our mid 20s, and although we are getting better at supporting ourselves, we still struggle. 

Here's where things get a little complicated. Literally almost exactly a year ago, the same exact thing happened. I found out I was pregnant. Struggled with sickness and attachment to my little bean, and eventually we terminated the pregnancy. It was a shitty ordeal. I don't regret it because I know we were not ready or able to care for a baby. But it's not something I want to go through again. 

So, I really don't know how he's going to take it or what we're going to do. I don't want to be this person who has had two abortions. I literally can't even understand how this has happened. I have always been on birth control and we have always been careful. We are also rarely even intimate. I guess he just has determined little dudes, I don't know. 

I feel completely irresponsible and like a failure for being in this situation for a second time. I'm so confused and depressed and sick with myself. I know I have to tell him but I have no idea how. I keep putting it off, ""I'll tell him after dinner,"" or ""he's already having a bad day, I don't want to make it any worse,"" etc. 

I don't even know what kind of advice I'm asking for, I guess this is more of a rant or confession or whatever, so I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub. I just feel so lost and the weight of knowing this and being to afraid to say anything is taking its toll on me. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you deal with it? What did you say? 

Also, as a side note, I feel it's worth mentioning that although this is definitely a surprise, if we were to keep the baby, it would absolutely be loved to pieces. I've fantasized about starting a family for years, but I know he's not ready. 

Any advice or words of encouragement would definitely be appreciated, and if you've read this much thank you.

97,"Just as a start, pardon my rambling. My thoughts have been so jumbled today...


I’ve always been a lonely person. Not in the way of not having friends or not getting along with people, but in terms of relationships. There’s just some hole that I’ve felt for years that I think can only be filled by finding someone like that, and within the past couple months it’s actually been going fairly well (as far as I can tell, but I honestly don’t know what I’m doing). She’s beautiful and I love talking to her, but my nervousness at asking her out led me to thinking about how much I struggle at expressing stuff like that to anyone. Not necessarily in a romantic sense, but I’m fortunate to have a group of friends who I love, but I just can’t find a way to tell them. Just the idea of telling people all the good things I think of them to their face just fills me with so much panic and I have no clue why, so I just keep it to myself. I used to have a friend who I could tell this kinda stuff (majority the relationship stuff), but we had a bit of a falling out after he just got fed up with me for various reasons and moved on. Ever since then I’ve just really kept my feelings to myself, since I just don’t have anyone else to really turn to. It took years for me to build up that trust with him and I’ve been a bit lost without someone in that role in my life (even though I’ve realized he was an asshole in a lot of ways) and I have no clue how to deal with it. Any help is appreciated.",02Feb2018,3
98,"Okay, I lied. I'm 18, but I'll be 19 this May. I graduated high school last January, and have been working ever since. For about a month or so after graduating, I lived with my father but soon moved to the city with my mother. I didn't pay rent, mostly because I was only working 30ish hours and our rent was steep ($1,200 for a tiny 2bed) so I couldn't afford to help pay.

Last July, we moved because we couldn't afford the rent. A month later I got a job at the Target 5 minutes from my house, I got my driver's license and a car (with money I received from my trust fund as a Native American). At first it was 20-35 hours, but since December I've been working 40-hour weeks at $10/hour. I barely make enough to pay the $450 that I split evenly with my mother and older brother, because of my car insurance ($195) phone bill ($80) and food. 

Ever since I was 15, I've wanted to move out on my own. I know, I know—it's naive. I've definitely learned how hard it can be to be adult and pay your bills. However, I want to become responsible like my brother and mom. 

My older brother will be turning 21 in March. He didn't have a job until he turned 19—working at Sears. He got an apartment with his friends and payed about as much as we do now. He lives with my mother and I now, and he has a nice job at a company where his programming skills got him far for his age. He's successful. He has a lot of friends, he has a nice job, money, is almost finished with college. I'm an 18-year-old queer girl who hasn't had a friend since I graduated high school, I hate my job (cashiering), I'm not enrolled in college and I feel like a failure. I feel irresponsible.

I spend money recklessly because it gives a temporary feeling of happiness. These days I feel next to nothing about everything. My life is wake up tired (I usually sleep 10+ hours a night due to depression so any less makes me tired), go to work and talk to insufferable housewives yelling at me because I put their apples in the bag ""too hard"", then go home and play video games alone all night. It's depressing. I don't know how to change. 

I want to be on my own so I don't have to rely on my family anymore and show them I'm not a burden. I want to live on my own so I can have privacy and time to myself, which I don't really get here. My brother always has friends over and at work I'm constantly talking to rude guests, and it exhausts me. I have anxiety, depression, and am generally introverted. I want my own space. I want my own life. I want to change my life so I'm not in a job I despise and working for my future.

I know it seems naive. I know it's hard. Believe me, many people have told me that and I know it fully well myself. I'm not saying I'm going to pack up and move out of state immediately. I just want to know what I can do to prepare myself. I want to take the necessary steps so that I'm ready to be on my own and can provide for myself. 

TL;DR: Lonely, depressed, anxious, and desperate to change my life. I want to move out on my own and I want to support myself. How can I start working towards this goal?",02Feb2018,2
99,"To start off, I’m a senior in high school, turning 18 in about 1 month. 

Throughout my high school career, I’ve tried to manage my time so that I don’t sleep too late. Without fail, I’ve been able to sleep at 11:30 every night for the past three years. In recent months, due to balancing school and college applications, my sleep schedule has fallen back. I tend to go to bed at around 1-2 am several nights a week. 

As a result of this, my mom constantly nags at me to sleep earlier. She tells me that I need to sleep earlier to preserve my youth, to prevent eye bags, etc. My sleep schedule is always under her control and she always guilt trips me and lectures me about sleeping earlier when often, I don’t have a choice. When I stay up to do work, she wakes up every 30 minutes or so to come out and lecture me to go to bed until I finally do. This forces me to feel guilty and stop my studies and sleep to avoid getting in trouble and to let her sleep as well. 

When discussing this with her, I truthfully overreacted and yelled that I was angry at her constant regulation, to which she angrily lectured me in response. 

Is this normal? Do most parents care to this extent about how late their child sleeps? Am I overreacting by being angry at her reaction? This issue has been putting a strain on my relationship with my mom lately. 

TLDR; My mom constantly nags at me to sleep earlier when I stay up to study. ",02Feb2018,1
100,"Hey guys!

So about two and half weeks ago I met a girl and we went on a date. Went to a bar, had a great time. Planned another date two days later. That went great as well. Then we planned to cook dinner together on our third date, a week later. That date happened and again went fantastic. Long story short, we wound up having sex that night and in the all the excitement, and not to mention we were both kind of drunk, I wound up giving her a hickey. She’s a teacher so she wasn’t too happy that it happened but seemed to just make fun of it. 

Apparently it didn’t go well when she got to school (She’s a teacher) and she began texting me about her upsetting few days having dealt with the hickey. She explained how I should have been more careful but that she knows I did not do it on purpose. We gave each other some space for a day or two after that. 

Keep in mind now; I’ve only been in one real relationship that lasted almost four years. I actually kind of started to fall for this girl. We spent quite a long time together on each date and we learned a lot, laughed a lot, and generally had a good amount in common. I like her and am beginning to care for her. 

However, she has cancelled our next date due to a scheduling conflict. And I’m just kind of beginning to worry I may have messed things up. Honestly I’m a classic textbook overthinker but I’d appreciate some friendly consoling. Thanks guys! 

EDIT: She tried her best to cover it up; scarf, makeup, etc.

101,"So I’m a 16 year old male and I’ve been dealing with these random waves of sadness that randomly manifest themselves. Sometimes they go away for a while and I think that I’ve finally gotten past them, but after a while they show up again. I have no particular reason to be sad and these feelings can last a couple seconds to a couple hours, but once they go away I feel normal and completely fine.  I enjoy writing especially when I’m feeling any form of negative emotions, but when I try writing while I’m in that state of mind; I can only write self deprecating stuff and it doesn’t help me at all. 

I do have people who are willing to listen, but I don’t want to burden them with my issues, plus I’ve gotten to know myself this past year and I know that I will become overly attached to someone if I begin to share my feelings with them. I want to see a therapist, but I also don’t want to burden my mother with that sort of financial burden. In all honesty I just want to know if what I experience is normal. Below is usually the chain of events that take place whenever I feel this way.

Sudden burst of sadness appears, then I begin to insult myself and demean my existence, then I just try to ignore these thoughts and try to relax and calm myself down, finally the sadness goes away and I feel alright as if the sadness was never there. I know this was long and maybe this is something everyone goes through and I’m just being dramatic, but I have no other way of finding an answer. ",02Feb2018,4

103,"I'm taking the second course of an introductory sequence in computer science this semester. On the first day of classes, the professor spent the first 20 minutes talking about how much of a departure this class is from CS I, and how difficult this class is, and how we will likely not do well if we don't already know Java. I figured he was just trying to weed out the more uncommitted students and brushed it off.

I transferred to this university, having taken the equivalent of CS I at another uni, so I went up to him at the end of the class, told him what we covered at my previous uni, and asked him if there were any gaps in my preparation and how I could prepare. He vocalized many hmms and huhs, saying at times ""nonononono,"" and at the end basically said ""I don't know, but you'll probably not do well."" It freaked me out but I decided to stick with this class for another week and see.

A few days later, he came in again, and started talking about how all these students asked him for advice on how to do well in the course. He started another 15 minute speech about how difficult this class is, and how we won't do very well. And then he goes, ""the last time I taught this class, only 20% of students got As. Only 20%. And only another 10% got A-minuses."" As far as I know, that's pretty good in an intro STEM class.

Since then, we've had three quizzes, all of which I aced, and I've had no problem keeping up with the material. But today, I went in for office hours because I had a question about whether Java could handle array operations like Python can (.append(), .pop(), etc). When I asked him if there was anything like that in Java, he didn't really understand what I was talking about, so I ended up showing him something I wrote in Python dealing with .csv files. He proceeded to stare at my code for a little bit, scoffed and said ""no, Java is for students who go on to work at Google and Amazon, you know, to create new things, and Python is just a tool to do data analysis."" Uh, okay, but then he says ""if you're in this class to learn about data analysis, this class is a waste of time for you."" 

I... I literally asked if there were things analogous to Python lists in Java. I read the syllabus, I know it's going to be about algorithms, I know it's going to use Java. He repeats the same message about 5 times in various phrasings, insinuating that this class is Definitely Not For You, then asks me, ""so how are you keeping up in this class? Are you able to follow the lectures?"" I ended up just saying thank you professor and walked out. 

What the hell is wrong with this man? Part of me thinks he's just weird, but part of me is afraid the class will actually become ungodly difficult later, when we start talking about algorithms. The add-drop period is over so I can't switch courses, but I have the option of dropping his class and taking only 4 classes this semester until the 15th. However, I really need to take this class if I want to do a CS minor (I'm a linguistics major). Has anyone had a similar experience? What can I do?

TL;DR Professor keeps suggesting I should drop his class but I'm doing well in his class so far. I don't know if it'll become ungodly difficult later on. What do I do?",02Feb2018,5
104,"I need help dealing with social anxiety and loneliness.

Let me start with a bit about myself.  I'm a 32 y/o, man.  I'm going for a degree in Computer Science and I also like to lift weights.  As you can all tell from my user name, yes, I enjoy my games, along with the occasional book or movie.  I also love to draw.

For the most part, I'm not a total disaster when it comes to low self-esteem except when it comes to socializing.  I've hadn't had any friends in about 10 years.  I also just shut down when dealing with the opposite sex.  Even though I lost my virginity at 24, I still feel clueless in the sexual dance.  I've only kissed two girls and had sex once in my entire life.  It's a decade long dry spell, both friend and romantic-wise.   

I just feel alone, undesirable, and afraid that I will be alone forever.  Also, I feel like I'm in the dark:  I'm constantly struggling about what the hell it means to be a man in this society.  It's like I need to constantly put up a front: to look tough, sexually desirable &amp; have high bedpost notches at all times or you're nothing. 


Still, I'm not totally broken, I can gather enough inner strength to do the important things in life, like work and school.  Thankfully, I also don't have body issues.  Also, I see a lot of guys blame women for their situation, and that's unfortunate.  Women socially struggle, too.  They feel just as undesirable as we guys do.

I'm sort of good friends with Drew, but i don't really remember how i met him, and how i'm his friend. He has said in the past ""i help out my friends"" when he hooked me up with someone, but i feel like he'd abandon me for his other friends (A B &amp; C) in a heartbeat, like the few times i've hung out with him was just us two getting food or watching a game, never me with A, B, and C.

107,"Yeah so as the title says I was ghosted 3 years ago and only recently have I really started moving on, although not 100% hence this post.

I had just come out of a relationship and I met a girl who was beautiful and really smart academic type. 

When I first met her she was really awkward in a cute way, I guess you could say she was almost stunned to see me as it turned out she had seen me on social media and talked about me to her friends despite me not knowing she even existed which was flattering beyond words, never had something like that happen to me before.

She started trying to get my attention online until we started messaging each other and would talk for hours on end, all was going good.

Weeks later we went out together for the first time since we first met, long story short we kissed and it was amazing I knew I was in love.

Shockingly out of nowhere, the next day she wasn’t replying to my messages about the kiss and spending time with each other. The entire day had passed with no reply and I was pretty confused we haven’t gone a day without talking since we first started this thing.

Eventually she messaged me that she was no longer interested, effectively asking me to leave her alone forever without any reason whatsoever. 

That broke my heart a little bit but I complied and thanked her for the conversations we shared and time we spent together and stopped communicating with her for good, in fact we never talked again since that day to the present day.

I never got an answer from her about what the hell happened how we went from being so happy together at first to this.

I heard it was because she wasn’t ready for a relationship which got my hopes up thinking we could pick up what we left but a few months later she got a boyfriend and she’s still with him all this time later in a happy relationship, which is just adding salt to the wounds.

Turns out a friend of hers who I didn’t know was extremely judgemental of me and even said to someone that she was desperate and went for me, just another kick while I was down.

I used to think of this girl every single day for a couple years nothing could take my mind off of her I never at least got the closure I needed just wanting to know what I did wrong, it’s not exactly my first break up but first one like this.

It’s now been 3 years and I can safely say I do not think of her on a daily basis although she creeps in my mind once in a while such as tonight. 

I’m happy in a relationship now which has really helped me forget about her but I would still like an answer, although I will never get it.

Anyone have any advice for a ghosting victim I know this thing isn’t exactly uncommon. 

Just to add, I was ghosted as she completely cut me off but later informed me she wanted me to leave her alone after messaging her a few times, a request that I simply respected.

109,"So, here's the deal...
I just began a new job as an applecare advisor for Apple for decent-ish pay (definitely some of the best money I've ever made). It's full time, and while I'm not guarunteed the greatest schedule, it's stable money with benefits. 
Now, I took this job because I've been a cook for 5+ years (Waffle House, fine dining, etc) and while I like the work, it's hard to find a stable schedule in this industry. I sorta figured that working in tech support would be a good start to something new. My boyfriend works as a software engineer for an amazing company, and the way he describes his company and how they treat their employees.... I want that. I want that so bad. Maybe someday I can work there, even as a lowly tech support. I really feel like I can milk this AppleCare job for all it's worth and then get my foot in the door elsewhere.

So, here I am, broke as hell, barely a week into training for this new job, and my SO has an idea.
He wants to buy an RV and work from it while traveling the country. With his line of work and because the company he works for is just **that fucking amazing** (also money), he can do this with little problem. I want to join him so badly, and he said he wants me to join him. I've been wanting to travel for a long time now, but... 
I'm afraid it's too soon to leave this job. I just started. No WAY would they let me take 6 months to a year off when I'm so new and not valuable to them. I'm almost afraid to even ask. I'm afraid if I leave this job so soon, I'll simply lose it. 

On one hand, I feel like this whole RV idea would throw a giant wrench into my goals of furthering a career (in what, I'm not sure, but I need to get out of the cooking industry, and the tech world is booming right now) and I worked hard to even find this job and get in. I had a goal of going back to school this year, and getting somewhere in my life. I can't do that from an RV traveling the US. I'd also have to save money, and I'd literally be saving all the spare money I have (after bills) over the next 6 months before he would be leaving... And even THEN I wouldn't have much to spare. I know he'd help me in any way he could (he makes more than enough) but I like feeling self sufficient and paying for my half. I'd feel like a mooch if he payed for over 1/2 of the entire experience.
But on the other hand, I feel like if I don't go with him for this 6 month-1 year adventure, I'll regret it. How often do you have the chance to travel the country with your best friend?

I honestly feel stuck, guys. I don't know what to do. I want to go, but I don't want to get off track and lose sight of my goals. Im having trouble focusing during my training because sometimes I wonder what the point even is. I might not be there for long, am I in this for the paycheck or the experience at this point?

I want to be successful and live a life that would make me, my SO, and my parents proud. But I also want to live life while I'm young (25 here) and take risks and see what this country has to offer.

tl;dr just got a new job in a new industry. SO wants to travel the country in an RV. do I quit my new job and go with him, or do I stick with my original plan and get the experience I want from this job, maybe go back to school, and advance in my life?

For months since the project has been announced (back in September 2017), I've been worrying about it every day whether I like it or not. Nonetheless, despite my worrying, I honestly have not gotten anywhere productive with this project and it's due on February 22nd. As of now, it's February 1st.

For the past few weeks (months, really), I've been trying to find a way to start on this research project in any way that I could. I've collected some websites that I think might help me and two books on the topic, but I haven't gone father than collecting sources. Not information and actually taking the time to read out the dang things, but trying to find stuff to relate to my topic. Alas, it's the only thing that can come in mind when attempting to do it.

I'm on my own with this project. I could've worked with other people on another topic (actually, a... very, very close friend I regard of in a way that favors him more than anyone else in my life offered for me to join him and his group on his topic), but I politely declined because I thought I would be a strain on the group and I thought I could pull it off on my own.

I can't even turn back and say yes because it's far too late for it now. It might've been alright in the first couple days after it was ""official,"" but now? Five months after? Oho, no. Not a chance. 

This project is literally worth half of my grade. If I don't get a good score on this, my grade plummets. My life plummets. My school opportunities plummet, as it'll always have an effect now in the present on the future, no matter what my grade level and age is. History's usually a great subject that I excel in and actually love, because I adore learning about the past.. but with this history project on my conscience, I don't know what the hell I should do.

I suck at time management, as always. I always wait until the last minute for anything, no matter how important of an impact it can make on my life. God, I always have the time to do things, but I always ""be myself"" by procrastinating and saying that I can put it off until later or there's more time when really, I know that time is running out and the bottom of the hourglass is almost full.

Just... oh my gosh. I don't even know how I've made it this far in school just as a twelve-year-old seventh grader without falling behind or giving up completely. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

On this, the advice I'm asking for is... what should I do? I don't know how I'm supposed to ask for help on this. How am I supposed to start this National History Day project when I don't even know where to begin with? What should I be doing, what should I be looking for, what is it with me that's got me so mixed up? How am I supposed to go about this whole ordeal, on top of getting a good grade? God, I know my grade doesn't matter at this point, but really, it's the result of this project anyways...

Urrrggghhhh. I don't know what I should do!",02Feb2018,2

120,"Hello all.

I'm sure some of us have had to deal with this current situation I'm in. But because of the circumstances as of currently, I am a bit concerned if I'm making a good choice or if I'm being a complete bitch, and I would appreciate any advice.

Basically, I work with my aunt (nail tech), who I feel like has always had something against me ever since I was little. I'm not sure if it's her personality or jealous or what. She's a fairly decent person but has not been the most positive to be around. She makes rude comments about me (ex: she was bitter about not coming to my house for the holidays ""because I had dogs"" and I had a strong feeling it wasn't the dogs, more so me), talks about me behind my back to her clients at work, and cops an attitude about something I do almost every day. In the beginning I let it slide because well, she's family and I didn't want to be disrespectful towards her despite her negative energy. She's my boss, after all.

Recently, a situation happened where she crossed the line with me. My boyfriends family friend came in to get her nails done. She was pampering herself because her husband had just threatened to kill her, ended up beating her pretty badly, so she was obviously going through a traumatic event. I felt sorry for her and did what I felt was right. I paid for her manicure because it was the least I could do. My aunt questioned why I did it, mind you I had told her the story about her situation before she came in. She then said ""she works at the hospital, she makes a lot of money, you should have made her pay."" And also ""You don't even know if the story is true.""
She had bruises. She cried during her appointment. My boyfriends mom, her best friend, told me. I was extremely heartbroken and shocked by what she said. I was mad. Confused as to why she's so money hungry and why she has zero compassion for anyone but herself. How can she care about nice clothes, nice jewelry, brand new cars and then when there's someone that is hurt in front of her she still cares about the money.
I told her I wasn't heartless and I continued to think about it more, and this is my conclusion. I have someone that I work with, that is constantly negative. Any time I involve something personal, there's something shitty said by her. So I stopped. I stopped talking about my day. I stopped telling her things about my life. If it wasn't work related, I didn't mention it. I stopped doing extra work because I realized the other employees don't so why should I especially when I'm treated like shit.
I'm only 22 years old. But I feel like regardless of being related by blood to someone, I am allowed to make the choice to cut her out of my personal life. At work I am an employee, not a neice and I should be treated like one just like everyone else. She doesn't treat them the way she does me, and it's unfair. I'm tired of the bullshit. I've decided to keep work life and personal life separate despite being related to my boss.

Sometimes I feel like a real bitch for making that decision. She has noticed because she mentioned to my mom that I wasn't talking to her and that I wasn't helping out anymore, and tomorrow we are supposed to have this group discussion about it. I guess I'm just looking for opinions. Part of me thinks I'm overreacting, part of me says fuck it my happiness matters.

121,"The coach who sexually assaulted me with his assistant coach is now an assistant principal at the local high school. I was on the wrestling team and they drugged, kidnapped, and assaulted me. He fell off the Earth for almost the last decade but yesterday I looked up his name and he came up as the assistant principal at the school. It was almost a decade ago and I have no evidence. But this is the same guy who had a bunch of young boys showering naked together on the wrestling team and giving eachother full body massages on the wrestling mats. He's a sick fuck and despite my disgust I don't really know what to do. Justice probably isn't in the cards but maybe lodging an anonymous complaint might help damn him when he gets caught doing it to someone else.
  
Right after it happened my family moved halfway across the U.S., I didn't realize what had happened until I was a lot older. When I checked the internet after realizing what happened neither coach was associated with the wrestling team anymore and both of them had dropped off the face of the earth as far as social media went. But the assistant coach had one article published for a charity where it mentioned that he decided to get a degree in education and start teaching. But because other than that one article both coaches dropped off the internet I assumed they both fucked off to a hole somewhere.  We moved back a year ago and just yesterday I found out that, that sick fuck is now the principal of the local highschool. I don't know where the assistant coach is but it's bad enough that one of them is confirmed to be around kids all the time.

122,"To make what could be a very long post short....

I’m a 25 year old woman who hasn’t seen any doctor other than a dentist since I was 18. My last doctor was a pediatric/adolescent specialist and I’ve never had an “adult doctor.” Similarly, I used to be in therapy for self harm but haven’t been in over 10 years. 

There are things I’ve needed to get checked since I was 16. There’s new health issues I want to get checked. And part of me feels like something is wrong in the mental health department as well so I’d like to go back into therapy

Bad news is I moved all the way across the country. I know nobody here to help me find good doctors. Good news is I finally have health insurance and money to start sorting all this out.

123,"My friend is morbidly obese and diabetic, and she doesn't manage her blood sugar well. Ordinarily, I'm a live and let live person. 

Here's the rub: I have a somewhat rare recessive gene that makes diabetic people with badly-managed blood sugar smell like a sugar-covered rotting corpse. I can't be within a couple of feet of her without getting a splitting headache from the smell.

She lives in another state, so ordinarily we just hang out online, so it never mattered. When we hang out, the smell is so horrible that I can't be near her, but I don't want to treat her differently in person than on online. She's an awesome friend and I really love her, so I want to continue the friendship. What can I do?

Edit for clarification:

Another thing I should have noted is that I really, really don't want to explain my problem to her or try to change her. I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable or embarrassed or anything for something that I feel is mainly MY issue. 

Most people can't smell her, so it's not like she's a stinky person - it's just an unusual unfortunate trait that affects me.

127,"this is a very complicated situation but i'm going to try and explain it as clearly as i can.

my close friend has been in love with the same girl since we were in 9th grade. we're 20 now and she's done a lot of horrible things to him during this period of time. they never dated, but he is still heartbroken over some of the things that have happened and its basically ruining his entire life.

so they meet in 9th grade and she is already in an extremely abusive relationship. we pretty much all know this kid is beating the shit out of her on the daily but nobody ever says anything about it. he's also VERY possessive and jealous. they date off and on until senior year.

so she meets my friend, they have a lot in common, whatever. 
now, he's a really, really sweet young man with a huge heart. but he's painfully awkward and its pretty hard for him to form any meaningful relationships. i feel like as soon as this girl started giving him any attention he just soaked it up. he was also bullied a lot in school and didn't have a lot of friends so i know things were pretty tough from the beginning.

a little time goes on and she as soon as she realizes how much he likes her she starts manipulating his emotions every chance she gets. (leading him on really bad, randomly kissing him when nobody is around, ect.) at this point he loves her A LOT but he knows they can't be together. this is the only interaction he's ever had with a girl at this point and he doesn't know what to do.

some more stuff happens throughout high school but nothing too huge. she cuts off contact with my friend a couple times because of her abuser and generally just treats him like garbage even though he's the only person looking out for her this entire time. he even goes as far as to buy her a $250 coat and she says she can't take it because ""she'll always choose her boyfriend over him no matter what."" (her words.) 

the summer after graduation is when things get the worst, though. she ends up breaking it off with shitface for good and he STALKS HER and RAPES HER in a park bathroom when nobody is around. the next day the piece of shit leaves on a fucking plane for basic training and she never sees him again. she starts doing meth to deal with her pain. 

at some point she ends up going to jail for breaking and entering. while she's in jail she writes my friend letters about how she ""can't wait to be with him when she gets out"" and that ""she loves him"" and just general manipulative shit that she doesn't mean and shouldn't be saying. when she gets out of jail he lets her move into his house because he feels bad for all the things that have happened to her. she completely trashes his house, steals half his stuff, and then runs away with her new boyfriend a few weeks later.

now, this is the absolute worst thing she does to my friend: she fucking blackmails him into having sex with her. she says that if he doesn't pay her $400 to have sex with him she's going to ruin his life and tell everybody some extremely personal, private secrets. he's never had sex in his life and she absolutely takes advantage of him. while she's living with him she also steals his credit card numbers and charges $400 to a hotel for her and her boyfriend.

they haven't talked in months but he's still so in love with her. he's tried dating a couple girls since all this stuff happened but he says he just doesn't feel the same way as he did when he was around her. nothing i tell him helps at all. what kind of advice do you possibly give to somebody in this situation?????? i'm honestly at a complete loss right now and i just want to help him.

Im a shy person that really opens up to people once im comfortable with them. I recently changed schools and its my 4th day in this giant high school. This girl at first i noticed was kind of staring and looking away when i noticed. I couldnt confirm if thats what was happening

Day 2, im sitting near her and i get to kniw her and a few others. This girl talks to her friend and right in front of me asks someone i know something and a second later he comes up to me and asks what grade I was in. Kind of weird but nothing that stands out, i got it, i was new and people wanted to know who i was.

Day 3, nothing really happens.

Day 4(today), i was sitting alone and browsing reddit. She asks her friend to ask someone i know to come to her, i hear the person i know audibly laugh and comes over to ask if i thought girl was cute and if i was single etc.

Anyway one of the stipulations of my visa is that I complete 88 days of agricultural labor for the farms in regional Australia of which all of Tasmania qualifies.

I’m currently in my senior and last year of high school in a catholic school in Queensland, Australia. Our school has 9 houses. At the end of last year, the leaders for those houses was elected. We are now in week 2 of the first term and the two leaders elected for my house are my best friends. I used to be a bit of a slacker in my earlier years of high school and would occasionally not show up to sport days and would sometimes get detentions. Since mid last year I have had the sudden change of mind and the sudden change of attitude where I would like to make a difference and take a leadership role. I want to come to school everyday and have more of a purpose then going to classes and leaving. 

At our school, each house is split into 8 tutor groups that we go to every morning for 20 minutes to mark the roll and hang out. These tutor groups are always led by the same teacher and they end up becoming good friends with the students most of the time.

At the end of the first term, the elected leaders along with the tutor group teachers will decide on who (if anyone) should become the 3rd house leader. I don’t know the detailed parts of this process but that’s as much as I know. What I am asking is how do I go about getting that 3rd position. I love my house but I’m worried about the other contenders because the younger grades know them more. I do not just want the position for the rep and the cool badge. I want to take responsibility and work with my two best friends. I have already told them I am interested and am planning to tell my tutor group teacher next week.

Any advice or questions is much appreciated.

I was promoted to a very lucrative position after a very short time at this company. 
There are many people who apply and want this position, and they were all turned down and it was instead, given to me -- and I didn't even apply for it.

-----------------------------

So, a few days ago I found out I was selected for a promotion and nailed the interview, etc etc.
I have been very excited and stuff, but I'm not allowed to tell anyone else until my background check / credit check / other stuff are 100% finished. (I work for a company that deals with very sensitive documents.)

Anyway. Here's how the chain of command goes:

* General Employee
* Special General Employee
* Team Lead
* Supervisor
* Etc

I went straight from General Employee to Supervisor ... and as you can imagine (or maybe not) that will make quite a few select people mad.

See, this is basically an entry level job, and I came in at the very bottom of the chain. All I had was a high-school diploma, a couple online certificates about leadership / communication, and some fast food experience. I made it known to management that being a supervisor was apart of my ""5 year plan"" but that's really it. I've also only been working at this company for over 1 year.

But I was granted supervisor, which really is a big deal in this company. It's a pretty lucrative title and pay-raise.

But now, I'm pretty upset / scared. 
There are a *lot* of people that want to move up in the company. At least 50 people apply for a lead position whenever it opens, because generally speaking, getting experience as a lead is the only way to prove that you know what you're doing and can supervise a whole team.

But, for some reason, they chose me. I didn't even apply for the position! I was just asked if I would like to interview for a supervisor position, I apparently nailed it, and here I am -- almost a supervisor.

What do I do? How do I deal with the many, many upset people that will surely come at me in some direct or indirect way? I mean, really it isn't that fair to them that I was awarded supervisor and people that have applied for it, and worked there 7+ years got told no.

149,"I used to have social media but in middle school I was bullied through it and just decided I'd rather get off of it and I love not having one but I'm a junior in high school now and I'm being told a lot that colleges look at your social media because they want to see what type of person you are. I have good grades, do theatre, volunteer a lot and if I were to create a new Instagram I would basically show that to give the colleges something to look at besides Pinterest boards that I made in the 7th grade. I'm wondering if that will actually do anything or if me not having a lot of social media will not affect me and my chances of getting into the schools I want because I really really dislike social media and all it did was give me anxiety  and make me feel inadequate despite knowing how fake most of the smiles in a lot of people's pictures are.

151,"I feel like this is a small and honestly kinda dumb thing to even talk about, but this stuff has me really messed up. I’ve been talking to this girl for a while and she’s really messed up. Like REALLY messed up. She’s gone through a lot of stuff and it’s affected her a lot, and I just can’t seem to get enough of her for some reason. She controls my thoughts most of the time it seems. I can barely eat or sleep without just thinking about her, and when I do think about her, I can’t eat for days and sleeping is really just out of the picture. I really don’t understand why I’m so attached to her in such a way. I’ve known plenty of people who’ve gone through tons of stuff but I’ve never felt so attached to one such as I am to her. I don’t want to believe that I’m in love with her because I don’t think that it would work out, and that love is iffy in my brain. I really don’t understand what to do anymore. I’ve been avoiding dealing with the attachment because acknowledging it means I have to acknowledge the concept that I might actually be in love. This is all very trivial and melodramatic I understand, but it’s affecting my life in a large way if I’m being honest. Anyway, I hope that someone can help with this and give me an idea or concept of where to begin in fixing this thing.",02Feb2018,5
153,"Hello good people of Reddit,

My BFF (since like kindergarten) is one of the most important people in my life and I absolutely adore her. We’re different, but have complementary personalities and have always gotten along great.

(She’s an INFJ Enneagram 1 and I’m an INFP enneagram 4 for reference if you’re into that kind of thing)

ANYWAY, we’ve always had an issue (or at least I have) with communication. I love and value conversations with friends. She does too, but when we’re together we rarely have conversation. She doesn’t respond to a lot of my attempts to make conversation (which honestly makes me feel like an idiot, and over the top.)

We recently decided to room together and it’s completely exacerbated the silence and my own insecurities. It’s hard for me to continue to update her on my life and ask for updates on hers when the conversation is so strained - and this is my main confidant, best friend in the entire world.

I know she values our friendship and cares about me. She’s just quiet. And I’m insecure about that. I just don’t know how to live with the lack of conversation because I feel like there’s a lack of friendship in our quiet apartment.

I really would appreciate your insights, as I want to either confront the situation - or my own issues - and make things better. I would love to hear your experiences with friends and conversation and introversion. Do you have friendships that are silent? SOS!",02Feb2018,2

158,Moved to a new city *Las Vegas* on Jan. 1st with no job after getting my AA in liberal arts with the end goal just trying to find a 9-5 mon-fri office job in customer service or data entry. I have worked at home depot for 5 years then 1 year in an office setting. I hated the non predictable hours of retail so I have been looking to get back in an office setting job out here it has been about a month and I got one interview with a temp service that just had weekend jobs and I am getting restless at home. Would you keep searching for that nice mon-fri job or just say forget it and apply to retail places then look for a replacement while employed? I assume my 5 years as a cashier should make somewhat easy work of finding a retail job but I would rather not... I do have a somewhat stable income and a good chunk in savings to get me through while I have no job. Should I just give myself x amount of months of looking for an office job then just go to retail tell I find something? Eventually even with my income I will need a job.,02Feb2018,2

172,"Have a roommate who's behavior has drastically changed in the past month. He snaps really easily, his sense of humor got super dark but with like no punchline, he's broken down in front of us, you can hear him snorting something all the time, he's high most of the day, when he drinks which is a lot he doesn't know how to talk to people, loves plotting/scheming, talks to himself like crazy, and he fucks with our shit brags about it on social media then when we call him out on it he deletes everything (he's now blocked us on everything so god knows wtf he's been doing).

Some background on him learned specifically in this month: 

He's 28 {knew he was older didn't know how old} (we're all 22-23) is obsessed with blizzard, has shit social skills, doesn't sleep, blasts death-metal when we have people over to prove his point and we call him childish to his face which he doesn't accept well.

He got kicked out of OK St won't tell us why.

Is like weirdly excited about his capstone project.

Deleted his Facebook because to protect himself in the future.

He drunkly admitted he stopped taking his meds this past month.

Pulled a knife out on me when I tried to rush into his room (dumb mistake on my part) after turning on some intensive death-scremo shit literally 1 min after quiet hours ended at 8:01 am. When asked to stop the music originally he gave the smart ass answer of I started after quiet hours ended. This is the same song he plays when he tries to annoy us.

Same night he told us he tried killing himself. Would cry then text a friend back mid sentence stop the crying, act like that wasn't happening, then go back to it.

Potentially destroyed the property of one of our roomates. New replacement items of stuff we already own came in the mail including a very large and expensive item. Has drunkenly bragged about fucking up the shit of the one roommate he likes the least.

Before he got taken away(mentioned) he kept giving us a heads up about a big change coming last Monday which lead me to question the fuck out of him. He said I was drawing triangles but like nobody except a mass shooter talks like this imo.

**When asked if he needed help with a class I took last year, he mistook that as me bragging then the conversation got so heated he ended up threatening to kill himself with medication that stops his heart. I called the police when this happened. They took him away for 72 hours to ensure he wouldn't harm himself. Before being detained he laid out on pong table with his middle finger facing the cops, freaked out every time the body cam/radio made a noise, whispered all his info his story to the cops while crying, and when they finally detained him he resisted like no other causing others in the building to come out. My roommates all talked about that incident and said he would have been fine if he wasn't so paranoid and more chill.  I've tried talking to him since and he says ""I don't want to talk about it now"" every time. The one time we almost got him to talk he blamed me for his parents having to spend thousands on medical bills then said my parents have money so it's no big deal I guess...(I didn't threaten to kill myself) 

MY biggest fear is he's fucking with my shit. I'm 75% sure he's putting stuff into my protein powder I drink daily because my stomach hasn't felt right since he came back. I would put it in my room, but in unrelated news our building has rats that have yet to be taken care of (their incompetence on this and a variety of other issues is why we don't trust building management on this)

Then tonight I find on the floor of our living room on a flash card ""Should we immerse ourselves in manipulation?"" I ask my roommates in the group chat who's flash-card it was and everyone but the kid {full grown adult} with the problems replies.

Does this have to continue? The school psych ward has advised me to potentially seek a restraining order as an option but I don't want the dude to get his life fucked. He'll have to get kicked out and can't be near me on campus at any time which will happen at some point. My roommates and myself want him to go get mental help for a while/go to rehab/stop acting like it's 06 screamo life/then leave us alone for a while. Everyone but him graduates this year (we added him to fill the lease) and this guy is just fucking too much. I get he might have a disability, but it shouldn't be the burden of others.

177,"I'll try to make this as short as I can and spare you guys the details, pretty much, I was attacked by a German shepherd at a dog park near my house on the 1st of Dec, '17. 

The owner ran away and left me bleeding at the park claiming it was my fault her dog attacked me saying I ""shouldn't touch a police dog""... 
(I was entering the park, behind the gate, asking her if her dogs were friendly before going inside and her dog pushed the gate open and attacked both my dog and I.. completely unprovoked!) 

I had one witness who called 911 for me, but I was in such shock I didn't take down any of her information. (She did make the call from her personal phone so I'm hoping I can track her down that way.)

Well anyway, I've been going back to that park almost daily since the incident and asking around to see if anyone knows the person whose dog attacked me. So far I've been able to find out her first name, and that supposedly, her dogs were rescued military dogs that worked in Afghanistan. 

I have 70k worth of hospital bills, the bite was pretty bad, I had to have minor surgery and a bunch of shots. 

I have a police report filed about the incident but since I had no information about the person they weren't able to help me with anything, they didn't even offer to help me look for her. I also opened a report with animal services but they also couldn't help me. 

At this point, all I have is the witness who called 911 for me, and the person's first name. 

*However, Someone recently told me they have been seeing this person come to the park at dawn right before it gets dark, I'm planning on posting up and waiting to see if I spot her, however, I'm not sure how to go about it once I do see her. 

Do I call the police? Do I approach her? Do I follow her to find out where she lives? *

I'm still in a lot of pain on my arm from the bite, there are certain movements that really hurt, i started having high anxiety, nightmares, sometimes they'd keep me at the hospital because of my heart rate and blood pressure being too high due to stress, I missed 3 weeks of work amongst other impacts this incident caused. :/ 

Anyway guys, Any advice would be greatly appreciated! 
Thank you for reading all this! 

*TL;DR:* was attacked my a supposed ""police dog"" and now I'm stuck with 70k in hospital bills, I have found out the owner of the dog is showing up at the park again and Idk how to approach her once I see her.

178,"Basically what happened between us was that we were both teens and we dated. I had a few opinions on things that he couldn't handle. He tried to start a polygamous relationship between us and a girl, then got mad at me when I refused. That was what ended the relationship. Afterwards he stalked my social media for a few months with fake accounts trying to get me to say something to him that he could use as blackmail but finally gave up after awhile.

This makes him sound like a bad person but before we dated he was a good friend and at the time we were both teens and doing things to try and make each other mad near the end of the relationship.

This was all around 4-5 years ago and I've since let it go. None of the abuse was physical, it was mostly just passive aggressiveness and jealousy. He's since moved to another country and this is the first time we've made contact in years.

I'm learning Mandarin Chinese and she works next to my work place, known her boss for a long time. Anyway, she just came to Australia from China about 8 months ago and we never really spoke.

I helped her boss one day and she asked me to speak in Mandarin to her which I did a little, then she kept asking me some questions, like am I gay, and do I have a girlfriend. When I replied no to being gay she smiled, and when I replied to not having a girlfriend she said ""How about me?"" I replied and said ""Maybe we can just be friends first"".

When she was invited by a man much older then her to my parents party, she insisted I come outside and speak with her. A bit about myself: I hate drinking, and I can't handle really loud sounds as I have a sensitivity to loud sounds, but I did anyway for a little while. Everyone is convinced that she likes me.

Anyways, to make this even shorter. She wanted me to help her with something so I went down to the shops and decided she didn't need help anymore. Now, I've never had a relationship before and I'm normally naive, but I have a feeling she likes me. She invited me to have Coffee, though I only had a Hot Chocolate, then she just accompanied me around and we ended up eating dinner and I walked her home.

She insisted I wear her pink coat home since it's cold outside, but my body (or brain) is really weird.. I'll wear a jumper in 40c heat and will wear a simple T-shirt in 17c. I don't know. Anyways she keep insisting I take it, so I ended up wearing it half the way home but I got too warm and took it off.

Now it's just sitting in my closet and she says she doesn't need it returned yet as it has just reached summer where I am now.

And now, I'm just sitting here writing this message and I don't know what to do. A small part of me has always been curious in relationships, but on the other hand... I just want to hang out with my friends and be happy. I don't really care about relationships that much honestly, and I care even less about sex. That isn't to say I don't want a relationship, but...

185,"Hi everyone. I desperately need advice. Long story short: I met this guy this past july when he came to visit his friend who lived with me. I overlooked his shyness and we had a really great time. He left after three days but we only got together his last. The next day, we said our goodbyes thinking it would never happen again, but kept texting everyday. Really long messages. So we decided to meet again three weeks later, at a festival in the city where he lives. I live in Portugal and he lives in France, so I went to see him and I spent the whole month with him. It was nice but it wasn't great. We went camping, it was my first time. His friend came along and I got lost in the woods, it took me about three hours to finally get to town and call him to pick me up. It was awful to realize he and his friend just kept on drinking and didn't realize I was lost. That was my first disappointment. Anyways, I just stayed there and had a really fun time, but we never spoke about a relatioship. 
I came back to Portugal and we kept texting everyday, so the next month I came back because he said he really wanted to see me again. So I did, another amazing three weeks and still no talks about relationship.
In october we couldn't see each other because I had too much to do in Portugal. So we planned a trip to Italy in November. It was fun, but not amazing. He is very shy and quiet, and doesn't bring up the topic of relationship. Also he never really opens up about his personal life, he doesn't really talk about his family, or the stuff that happens in his life at home. 
I sorta got the idea that we were serious because I kept traveling back and forth to be with him, and in his house with his friends we were together and behaved like boyriend and girlfriend. There was nothing weird. But still never spoke openly about where we stood. I got silent many times because it did really upset me. 
So in december I stayed in Portugal and became distant. Even spoke to his friend who was my roomate about it, she only said that he liked me and he was shy. 
In january, in spite of the lack of proper communication I went to surprise him for his birthday, and that is the time that everyone was like introducing me to new people as his girlfriend and I spoke in private with some of them and they all said that he talks about me as his girlfriend and that he talks a lot about me.
So I was happy but sad in a way, because we never had that conversation, not even when I tried again. 
The thing is, he is really shy, he never talks about many things with me. He seems to be nervous all the time with me.
I hate it.
When we are with his friends, he's always talktive and with women even more. They are  French and I can understand very little of it, so I ask them to speak in English so I can be part of conversations. His friends try but he never does. I can sit there for hours without being part of it and he doesn't seem to care. 
I spoke to him about all of this and still he keeps doing it.
The thing is I'm arranging everything to move there in a week and learn French. But I don't feel like it would be worth it. Even thought he thinks of me as his girlfriend and tells me he loves me, I don't think it's going to be a very good relationship.

187,"I'm going to keep myself detached as if I go too deeply I'll never get out of my feelings

So here goes.... 


I graduated highschool in 2016. Two years ago. I was 17 then. I decided for some reason to go to the same city both my brother's studied in, I also mainly chose it for the distance and familiarity while having some nice uni's and generally nice public transport. 

I joined a foundation thing instead of immediately applying to uni because I was lacking in maths. Shit didn't work out because of multiple factors. My awkward lack of social skills, anger issues, somewhat antisocial tendencies, dislike of anything overtly loud, walking is weird since back home the main mode of transport was being driven around and I stayed in a dorm 20 minutes away by feet. I'd like to add in the fact I'm overweight and spend 90% of my time in my room. 10% for school. So it was... Weird. I'm used to it now but before when this started it was a nightmare. I didn't manage to get in time to all of my classes. I had difficulty making friends or maintaining them (this kind of still stands true until now) 

And in one of the groups, there was this person who dislikes me when I ask clarification on their ideas. I've just been late once or twice but get outted quickly as I'm disliked by her. But whatever, that really made me dislike school as I hate drama or tension so I stayed away and my motivation lowered and so did my attendance. The admin told me my best bet was to withdraw or else there'll be an issue with my Visa so I did. Withdraw. 

I was supposed to apply to an architect program but literally on the day when I was on my way to pay for it, they sent out an email saying the program was full. Freaking fantastic.

So I hazardly  made a plan b of going the bachelor of arts route. Politics and psychology has always been interesting. 

My father who pays for all this is understandably unhappy at my constant switcheroos, and so are my brothers. I had to be dramatic for them to not send me back home and said I'd kill myself if I decided to change anymore. So ok. I'm stuck with doing psychology. Fine. I'm okay with this.

Hither to this new place for arts. I got... Too heavily involved with this one person who deeply hurt me (as friends, and it was the first time I've ever been this close to someone) so it hurt a lot. And I couldn't stand going to class anymore and started avoiding school since I didn't want to see her. My room was a mess. I was basically depressed. But I didn't tell the counsellor I was meeting that. Just... I ended up releasing a lot of old baggage instead from the past which was nice but at the same time not so nice since what she wants me to focus on is my academics and not my pained feelings which hurts so I stopped seeing her(the counsellor) too as a result. 

Then second trimester starts. There was an issue with reenrolling. I ended up joining late. I'm immediately isolated as I'm three weeks in late. Then I ended up not going to classes because I was trying to catch up but I couldn't. I kept on procrastinating and I keep on trying to dedicate days to focus and start but I couldn't bring myself to do so for some reason. I'm not a bad writer. I'm not a great one either. For reference, I got a 4 in my AP Lit. Which was more than what my AP Lit teacher expected of me, but she also dislikes my guts as I used to be mute and had incredible difficulty in talking to people which she assumed as arrogance so there's that

And now I'm 2 hours away from the last due date (already late over 30% off ) and I hadn't done a thing. I've had sleeping issues, put it off. Ended up doing work and drowning myself on moving and finding/making friends and my other interests/hobbies 

And idk what's going to happen to me

They might kick me out. I didn't tell my family (dad and brothers) about this at all. The last time I visited home when I hinted at possibly having a delay, they blew their top so I'm afraid and also yet I'm accepting. I deserve whatever they decide to punish me with and yet I'm so afraid and I'm also so fascinated with how much I can get away with 

I'm fucked up

What should I do

I sent an email to book a time to meet with my counsellor and I'm afraid 

I think her patience is running thin on me. Sometimes it feels like I am depressed, sometimes just lazy, sometimes my heart hurts so much I can't breathe or there's a wet patch on my chest but when I bring my hand down there's nothing there and my head is in a constant fog. I'm 98% certain my thought processes are not clear right now, fogged up with stress and feelings and guilt and anger and frustration and sadness and I'm confused with everything 

Someone help me this is the first time I've ever been this honest online and I'm definitely certain I deserve the backlash for whatever this will receive. I'm just pathetic, the rant Rick tells Jerry I think applies to me. I make people feel sorry for me subconsciously (and consciously now I guess idk what the fucm js wrong with me I feel so detached these days trying to distance myself from my emotions as I end up feeling wanting to physically strangle someone or deck something idk sigh) ",02Feb2018,2
188,"My ex and I were together for just over a year. He broke up with me but got back together a few times during the course of the relationship. We finally officially broke up a few weeks ago. I know, it hasn't been that long. However it was mutual and actually we decided to remain friends because we still had a good friendship and neither of us wanted to just throw that away. We broke up because it was clear that the relationship would not work out in the long term for various reasons; mainly, differences between us.

Admittedly, being friends did make it more difficult to separate completely. We still spent time together and also continued having a sexual relationship. It was like being in a relationship but without the commitment. For this reason, he said he didn't want to continue the sexual relationship. It was making it difficult to completely move on. I said ok. But I also said we should see each other less as well, since we saw each other a few times a week still.

Now the problem I need advice on: I find myself already wanting to find someone else. I don't know if it's because I'm not used to being single (I've been in a relationship most of the time since I was 14, I'm 21 now; I've hardly ever been single since then). But also not sure if I want a long term, committed relationship. Part of me just wants to date, meet new people, etc. Maybe have something casual. I feel like I've had too many long term relationships and they never work out, usually for the same reasons; perhaps I should just do dating (as in, just meeting guys), learn what I want in a partner, what I don't like etc..

but I don't want to date people just because I don't like being alone. I feel it's not right. Although does it matter if it's just seeing people and not having a committed relationship?

I also fear it's too soon.. it hasn't even been a month yet. Although like I said it was mutual, and I kinda saw it coming anyway (given that he broke up with me before several times).

I dunno, I am wondering if perhaps I should just stop seeing people for a while and learn to be more independent. Because I think this wanting to date is more out of loneliness rather than actually wanting to have a committed relationship. What's your take?",02Feb2018,2

I have many lovely memories of us together that I’ll treasure forever; although the past few weeks (as she moved away last month) have been very difficult, it proved too much for her and she just broke up with me over text. She explained her reasons and we both thanked each other for the memories and wished each-other good luck. I know it sounds silly, but it sort of hurts more knowing it was a calm break up and a simple goodbye... I am currently sitting in my room feeling sick and fighting back tears.

192,"Alright, I'm a grade 9 student in high school. From elementary school to grade 8, my grades were on point. In all of my subjects I would always get A's (except for gym...  always got a B there since I'm not really all that athletic but I tried my best anyways). But ever since starting grade 9, my grades just weren't as good as they used to be. I'm not failing any of my subjects, but remember that I used to be an A student. I'm now more of a mostly B/A- student, sometimes I still get A's, and I have that one random C plus I got on my French test. So I've been stressed about my grades going down, but for the most part I'm still doing alright I guess. However, I just got my math project back today, and I found out I failed it. I didn't even pass, just bombed it. Keep in mind that for math I'm more of a B/A- student as well, so failing this was a really big shock to me. However, the teacher did say that mostly everyone did it improperly and got a bad mark (a C- on this project was considered good/was the average mark, that's how badly most people did on it). I'm honestly not too upset, since I saw this coming (I realised there were a lot of mistakes in my project but dumb me in the past didn't change them for some reason). It's just been sitting on my mind a lot, and I don't know where to go from here. In my whole life, this is the first time I have ever failed something. Of course, this doesn't help my current stress of my falling grades. So... that's it. Just wanted to get it off my chest and see if anyone could give me advice. I've been thinking about my fail and my failing grades a lot lately, probably too much since I'm so stressed out about them. Any advice on how to deal with my stressful situation and how to get over my fail?",02Feb2018,2
193,"I'm in grade 11, and I don't know but the most cliche thing happened. I've liked this girl for a year and a half and it's been a tough 18 months. I'm sad to admit that I thought I'd never get over her so I ghosted her for 4 months, which I really regret. We just had a conversation and she said during the summer she saw something in me. We're extremely close by the way. So after the whole ghosting thing her and I started to talk again and I told her about my feelings. She said what she said about the summer. And she told me I made her happy whenever I talked to her, and I told her knowing that also made me happy, and since it's 5 in the morning we decided to sleep but I can't cause this is so surreal.

Tomorrow i will go to a birthday party, for our mutual friend but he tells me ""dont be rude"" ""be nice ok?"" and so on. I really dont know why he tells me this. With my FRIENDS of coursse im a little bit loosen up but i never harmed others. We are adults and i think if someone has a problem with me, he/she can tell me.

One month ago i asked our mutual friend how they met (they are a couple) and my best friend bashed me how i dare. I asked this mutual friend am i asked something bad or something, they were totally cool with me.

I have a feeling that my best friend dont like how i behave (with friends im the funny guy) because he thinks, our friend going to think bad about him, because of me. He want to meet non existing standards or i fdont know.

Im feel im the bad one because of he tells me i should behave myself.  this is humiliating to see our friends and with the think that ""you should behave because XY said so"". I think  FRIENDS should like you because who you are and the FRIENDS are the group where you dont have to hide your true self.

198,"So the context here is that I live in Florida and this girl I like lives in Canada and we talk like literally all the time. We met up at an event we mutually went to and fooled around but didn't have sex. The entire weekend she was kinda on her phone which bugged me a bit. We talk on the daily so it didn't bother me and I kinda fell for her and it felt the same from her end. On Wednesday night she told me she's hanging out with a mutual friend of ours who lives in Canada on Friday. I asked if it was a date or something and she reassured me that it wasn't but she asked me what I would do if it was a date. I told her that I would be happy for her but I could no longer be there for her in the way we were talking. She's had only 2 relationships before both long term and from what she's told me it seemed like she was basically being emotionally abused in both. So I went out of my way to get her some gifts and stuff she would appreciate and even have preplanned ordered her Flowers and Candy for Valentine's Day cause she told me that she's never had anyone do anything for her on that day. 

The past 3 days she's been ""annoyed"" with her step mom and has been incredibly moody with me over text conversations leaving my messages either on read for a half hour or more at times and eventually responding with one word similar to ""okay"" ""lol"" ""wtf"" ""awhh"". Those are her basically go to responses with me or some sort of emoji. I said something to upset her yesterday apparently and she proceeded to ignore me the whole day but I can kinda see when she gets on messenger to message our mutual friend back and she basically was on all day talking to him. She's meeting him today and emotionally I'm worried and I feel spent and drained on all aspects of this matter. 

What should I do Reddit? Should I ask her to talk to me and be honest about why she's changed her attitude towards me recently? Should I just get out now and leave her be? I've never been more confused in my life and never felt so emotionally drained on a matter. ",02Feb2018,2
199,"-New boyfriend
-His friend is a model, who although I dont think is pretty, is clear that he thinks she's gorgeous
-They have intimate hugs, although he hugs everyone quite intimately it makes me uncomfortable when he does this.
-Her fb photos are her in her lingerie!
-She is featured in many of his fb photos
-I challenged him about it about he said, ""You're as beautiful as her"", ""I choose you"", ""I dont want to be with her"", ""i see her like a sister"". 
The ""you're as beautiful as her"" comment really bugs me, makes me seem like I'm almost on her level-and I actually had to push him to say that because I said, ""You think she's prettier than me.,"" he paused for like ages then said that. I think I'm prettier than her personally, but I know beauty is subjective. i've had previous partners think I'm absolutely the most gorgeous woman they've met-and I prefer men who believe that obviously.

I don't have male friends that are gorgeous like her. I would find it hard to make male friends that would intimidate him, but I feel myself wanting to get them just to make him jealous.
I always think they're on the phone together or hanging out. it drives me crazy. I told him he should be with her and he says its not like that. Also made a comment that he friendzoned her-but he told me earlier in the relationship he friendzones in order to make them want him more. Further to this, she is older than him. One day his friend said, ""I'm not into older women"", and he within half a second, so quick, was like ""oh I am!"" (I'm not older than him).

What should I do? How do deal with this? It makes me dislike him.

205,"Right now I’m living in Southern Africa and I have two dogs and a cat. I was never supposed to have that many, but alas, we are here. I’m planning on taking my precious animals home. 

The advice I’m asking for is in regards to getting my puppies home. First, you should know that when I go home in some months, I’m going to have about $7,000 to my name. You should also know that I need some of that money to move back to a major city where I’ll have to rent expensive housing. 

My cat can be brought in the cabin with me, on my way home. However, the dogs will be more complicated to get back. They are medium sized and can’t be in the cabin. Here are the options for my puppies: 

1. I take Ethiopian Airlines, where I can take two dogs in cargo for the extremely low price of “excess baggage”. There is very little information on the conditions, and no reviews online. However, I know of three people who have done it successfully. 

2. I take any airline, and hire a shipping company to get my dogs back safely, handling all the layovers and such and making sure they are on the most direct flight in a safe storage area. This would be at least $1,200 for each dog. Most people in my country use this when taking their animals back. 

3. Leave them. 

Just kidding about number 3! I love them with all of my heart, and my biggest need is just for them to get back to my country with me, safely. However, the cost of two would be a bare minimum of $2,200. Is that way too much to spend, when I need the money to get an apartment and such? Is it worth it to check my dogs in cargo? Do people do this and it’s not as bad as I think? 

Just some additional information about my financial situation: I’m a grad student with some loans, but when I go home I’ll be living for free with my family for a bit. Some months later, I’m planning on finding a job and moving back to my city where I’m finishing out my degree. But as of now, I have no money. 

Of course, I want to take the first option but I’m frozen with fear that they’ll be killed in cargo. Doing some internet research didn’t help, because I read some horror stories that happened on much shorter flights and much more reputable airlines. I need to know what the right decision for this is, financially and emotionally and risk wise?

206,"So I got a job at a bar/bistro, often I'm person who floats between areas like the sports bar, bistro, and gaming area. Overall the job is not bad and I'm on a 3 month trial period, I really want to keep going with this work while I sort stuff out at home/save cash before I move towns.

The issue is there's a chef who is rude af to me and has been since day 1. I've met lots of chefs considering I've worked a lot in hospitality most of them are normal then you get the Gordon Ramsey wannabes. With this chef I have never been rude to him yet he talks to me like total dirt, throws dockets at me, just starts REEEEEEing at me at random, one day I gave him clear instructions on how this person wants a meal made then he said he won't cook the meal because I didn't tell him how the meal was meant to be cooked then a waitress repeated exactly what I said *then* he cooked the meal, other times at random he will scream random vague instructions at me like ""get me beer!"" We have like 8 beers on tap so I don't know which one he wants or how much, he also speaks to me like dirt then causally expects me to put through staff drinks for him and serve them to him, plus he has a speech problem that makes him hard to understand but he goes off his head if you ask him to repeat what he says, etc which then if you go to confirm orders, take a customer request back, or ask if the kitchen has something or not he'll talk rudely to me or act as if I'm stupid, yet if the meal gets fucked up he'll go off because we should have checked with him; ultimately being hard to do and total put off due to this fat ugly man speaking to you like dirt every time you do.

I mentioned something to one of my managers about the chef's behaviour while we were working because I was venting, she mentioned it to our shift manager who then talked with me about. We agreed to let it slide this time. I can usually understand salty behaviour as a once off or so considering everyone has shitty days, yet this chef is being constant. Today he called up to get a take away, then started screaming at me like a crackhead over the way I was taking the order which I was doing via  company policy which he is fully aware about.

However he's been there for ages so everyone is used of his behaviour, apparently he's made several people cry then all he does is say 'I'm sorry :(' after management tells him off, only to go do it again. Also people there just brush off his behaviour like ""Oh that's just 'Chef', don't take any notice"" basically where they've accepted this behaviour. No other chefs who work there act like him.

What I want advice on is what to do in regards of this such as: ignore this chef's behaviour like the others because I've only been there a month and I'm on a trial so I should keep the peace? take it up with management? Privately tell him I am not tolerating the way he speaks to me and to stop it? Or wait until he starts again then formally tell him off openly in front of others? I haven't been there long enough and they're all sort of cozy/used of each other so I'm not sure if this will turn the others against me. Yet I don't go to work to get spoken to like that especially by a staff member.

207,"I got set up with this girl through her twin sister who works where I live and became friendly with. She is 23, I am 21, we have gone out on quite a few dates and everything has been going well apart from the sex.

The first time was around my place, we did quite a lot of foreplay and then I took her to my bed and got stuck in, after about 10 minutes she told me she was coming and I presume she did, I came close over the next 10 minutes but then she started pulling faces like she was in pain and I noticed, she said it hurt a little bit, so I said I was happy to stop, she said afterwards that her ex who she had been with for 7 years prior to meeting me was 'half the size' of me, which I guess was an exaggeration but had truth to it.

The second time was last night, I went round her house and we got into it while we were lying in her bed, she gave me a short blowjob then I ate her out for around 10-15 minutes which she seemed really into, with her really forcing my head into her and saying she was coming. I laid on my back and she climbed on top and struggled to even get me inside of her, she gave up pretty quickly, got off of me and said 'im too tight', I was naturally disappointed but didn't communicate that to her, just said something along the lines of 'its okay I don't want to do it if it will hurt you'. After I said that she got up and put her pyjamas back on, with no offer of any other way to get me off (her blowjobs are quite teethy around my girth and I don't think I could get off from one but an offer still would have been nice) this felt me leaving a bit used as I felt like both times she has gotten what she wanted but left me all worked up, both times were akin to stopping piss midstream, although I haven't told her this.

Am I just feeling bitter about it or do I have an actual reason to be upset? I have ordered some lube for next time and if it doesn't go well, I am really going to question whether it's worth pursuing a relationship with her if last night will be the standard for our sexual activity. Obviously sex isn't everything but I would rather not do anything sexual if I'm to perform and meet her needs with none of mine being met at the same time. How should I go about communicating this with her ? It isn't her fault that she is too tight and not my fault I am too big so that has made me think it just won't work between us, no matter how much I might want it to.

212,"Hello all!

Very new to Reddit but needed some advice - it's a long one! Fellow/ex university students, have you ever been called in for an academic integrity meeting re. supposed plagiarism? 

I was called in once while doing my undergrad - I transferred from another uni straight into 2nd year so missed out on all the plagiarism talks. I had never heard of Turnitin (Plagiarism checker) and none of my friends or lecturers ever mentioned it so I had no idea all students were using turnitin before submitting assignments, so of course, after a year and a half of blissful ignorance, I was called in for supposedly 'plagiarising' my work (&amp; was found NOT guilty, I had simply forgotten to use quotation marks for a quote i'd used!) and of course was very neurotic and paranoid about the same thing happening again. They still gave me an absolutely terrible mark for the essay, which ultimately ended up being the reason I didn't get a First in my degree :(  

Fast forward to today, I decided to do a Masters and liked my uni so much I chose to stay where I am. I have just been called in for another academic integrity meeting. But here's the odd thing: I obviously put the assignment through turnitin before submitting, and it came up as 26% and green, meaning it was ok to hand in. I scanned through it and nothing was obviously copied and pasted or anything (I wouldn't do that anyway!). Handed in and thought nothing more of it. My lecturer sent me back the assignment i'd handed in and the turnitin score was 43%!! I couldn't figure out why, until I looked through it and realised that the coversheet (which everyone has to use so always gets highlighted on turnitin) brought the overall percentage up by 17%!! Other than that there's the odd word and phrase which are highlighted but they are all my own words, no big blocks of text!

I'm not sure how behave this time in the meeting. I took a very timid approach last time and simply admitted ignorance and let myself feel extremely guilty (which looking back, I cannot believe no one told me to use turnitin after i transferred!). This time, I'm cross and do not want to be made to feel guilty OR get a c**p mark, as I don't think it is justified. 

Should I take more of an aggressive approach during the meeting and kick up more of a fight? Or would being more accepting and apologetic of any wrong doing work better in my favour? They have a way of making you feel you've done something really terrible, and I'm scared of being pushed into an admission of guilt this time.

Thanks!",02Feb2018,4
214,"Hey y’all, I’m in the process of finishing up a complete over haul of my resume since I have not been getting any bites on my old one.

215,"(RUNDOWN AND TL;DR At the bottom, this one is long) 
In the span of about 4 months I’ve been involved with 4 different girls. I broke up with a girlfriend of 4 years (Denice). Afterwards I moved quickly (only took a week) and dated a spectacular girl (Joana) for a month, though I knew her for longer. When I was with Joana I discovered I loved her. I found her to be near perfect for me in a lot of ways; she was actually funny, cute, nerdy, everything I want. Though quite frankly I might never know for sure as our relationship was still in the “honeymoon” phase when we were forced to break up (the relationship was going long distance and we agreed it’d be too hard. Essentially she’s the one that got away.)

Joana did a lot for me in terms of raising my self confidence where being with Denice did the opposite. Coming out of the short and blissful relationship with Joana taught me what I deserve and how I should be treated. 
When I arrived at my new residence I didn’t waste any time. Less than two weeks after breaking up with Joana I was going on tinder dates and regular dates. 

Of these dates, two girls came up

The first girl was Lilly, and we seemed to hit it off.  Lilly is a total pothead but really beautiful. After three dates I was going down on her. She wanted to have sex but my gut feeling was to not do it. I wanted to have meaningless sex with her but I just couldn’t do it. It wasn’t even necessarily because of Joana, I just had a bad feeling about it. Lilly and I haven’t talked much, I feel like we have each other down in “black books” but for right now nothings happening.

The second girl is Rebecca. Rebecca is a good friend and I am almost certain I want to make her the next official girlfriend. She’s funny, cute, nerdy, and into abstract memes like my gay ass. We’ve gone out like 5 times as friends but we haven’t done ANYTHING. I know if I go for it I can probably “make her mine” but I clearly think I’ve got some stuff to figure out.

🅱️🅱️🅱️RUNDOWN: It’s been a month since Joana (the one that got away) and I broke up and I think I’m ready to move on to another official relationship. I’m just feeling rather strange how I only took a week to move from girl to girl. Is something wrong with me? Do I get caught on new girls too quickly? Or am I polyamorous and capable of loving more than one person at a time? Or is this just the behavior of someone who got out of a 4 year relationship and was released into the world of adult dating? Am I just rebounding? I honestly have no idea. I know some people would say take a break from dating, but tbh I don’t like that idea. I don’t want to get Rebecca caught up in my mess yet though.

TL;DR: I was able to move on from a 4 year relationship in a week. I find I can like multiple girls at the same time, maybe even love. Is this the behavior of someone who’s polyamorous, rebounding, discovering the world of adult dating for the first time outside of a 4 year relationship, or just a sap that’s gets caught on new girls too quickly? Should I try to get into another official relationship and chill out? ",02Feb2018,2

For a lot of my adolescence and teenage years I thought of myself as being bisexual, leaning more towards the “gay side” of the spectrum. I have had experiences with men before which confirmed this (both physical and emotional). But have also had feelings for females once or twice during high school. 

However recently I have been leaning more towards the “straight” spectrum and a lot of the time not being turned on by men as much as I used to be. Im seeing myself watch straight porn more often and not feeling the post masturbating blues as opposed to when watching gay porn I feel repulsed afterwards.

223,"So, this is a year long battle that I am slowly losing. I'm getting angrier and angrier at work. All thanks to one co-worker and our boss.

The place I work tries to help people find work who have been unemployed for a while. It's mandatory for people to attend if they've been claiming benefits for a while. Refusal to do so or not taking part means your benefits will be cut/impacted. Anyhow in this lovely business I am the first point of contact for all of our clients. I sign them in, check their appointment, answer general queries and reimburse their travel expenses (if eligible). I'm expected to be the first barrier and take on the brunt of peoples tantrums when things don't go there way. Also need to do some investigations if things don't appear right.

Anyhow, lately whenever I've been pulling people up about things which aren't right, I'm immediately told that I'm in the wrong by my boss. Bare in mind these aren't little things. Like one person coming in half an hour late for an appointment, claiming this is the time the letter stated. Ignoring the fact that I printed off the letters, I packed the bloody things and posted them myself. No princess, it did not say 10:00 learn to read and stop pretending to be upset because you've been caught lying. AGAIN. But apparently I shouldn't be ""starting arguments"".

This happens. Every. Damn. Day. Doubting my decisions, questioning my work, generally making me feel like I'm less than nothing to them. I am desperately trying to seek alternative employment but it's slow going. All in all it's really getting to me. I am stressed out of my mind, barely sleeping (now on day 4 with no sleep...) and my anger is going haywire.

I'm physically having to restrain myself from punching walls and/or people. Biting my tongue almost every conversation. I dread to think what effect it's having on my blood pressure and heart. Thanks to a hereditary heart condition that got revealed 2 Xmas' ago, that too is playing on my mind.

So reddit, here's my question, how do I calm down and try to not let things get to me? I'm taking breathers, I'm stopping and looking out at the (thankfully nice) view, trying to talk to my boss is a no-go. She thinks I'm making it up to get out of work. Can't get time off to see a shrink either. So I'm stuck and need help. Please?

225,"So I've had this cat since I was 12. I moved out of my parents house at 18 and left him at my parents house with my other cats (I had 3 cats in total). Well in November 2016 my mom took one of them to be euthanized without telling me (he was about 11 years old and sick so I was going to do it) and that really fucked me up and I was in denial until the next year January 2017. Then got angry and decided that I needed to get my other two cats away from my mother. I was going to find them new homes but I saw an ad on craigslist that a lady was renting out rooms in the other apartment of her duplex and that pets were allowed. So I move in there with my two remaining cats and live in a private room from February 2017 to November 2017.
Long story short, the lady and my roommates were crazy and I spent my entire time there saving for a car, trying to find a home for one of my cats and going to therapy to register the other one as an Emotional Support Animal so I could move out into an apartment complex. Well on the night before I was going to give one of my cats to a really great couple that wanted him, one of my roommates tried to attack me. I fled the house with my cats and crashed at my parents house. Next morning I relinquished my cat of 8 years to his new owners. I got out of that lease so I stayed with my parents and my remaining cat until January 2018 when my cat finally got registered as an ESA and I was able to move into an apartment complex. 

Now, after all that, I forgot to ask my roommates of the apartment complex I moved into if they had cat allergies, and two of them did but I had already signed the lease. 

It's been a month living here, and it's been fine, no disputes. But I have to keep my cat in my room the majority of the time and he has to be on leash to be in other areas of the apartment. 

So one night I was really sad and put an ad on a pet finder website for him. I found a really great family that wants him, and I arranged to drop him off tomorrow.

After all I went through to keep him, I feel like I'm giving up on him. He's depressed because he can't go outside anymore, he's been an outdoor cat all of his life. And it's just really hard for me to make him happy here. I'm 20 now, making $11 an hour and going to school so I don't have time or energy to take him outside on walks. But I feel like I actually do need an Emotional Support Animal because I'm severely depressed and some days he's the only reason I come home after work. I don't want to be selfish and only keep him here, when he could be an outdoor cat for another family, just because I need him. I do need an ESA but he's also like my child of 8 years and I want him to be happy.

I don't know, should I give myself more time? To see if he settles down? To see if he starts enjoying being cooped up in my small room as I neglect taking him on walks? I'm walking the line of needing an ESA and being too self-absorbed and depressed to take care of one. I can't give him back to my parents because they would just feed him and leave him outside on his own, plus I think my mother would kill him. 

Anyways, I'm set to drop him off to his new home tomorrow, and I just don't want it to be something that I can't emotionally handle and I just suppress him and all the good memories. ",02Feb2018,0
227,"I used to be a pretty big asshole. I was antisemitic and homophobic in high-school. I was deep into drug and alcohol abuse in college. Some old roommates, who I was very close to, believed that I raped an ex-girlfriend (alcohol was involved), a claim which she never made herself and which I discussed with her afterward. I flaunted my wealth at colleagues, friends, and family.

Over the years, I have made significant changes to every aspect of my life and behavior in order to become the opposite of what I was. I am still deeply troubled whenever I think about the kind of person that I was.

I have tried my best to shut the last 30 years of my life out of my memory but I feel that some or all of the people that have experienced me will remember who I was and will try to use that to blackmail or threaten me out of this new position (it is very likely that they will read about me or see me on the news). 

I haven't seen most of them in over 10 years. I don't think contacting them individually and telling them ""I've changed"" will be very fruitful. But I am very concerned that I will be forced to resign if my employer learns of any of this.

255,"I have pretty severe anxiety and bipolar disorder. So it's not uncommon for my brain to create a worst case scenario and paint a huge, elaborate picture with it. I know that more than likely, this is the case. But I thought I'd ask for some advice. 

&amp;nbsp; 

So first off, I've never had penetrative sex. My boyfriend (24/m) doesn't believe in pre-marital sex, so that most we've done is have his penis rest on the outside of my vagina (I know its weird, but that's not why I'm here). The last time we had ""sex"" was Sunday. He has never ejaculated on or near me, but I'm sure there has inevitably been some pre-cum around the outer part of my vagina. I am currently on BC and have been for 5 years. It definitely helps with my flow and severity of my cramps, but never did much for my regularity. It's not abnormal for me to start my period 3-5 days before OR after I'm ""supposed"" to start. This was the case again this cycle, where I started my period Wednesday instead of today. Again, totally normal for me. 

&amp;nbsp; 

I recently began a new weight training and weight loss program. Last week, I pulled a muscle in my lower back and was told not to return to the gym for a few days. Not a big deal really, unless anxiety likes to ruin your life. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Fast forward to today. I woke up from a bad dream where I had just found out that I was pregnant. I didn't think anything of it but found it difficult to fall back asleep. I went to the bathroom and changed my tampon (which looked normal in color and amount). I took some Tylenol for some light cramping and back pain (from the pulled muscle) and went on with my day. 

&amp;nbsp;

As I was leaving to go to work, I told my Mom, ""My back hurts, and my nipples hurt (which happens sometimes with my periods), and I'm cramping."" She said, ""Yeah, that's how it feels the entire time you're pregnant."" I almost lost it. &amp;nbsp; I have a logical explanation for every ""symptom"" I'm experiencing; nothing out of the norm is happening. My period looks and feels fine, my back is supposed to be sore, my nipples regularly become tender when I have my period, everything is fine. No nausea, no irregular mood swings, no fevers, nothing that would be indicative of an early stage pregnancy. The only thing that caused this panic is that I had a bad dream and now I'm paranoid. 

&amp;nbsp;

Does it sound like I have a cause to be concerned? Or am I making a huge deal out of nothing? Obviously, I know that taking a test is the only way to be 100% certain, but I think its a little soon to be going to that extreme.",02Feb2018,1

I'm glad that you are reading my post. I'd be really grateful for any comments and thoughts, it means a lot for me.

Well, my big problems is, as the title already says, that I don't have interests. Well, this might be a bit exaggerated, so I have very little interests. 
Not enough interests to have a stable conversation with people: I can talk about the beautiful weather or my last r my grades, but that's it. I am unable to have a deeper conversation, cause I have nothing to tell about myself. 
This makes meeting new people extremely difficult. When someone asks me: 'So, how do you spent your free time actually ?', I am done, cause I have nothing to talk about. I could say 'I play video games all day long', but I don't see this as a part of myself. Playing video games is just a distraction from my real life, and makes me really unhappy. Everytime I stopped playing video games,  I became really bored.

People could argue that I should try more things. This seems right, but I tried a lot of stuff and it all ended up the same. My parents actually did a good job on this, they made me playing soccer, basketball, tennis and some other stuff, I started playing the guitar and the piano, but I never stuck with anything. And tbh, I was never satisfied with those things.

One year ago, I tried to get in music production. The first month was quite interesting, but I lost interest again. 
At this point I started to ask myself: What am I doing wrong?
I thought it could be a lack of discipline. So, I forced myself to continue making music. But it all ended up more frustrating.

I really don't know what to do, and another question that crossed my mind was: 'How is interest created ?'Why is person x interested in y?

265,"In high school, a girl I was friends with went to a costume dance. Her and her boyfriend dressed as the Obamas - in blackface. This was just after he was elected the first time - so almost ten years ago. 

This girl loved Obama, campaigned for him, went to his inauguration, etc. Her and I even saw him speak together. 

As a kid in high school, maybe I didn't understand it was offensive or didn't think it was my place to tell her it was an offensive costume. I think that the reality is I knew how much she admired and adored the Obamas, and it didn't cross my mind that what she was wearing was not just her paying homage to two individuals she looked up to. Obviously as an adult, I now understand that it was inappropriate and offensive for her to dress that way, regardless of her feelings on Obama.

Anyway, she has multiple photos of herself and her boyfriend in blackface on Facebook. They are buried deep in albums from a decade ago...but they are there. I am also in one photo.

This girl is smart and likely has a career in government ahead of her. She's graduating soon with a law degree and a PhD in econ. 

However, her and I aren't really friends anymore. There was never an end to the friendship, it just fizzled out I suppose. But there was always an air of competition between us - we did many of the same activities in high school, went to similar undergrad schools, and both went to dual degree law school/grad school programs. This, I think, makes me unsure of how to handle this...but it has been making me uncomfortable for a long time now and I think I need to deal with it.

So, I have two concerns. First, one of the photos has me in it. (I was dressed as Waldo from Where's Waldo, and there are multiple other people in the photo). I obviously wish she had not chosen that costume, or that I had asked her not to do it, or that I had refused to engage in the event with her dressed like that. But, I can't fix that now. However, I don't want the photo on Facebook. I know it's out in the world forever, but I'd like it to at least not be on her current Facebook. 

Second, like I said, this girl is smart and on a path to major success. I know her as a compassionate (even in her competitiveness) and equality-driven person. I've never know her to exhibit racist thoughts or tendencies, except for this. For the sake of her career in government or law or higher education...i think it would be smart of her to take these photos down. 

I honestly don't know why she still has those photos up. I don't know if she thinks they are appropriate (i cant really imagine this) or if she has just totally forgotten about them. 

I want to gently let her know that she should take these photos down, especially the one that I am in. But I don't know how to handle it. It has probably been 3 or 4 years since we have spoken and, like I said, there is always a sort of strange competitiveness between us.

She then starts to irish jig and shakes the entire floor (old building). I tell her to please stop I’m trying to get work done before the weekend. This starts the entire feud. Apparently, I have offended her to the highest degree and she starts calling me “grumpy”. I ignore it.



Since this time, she has been exceeding rude to me. This includes leaving me out of office discussions, generally ignoring my existence, blatantly ignoring my good mornings, refusing to give me paperwork from other coworkers and asking other people to hand it off. I have told management about all of this. They just tell me to just stay clear of her. All the while I have tried to maintain a professional attitude and try just to put my feelings about her childness aside and just interact with her as little as I can but sometimes I need to.



Please also note that during my employee review I was deemed “not respectful” and didn’t uphold the “company values” because I didn’t like her. I told them all of what happened up till then and I was told by a manager (not my direct manager) that they had studied behavior for a large part of their life and maybe I was seeing something in her that I didn’t like about myself. That’s why I don’t like her. I casually agreed just to get it over with. There was no sense in me dragging it out and arguing. They had made up their mind.



The policy at my company requires employees to notify me at least a week in advance of a large mailout (part of my job). Everyone at the company follows this rule. I have even accommodated them to say I only need 24-48 hours even though policy says a week.



Fast forward to Dec 2017 – she sends me an email the day of and says I need this done today. It’s a large mailout and I have a lot of other things to do. I go to my direct boss and say that I can’t do this I have other things to do and I require notice. She speaks to said evil coworker and reminds her of the policy. Does the mailout herself – my boss that is.



Late Jan 2017 – the very issue is brought up in a staff meeting saying that you need to give notice of a large mailout. It is made clear that it is the upmost importance that I am given notice because it is a lot of prep work. This is plainly directed at her.



Yesterday – February 1st (a week after the meeting) – coworker emails me that she has a large mailout to go out today – boss isn’t here. No management is here. I politely, firmly and respectfully email her back advising that she cannot give me a same day notice and that she has to adhere to the policy and that I need at least 24-48 hours’ notice. Instead of apologizing and saying it won’t happen (you know like a grown up) she advises me that she will figure out herself and she doesn’t want or need to interrupt me and my workflow. I advise her that there is no need, I have already started but all I get is snide comments and attitude from her. I cc all correspondence to my boss and hers as well.



Later on, that day – after management gets back my boss talks to me and tells me what she wrote was unprofessional and it will be dealt with. I tell her that I am feeling harassed/ intimidated and that I have done nothing to her to warrant the attitude, rudeness and overall unprofessionalism. Boss agrees with me. What I did was not wrong, I did everything right.



Today I come into work and my boss asks me if I want to move from my desk and relocate to a completely different part of the office to accommodate her. Basically, her actions are going completely unpunished and practically rewarded. I don’t want to move, I’ve been here longer, I need to be where I am to accommodate other people in my office and helping them out. It feels like “ok if I was being sexually harassed by a man, would you ask me to move to accommodate him?’ like am I wrong in thinking this? I don’t know what to do. My boss basically tells me that if I make the decision to move then I am making the decision to stay in the hostile work environment and be near her (her office is right near my desk- I don’t have an office, just a desk). It truly feels like they are doing everything to accommodate her. I should also mention that while I get the worst of it she has been rude, annoying and blatantly disrespectful to other office employees. When it was reported, all they got was “she has a bit of a funny personality, just ignore it”. Apparently, being rude is a personality trait.



Reddit, please help I don’t know what to do. Should I move? Should I escalate it further? Is my employer being fair? Are they doing enough? Any advise is appreciated.

268,"im 22, female, just got my ba in psych and am working full time at a daycare making 15/hr. i scrape in about 1600 a month and found the perfect place for 900. its close to my job, by the train, and allows me to bring my cat (who is technically an esa, i had him in college due to severe depression which i still have but am managing one day at a time)

i know its cutting it extremely close but heres the thing - me and my parents dont get a long very easily. my parents divorced when i was 7 and i was living with my father and my step mom for 6 months after i finished college but they were slowly driving me crazy. they stopped speaking to each other for 4 of those months and my stepmother clearly doesnt want me in her life. one night, my father finally loses it and sends me into a depressive spiral (its hard to explain, he was being physical with me like grabbing me and not letting me walk away from him and there was a rage in his eyes that i had never seen in him before so i was scared shitless and still am. i dont want to be anywhere near him anymore. im already very weird with men after being sexually assaulted multiple times as a child by a close family member. what did i do to make my father so angry you ask? i left my keys in an uber which they kindly brought back that same night)

that night my mother came to get me because i didnt feel safe with my father anymore and ive been sleeping on an air mattress on the floor of our basement ever since. why you ask? because my mom rented her house to a stranger who just recently moved out. i left my cat with my father because theres no room for him in the basement and its making me extremely depressed to think my cat might forget me. nearly every night i come home from work (which i now have to take 3 trains and a bus to get to) and cry for hours until i finally fall asleep. my mom and her boyfriend are moving back into the house this month, and want me to move with them on the condition that i declaw my cat as to not ruin his furniture. i dont fully trust her boyfriend, and i absolutely do not want to live with him. my mom is extremely suffocating and manipulative at times.

i love her, but i know that if i continue to live with her for much longer, conflicts will arise. some people are telling me to stay and deal with it, and some are asking me why i havent moved out yet. i have to give my potential new roommate an answer tomorrow or she will give the place to someone else. all i want is to be emotionally stable, and i know i cant be while living with my parents. and on top of all this, my only close friend who i need support from is angry that i would even consider moving out and i dont understand why. please help.",02Feb2018,1
269,"Hi, I'm a long time lurker posting on a throwaway because of potential FBI involvement. Not sure if this is the right place to post, if it isn't, I would be happy to post in a more appropriate subreddit.

I'm looking to verify the plausibility of a story or in the case it is nonsense, be able to offer strong reasoning for it in case legal means need to be pursued for recovery. Research was done on my end but getting opinions from more qualified people is always a smart choice.

So the situation is as follows: Bitcoin was sent to someone who I inferred is using a software wallet and claims he no longer has access to it. He stated that the FBI had seized his computer as part of an investigation and when it was returned, the raid array was ruined and he was unable to access his data. After he contacted an FBI agent involved in the investigation, he was told that he could come and pick up a partial recovery of the data.

I personally am highly skeptical but I am unsure on how to definitively prove that this story is nonsense or how I would go about go about independently verifying that this incident happened (do I go to an FBI office and say ""hi, are you investigating [name redacted]?"").

All I have right now is a picture of some tagged equipment that doesn't show up on a reverse image search.

If I were to accept the claim that the computer was seized and then returned with a ruined raid array. Questions are raised about the following details:

From what I read, the FBI will image all of the data from computers that are being investigated. If there would be any point the raid array would be ruined, it would be at this step. How plausible would this be? If the purpose is to preserve evidence, it would be very careless to ruin the raid array and not make any mention upon returning the computer.

How can there be a partial recovery of data in a ruined raid array? In a striped setup, if a drive failed, the array would either be restored with a parity disk or virtually no amount of data would be recoverable. I assume it's a striped setup because there would've been no data loss if it was a mirrored array.

How reasonable would it be to request the full drive images from the FBI? If they offered a partial recovery, then I can assume the raid array was intact when they imaged the drives.

I am in a position where I can meet this person. Is there any advice for anything I should be looking for or ask about in order to validate this story or confirm it is complete nonsense?

I appreciate any help in this matter, thank you.",02Feb2018,1
272,"Skip to the second-to-last paragraph if you don't want to hear venting about my depression and just want to help me with the school issue. I'm really sorry for writing so much stuff I just want to let it out.

Hey guys, I've been depressed for quite awhile now. I began to spiral down and just stopped caring about everything. I crawled through my last semester (which was Spring 2017) in college and somehow got A's. I convinced myself that it was the one thing I shouldn't screw up on because my ticket out of this low middle class paycheck to paycheck life I've lived since birth was riding on my grades. Otherwise I just slept and cried and hated myself and only felt bitterness. I snapped more at my family and I was constantly angry, sad, or numb. Things were made worse when I experienced my first death when my grandmother died in June (my other grandmother also died in early 2017, but I wasn't as close to her). At the time I was making preparations for my transfer from community college to a nice university I got accepted into for my program. Once the tragedy struck I was basically on autopilot as I completed all my requirements for the transfer. Even had to have my parents buy me an expensive nonrefundable 2 year health insurance to be accepted in my program.

Fall came and during the first week of class I realized that I couldn't do it. My depression had slowed me down to the point where I felt barely anything except sadness and self hatred. My good grades where all I had and I just knew I would mess up if I pushed through the semester. This wasn't community college anymore, this was a full fledged university *and* it was the beginning of me actually studying for my degree. It wouldn't be as easy to push through my depression as it was in my CC. I approached my program's counselor for me to drop out for the year and reapply for 2018. He tried to convince me not to because the program was so competitive that there was a chance I wouldn't be accepted next year. My mind was made up so I dropped anyway (w/o financial repercussions since it was done the first week, no problem with FAFSA). I've spent the last few months trying to get back up on my feet and slap myself awake and it's been a process of many attempts and failures. The more I fail that more I've fallen into the hole. It's around that time where I have to reapply now for the same university's program, and I have no idea what to do...

When I got accepted to the Fall 2017 program as a transfer student (which makes it even more difficult) I had a 3.9 cumulative GPA and a 4.0 science GPA. No volunteering experience and no work experience in the field. There's also an exam we all must take to be considered for the program, which I scored an 89% on. They also didn't even view my interview video that we were all required to upload unlisted on YouTube. I'm very worried I won't be accepted again after dropping last time the first week and I honestly don't know what I would do if I don't. Who knows if the candidate pool has become more competitive. Now, with these scores and grades I have no idea whether I should retake the exam and aim to get over a 90%. The thing is this test costs like ~$200 to take and we would *really* struggle to pay this amount again. My dad is out of a job right now and he's our main bread winner.

I'm really conflicted on what to do here. Do I scrape the money or do I give it another shot with my 89%? I'm considering other universities to apply to just in case but I'd really rather get in this one. If there's any advice for my depression as well that's appreciated. Currently I'm trying to set goals for myself to complete during the day. This post for advice was one of them. I really appreciate you taking your time to read this. ",02Feb2018,1

280,"There is a woman I work with who I generally get along with, but she has a tendency to be very passive aggressive about things that annoy her and she also is one of those people who talks shit behind others' backs. I try not to participate in the shit talking and generally just run with a vague ""Yeah, anyways.."" type thing. But what is bothering me right now and what prompted this post is the immature way she handles issues at work. 

We have another workmate who sits nearby who for weeks on end was making super gross and distracting snorting noises and clearing her throat really loudly. It was gross and annoying. Equally annoying, though, was this coworkers reaction every time it happened. Instead of ever just saying something to her about it (which I eventually did), she would mutter audibly ""fucking stop"" and things like that. Honestly it got to the point where her bitchy reactions were more distracting than the snorting. When I'd had enough of it and it was clear it wasn't going to stop any time soon, I spoke to the girl who was snorting all the time and politely asked her to tone it down. Because that is how adults deal with their problems. 

Now, I've been dealing with the lingering effects of a cold/flu I had a few weeks ago. Basically, nasal drip causing me to need to clear my throat. I've been consciously trying not to clear it often and to be relatively quiet when I do. Unfortunately, after I finish eating it is really bad and I need to clear it to be able to breathe properly. 

I had no idea that this was bothering anyone around me, and if I did, I'd have doubled down my efforts to do it quietly or go out to the hallway. Though I think it is a bit petty to be that annoyed over a quick, fairly quiet throat clear, if it was brought to my attention politely I would try my best to stop. 

So, out of absolutely no where today, as I cleared my throat after lunch, she loudly said ""ok that needs to stop! It's been going on for weeks!"" Because I sit across a shared four person cubicle from her and it was only the two of us, when I hear her say something and don't catch it right away, my automatic reaction  is to ask ""What?"" Well, I asked what before my brain caught up to what she had said, but she didn't respond at all. So now I'm sitting here like, fucking really? You're gonna not say anything about something that's apparently been bugging you ""for weeks"" until you snap about It, and then when the person asks what you aid you're going to fucking ignore It? Jesus Christ..  this is a 37 year old woman... talk to me like an adult! 

Anyways, obviously I need to bring the issue up with her. But I am trying to figure out how to go about it. I figure I should just ask her if I can speak with her privately for a minute and either go into one of the empty office for a second or out in the hallway and just get straight to the point - if something is bothering You, you need to speak up politely and professionally. These types of snappy responses are inappropriate and only serve to breed a resentful atmosphere"".

Hi. I'm an 18 year old boy from Cape Town, South Africa. I've reached an age where I'm having to make many important decisions and there is one I'm not sure about (career path).

Well, over the past few months I've become more and more interested in genetics. I read about it. I love learning about it. I believe I would be happiest as a geneticist (or any other biology-related job of that doesn't work out) but I'm conflicted. 

Like I said, I'm from a 3rd world country. In most of the articles, books and papers I read about genetics and science in general, breakthroughs are often made by people from 1st world countries such as the US or China. This is my problem. 

I have no idea if it is worth it. If I study to be a geneticist/biologist of some sort, will it ever really mean anything if I'm not in a country leading in innovation and at the forefront of science? Will I ever really do anything of significance? I know there would be thousands of scientists who got a much better and higher-level education than mine, so what would be the point? My qualifications would mean nothing and my knowledge would probably be inferior.

There were adults around helping me with these tasks, including the 40-something man who is the subject of this post.

In this building, there was a basement that was used for storage and had a ton of random stuff in it like tents, furniture, paperwork, etc. On one of the days I was working, myself and the man were in the basement organizing some items and he was showing me around the basement; it was huge and had multiple rooms in it, so it could be complicated knowing where to put the specific things that we were organizing. 

While in the basement, he mentioned that there was a really comfortable chair that he liked to lounge in and wanted me to try it out. He told me to lay face down on the chair and then straddled me, rubbing my shoulders and ""massaging"" my back. I immediately was uncomfortable with this so I started squirming around and he (thankfully) got up and played it off, asking me if he hurt me to provide an explanation for why I got up so quickly.

Because nothing technically ""happened"" from this event, I've always been very unsure of how to handle it. I'm posting here because I need advice on what to do.

290,"I'm currently having some roommate issues, and right now I'm gathering info to attempt combating it, but I'd like to get some opinions on things. Any ideas?

_________________________ 

1) Temperature: Probably the biggest thing for me, I'm cold. I prefer 72 indoor all year round, but I'm willing to go to an even 70. My roommate (and her boyfriend, who is living with her for a few months until she moves out) insist on 68. Or lower. The problem is, I get frozen - feet, nose, etc. It's extremely uncomfortable, and honestly I think it's unreasonable to expect me to wear a ton of clothing in my own apartment just to stay remotely comfortable. 

Lately I've been keeping to myself in my room and running electronics to keep my room warm. By the morning if course, it's back to cold again. While insisting she's too hot, she moves the temperature down and leaves her window open (40s F outside). I think most of this is her issue: she always dressed warm, she has think blankets/comforters on her bed, she sleeps with her boyfriend (obviously?), and they have copious amounts of sex (interesting how heat works). During the day, she often leaves the window open along with her door, which further allows for the spread of cold, and the cost of heating. A month ago I offered to help pay for a door mat to help keep the cold in her room and she can shut the door. Nothing since, and she doesn't want to compromise. 

I'm tired of this, and I'd like a comfortable temperature. They think I'm strange and won't ever be warm. I'm planning on purchasing some thermometers and spreading them throughout the apartment to get a better understanding of the temperature, and then bring up the results to them.

2) Kitchen Cleanliness: I like to be able to cook, and use dishes. When I'm done with either, I clean up and load the dishwasher. For the past several weeks, every night there are piles of dishes in the sink, dirty dishes in a half loaded dishwasher, food goop on the counters, and grease splatters all over the oven. It's to the point that it's unusable, and I've reverted to eating out. I brought it to their attention last week, and their response was that they clean up all the time, and they always take care of the dishes. 

This past week I've used a total of 5~ dishes, and placed them all immediately in the dishwasher asap. I've also gone through and taken pictures every night of the status. Every night it's disgusting. I plan to bring these pictures forward this weekend and call them on their bullshit.

I'm also got a weird feeling of loneliness(?) about always being in the background of stuff my friends do and never doing anything noteworthy (even though I know it's mostly not true), and these calls of the void usually also include somebody noticing/finding me, so I think they may be some messed up cry for attention by my brain.

I'm living in a packed house and maybe it's just me but it seems like people look down on me or don't take me seriously because of my situation. I really want to prove them wrong but more to my self that I can get out of this rut. I'm running on E in this situation. I was thinking about saving up and buying a car with the little income I have, and also work on my health so I can be able to keep my jobs, but I need something productive to do that can give me results at the end. Any advice would be appreciated. Sorry if this all over the place, I  suck at writing.",02Feb2018,2

304,"So, first of all, this is a throwaway account because the friend in question browses reddit and knows my profile. For context: I am in high school and I ride next to this friend of mine (who I'll call Chris) on the bus everyday. I don't know or want to know anyone else on my bus, so I have no one else to talk to. This is going to sound stupid, but please read though it because I have no idea what to do in this scenario, and high school kids are terrible at giving advice honestly.

Okay, so I started sitting next to this guy on my bus a while back. And it started out fine, I thought he was a decent guy. Bit quirky and weird, but really everyone in high school is to some extent. Plus Chris had and has lots of friends, it's not like he's a loner so I thought there probably wasn't anything wrong with him. For about 3 months everything is cool. Then one day I'm talking about a certain male celebrity and I joked that I thought he was objectively attractive. I knew while saying it he was going to react, call me gay, we would have a laugh about it. 

So then the next day Chris started making gay jokes, like all the time. The entire bus drive was interspersed with jokes about how I was gay. I thought it was kind of imbecile, but it's high school, whatever, he'll be over it tomorrow. But no, he kept making these jokes, constantly, for the next month and a half I would say despite me telling him that I think it's stupid and he should come up with better humor. 

Then it escalated. Chris started telling other people, some of which I didn't know, that I was gay. Behind my back. I didn't find out about this until in the middle of class a mutual friend of ours asked me if I was gay. To which I responded that I was not and what had made him think that. He told me that Chris had been telling people I was gay. I ask him if he was doing it as a joke, but he told me that Chris had sounded serious.

So I ask Chris about this, and he tells me he was just messing around. I tell him about how my friend came up to me, and I tell him lightly to stop. I ask him who he had told I was gay, just so I would have an idea of who I should be wary of. He mentions that he told the girl that sits in front of us on the bus, who we occasionally talk to. She happened to be absent that day, but I figured I would talk to her about it tomorrow on the way to school. 

So the next day I start talking with her, explaining that I'm not gay, and she gives me a much larger list of people then Chris initially gave me. I turn to him and ask if this is true. He says yes. At this point I am visibly irritated, to the point I am cold with Chris. I ask the girl if she'll help me with damage control, and I suddenly hear quiet sobs coming from Chris, who has his face turned away and obscured with his arm. Chris is not an emotional person, and I had never and have never since seen him sad. Much less *crying*. So I awkwardly turn to the girl, who I think has noticed as well at this point, and I say something along the lines of how cleaning this mess up won't be so bad. 

So at this point I figured he got the message, and I don't bring up the gay situation on the return ride, and neither does he. And yet, I find out that the very next day he has started telling people I'm gay again. This time I look him in the eye and tell him firmly that this has to stop. I also make it clear I want the gay jokes to stop. I repeated this sentiment on the way home so that he really got the message. 

And for a while, everything was fine. He stopped making the jokes, no one came up to me and asked if I was gay. Skip ahead a couple weeks and slowly he starts making the jokes again. Every single time I remind him he promised to quit it. He keeps doing it, in increased frequency. Eventually I just give up. 

Skip ahead another few weeks. Chris starts doing this thing where whenever I say I'm tired he lightly hits me and tells me jokingly to wake up. No big deal. Then he starts hitting me harder. And harder. I tell him to quit it and he just keeps doing it. I'm stopped saying I'm tired but he just hits me randomly and says wake up now.

Fast forward to today. At this point, I've had enough. I decide I'm going to use his own techniques against him. He had told me way back (3-4 months ago) about he had gotten run over by a car. I made jokes about he got run over by a 60 year old woman because he wasn't paying attention. I did it for a while because I honestly thought that he thought it was as funny as I did. But I started to feel that he didn't like that joke for whatever reason so I stopped doing it after about a week or so.

So I knew he didn't like this particular joke and I figured I would use it to piss him off. I made I joke about how he got run over by a car and suddenly he just starts pummeling me *hard* and pushing me out of my seat. All while having his normal smile on his face, as if this is all in good fun. I tell him to stop, and that he's hurting me, and he stops. Same smile. 

I can't figure this guy I out. I don't think he's gay, I know I'm not his only friend and he has no problem socializing with people, and I don't see why he would hate me. As far as I know, I've done nothing to wrong him. Hell, I even told him I sorry if I did do something to offend him, to which he just laughed off and responded with a joke. I'm usually pretty good at understanding people's personalities and motivations, but this guy makes no sense to me. So what I'm asking is, what do I do? Because I just can't stand him anymore, but he's so integrated in my friend group I can't just ditch him. He sits right next to me on the bus everyday too. And I really don't want to cause drama.",02Feb2018,3

So, I'm in need of some help. 

I live with two roommates that are a couple and on top of that, one of them is my sister. Recently they have been fighting a lot and are not only loud, but the fights also spill out into the kitchen and living room areas. 

I think, since I usually keep to myself, that they think I'm ok with them fighting in the shared living space and having yelling matches in front of me.

How can I bring up my feelings about this to them in a way that is neutral and won't make it seem like I am critiquing their relationship? 

I don't want to take sides or have any part in the fights, I just want them to keep it to themselves.

Any help is appreciated.

310,"So my roommate is initially from Cameroon and then moved to France and is now in the US. Our room is a single room and he refuses to go into the hall to talk on the phone.

311,"I was cyberbullied all throughout highschool by a few girls. I never really did anything more than inform my school guidance counselors even in spite of needing psychotherapy from the harassment. I did not want to stoop to their level. For the most part, however, I was able to move passed it all. It turns out that all the while, right under my nose, those few girls were spreading a plethora of lies and rumors about me in an attempt to taint my reputation. Purporting ideas like exchanging sexual favors with a gym teacher for an A in his class, their fallacies were transparent and ridiculous.  I guess that was why administration never really looked too deeply into it. 

Possibly one of life's cruel jokes: I had a teacher in highschool that was pretty well-liked amongst most students, myself included. Instead of attending the cafeteria's folly, I found solace in the relaxed atmosphere of his classroom. Two years ago, he used that opportunity to eventually, groom me and ultimately, sexually assault me. Because of prior accusations against me, I was painted wanton by administration and student alike. I was guilted for ruining his life, as he was a public school teacher. I was forced to be homeschooled for the remaining months high school - effectively ostrachizing and isolating me after the traumatic incident. I missed out on going to senior prom. As a member of the school choir, the administrators even tried to keep me from participate in my final concert for ""my own safety."" The harassment went as far as the Internet,

I developed c-PTSD, but I attended his sentencing. I felt a small sense of justice after seeing him bring carried away in handcuffs. I felt safer knowing that he was going to jail for what he did. 

I saw that one of my highschool bullies recently posted a picture in reference to my rapist, claiming to miss him. Someone in the comment thread inquired about my assault - generally referring to it as ""the drama."" They were both just nonchalantly talking about his prison sentence. A friend of mine interjected to question why anyone would anyone miss a rapist. My trauma was invalidated as the following comments were just an assortment of rape apologia and victim-blaming. 

I've always tried to take the moral high-road, but part of me wants join that forum and voice ***my*** feelings.

Is this my right as the victim of the subject in discussion? Do you think this could bring me closer to feeling some type of justice for everything that's happened? Or, am I just feeding the trolls?",02Feb2018,1

319,"For the last month or two I have felt completely lost as to what I should do, and it's really starting to take a toll on me. Recently my SO of just over a year ended things with me due to the fact that I had some issues of my own that I needed to work on (self-esteem, depression), and since then I feel like my life has gone somewhat downhill. I see a psychologist once a week to combat these issues, and has helped me out a decent amount, but I haven't gone to see him in the last three weeks due to some unforeseen circumstances. This leads in to the main reason of my post.

I've been friends with the same group of about 10 guys since we were in first grade (18 now), we've all grown up together and been there for every significant event of each other's, but for the past couple of years I feel like I don't really have a place in the group, and am just tolerated. In the group there are a lot of little ""subgroups"", where everyone has someone else they can pretty much consider a best friend. During the time that I was with my SO, I didn't really hang out with my friends at all, due to the fact that I felt like I didn't have a real part in the group, and that my girlfriend at the time didn't really like my friends. After we broke up, I got back involved with them, and thankfully they welcomed me back with open arms, and have solely been hanging out with them practically every night, but I feel like I'm just there. Sometimes I see on social media that they went and all did something the night before that I didn't even hear about, and I know that they have a couple of groupchats with pretty much everyone but me, which doesn't help. Plus I feel like I'm not coping with the breakup very well, as I haven't moved on two months later. After the breakup I also stopped trying very hard in school, with my grades starting to slip shortly thereafter, making me fail a class and getting a D in another in my first semester in college. Realistically I'm just going to keep digging myself deeper into this rut I'm in, as my only real support system are my parents and younger sister, which really sucks. I hate not being able to have someone who I can consider a best friend, it makes me feel like I'm just there and not really wanted as a friend.

I am at a crossroads in my career and looking for direction and advice. A little background: I am a 28 year old female with a bachelor's in Psychology. I currently work as a tech/ academic administrator/ research coordinator in a small private practice. Basically I tech up patients, manage the clinical side of my office, manage the resident and fellow schedule and any academic issues that arise. I also coordinate resident and attending research projects, track study patients, figure out the logistics of figuring out how to make a new study work in our practice, educate staff on studies and protocols, etc. To say the least, I have a lot of hats. 

I used to love my job. It was the first thing I thought of when I woke up in the morning (in a good way lol), I loved my coworkers and  bosses, and I was genuinely excited to go to work everyday. Lately I've just been feeling so unfulfilled.. like I could do more, see more, actually contribute to this crazy world, and make a lasting impact on people's lives. I used to be so inspired, I want that again.

I would love to do something in the social services/ non-profit industry, but am not sure what. I also am not sure how to actually make enough money to live with this type of work.. I'm not talking extravagance, just being able to pay the bills. 

I love coordinating events and am great at managing several projects, and I am very very good at administrative tasks and organization. 

I would love to work with at-risk youth/ families, or coordinate care and community involvement for those without access, or help people who are homeless or addicted or with mental health issues. I want my life to matter. I want to give back.

326,"I don't even know where to begin. I'm 32 years old, moved to Seattle for a fantastic, well paying job with excellent benefits that allows me to travel all over the world and live in a cool city surrounded by stunning natural beauty. I work in oceanography, but stopped at a master's degree rather than pursue the full academic route. My girlfriend of five years is pursuing the full track, and we've been long-distance for a long time. She lives on the east coast, and is from Canada. Her next step is to find a professor position. We've been faced with a choice for awhile : get married so that she can be where I am no matter what (green card), or continue to pursue her work here in the US on a visa until we're ready to be married. 

To preface, I've had some commitment reluctance as far as marriage is concerned.

Rather than telling my life story, I'll try to distill the difficult paths I'm faced with:

1) Stay committed to this job, which offers me financial stability and the prospects for a good life in Seattle. This comes at the cost of being far from my family and friends in the Northeast, and possibly my relationship. My girlfriend would have to (at least temporarily) abandon her career track for this. She has some resentment over the fact that we did not do this earlier. Additionally, my mother is dealing with some very serious health issues.

2) Leave this job for total financial uncertainty (I have basically peaked in my field with this job - I will not find a better gig back in the Northeast) to marry my girlfriend, then follow her to whatever future jobs she might have. I really do not think I could be happy following someone that is walking down the academic route, since the shitty state of affairs that academia is in these days means people basically have to be willing to move anywhere any time *if* they find a position. Furthermore, I'm not 100% sure her heart is in academia, even though she's extremely good at it. 

It seems to me that if I'm going to make a huge sacrifice to walk away from this job for her, it's only fair that we commit to living in the Northeast where we both can be closest to our family and friends. For me to walk away, move to Cape Cod for 9 months, then move to god knows where (the south? southwest? landlocked? hell no...) only to find out that her position isn't permanent, to move on god knows where else in a few years just does not seem reasonable. 

Reasonable paths to me seem A) I stay here and she either chooses to take the risk of moving and not finding work in her field immediately (though it's likely she will eventually) or end our relationship; or B) I walk away from my career and we both compromise for each other by committing to stay in the northeast where we both should be able to find some kind of work that can keep us going and happy.

However, I am unable to shake my insecurity. We have been seeing each other since September and have been “official” a little under a month. I am a little bit overweight (5’8” and 185 pounds approx.) which I think is contributing to these feelings, but honestly I’m just insecure about my physicality in general.

I am still wondering to this day why he decided to pursue me, because I am sure he could find a girl much prettier than I am. I’m fairly attractive, I guess, but he could definitely do better than me.

Is there any way to shake these feelings? I guess that losing weight could help, although I struggle to stay motivated (lost ~30lbs a couple of years ago and have kinda plateaued since).

333,"I work retail in a chain office supply store that has a printing department. I also do freelance design and marketing work on the side, but I'm very much a novice and I usually just do very small things as freebies to build my portfolio for after I get my degree. Thus, I have business cards and keep them on me, but I don't hand them out often. As you can imagine, it's against store policy to solicit clients for my side business while at work.

Well, this week I made a mistake with that. A customer came in to have a flyer printed, there was a problem with her file that I fixed fairly quickly, she was impressed. I mentioned I did graphic design on the side. She asked for my card. I gave it to her.

I can't really explain why I gave it to her. I'm normally a stickler for policy and I pride myself in being professional and ethical. The best I can figure is that I was stressed and panicking (my coworker in the department had walked out/quit earlier, I was called in on emergency, there was tons to get done in a very small time with no help, and I had been heckled by customers earlier in the day), I was in ""customer service mode"" aka say yes to everything I physically can, and I just wasn't thinking.

Now, she's contacted me to have me design her a t-shirt. Lots of problems here. First is that generally I don't do vector work. I'm terrible at it and don't have access to Illustrator right now anyway. I could technically still do it raster, but it wouldn't be ideal. Second is that, come to find out, she is the head of a large non-profit in my area and the t-shirt is for one of their big annual events, and that is very intimidating for me and feels out of my scope. Third, I'm concerned about how this will affect me at my current job, which I would like to keep and am vying for a promotion at. 

I don't want to do the job. I feel guilty about giving out my card on company time and I'm worried about the consequences it will have for me. But I don't know how to tell her that without it coming back to bite me at my job. **I'm not worried about alienating her as a future potential client**; like I said, doing work for a company of this size feels out of my scope, and for the moment this is firmly a side gig, not a career. 

I'm mostly worried about this coming up next time she needs something printed at my job, or this getting back to my boss at that job, and not coming off as totally unprofessional. My bosses at work are pretty chill normally, and given that we just had a person quit they kind of need me for the time being. I doubt I'd be fired, probably strongly disciplined but even that I'd like to prevent if I can. But this feels big to me. It was a complete mistake to give her my card, but I don't know how to explain that to her.

**TL;DR:** I gave out my business card for my side gig while on company time at my real job, it was a mistake, I regret it. Now they've contacted me asking for a design, and I don't know how to turn them down without screwing myself over.

**How do I explain, professionally, that giving out my business card when I did was a mistake and I shouldn't have done it and that I won't be able to do the job for them? How do I minimize this coming back to bite me at my day job?**",02Feb2018,5
334,"Bought a new gaming laptop , asus rog gl702vs-ah73 , 12gb ram , gtx 1070 , i7-770hq , 1tb hdd , 128 ssd

I am worried about it being refurbished .. serial number doesnt have that R . I checked system info , and system sku is blank , there is no value in there which is weird

Also someone told me 12gb ram laptops tend to be refurbished ?

Thanks",02Feb2018,1
335,"hey there, I'm a 13-year-old lad who has a problem. I've started puberty and I hate it! In 4 months I'm turning 14 and I'm really stressed out because I know the older I get the more responsibilities and stress will be put on me and I know I will have to have sex before I turn 30 or else I'm a loser! I wish I was still a 5th grader. easier math, people were nicer, no grades, no stress about the future. Help?!",02Feb2018,2
336,"Only friends with fake people just so I have someone to sit/talk with. Got forced to go out with a girl by friends. I was super awkward infront of all my friends and her when we met. I don't know if she likes me and I don't really like her. Apparently she is really nice though ( personality wise ). I don't want to tell her this isn't working out as everyone who I have built up a relationship will probably hate me for it as they seem to like her more than me. I also don't want to meet her again and have to go through this awkward shit and pretend to like her. Like I don't think i can psychologically handle meeting her again - I was so depressed after I met her just due to the fact at how embarrassingly awkward I was and I don't want all my 'friends' to see that.

I'm an awkward shit and I preferred to keep it underwraps but now after meeting her, everyone is changing their opinions about me

If I'm going to meet a girl, I want it to be natural and like her and have her like me and not this forced awkward shit.

P.S I also have to go to prom with her

atm im just blanking all social media",02Feb2018,1
337,"So I really want to try and make more friends this year at high school. At the moment, I only have one sort of close friend. (Like we don’t hang out outside of school, but we’ve known each other for years). She’s shy and introverted like me. Our similarities are what brought us together, but now I feel like it’s almost led me to become more reclusive. I don’t hate her or anything. I simply want to branch out and improve my social skills. However, I feel as if I betray her if I hang out with others. I’ve made several new friends this past year, and I really want to get closer with them. The issue is that my other friend is much more closed off and doesn’t seem to want to make more friends. So when I go to talk to the group, she refuses to even come along. I don’t want to abandon her and have her sit alone, but I also really want to make an effort to establish other social connections :( 
Really not sure what to do ?",02Feb2018,1
338,"I'm 18 I have the money to buy a car but I won't be able to afford the insurance (800 every 6 months). I work as a grill cook getting paid 11.25 but I'm getting  little to no hours. I use marijuana to help dull my depression and IBS which limits my job opportunities but if I quit I go back to being in immense pain. I've been in and out of doctors offices for 7 years with nothing ever getting better. I've felt stuck for the past 2 months almost like I haven't even been alive. I live with my parents but I pay for everything but some food. I have an opportunity to move in with a close friend in Colorado but I don't know if it would be any different.
Sorry if I rambled a bit I'm just confused and I can't figure out what to do.",02Feb2018,1
