0,"So first things first. This isn't an ""offical"" date and he hasn't admitted to liking me in THAT way yet. Which is why I'm kinda nervous and on the fence because I do like him and I'm pretty sure he likes me back. 

He's been wanting to hang out with me all the time all sudden. We didn't hang out for a year and now it's once a week, he used to take days to respond to my messages and now it's within 5 minutes. Now if we hung out a bunch before this I wouldn't be assuming this but this came out of the blue and like I said we almost haven't spoken at all in about a year. BUT the real kicker was when I mentioned I was alone in a hotel room tonight and he wanted to drop everything and come hang out with me. The only reason he didn't was because I was too far away and he would've had to stay the night if he came over. 

Then right after that he invited me to the movies and later on dinner this Wednesday (Usually we just go to his place and binge watch shows). I accepted and that's why I need some advice.

Am I reading too far into this? And if not what can I do to make sure the date goes well? I don't go on too many dates so I'm not an expert at it and I would appreciate any advice I can get. Thanks in advance!",24Jun2018,1
1,"I have a dilemma that's been on my mind. I'm and 18 year old student and I got placed into an electrical engineering course. I am not good in math or science and as a result I am not good in engineering. I also find myself dread going to school each day. I feel absolutely awful each morning and can barely get out of bed. I feel like I'm forcing myself and all I get in return are poor grades. I made some acquaintances in school so the social aspect is fine. I just want to leave school so bad. I understand how this comes across as whining and being immature but that's how I feel. I don't know what to do because if I leave I'll be forced immediately into compulsory army for the country I'm in. On the other hand, joining a different institution would cost a lot of money which I don't have. I feel really lost and almost angry from frustration in this situation.

I've tried to change courses without success and my alternatives would be to study abroad or go to private school which I can't afford.

3,"This is my first time posting on this reddit, so forgive me if I make any errors. So I'm a 25 year old woman, and I live with my mother currently due to medical issues and subsequent medical bills. One of my friends also lives with her parents. She's 19. She asked me about a year ago if I wanted to start planning on moving in with her, and I said yes, because I wanted to move out of my mother's house. Unfortunately, in the last few months, I've begun questioning if she would really be a good roommate or not or if I really wanted to live with her. Some of my other friends have expressed to me that they doubt her ability to make good decisions or to be responsible enough to live on her own right now, and I tend to agree with them. She hasn't been making good decisions in regards to saving any money, shes been getting expensive tattoos, going on long trips, etc., and it's been making me nervous. She and I haven't been talking about our moving plans and, frankly, have barely been talking at all for a few months because every time we do talk she simply complains about her life and dumps all her problems on me. 
What has REALLY made me completely change my mind, however, (and this is what I feel terrible about) is that in the last six months I've reconnected with an old lover and we've fallen in love. Last month he told me to move in with him, without her (obviously.) This would involve me changing cities, and completely abandoning her and any and all hope she has of moving in with me would be forgotten. I want to talk to her about it, and I want to tell her the truth, but as I said any time I talk to her she starts telling me how horrible her life is and how poor she is, and it never feels like a good time to tell her how in love I am and how I'm abandoning her. I figure the sooner the better, but it's just too hard. Does anybody have advice?

7,"So I'll be a senior in high school next fall and my friends and I are planning on having one last birthday party together in October (since 3 of our birthdays fall in that month).  

My best friend and his twin brother (who I'm also very close with) love comedy and since it's likely the last bday we'll all be celebrating together, I want to get gifts that are meaningful/memorable.  I recently asked them for their favorite comedians and it turns out that one of them will be performing right in our home city next October.  4 tickets (for them and their parents) are quite expensive, but I really want to do this for them.  They're wonderful people and have done so much for me over the past four years, and I really love them all.  I've been saving up for four years and am just $20 short, which my dad agreed to cover.

My only concern is that getting them this would make them uncomfortable.  The tickets are something pricey enough that it seems like something a family member or a parent would get, and I want them to enjoy it.  Should i go for it, or should I try something else?",24Jun2018,1

9,"My girlfriend's family is coming from out of town to stay with us.  There's nowhere near enough room for them in our home, and them staying in a hotel is absolutely out of the question... ""that's not how they do things"". My girlfriend and I will therefore be sleeping at my dad's house. I'm told Im not to avoid them by staying there. 

The problem is my GF's mom.  She's a controlling narcissist.  She always has to be the centre of attention.  She always must be included in everything,  and she'll ruin what would otherwise be a relaxing and fun time with her comments and her attitude.  My girlfriend will not stand up to her.  Ever.  ""That's not how I was raised"", she says.  

My girlfriend is hiding her ""expensive"" shampoo to avoid comments like ""must be nice"",  despite the fact that her mom has a terrible shopping addiction,  and the shampoo is a pretty cheap.  

We went and stayed with her parents for Christmas.  We were always walking on eggshells, but her mom ended up giving my GF and I the silent treatment for 3 days anyway.  Our only guess why is that the 2 of us went out for an anniversary supper instead of eating dinner with her.  

She doesn't cook, and doesn't clean.  When we stayed with them we cooked several meals AND washed dishes.  But I just know when she gets here, she'll sit there staring at dirty dishes and make a comment about how someone should do them.  Suggesting she do them would no doubt land me in the dog house with the GF and her mom. 

These are just some examples. 

I'm stressed.  We're picking them up from the airport at midnight tonight. 

How do I make her respect our boundaries,  our home, and our choices?  I can't defend myself when she makes comments. I can't talk to my GF's dad about it, because he has no control over her whatsoever.  I have the feeling I'll be taking a lot of walks outside. Help please?

15,"This story is kind of complicated but I'll try to keep it as short as I can. I currently live with my S.O. and two other housemates. Three of us get along really well and hang out pretty much all the time. Our fourth person is extremely introverted and shy to the point that it has felt like there are only three of us living here. It makes our third housemate very uncomfortable since she shares the bathroom with our fourth. She ends up always cleaning the bathroom after he leaves it disgusting and messy. He also eats a lot of our food without contributing to the costs or helping prepare it. He also doesn't really do his dishes, just leaves them in the sink for someone else to deal with (usually). He stays up until 4 a.m. regularly playing games, yelling laughing, and generally not noticing how loud he is. He shares a wall with our third housemate and she has to wear earplugs nightly to sleep. He has never apologized to any of us in person for his noise level and we have told him to keep it down repeatedly. Tbh, we're all kind of fed up with it and we've never been able to make solid connection with him. We have asked him out to dinner with us and just to hang out but has only taken us up on it a handful of times. For context, we've been living together for 6 months. He has also made some efforts by offering to play board games with us but he never pursued it fully, so we've only done that once. Both sides have tried reaching out to each other, but without much success.

Adding to the general awkwardness, he is dating a high school friend of mine who I know fairly well and am on good terms with. My friend knows a little about our living situation but I'm not sure to what extent. I don't want to ruin our relationship with him or my friend. What would be a tactful way to let him know we are moving and that he is not welcome to come with us?

16,"I'll try to keep it as short as I can, but I met my best friend ~5 months ago, in a video game. We are both girls and many times a day we would platonically tell eachother that we love eachother very much, and always texting eachother cute and wholesome things, and she has become very precious to me since I've felt very lonely. She has told me the exact same thing. We would excited talk to eachother throughout the day and play video games and watch series every night, but that hasn't happened very often for weeks. And it starts to feel like I have to initiate every conversation and she just writes me what she can ""get away with"" without making me worried or feel ignored, like she's just trying to keep me happy. I know she hasn't been busy or stressed or anything like that, so I'm very worried that she just doesn't find me exciting to talk to anymore. She still says she loves me but she doesn't show it in any way.

I'm very much hoping this is temporary, but even if that's the case, do I just act like nothing?? Wouldn't things just feel weird? And that's the best case scenario...

If she doesn't want to be best friends or just friends at all, there should be a reason for it at least, and doing it this way... not telling me anything, I can't imagine anything more painful. When I starting talking to her her, it cured my long term depression, and I know it will return and probably never go away if that happens.

20,"hey so i haven’t slept tonight and it’s 11am and i’m in full blown zombie mode so bare with me this is probably just sleep deprived nonsense. 

anyway
so like my life’s been pretty trash, not as trash as others like yknow i have both my parents and a roof over my head 
but i have a lot of trauma 

i’m 17 years old and a female 
was diagnosed w depression in year 3 
i’m currently seeing my 5th psychologist, and i’m about to see my 2nd psychiatrist 
i left school
did two tafe courses (certificates) and then dropped the 3rd because of lack of motivation 

to summarise my life 
i was badly bullied in primary school and i used to live with my biggest bully (he was the son of my mums friend and they came to life with us cus they needed help) he sexually assaulted me numerous times and would tell the whole school about every embarrassing thing i did at home. i had 0 privacy
ended up as the popular girl in high school but hated every moment of it as i was a valium addicted, anxious mess so i dropped out 
my dad is extremely depressed has attempted suicide multiple times i used to basically look after him
mother partied through out my childhood and created a shitty environment for me, let people into our house who sexually assaulted me (unknowingly)
have a long history of sexual assault to varying degrees 
my step dad whom i thought of as a father and accepted as family, looked up to and told everything to ended up confessing his sexual desires for me. he never acted on them and i decided to keep it a secret because if i told my mum it would break our family and we’ve never been this stable before but it’s slowly eating me up
i’m extremely anxious to the point where sometimes i can’t even walk to my mail box without panicking 
have had 3 jobs (1 had to leave as i moved homes, 2nd closed down) and had to quit my last as my anxiety over the job was ruining my physical health 
i’ve pretty much been tossed in between my fathers and mothers because neither of them can deal with me
all i do is play games because i need something to fill my days up
also i have 2 brothers 20 and 23 who both live at home and neither have jobs LOL one is autistic tho and the other is just idk... probably depressed but won’t admit it or talk about it



i have 0 passion for anything, 0 goals, 0 drive, everything i slightly want to do seems too like too much effort than it’s worth. like i definitely want to kill my self but decided i won’t because of my little sister and the rest of family (even tho they don’t do shit for me while i’m still kickin just for them) 
i’m honestly at ends meet
like if i’m going to stay alive then i guess i want to do something half meaningful i don’t want to just be on benefits and sit in a tiny shitty apartment all day like my dad 


what the fuck do i even do? i feel like my brain has been hardwired to be like this because of the early childhood trauma 
i’m supposed to be moving out into a shared apartment with one another person but i feel like nothing will change. i’ll just be sad, anxious and dysfunctional but this time i won’t have my mum constantly telling me i’m a burden and to please move out lol

like i literally am just doing nothing with my existence and living for the mere reason that i don’t want to scar my family by killing myself

i’m at ends meet, life’s fucking shit. advice? pointers? wanna chat with my sleep deprived self so i have something to do? anything? ",24Jun2018,1
21,"I was walking past an building that’s supposed to be one of those ‘elderly only’ apartments, and I stopped for a moment because I thought I heard screaming. There’s a park nearby but it was very clearly coming from somewhere else.

I stayed and listened for 5-10 minutes and grew more and more concerned. An older man yelling, I could make out words like “stop talking!” and “shut up!” but not much else, just assorted yelling. There was a woman also but I couldn’t make out anything she said. The child sounded 5-10 years old, and was full out wailing. Yelling “let go of me!” and “stop it!”

I told the police the building # and where I thought it was coming from (leftmost side of the building, between the first and second floor). They said they’d send an officer to investigate and I saw the cop car pass me as I finished my walk home. 

Will they call me if they do find out what it was? Or if somehow I was wrong? I’m really nervous it was coming from somewhere else and I just scared the receptionist or something of the sort.

23,"Hi, any advice for this situation would be greatly appreciated.

My uncle is visiting my parents from out of the country with his young daughter and his wife, who is from China. His wife is very traditional, and in her country, when you’re visiting family, she expects to be hosted. My parents live in a small 2 bedroom house, and while they are okay with hosting them, they would prefer for them to get their own accommodations because the house will be cramped with their whole family visiting. Despite them politely suggesting, my uncle insists that he will be staying with them, thus he basically invited himself to stay there.

Now the real issue is my father, who has been a struggling alcoholic since before I was born. It’s caused a lot of friction in my parents marriage, but within the last few years, my mom has managed to pull the reins in and he is more under control. My uncle and his wife however, are huge alcoholics and when he visited last time, my mom was pretty upset because she asked him not to drink around my dad / in the house, he said he would oblige, and proceeded to crack open a bottle of wine a few hours later.

This is my mother’s correspondence with him today to give you a better picture to his attitude regarding her request:

 Mom- Also wanted to mention that ___ and I would really appreciate if you didn’t drink around ___ in the house as he is very susceptible to temptation. As a family, we have been trying to work through his drinking problem.
   
Uncles response- Dear __
 
Well,  considering that I drink wine almost daily with my meals—breakfast being the exception—and my wife likes to drink a bottle or two of beer prior to bed time or in the middle of the day, we’ll have to sort that out. I really don’t to be a part of whatever tension you and ___ have about ___ issues. That said, I am not, as you know, insensitive to your concerns.

So I was with this girl on and off for 3 years, I was consistently told that she didnt treat me right and that I was blind to it but I was in love with this girl. I spent every day and night with her, she became my lifestyle. About a year into the relationship I had a bad spot and messed up. I betrayed who I think to be the love of my life. I came clean to her and that was just the downfall of us. We 'fixed' it and got back together and everything seemed okay. Then the first guy of 4 came. She cheated and left me for them. I took her back. Together for a while again and the next guy came, she left him for me and we were together, this happened with 4 different guys and i took her back every time. Call it dumb but i dunno whats wrong with me to do it. She just has a calling for me that i cant turn down. 

As of a few months ago she left me for guy number 4 amd it tore me apart. I evidently tried to act strong and move on which has never worked any other times.

or asking me to help him with some computer stuff since i'm good with computers, when i had all the girls around me this guy used to call me daily and we used to meet up daily too, but now when i look at it i feel like he was my friend just so he can meet girls trough me.

36,"Semi-long post sorry.

How do I go about telling my mom that I can no longer help her financial without her trying to use the ""I am your mother."" card. I love my mom she's one of my favorite people. She has supposedly been looking for work, but doesn't seem like she is getting anywhere. And it is putting a strain on me having to support her and partly her boyfriend as well, who has what my mom says multiple accounts with money that for some reason he can't withdraw from.

At this moment in my life I am living with a friend's family member trying to get my own place, but while I am paying rent to them, giving my mom money, buying food, and paying other bills and storage. I can't get myself ahead enough to get my own place. 

I know some of this belongs in r/personalfinance , which I'll probably cross post there as well.

I don't want to have her hate me that's the main thing, but I can't do it anymore. I may see if the company I work for can transfer me to a different state to escape it. But that isn't the answer to fix my problem.

42,"So there is this girl (beginning of every story xD), and we talked over summer through the phone (as she was away at the time). Then, summer ended (I am not in the US) and things kind of went slow. But then we went on a school trip for two weeks, and things went fast. We made out, and we were both very horny (I don't know what term to use xD but I think you guys should understand (nothing actually happened because we couldn't, but we heavily teased)). She told me some stuff about her past, and how she was sexually molested for two years when she was younger. A couple weeks went by (after we came back), and we were kind of separate. I tried to do the same stuff I did on the trip (as in sexually) and she just kind of shrugged it off. Then, one day after I tried,  she said its was because something happened and every time something sexual happens, or just a kiss, she gets reminded of her past. We talked and said she doesn't want to be my girlfriend because she doesn't know if she can ""satisfy my needs,"" so we said we would see how things would go. We are talking now, but I do not really know what to do. 

By the way, I talked about my past and how I was almost suicidal, and we haven't talked about it since because there hasn't been a good time and place, and I do not want to do it through the phone.

She is also terrible with answering messages xD so a lot of the times when we try to talk about something she leaves and if I message her again its really nagging xD

She's super reliable and has driven to our school campus on days she didn't have class just so I could have a buddy to talk to. She gives me advice, and listens to all the problems and things I go through. I can honestly say she's  been more of a friend to me than people I've known for years.

51,"Hey Reddit! My lease is up in California at the end of August. I'm moving to Texas in January to be near my brother. Where do I live in the interim? 

\- Continue living in **California**.* Pro*s: I'm not job hopping. I like my jobs here well enough to stay for four more months if needed.* Con*s: no family around, high cost of living (I'm in Orange County), not a lot of close friends, might be hard to find a short term lease for those four months, doesn't feel much like home. I have not particularly enjoyed living in California lol but I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to live here. 

\- **Florida**. My good friend has a spare room that I can lay low in for a few months before Texas. Work my old job, hang with my friends, etc.* Pro*s: Friends, beaches, the feeling of going ""home,"" weekend trips to see friends who live a couple states over.* Con*s: this is my hometown and there's a lot of history here (ex-boyfriend, old family drama, etc. - hence laying low), it's also kind of a blackhole. There is a lot to get involved in, which is important to me, but Florida feels like it's the easy/comfortable choice, and I'm not sure how comfortable I am with choosing easy options in life. Florida isn't going anywhere, my friends who live there aren't going anywhere. Going home is always an option, so I don't know if I want to make it my first choice. 

\- **Maui**.* Pro*s: my dad lives here, so no rent. I really love my dad and in the back of my mind, if he died next year hypothetically, I don't want to regret not having lived with him when I had a chance. Also, the opportunity to live in Hawaii doesn't often present itself. My younger sister is moving here at the end of August for different reasons but it would also be nice to live with her for a while too (side note, she is probably moving to Texas with me in January as well assuming she decides to take a gap year).* Con*s: Maui is really small and I remember getting Island Fever when I visited in 2016. Another con, I'm a paralegal by trade and don't know of anyone would hire a girl who's  new to Maui and going back to the mainland in four months. I also don't know of any organizations to get involved with while I'm there (I've only done light research so far)

I do not know her very well (the little I do know her, I actually quite like her) but she had/has addiction issues.  They seem to be on relatively good terms right now but it changes regularly.  I don't know the exact nature of the addiction other than ""pills."" I heard through a mutual friend (who'd I consider rather reliable) that she takes methadone (although it's not prescribed to her).  She is possibly still (or has been) taking pills.

As the potential uncle, I feel helpless.  Regardless, I will be there for my brother, her and, most importantly, the baby.  But in terms of some logistics, I wonder if there's anything I can do.  I don't know if the doctors are aware that she takes methadone.  I have no medical expertise but I assume this is something they would need to know in case the baby is withdrawing.  Is this something I can (and should) report to CPS? Would they be able to preemptively do something for a child? Is there anyone's attention I can bring this to?

I have tried talking to my brother but he is stubborn (and maybe in denial?). He won't take any measures of his own at this juncture and is trying to maintain calm waters with ex-gf.

59,"I'm 22, can financially support myself from a job i've been holding down during University but cannot force myself to move out from my dysfunctional home because of the fear of leaving my younger siblings in an alcoholic environment.

My parents are alcoholics, rageaholics, and have been for as long as I can remember, they drink every other night of the week, argue late into the night during weekdays, smash and throw objects, slam doors, physical fights have broken out, police called multiple times, confrontations are constant. No amount of intervention from myself or other siblings have had any impact on the arguing, the violence or attitudes changing or stopping. 

When we intervene it only escalates and you're put into fucking chaos where in their mind its about picking sides of who's right and who's wrong, trying to make sense of a fight that could have started over the tone of someones voice, a grudge from years ago, petty inconveniences, life / work / family stress. And the verbal abuse and blame is then put on us. 

We're walking on eggshells everyday, knowing well that if an argument starts or any level of discomfort to either of them is brought on it'll all come out whenever they drink. They drink until they can't remember what happened the night before and leave us with the mental scarring. Nothing ever changes, health risks, the embarrassment of family and friends knowing brought on by the amount of drinking haven't impacted it either. 

In the last few years as i've started University and work I've become aware of how mentally fucked I am from the amount of dysfunction that i've been dealing with at home and it's absolutely going to leave an effect with my siblings also, I have extreme difficulty socialising, especially with other adults, I can't be around people consuming alcohol for the amount of anxiety, panic and physical discomfort that I experience in the situations, I assume i've been conditioned to expect violence and extreme discomfort from any situation involving alcohol. I'll do anything to avoid the slightest bit of confrontation because i'll always expect it'll result in a fight. 

I can't control my parents and shouldn't have to because they're fucking adults, they won't stop drinking and even in times when they're sober I don't want to be around them anymore because i'm always waiting on the next fight to start.

The dream: It was long and intense, super vivid and real. Probably one of the only dreams I’ve ever had in my life that almost 12 hours later I can still remember every part of. 

I convinced my brother to break into my ex’s house house with me and murder her while she slept. We snuck in through a window, masked, me carrying a suppressed pistol. We stood at her bedside. She was covered in flowy white bed sheets. She was so innocent and beautiful laying there. I didn’t want to do it. I handed my brother the gun and he covered her head with the sheets and pulled the trigger multiple times and very quickly. I can picture it clearly. To keep it short, I spent the rest of the dream paranoid that people would find out it was me who killed her and I felt legitimate guilt and sickness. Like I had done it in real life. I woke up and realized it was a dream and got nauseous from the things I was feeling. 

I know it’s ‘just a dream’... but it was the most inexplicably real dream I have ever experienced and it was so extremely violent and messed up.

70,"So I have really strict parents that have always set ridiculous rules and expectations for me. Rules like not being able to have any male friends ever until I was 19, when I was 18 my curfew was 4-5 pm during fall/winter(had to be home before the sun came down), now that I'm 21 the latest I'm allowed to be out is 10pm. Keep in mind my parents don't even live with me  anymore. I live with my  sister and she has been enforcing all the rules. Of course I've broken curfew so many times. I'm 21 and I don't think there's anything wrong with being at a party with my friends past midnight or staying at school until 3 studying for my finals. Usually when I break curfew it ends in me getting angry texts from my sister. Once it wasn't even that late when I was getting threatened by my sister to get home. It was 7:50pm... Well recently I was like ""screw the rules"" and I went down to my boyfriends hometown for a week. He recently graduated and he lives 3 hours away from me. I wanted to go with him and stay for a bit when he moved back because we literally have no idea when we're gonna get to see each other again. He can't come visit me because hotels in my area are  super expensive  and there's no way my family would let him stay with us. Anyways, so I called my mom and told her I was going and she basically told me no because ""that's not right."" Thing is I wasn't asking for permission. I was asserting myself as an adult woman and letting her know where I was gonna be. Most kids don't even tell their parents when they do something like this. They either lie or just leave. Needless to say when I got back my sister was beyond pissed. She asked me if my boyfriend and I are engaged because otherwise there's no other reason for me to go see him when he's living far away and started calling me a liar. Every time I step out of my room she takes every opportunity to take jabs at me and be hurtful. She and my brother loudly announce that they're going to get food or see a movie and they purposefully don't invite me to anything. They even cut my car from the insurance and I can't drive anywhere anymore. When I got back she and mom acted as though I committed the worst sin ever. 

Any advice on dealing with this? I would understand if I was a teenager and my boyfriend was some deadbeat, but I'm a 21 year old woman turning 22 soon. My boyfriend has been putting in job applications like crazy since he graduated. He's a really good smart guy.

72,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. My sister has been acting weirdly towards me since she came back from travelling for a couple of months. She's 20 and I'm 17 and both the only kids in our family. Nudity was always normal when we were growing up but we all became a little more private once we reached our teens, so apart from the occasional dash from the shower we never really walked around without clothes.

For the last few weeks my sister has been making a point of walking around naked, but only when my parents aren't around. It started with coming out of the shower with just a towel around her head and walking around looking for stuff, but now it's at a point where she'll be completely nude for over an hour or more. 

At first it seemed really casual but recently she's gotten more deliberate to the point that she's constantly making excuses to come into my room or bending over and picking stuff up in front of me or sitting next to me on the couch with her legs open. 

I haven't said anything to her because I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable in case it's completely innocent. Am I overreacting or is this weird?",24Jun2018,1
73,"Around 7pm today a stray cat got hit by a car where we live. The police came but there wasn't much they did except help us get the cat in a cage. This is the 3rd cat we've took in that has gotten injured. Usually we call animal services and they'd come pick up the cat the same day but they close at 6 pm. We were going to take him tomorrow but they don't open on Sundays so I was wondering is there anything we can do to help him? We already gave him food and water and a little box to sleep in. There's blood around his mouth and nose. Should we clean it? I know he was a indoor cat but the owners moved out earlier this week and let him loose. Do I just leave him alone and check up on him every now and then? He seems to be breathing okay but he let's out a sorta grunt noise sometimes. I want to bring him inside to sleep but I have 3 cats and I don't want them bothering him. Right now he's on our balcony (we live on the 3rd floor). Is there anything else we should do to help him?

75,"Sorry this is a bit of a read. I’m overwhelmed and frantic.

Mom [64] has had Parkinson’s (diagnosed) for about 20 years now. Within the past 5 years she was approved for a lower GI tract Duopa (Parkinson’s drug) pump. Apparently these aren’t super common. 
Due to a recent traumatic fall she has been in the care of a rehabilitative nursing home to help get her strength and coordination back to semi-independent levels. Also, she’s recently been diagnosed with Dementia. It’s not super uncommon with Parkinson’s patients, especially with how long she’s had it, but it’s developed rather quickly and it went into a tailspin the other day. 
She struck her nurse, and requested police presence as she thinks everyone is out to kill her. The facility said they can no longer provide the care she needs and she must be transferred within 30 days. This has hit all of us so sudden. I live in a different city than my mom &amp; dad. I’m trying to run through websites and dissect each facility. I have heard horror stories on the news of memory care patients/the elderly experiencing abuse and neglect. It’s the forefront of my mind.
I need advice. We have to find her a home with a learning staff because of her Duopa Pump.  She also needs staff specializing/experienced with Dementia patients. Has anyone gone through a similar experience &amp; have ANY advice to offer? Anything I should be looking for in these facilities? Qualifications they should have listed on their websites? Minimum staff size? Recommendations? 
I plan to book travel to see my parents ASAP &amp; use that time to tour a few facilities. I hope to have some way of narrowing down my choices before then. 
If it helps, they live in Central TX.",24Jun2018,2

80,"i went to the strip club last night and spent nearly $100. i was only intending on spending half of that but i got too carried away. for example i saw one particular Brazilian girl that had the fattest and roundest ass in the entire club. literally the dime piece of the club because her booty was so outstanding. tons of guys were looking, talking, and making hand gestures about her giant booty as she was on stage, it was nuts. i got a lap dance from her earlier in the night for $20 and then tipped her a few $1 bills a little later to keep talking to her. at one point i negotiated getting another lap dance from her but this time i asked if i could have her fat booty right in my face as i'm seated. she didn't speak english well and had some of her Brazilian stripper friends next to her that offered to translate. after i explained what i wanted said she would do it for $40, so i agreed.

the lap dance was incredible, even though i didn't nut. i basically put my face right in between her butt cheeks and clapped them on me for several minutes. i also grabbed her booty, clapped it, jiggled it, etc. she also rubbed it on my cock as an added bonus. it was almost like sex because she literally was bouncing her big booty up and down on my cock as i gripped her waist and clapped into her. i was definitely going all out because one of the bouncers that supervises the lap dance room from time to time called out to me once and said ""no touching"", the girl didn't mind at all though.

essentially, i did everything i wanted besides full on penetration and nutting. it was a good time but i fear that i will soon get addicted if i keep going. she told me she works wed, thurs, and friday nights. i would love to go weekly and get a similar experience until i get bored but i'm not sure if it would be wise financially, i am not even having sex/nutting after all. thoughts?",24Jun2018,0

He also does anything he can to make me feel terrible about myself (bragging about how he's much more fit, saying I'm fat, rubbing it in that he doesn't wear glasses, etc. I'm pretty fit and I'm only a little nearsighted so my eyesight really isn't too too bad.).

84,"I met this guy on an app a few months ago. We started talking and really hit it off. We finally decided to meet up and hangout. When we did, it felt like we instantly connected. We would laugh and just talk about life. When we started to hangout after our first encounter, it would always lead to sex. This went on for quite a while, just meet up to have sex, and that was that. I finally had the courage to tell him I wanted an actual relationship. I messaged him  and told him that I enjoyed what we did, but I was looking for the real thing. I let him know that if he didn’t want me for me(more than just my body) that we should stop talking.... 
Long story short, we stopped talking. And I thought that was that. I really did like him. I developed feelings for him and I was torn that he replied with an, “okay.” about the whole situation. I slowly started to forget about him and move on. 
Cut to now, about a month later, he texts me and I stupidly answer. We talked for a few days, just the occasional “what’s up” and “how are you?” 
He asked me to hang out the other night and I stupidly agreed. He picked me up, but his friends were with him in the car. I was so confused. He introduced me and they said, “it’s finally nice to meet you. He’s told us a lot about you.” We went to a casino just for fun and laughs. He was holding my hand, hugging me, kissing me, all that relationship kind of stuff. He was very affectionate that night. As the night dragged on, his buddies were asking me questions about myself, getting to know me. When it came time to drop them off at the end of the night, they said they couldn’t wait until I could hangout with them again. They were all very nice. I slept over at his place. We cuddled and watched movies until we fell asleep. 
I’m just wondering if I’m going to end up getting hurt again. He never acted the way he did that night at the casino before, he was never affectionate. He just wanted to hangout and fuck. I’m wondering if it’s all just for show. ",24Jun2018,4

He is an unbelievably great person. Has a wide range in knowledge in just about everything, willing to help everybody, has a contagious laugh, unique sense of style, and the most fun person one could be around; but girls don’t find him attractive or even give him the time of day.

Everyone makes mistakes no matter big or small. Sometimes you may have made a bigger and more serious mistake. One where you feel so bad and so apologetic, and although your superiors says its okay you still feel really guilty. If theres nothing you can do to reverse the mistake then learn from it！Make sure it doesn't happen again！The biggest way of learning is actually by making mistakes. We all need to make some mistakes in order to learn from them. Some mistakes may make you feel guiltier for a longer period of time and so here are some ways to help you coop with your mistakes.

1️⃣ ACCEPTING OUR MISTAKES 
- Know that we all make mistakes at some point in life and that they do not define who you are
- No one is perfect and it’s okay

2️⃣RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU DID WRONG 
- Do you know what exactly you did wrong?
- Think of ways to improve the situation and/or what you may need to do in order to prevent you from making the same mistake again

3️⃣TRY TALKING WITH SOMEONE 
- When a mistake has been made don’t feel ashamed about it, remember you don’t always have to cope with it by yourself. Talk about it with someone you trust ask them for advice
- Talking about it can actually allow you to feel less stressed out ",24Jun2018,0

But my other roommate is a huge problem. I set ground rules when we first moved in. Don’t touch my stuff and I’ll respect your stuff too. I think this is common sense not to touch anyone’s things but you never know who you end up getting roomed with. 

My beers are always missing. I’ll get a 6 pack and she would take a couple beers without asking and when i called her out on she said “oh sorry i just needed a chaser”  and she drinks my wine.

103,"Three years ago, I started having an affair with a man in a city two hours away from me. It's absolutely not something I'm proud of. I actually feel a great deal of shame. The chaos that I brought to my family is undeniable and damaging, to the point that one of my two sons and my three sisters no longer wish to associate with me. I don't blame them, I made terrible mistakes and there's no excusing them. 

During the affair, my lover's wife (yes it was that terrible of an affair) managed to get into his Facebook account and print out copies of our private message conversation. She sent a copy of them to my at the time husband, and that's how he found out for sure. There were definitely lewd messages, and messages hateful to our significant others at the time. 

My ex husband (we went through a divorce that started before he found out about the affair) stalked me a great deal during our separation and eventual divorce, to the point that he had made fake accounts on dating sites he knew I used, and would borrow his friends Facebook account to watch my social media because I had blocked him from it. He would call my first son (from my previous marriage) 8-10 times a day to squeeze information from him about me. I know it was a hard time for him (my son) and it took a great toll on him. His pre-existing mild depression got noticably worse, and he developed anxiety issues. He started seeing a therapist after we found out he had attempted to take his own life. I found him laying on the toilet, asleep, with two empty pill bottles and a toilet bowl full of vomit. I've since done what I can to keep him from being in the middle of things, but it doesn't always work. He has a serious problem with not being able to disappoint people, to a point that it's almost detrimental to himself. So he'll always answer and be helpful if his ex-stepdad calls. Anyway.

When he (my ex husband) finally came to terms with what was happening and found himself a new wife, the stalking stopped. He stopped calling my son all the time, he stopped sending me text messages about what I'd post on social media, and he stopped trying to call and check up on me. My son got a new job that kept him busy and helped him tremendously with his depression, coupled with the fact that he didn't have to talk to his ex stepdad every hour. 

I've had conversations with my son many times where we agree that my ex was manipulative and emotionally abusive, along with being a control freak (he used to require that my son, at 15 years old (he's 26 now), check in every hour, on the hour, no matter where he went, and every 10 minutes late, he was grounded for a day. It got so difficult to upkeep that my son stopped hanging out with his friends altogether unless they were at school. I only found out a couple years ago that my ex-husband had actually told my son he hated all his friends, which is why they suddenly stopped coming over, and my son stopped having a social life almost entirely. It was probably one of the contributing factors of the beginnings of his depression.)

And please, don't take that previous text wall as me attempting to excuse my behavior. I fully admit that what I did was wrong, and have no delusions that people would want to side with me. I am just trying to lay all the information on the table for the purpose of my actual advice question, and the reason I'm on this sub. 

My ex contacted me today, after telling me he was going to go after more child support (he got custody of our mutual 11 year old) after agreeing on an original amount only 2 months ago. He's threatening to take my private messages with my ex-lover (he broke it off soon after we were exposed because he wanted to make things work with his wife) to my district office (I'm a teacher, have been for 20 years at the same school) and I have no idea what to do. I know some of the messages were during the school day, but I only ever messaged him during lunch, recess, or passing periods. I don't know if the proof of an affair would cause the district to have cause to fire me, or if messages during the school day would. They never affected my work. I'm terrified of what might happen, as I'm also going through bankruptcy, and I'm barely staying afloat because of my job.

The cost of my utilities are around $150 a month, groceries are around $170 (this fluxuates), gas is 30$ a week, school loan payments are $125 a month.

I feel like I’m drowning. And to make matters worse, I got pulled over for speeding today(speed traps suck!).

I was lucky enough to have my mom pay for my first six months of car insurance since she’s get a $250 break if paid up front. The car was registered in my name and I am responsible for payments after September. Now, I already have points on my license and the lowest rate I could get was $216 a month from Progressive (I was pulled over 3 times in one year. 2015 was horrible). I went to a defensive driving course to lower my points but it’s not enough.

Now with this ticket I am freaking out. How am I going to pay for everything? I have asked my mom for help but she is apprehensive. I asked my dad as well and he said he would provide me with $100 a month until I get stable.

109,"What do I do about this? How can I help her?

My friend grew up in a regular loving household but recently she’s been hiding things from her parents. Ever since elementary school, her mindset’s been only ‘boys boys boys’ and she used to crush on one boy after another. We used to role play and she would often have a fantasy boyfriend while I would decline. The entire role play would be about dating and drama. (We were 8-9 years old)

Once we hit 6th grade she dated several guys but they all broke up with her because she was too ‘clingy’. My other friends and I were partly glad they broke up because the guy would always be so miserable in the relationship with all the rules and restrictions she had. Besides, whenever she was dating anyone, that was the ONLY thing she would ever talk about, and when they made the slightest slip up like not FaceTiming her once every 3 days (that was one of her rules) she’s spend an hour talking to me about how much of a jerk he was and threatening to break up with him. 

It got worse this year. She started an argument with a guy before eventually she got sick of the argument and turned around on him and called it ‘bullying’ even though she was the one who stalked him through a group chat and kept provoking him and insulting him, just because he asked her if she liked a guy! She told her mom, who naturally believed her own daughter and they got the school authorities involved.

They filed a restriction order and the poor guy wasn’t allowed to talk to her or get close to her at all or he’d be suspended, and he had to switch classes. My friend was given the choice to have a police officer “talk” to him after school about bullying and she said yes. I’m sure the police must’ve given him a scare or intimidated him because the next morning he showed up at 1st period and there were bags under his eyes, he looked tired and stressed and his eyes were red and puffy. I felt bad for him, but when I told my friend about it at lunch she grinned and said eagerly “really was he crying?? See (my name) this is revenge! That’s what you get for bullying!” 

And eventually she turned to cutting herself ‘because of the bullying’ and made a whole show of ‘trying’ to hide it and when her mom found out she got therapist help and switched schools, etc. I’m sure she just did it for attention, because everything she ever does is for attention! The bullying, the constant drama and the cutting! And after that she made a whole show of how much more mature and experienced she was then my friends and I and how we would never understand what she went through. The worst part is, she genuinely believes all that and that she was being bullied! This is just my personal opinion...but if you start an argument with someone and partway you get tired of it and try to call quits, you can’t expect them to stop and if they don’t then turn around and call it bullying.

Ever since she switched schools, she’s been liking guy after guy, and recently she’s admitted to me she’s been sending nudes back and forth with this guy she’s known for a couple weeks. She sent a pic of herself masturbating and the other 13 yr old guy did the same and they’ve been exchanging nudes etc. the guy even sent a vid of himself masturbating and asked her to send dirty texts and he rated her chest as a 9 out of 10. She hasn’t told her mom, she would be in DEEP trouble if her parents found out. She’s scared them when she admitted to cutting and they constantly worry about her. They only know she’s boy obsessed but there’s nothing they can do about it because they’ve tried everything. I think that the other guy’s screwing with her, and while she’s deleted the pics and texts she’s claimed he agreed to not tell anyone.

She loves the attention, and when she first took her shirt off in front of a couple guys and girls on a livestream she later asked me, how scandalous was it on a scale of 1-10?

In my opinion she’s totally mentally screwed up but we’ve been friends since preschool and are close friends because there are some good parts about her.

Am I wrong to think she’s wrong? How do I help her? I tried to tell her my opinion before but she only brushes it off or we get into a fight about it. What should I do? I don’t want to tell her mom because then she won’t ever forgive me or tell me anything and I at least want to be there to support her later on when she comes crashing down. Now I’m just listening and trying to support her and not criticizing anything she does because my words feel empty and they always pass right through her ears because she doesn’t listen at all. Thanks everyone who read, sorry this was really long. (I hope this wasn’t against reddit rules, I’m new to this app, not sure if you can take your post down yourself but if it is against the rules I will take it down.)

110,"I'm taking this math class (college lvl algebra) and in class and doing the homework I felt confident in at least 80% of knowing what I need to know. But once I sat down to do a practice test I couldn't get the problems down. And now I feel confident in about 10% of the stuff I need to know for my test Monday. 

I want to become a doctor one day I'm 24. I feel as if I'll never get there, how could I when the easy math is giving me so much trouble, I know it takes practice and time and it's unreasonable for me to get so down on my self for not knowing / understanding some math. But it's making me feel like I was/am and will never be smart enough to do the things I want in life. ",24Jun2018,3
111,"Hi! Thank you for taking the time to read whatever shit I'm about to spill, haha. 

Okay, I'll divide this into parts, considering I really need to get this off my chest and all of it is pouring out at once.

Part. 1: Me Disappearing

So, I'm in a pretty shitty situation friend-wise. I've been online friends with this really awesome person for almost a year now, and I keep disappearing. When we first started talking, we bonded over music. Normal conversations, and then we became closer friends. As time went on, conversations would get pretty bland and short because of me and my bullshit anxiety. Ugh, I hate it! Anyway, they would say something and I just couldn't reply. The things they said were normal things people say, and I was just stuck. I worried what I would say was wrong. I worried I would be judged, even though they aren't that kind of person. I was worried about so many things that make no fucking sense. This led to me just not saying anything for the rest of the night/day, with only small talk throughout the week.  Then it went to weeks of silence, me coming back for a little bit (still small talk, and anxiety), to two months and back to talking, and now it's been almost three months since I last talked to them. They used to send a message here and there, even when I was gone, and now they stopped. I understand, though. Who would want to talk to someone who can't even stay in a conversation? I'll also add that I did summon the courage to send a few apologies between ""disappearances"", and they were accepted, but I think I've worn out apologizing. I feel like absolute shit.

Part 2: More shit..

This involves the friend I mentioned above, and another super close friend of mine.

So, my friends are way more extroverted than me, and call and video chat like it's nothing. I can't do this worth a shit. Talking on the phone is easy when it's family or school, etc, but friends? Brain goes, ""nope!""..

Both friends have said they wanted to video/voice chat. I agreed to do so, but once the time came, I couldn't utter a single word. I felt like shit for that, and apologized countless times. We agreed to try again, didn't work. A few more times, and they gave up. I told friend 'A' (PT 1) that I have terrible anxiety and I just can't do it. They said we would work on it. No progress because I've been MIA.

I met one friend while playing a game. They and a group of friends talk on Skype all the time. I'm just awkward and silent.   I can't fucking speak, urghhh! And they're friends, not strangers! (I've also disappeared here as well -sigh- )

I'm just in a rut.  I wish I was a better friend and not such a mess.

I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I'm just grateful someone took the time to read this. Thank you. :)",24Jun2018,3
112,"A little back story, I'm in a lead position at my company. there are 2 leads, me and another. We have 2 bosses, a supervisor (one step ahead of us) and a manager (2 steps ahead). A while back, maybe last year, we were told that we would never have to deal with people aka the more punishment side of work.

Fast forward to last week, we had an hour long meeting between the 4 of us where those 2 just pushed that responsibility on us, which I think is bullshit. Here's why. First off, we don't get paid for this shit. I bet half the room is making more than us. these are all the old fucks that have been with the company for 30 some years. The other half, I know for sure that I'm only making about $1 more than them, if that. Another reason, they had another supervisor position opening up in our room, but quickly dismissed it because they didn't think they needed another supervisor, which I agree with. Too many Chief's, not enough Indian's kind of room.

So here's the problem, is this even legal on their part? I mean, they keep using the excuse that they are in too many meetings all day and don't have time to deal with the people. Which, to be fair, might be the case for my manager. My supervisor however, is almost always around. I just have this feeling that the real reason is because none of them have a backbone to do the more punishment side. A little side note, our manager is pretty new, started about a year ago. When she first started, she tried super hard getting on everyone's good side. Being super friendly to everyone, getting nice comfy new chairs for everyone etc.. While refreshing cause our old manager was kind of a bitch, I think she's just too scared to be hated by everyone now. Our supervisor is kind of the same way, she just doesn't want to be seen as the bad person.

So in this meeting, this just flat out said this is now your responsibility, deal with it. And they tried to put a positive vibe to it, like this will help you become a supervisor yourselves one day so you might as well develop the skills now, stuff like that. My thing is, we don't get a pay raise, we don't get a title increase. If they wanted us to be a supervisor one day, they should have kept that position open. What can I put on my resume with this.. I have supervisor like skills? I just never quite got to the supervisor position. That just looks bad in my opinion. Are they just too lazy to do their actual jobs? Can they actually force this on us? It's all just kind of a bullshit situation.

Sorry if I typed this in a fucked up way, I'm not good at telling stories. If you have question's for me, feel free to ask as this probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Just trying to get some opinion's on the situation. Thanks for the impute :).

113,"Hey, I made a post on here earlier and it didn't get a lot of responses on it. In short, I have strong voyeuristic tendencies which make me feel sick with guilt and worry. This is almost completely from over doing it on the porn. I am constantly trying to find that thing that makes my lip quiver and my whole body feel tingly. This has led me down a path of absolute degeneracy as I try to find new ways to give myself stronger orgasms. I hate it. I want to slow the fuck down. I feel sick with myself every day and its causing me to drop hobbies as I go deeper down the rabbit hole. 

Heres where my immediate problem lies. Theres a group of girls, specifically one, that is coming over to my house on the forth. Most of them I could seriously give so little of a fuck about I can resist putting up a camera. It would be a plus but they would only be an occasional jerk off sesh and thats it, I can resist that just fine. This girl I've had a crush on for years. She's one of my dad's friend's daughter. She's also the only girl who I've met who makes me like this and I have no idea why. There's other girls I get along with better, there's other girls that are more attractive than her, but for some reason, I focus on her. She is 17 and has this innocent modest vibe about herself along with a Swedish accent and a nice body. The first time I saw her in a swim suit was four years ago, before hand I had only seen her in blue jeans and a tshirt or something like that, sometimes a dress but other than that nothing that showed off her body. I felt sick looking at her, I tried to set up a camera in the bathroom but it was so short notice that it didn't work, took pictures of her ass and jerked off to it so many times I actually became dehydrated, stole her panties from her bag and jerked off while smelling them. Felt more sick, I actually had a panic attack off and on for over an hour. Talked to one of her friends just to calm down, she has panic attacks too, noticed right off the bat I was having one for some reason, luckily I calmed down talking to her and my attention was diverted away from the main girl. Interestingly enough, I never felt the urge to set up hidden cameras with her. I saw her in a swim suit and thought she looked good in it. There was no uncontrollable lust. I have a feeling its because I've actually talked to her and see her as a person, while I see this other girl as a object of sexual gratification. Something that makes me go absolutely wild over. 

I see two options here, I either talk to her enough that I start to see her as a person, which is going to be hard after my previous track record...or I find some way of skipping out of most of my parents forth of July party and only come back at night when she isn't in a swim suit and I can actually control myself. Is there any way I can skip out without looking suspicious? Most of my friends are going to want to come to my house, maybe I can do shit around town with them or something? I don't know. All I know is I NEED to get out of the house when she is here and basically in her underwear because I can't control myself when she is like that. For her own safety at least so I don't perv her changing. ",24Jun2018,0
114,"It's been my mom and myself since I was 11. (My dad passed away) And she got remarried. But over the summer I'll be moving out and into an apartment with my boyfriend not too far from home. 
My mom and I are really close but I feel so bad for leaving. To the point that I almost cry just thinking about it. So what are some things that I can do to prepare for it?

115,"So, just for background information, 17F here writing about my 14F sister. We aren’t particularly close, and she has stepped hardcore into the party scene and has withdrawn from our family over the last two years. 

So this morning my parents left for a funeral of a family friend. It was about two and a half hours away so they decided to leave us at home. My sister had approached me very shortly after my parents left and asked about possibly having a guy over. My parents have caught her having extremely flirtatious conversations with guys and planned on having her put on birth control to be safe. Normally i would have 100% said no, but we will be attending the same school next year and i’d like for us to be closer. So, i agreed and helped clean up the house.

To my lack of knowledge, the guy she planned on having over is 17. I know this isn’t a huge gap, but the mental state of a 17 year old incoming junior boy and 14 year old incoming freshman girl do not mix well. She told me that she wasn’t planning on doing anything other than maybe kissing him. I should have known but just blew it off and let it happen.

So he finally comes over. Very rude to me, not acknowledging me and they fly off to her bedroom. I hear them laughing and talking after a little and i decide to just cool out. I take a shower and start getting ready to go out with friends when i hear noises coming from her room down the hall. Our house makes plenty of noises so i ignored it, until i could very clearly hear her moaning. I panicked. I couldn’t just bust in there and stop it so i just texted my best friend in a panic. After they finish and he goes downstairs to use the bathroom, i immediately tell her to come in my room. She has mascara all over her face and it’s very clear what happened. I felt so guilty and awful, but i have to leave to see some friends so i just leave her there.

I get home later with two friends and the guy is STILL THERE. It’s been like 4 hours and my parents should be home super soon. I politely ask him to leave and then proceed to flip him off through the window because he was total tool and so rude to me the entire time. I told my friends to wait and i went upstairs to check on my sister. She tells me she needs help getting the blood off her bed, and i walk in to see her white comforter has huge blood stains on it. I immediately began to cry like a baby. I don’t really know why, but something completely broke in me in that moment. I washed her sheets for her and made everyone dinner. She seems so fine with the situation and i can tell she really likes that boy, but i’m still torn.

My parents came home and i lied about why i was doing laundry and everyone moved on. But, it’s 1:52am and i’m sitting here with so much guilt. What if she gets pregnant? She says they used a condom but it still worries me. What if he shatters her heart? Will she hate me down the road for not stopping her? Will my parents ever forgive me for not stopping it if they found out? How will people treat her at school if they find out? My dad and her have always been closer than anyone else in our family, and his soul would shatter into a million pieces if he found out, and especially if he knew i didn’t put my foot down and get that older creep away from her. I also in some ways feel deeply insecure about the situation. I’ve decided to wait until marriage to have sex, but i’ve never done more than kiss a boy, and i’ve never been in a relationship with anyone. I feel extremely inadequate in some ways and i hate that i feel that way. 


I have serious anxiety issues and this is eating me alive. What should i do? Is this my fault? Could i have really stopped it? My best friend told me that it would have happened eventually, but i still can’t help and feel like if i had been more strict and not let some older guy make a move in her. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! ",24Jun2018,3

But my other roommate is a huge problem. I set ground rules when we first moved in. Don’t touch my stuff and I’ll respect your stuff too. I think this is common sense not to touch anyone’s things but you never know who you end up getting roomed with. 

My beers are always missing. I’ll get a 6 pack and she would take a couple beers without asking and when i called her out on she said “oh sorry i just needed a chaser”  and she drinks my wine.

She invites her friends over and they just make themselves home at the fridge and they don’t even ask my roommate which things are hers or mine and just eats my food and i come home with my food missing because of her friends too.

127,"I am in a relationship for two years andcurrently living together for a year. Last year i gave up my apartment for my roomate who had a baby and wanted to have the apartment for her own (another story). Rather than getting a new one, we m(32) and f (28) decided that we should just be together because i am spending hours and days anyway at his place. the lease was named from his ex that was dated back in 2010. he told me that he never had kids, and his mum and grandparents never mentioned any grand kids except for a grand dog (bf-sister's dog). 

He told me the reason why he never updated the contract is because he doesnt want the lease to go higher than what we are currently paying and the rent prices are already too high in our area(toronto).

after the whole debacle of me prying out the answers and paying half of the rent in pennies for a few months, we were quite domestic and lovey dovey. 

that is after he started going out to summer parties (both from job and old friends)and getting drunk. i already told him back then that i don't want him getting drunk on the streets (he got problems back then that he was so drunk that he would fell asleep on the park grass or somewhere and also because of my irrational fear - i almost got sexually abused by my father's bestfriend and he(father)was drunk on his bestfriend's house.).

i had already talked to him about this and this afternoon i made him pinky promise me that he would never get drunk and be home safe.when i was on my way home he said he'll be back in a hour (11pm). hours pass and still no bf (2am) . called him cause i was worried and he said that he was safe in his cousin's house (host) and that he will just go strait to work later. i'm hurt because he promised me and not just hours he breaks it. (just left me a message and called me that hes safe and he have a bed at his cousin's house)

im not good at any confrontation, but i tried to break up with him three days ago because he doesnt want any baby and i said i did. he wanted to compromise to a dog first.

i'm afraid that he'll just break his promises again.

i'm hurt that he did this.

i had gave up half of my career to cater to him. And i said i am willing to give up my career and decline on my post school program to have a family whether or not with him as the father.

is it worth it?

i'm confused.

Yesterday I went to a bday gath for one of my best friend’s of 13 years. So it was a small house party type thing and anyways I got smashed, wrecked, drunk. And I’m an affectionate person, I like to give people love when I’m drunk. Tell them I miss them, say they’re pretty and hug. BUT ITS NOTHING SEXUAL? Anyways I’m sure you can all recall a moment you’ve received a hug from a drunk person or given a hug while being drunk. 

Right so I gave the bday boy a hug and me and him were talking and his girlfriend got a bit shitty? Like me and her are good friends as well and she’s knows how I am, she knows very well I’d never go there with him or any guy at the party at all. But she still seems annoyed? Thing is she kisses guys, sits on their laps, hugs them all the time SOBER and he never says a thing but the moment one of his closest friends of 13 years does it it’s a bad thing? 

So what I’m really trying to say is was it wrong of me to have hugged him? It was nothing but a friendly hug and he hugged me back and it was a side hug not even a real one. Like idk why people like to make a big deal out of anything. I apologised to her a million times and she’s accepted it and said she wasn’t angry she knows how I am and I was drunk. But at the same time I know how she is and she’ll be nice to your face but speak shit behind your back about anything you do. I just need some feedback (positive preferred) about whether I was in the wrong or not.

131,"My husband and I are having a baby in two months and we just moved halfway across the country. He  got a job out of state right out of his bachelors (I finished mine a year ago) so we moved for better financial opportunities.

Needless to say, our family is very unhappy about the distance since we are having our first child. Everyone wants to come out to visit us after the baby is born - his mom, his dad &amp; dad's girlfriend (divorced parents), my grandparents and my mom.

My mom and his dad are much easier to manage personality wise and very open to waiting until we are comfortable and doing whatever we need.

I'm worried about my mother in law and my grandmother though. 

I get along well with both overall, but here are my concerns.

1- MIL is very nice but also a know it all and heavily critiqued my sister in law when her daughter was born. She wants to be here right after the baby is born and I do not need/want her criticizing me while I am adjusting to being a first time mom. My husband also has no parental leave because it is a new job so he will have to go back to work right away. I'm worried about having to entertain her, being exhausted, being criticized and then having no family time with my husband and daughter. She is trying to come right after the baby is born and be here at least a week. I am also introverted so social interaction can be generally exhausting. But because we live in another and have a spare room she would be staying with us, so there would be no reprieve at the end of the night when she goes to a hotel.

2- my grandmother I am not concerned about criticism or anything like that. She has always been supportive and will let me figure it out, and I'm comfortable enough with her to bite back so to speak. I'm worried about her trying to stay too long, wanting time with the baby when I am trying to form that bond, and her getting on my husband's nerves.

3 - the two of them want to be here at the same time right after the birth and I do not know how to accommodate them in my home space wise, deal with their personalities (they will clash especially on parenting), or make time for my husband to bond with the baby when he gets home.

 4- a lot of what I have heard others say is that if you have visitors in the first few weeks it's really better if they are there to support you while you learn and adapt because it is a transition and exhausting, not to ogle the baby and get as much baby time as they can (which I'm sure is what both of them would want).

Note: I will be breastfeeding.

I'm really looking for advice on trying to manage and coordinate having visitors. What did you like, what worked well, what was exhausting and what did you wish you did differently?? I'm having a hard time being firm in my gut feelings because I really don't know what I should do or what I'll want for sure, but I am very concerned that it will just be a nightmare of me trying to entertain people while they constantly want mine and the babys attention.

138,"So I have been extremely good friends with this guy who I met through my boyfriend. We started off as a trio, but then my boyfriend got extremely busy. Because of this, his friend and I had a lot of time to get to know each other more. We quickly became close and maybe too close to the point where I’m closer to him than I am to my boyfriend.

My boyfriend is still extremely busy so my friend and I refrain from hanging out. He finds the idea of is hanging out our own weird, which is understandable because he respects my boyfriend, but I thought we were close enough to be able to do that (?). 

I’m not going to his grad party because my boyfriend isn’t going to be with me and it just sucks. He’s also leaving for college soon. I haven’t hung out with him since since the middle of the school year. 

How do I get him to see me as a separate person from my boyfriend? I just want him to be comfortable and just see me as one of the “guys”, but it’s been a struggle.

140,"Using a throwaway cause he’s pretty active on Reddit and avoids the subject like the sun.

My cousin, who I’ve grown up with and is my best friend, has been living under some shorty conditions most of his life. The past doesn’t matter as much as the present.

He’s currently with his mom and her boyfriend, the three of them alongside 3 or 4 cats, live in a small trailer on private property that they pay the landlord for. There’s no water, obviously an issue. The mother doesn’t allow the cats to go outside for fear of ‘losing’ them, meaning a constantly full litter box.

The mother and boyfriend are both slackers, the mother is on the verge of being fired again. She’s been unable to find an apartment, one of the biggest issues? The cats obviously. Which she’ll ‘never’ part with.

I’ve talked to him and tried to convince him multiple times, his best option would be Job Corps, it’ll get him under a real roof with proper necessities. But because of his upbringing, he’s super insecure, shy and socially awkward. He will always respond to this subject by saying he’ll be around people he doesn’t know and he  afraid of having a roommate because they’ll judge him.

**More info**

&gt;Dad is not in the picture, he’s homeless and works under the table a few states away.

&gt;The rest of our relatives are either deadbeats or literally dead (immigration doesn’t always go well)

&gt;I’d house him with me but I live in a one bedroom (no living room) with a wife and child.

&gt;The cousin has just turned 18 a few weeks ago.

&gt;They live in a rural area, the closest possible job is about a 2-3 hour hike.

141,"SO, I started a new job about a year ago. It's a really good job- pays well, great benefits, etc. The kind of job you stay in for 30 years. I plan on doing exactly that.

The way our offices are set up, we share office space with each other. So, in my room there are 4 other women. In the adjacent offices, they each have 4-5 women in them each.

The year went along fine. I worked really hard. Did really well. In the last two weeks of work, something happened and 2 of the women in my room started being 'mean girls'.... I know, I know. This is not high school, but they acted like it. They'd leave the room when I entered and didn't say a word to me. When I said 'good morning' there was no response. I don't care about BEING FRIENDS with them. I have enough friends. I just didn't appreciate the isolation tactics because I have to SIT AT MY DESK and it's awkward when it's so obvious what they're doing and I just want to GET ALONG professionally with everyone.

So I confided in a friend in the back office and she has been there for 10 years and she goes, 'Yea, everyone knows those women can be mean girls.""

So I felt better knowing it's not just me.

They continued being weird/mean for a week and the whole time I did my work elsewhere - lots of other open space- with my one really good friend who also knows the dynamic.

Then, finally, this past week, they stopped being mean. I don't know if someone said something to them or it's just the ebb and flow of shit, but I was relieved simply because it was making me feel uncomfortable and awkward doing work in my room.

The girl in the back office that I had confided in- EMILY- invited me out to see a concert with her and her husband. She sent me a text message the day after I confided in her and said I should bring my boyfriend.... At first I was stoked- i love concerts and I want to hang out with people outside of work. Then, I thought about bailing because I was too tired. In the end, my boyfriend and I went.

We met up for drinks first and then went to the concert.

It was fun.

But there were a few things that happened that are annoying me. And I tend to over think and over analyze everything.

1. Emily wanted to talk about work when I didn't. But I indulged her and said things are fine in the room now and she was right about the mean girls thing.
2. Her husband started talking about a woman at work that Emily hated and Emily immediately tried to hush him and I'm like why?? This woman is retired, you have nothing to worry about. It's not like I will tell anyone, etc. I just felt it odd that she wanted to hear my shit about women at work but wasn't forth coming with her shit.
3. She knows my bf is Italian. I am not (obviously so). 
When we were all sitting down, all four of us, and drinking, she goes to my boyfriend 'Whats your last name?"" He says 'ricardi and she goes ""ricardi""...so you're italian and i'm italian any my husband is italian.... and makes some generalization about italians that wasn't super pertinent to the convo. And I'm thinking that she only asked to find out his last name not to confirm he was italian. He has the most italian sounding first name AND i had mentioned at work that he was italian, so she knew. I just didn't like it. It felt NOSY.
4. Later again, when we were sitting, she said TO him over me because i'm sitting in between..... 'you have nice skin.'.... and he innocently goes, ahh i've been out in the sun recently, etc. and she goes 'that could be it or not, but you just have great skin.'
This comment bothered me too. Why are you complimenting my bf's skin. Your husband is right there. I am right here. This is weird.

Am I over reacting? I thought her husband had great hair. I would NEVER say anything like that to him esp with her there. I am so respectful of relationships and boundaries and always anticipate what may or may not make someone feel uncomfortable.

Then it was 1 am and they clearly wanted to keep staying out, so we said we were done drinking and wanted to grab pizza and they stayed put. That was the end of the night.

We don't go back to work for another 2 months.

Now I'm second guessing everything and giving myself a hard time for saying YES to this invite and bringing my boyfriend.

I am usually a very VERY private person and like to keep work and personal life separate. BUT because I had confided in Emily earlier, and she was being nice enough to invite me to something, I felt pressured to go. I could have easily said NO. I wish I did.

Now she knows my bf's last name, and if we ever break up she will have met him. And I will be there at this job for another 25 years. Every other woman in this dept. is MARRIED with kids. NO divorces. And no one is childfree. It's crazy. I don't even know if I want to get married and pretty sure I don't want kids.

And I just feel exposed that she met him and was weird with him- who compliments someone's skin and appearance in front of his girlfriend?

I KNOW I can be crazy and over analyse everything to death. And I also give myself a hard time over decisions that I think weren't great. This is not A BIG DEAL i get that but it's been bothering me non stop and I wish I could go back and politely decline the invite.

I love going out and have tons of friends outside of work. The reason THIS is bothering me so much is because I like to keep work and personal life separate. And I crossed that line. And now she KNOWS my bf and its making me cringe. And if we ever break up she'll be the one person at work that knows my past. And I HATE that.

145,"Idk for sure if I'm posting this to the correct group (never used Reddit before), but I'm looking for advice on how to conceal a facial bruise. It's about the size of a peach on one of my cheeks. Makeup would be the obvious answer, but I don't have any on hand, and all the stores in my area are closed, so I won't be able to buy any by the time I need it. Any ideas?

I have to hide it before a meeting at work tomorrow. My boss will assume the worst and think that my boyfriend has been beating me if I haven't hid it by then--he hasn't by the way. It's a long silly story, hence the reason I'd rather just hide it.

The story if anyone is interested: last night boyfriend and I were rough-housing and he was fooling around and sucked on my cheek to gross me out, he ended up leaving a massive bruise-like hickey on my face. To make matters worse, today we fought really bad and he ended up punching a door in the process (NOT me, he'd never hurt me) so his knuckles are all bruised bloodied up. Two totally unrelated incidents, but put together that look awful from first impressions. Again, my boss is very quick to defend her girl employees, so any advice on how to hide this without makeup would be hella appreciated, I'd rather not explain the embarrassment behind what really happened.",24Jun2018,0

This then started a bit of an argument and he is swearing up and down that he didn't turn it off. does facebook have bugs with the active feature?

We waited to have kids until we had security.  I was very excited when she got pregnant - we were on cloud-9, planning out how amazing our lives would be when we welcomed our son.  I think we were both ready.

We followed all the rules, every check-up, we did everything right and everything that the good doctors told us to do, and went with a natural birth.  My wife had a stroke during her delivery and died the following day.

That was then.

My son is going to be seven this month.  He has everything he needs.  I try to be a good dad and I think anyone on the outside would say everything is fine.  It's motions, to me, and I try to go through the motions in his interest and I do what I can do ensure that he's happy.   But I miss her so much, and I'm afraid that I blame him.  It's irrational, I know, but I'm not connecting - I don't feel what I should be feeling and I hate myself for that.

I loved her more than anything.  And I know that our son was her dream and that he would have been her life.  I thought I felt that way too.  But I'm angry and I can't feel what I need to feel.  I don't know what to do.

152,"So...... I was in an age gap relationship for 3 years, living with someone much younger. Recently because of issues with where we go, negative stuff from her family, I initiated us to split up. 

Sadly after the split she ended up spending some nights back in my house and she got pregnant. (yeah that was a stupid mistake).

She then decided after knowing she was pregnant to try living with her sister in another country. ( We lived in France). Her mother then sent her a one way ticket to Florida and she went. She refused to have any discussions about the future except her saying vaguely she wanted me in the babies life.

I own my own house here in France, and I am an IT consultant architect. At my age (60) there is fuck all hope even in Europe I get a permanent job, I do OK with contracting.

Where she lives there are NO jobs available to me with what I do, and trust me I have looked incessantly. 

She refuses to return to live near me, and I am refusing to come to Florida and work in a minimum wage situation. It would be a disaster, and I would not then have the resources to actually support a child properly. She herself has no qualifications .... so she is going to be in a minimum wage situation living in her mothers spare room. She refuses any form of counselling or mediation. 

This is a train wreak and I fear her mother has her head up her  ass about the reality of the future of the child and her daughter.

I offered her a paid apartment, a car etc and she would not have to work until after the baby but she refused this as well.

And no there are not issues of violence or drugs etc in our past relationship, I think she was furious that I split with her. She has poor skills in managing money, in so far that when she left, she had zero money because she spent what she had earned before she left.

Any advice? I want to be in the babies life and support the child, but at my age moving to a shit hole town in Florida with no senior IT contracts will basically mean my life will be a train wreak and I will not be able to give the child any decent life. Realistically I can only do this from Europe. I have no network in the USA ( all of my work/contracts are found via personal professional connections) 

I have worked out budgets, explained the job situation etc, but she refuses to discuss or respond.

Her parents keep her locked away almost like a princess in a tower and they don’t let her tell anyone about what’s going on in her personal life (although she tells me some things).

163,"It might be a bit late right now to do this and I don’t know if I’ll get anyone soon at this time but here it goes. 

So today started out somewhat normal. Me and the wife were working on doing a lot of cleaning around the house today. And our vacuum broke down on us a while back so I have been borrowing my one friends vacuum from time to time. My friend lives with his daughter and one other roommate. Anyway I went over to their house and more or less let myself in after no one answered the doorbell. My friend I knew was on his way back from a long trip so I didn’t expect to see him, and the daughter has her thing going on out of town. When I went in after no answer I came across their roommates dead body laying on the floor. (He had health problems) It was apparent that he was there for a while. 

And what happened after that was the usual procedure. I called 911 and people showed up and I answered any questions the police had and I called my friend and his daughter and took care of what I could for them. 

Anyway the rest of the day I’ve been pretty shaken up about it and stuff and at this point right now I am having trouble sleeping. Falling asleep isn’t the problem but it’s that when I was about to drift away I felt my mind going straight back to that scene. I had a short nightmare where I was back at the house and was expecting to see the body there after I heard his voice. 

It is freaking me out a bit and making me want to avoid sleep all together. This whole day since that my mind keeps going back to that scene and I keep seeing it vividly. Is there anything I can do to get past this?",24Jun2018,1

Then my mom got me back and I loved with her and my step dad till I was about 11 then they went to jail also for another 4 years and I went to live with another foster family. I then had a benign brain tumor which kinda messed me up for probably my most important years of high school and messing up my gpa. And between that I’ve been constantly moving around the state. Now I’m 19 and been graduated for a year, and I’ve never felt as if I had true parental figures in my life to help me figure out what I need to do with my life.

But, I am always haunted by the fact that I have absolutely got no friends apart from a few (3 in number to be accurate) and that is really bothering me. I try to make friends and suddenly something happens and even at the slightest of issues those new friends walk out of my life leaving me alone, again. I just let out a sigh and think may be this person was not destined to be with me and let it go.

A part of me always reminds me that may be my life is not very interesting for them and hence they get bored with me as the reason for them leaving me.

But, it's been happening too frequently for my liking. I've seen people who have friends who, even after the nastiest of fights, they'll always be there for each other. 

Why do people tend to walk out of my life like that? What's wrong with me?

Should I make peace with the fact that I am going to live my life alone without making friends for the rest of it or should I do something about it?

Yesterday we went to his nieces birthday, and a lot of stuff that happened annoyed the shit out of me...

First his sister invited his ex girlfriend to the birthday after making it clear it was just going to be immediate family, sisters, Mum &amp; us... and we get there, and she turns up (the ex).

Secondly, his nephew rings up and talks about how his girlfriend saw a post on my fb about being pregnant (i don’t post personal life on fb) and assumed that I had gotten pregnant to someone other than him... I told current partner to announce and he obviously hadn’t... made me feel like he was ashamed to say something! 

Third, I’m just over his sisters... they congratulate him on being around this time around and being here for us. They stroke his ego to the point he thinks he’s doing enough just by being here physically. It’s annoying me...

Fourth, I’m really stressed out financially, I make just enough to cover bills and essentials, which is okay, but with a new baby on the way and my son, it would be nice if current partner got a job and helped out... but after 3 months, his last login into a job site was a few weeks ago...

178,"My good friend is the kindest person I know. We were originally just internet study buddies for a language swap but we have become best friends quickly.  
But there is a huge gap in perspective.  
  
Today, we discussed finances - which we do from time to time, but usually its comparing GDP between countries or material prices or something plain - and they mentioned that they had xxx in their wallet. Of course, I laughed. They then proceeded to turn on their webcam and show me.  
Now, 99% of people I interact with are below the poverty line - but I have met several wealthy people. Finding out that they are well off changed nothing, but it also revealed to me why they are so optimistic.  

Today, they offered to buy me a plane ticket and all further expenses to visit them for 2 months in Eastern Europe.    
  
I said no. No way in hell. I cannot, will not.  
I cannot abandon all my bills - house, car, debt. I cannot leave and expect to come back to a job. I cannot take advantage of you - accept that much time and money. Even if you dont see it as being taken advantage of, **I do**.    
They dont understand that its not good to ask for things - because you wont get them.
   
No amount of explaining in either language is enough to make them understand *why* I cannot do the things they do.  
Poor people dont travel the world. Poor people dont eat whenever they want. Poor people fix things themselves, because they cant just pay someone to do it. Poor people dont 'lend each other $xxx'. Poor people dont get many opportunities *because they are poor*.   
 
Not one person will you ever hear say ""I would absolutely not like to tour Europe and make new friends and do amazing things"".  
No. I have reasons I cant. I'm always sick because doctors are expensive in America. I dont have a degree, because those cost tens of thousands of dollars here. I dont get time off from work - or stress.   
Being poor is so unhealthy but theres not much you can do. You do the best you can and sometimes a little more.   
And, for me, that is ok. I want things, but I have what I need and that is ok.   
    
I think I made them upset. I just dont know how to make them understand. I have wanted nothing more my entire life than to do exactly what they offered to me - but now is not the time. There may not ever be a time, and Im sorry, but I cant.",24Jun2018,1

We hung out more and more frequently and soon things got a little more serious. I knew she wanted to get back together but at first I wasn't ready. 

The past couple years I've had issues with depression but when I was with her I felt a little happier. She made me feel more comfortable about myself and she truly seems to care about me. Which is why I decided to get back together with her. 

Now about a month after I decided to date her again I'm realizing how different we are and I don't feel like we are compatible. She's a lot more outgoing and she likes to party while I'm more reserved. She also has a lot more energy than I do.  I'm also just not too into the sexual stuff but she seems to want it almost every time we hang out.

182,"My friend Alex is dating this girl named Jessica. Jessica has a problem with the fact that Alex is friends with my friends and I since there is a girl that Alex shared a relationship with (Alice). We have been friends with Alex for over years now and Jessica and Alex have just recently started dating. Jessica is constantly feeding Alex lies about how we are mean to her, isolate her and bully her. This is not true at all, in fact we have made constant efforts to be her friend. 

The first time we met Jessica was at a Halloween party where we were nothing but nice. She danced and flirted with all of Alex’s friends while inappropriately touching everyone. Everyone was uncomfortable but they still gave her a chance. The second time was during New Years where she bought a few friends. When she bought those friends without letting us know prior, we did not have enough tickets for the venue so her friends had to leave the line when the ticket holder would not issue anymore. During New Years, the friends were in their own corner where they were avoiding us. Jessica got in with a ticket but her friends did not so Alice and I and all our friends included Jessica in everything as she seemed really upset that she was alone. We spent the whole day together and were nothing but welcoming in fact Alex wrote us a thoughtful email thanking us for being so kind. The third time was for Alex’s birthday where Jessica was to plan everything. She decided that she wouldn’t do anything and put all the work on us. We made a separate chat where we did everything and made the birthday party happen. Jessica ended up cheating on Alex on his birthday in front of everyone and Alex was furious and they fought. She cried and convinced everyone it was untrue until the truth came out. Nobody really responded as they did not want to get involved and Jessica was trying to convince others that he’s horrible for calling her names. 

Randomly, Jessica started yelling at Alex for having Alice as a friend even though Alice and Alex keep their distance and barely speak. Alice decided to delete Jessica to keep more of a distance however Jessica caused a fight between Alex and Alice for it.  Jessica is constantly creating fights between our friend group because she has some idea that Alice likes Alex. She is constantly feeding things in Alex’s head such as how we were rude to her, didn’t include her friends, made them wait in line only to not get in and how we never gave her a chance from the beginning (which truly is untrue). Alex has cut several ties with his friends because Jessica has created scenarios and problems where Alex would argue on her behalf and end up losing the friend. Now Jessica has created a drift between Alex and 4-5 of his friends because he accused them of being mean to Jessica and being bad people. Jessica randomly messages all of us for being rude and how she just found out that she has been deleted from Alice even though she knew months in advance and brought the issue up before. She created a huge fight between us and Alex again to the point where we are all upset and confused as to what to do. 

She is very insecure that Alex fools around which in all honesty, he does. She knows he will be going to Las Vegas with his friends including us (she was invited also but refused). We believe her goal may be to convince Alex to hate us all and cancel his ticket to the trip so he won’t cheat &amp; that is why she is creating all this drama and bringing up problems from the past. Jessica has brought up many things in the past and have basically called us horrible people. We tried speaking to Alex about it but he believes Jessica is right and we are all in wrong. 

We all believe he is in a toxic relationship with Jessica as she is very controlling and manipulative. She doesn’t want Alex to have any friends aside from the ones that she approves of (her own of course). Alex is way too stubborn and blinded to think her intentions are wrong as she plays quite the amazing victim role. We have this trip coming up yet this friend group is going chaotic as everyone hates Jessica and are frustrated with Alex for yelling at them over false accusations. Some of the accusations made were how we treat her awfully since Alice “likes” Alex and we are mean to Jessica as Alice is our friend first. However Alice does not like Alex at all as their relationship was purely sexual and used to get over a past lover. 

I’m not sure what to do... I have deleted Jessica off social media because I am sick of all this drama she has been causing. I feel so bad for Alex and have told him multiple times that he is getting manipulated and brainwashed, but he doesn’t seem to listen. It is getting so awkward with our friend group as she created such a drift (her goal probably). Alex has no sense of how awful this is getting and how many people he is losing. We all love him very much but ever since Jessica came into the picture it’s been nothing but her insecurities projected onto us and Alice.

183,"*Sorry this will probably be a rant
So I've been friends with my two best friends for like 8 years and have always felt like I belonged and they liked me but since about mid way through last year they have been getting closer and closer while I'm kind of being pushed out. I know they still like me because we always have fun together when we are out but it's just that they spend a ton more time together than I do with them. There are a couple of things that are making me feel this way so I'm just gonna list them.

1. Mid way through last year one of them moved houses which sucks because before that we used to hang out almost every day and we would walk to school together etc. but now this friend has moved closer to the other one so they walk most of the way to school together and I meet them with another friend. 
2. They both do hockey and have been together so much because of it, it is constant like every weekend they are like ""we had a day competition together and guess what happened..."" 
3. They hang out a lot at each other's houses and always like being up things such as ""so guys on the weekend me and ___ made brownies but then we realised they had hazelnuts in them"" or so one friend makes lots of desserts and I've had a couple of them but the other friend was like ""I've tried like a million or your desserts""
4. I know they prefer each other over me because the other day we went to see a movie together and _1_ was like oh me and _2_ have already aggressive to sit next to each other, when I was clearly about the sit in between them

Sorry for ranting

I still like them but I'm just not sure what to do.I don't really want to ditch them because my situation would be a bit difficult to make new friends.

186,"Dear all, 

I'm an underage smoker and as one my mom hates it! I never tried hiding it from her as sooner or later she would have found out. I've got over an year before I turn 18 and I have to obey my parents to some extent in order to avoid clashes.
Today, my mother came to me with a preposition: ""If you quit smoking, now... I'll buy you a car when you when you turn 18! Whatever car you want, within reason.""
To be honest it didn't come to me as a shock as I knew how much she hates it. Like most boys I am a big car fan and having an expensive first car would be nice but I'm not too crazy about the idea. I go to a boarding school in a different country and I'm likely to go to university in a different country so a car at home wouldn't be used very often. If I get the car there it would be very expensive as insurance, city center tax and gas will still have to be paid. Also the steering wheel would on the right side. Furthermore, I don't want an expensive first car as it is nit unlikely that I crash and furthermore cars decrease in value very quickly so it is not an investment. It would definitely be useful to have it and also make it easier to pick up girls but I can do that just fine without a crazy first car. 

On the other hand I've wanted to buy a nice watch for a very long time. A watch which I'll be able to wear for the rest of my life and even pass it on to my children. Unlike cars, expensive watches don't decrease in value that quickly and don't require as much care as cars. The idea of having a nice expensive watch seems very attractive as I wouldn't have to buy one later. Also cars are bad for the environment and with the rise of electric cars and the ban of hybrids in some cities and city centers it doesn't exactly seem as the best thing to get right now. 

Lastly, I like smoking. Despite the annoying smell, nicotine helps me think and calms me down. I am addicted but I don't really want to stop. After all you only live ones so why not make the best of it and do what brings you pleasure and smoking really does bring me pleasure. 

Concludingly, I'm not really sure what to do as all three options seem quite attractive and despite money being a good motivation I'm split between a watch or a car. Any suggestions on what to do would be very welcome. Suggestions on what else I can do with that much money would be welcome. ",24Jun2018,1

189,"I am 19 years old, just finished my first year of college, and i feel so trapped i dont know what to do. I have always been a perfect daughter: getting good grades, taking care of my siblings, doing chores, listening to EVERYTHING my parents tell me to do. My parents are very conservative: no boyfriends, no partying, curfew at 11. In highschool I barely had any friends because they would never let me hang out with them, probably once every two weeks. If i did ask to hang out I would be interrogated on the EXACT details of what im doing. The first time i was away from them was when i lived in a dorm last year. Because my college is in-state (worst decision ever) my parents would make me come back home every weekend. The couple fridays that i did spend at school, i went out with my friends and got drunk. However i would always be responsible and still got straight As. I also had a boyfriend who was also a good student and who had a family that my parents have known for many years. But of course we had to keep it secret. I took many pictures on my phone throughout the year— me at parties, me with beer bottles in my hand, me with my boyfriend, one picture of me kissing him,  etc. Towards the end of the year, my parents found all these pictures and it ruined my life. My dad threatened me over the phone and called me the worst names to the point where I actually didn’t want to be alive any more, he called my boyfriend and threatened him, called his parents and threatened them, took away money from my bank account, and put a GPS tracker on my phone.  It was probably the worst week of my life. 

My only consolation was that I would be leaving for Atlanta for the summer for an internship. The company offers free housing for the interns but my parents decided i would be staying with my aunt and uncle instead. I didnt really care at the time because I just wanted to get away from them. When I started my internship, i made many new friends. With my parents and aunts permission, I hung out with them once a week (that was my limit) with a curfew of 7 PM. A couple days ago I went to a concert with my friends and planned to sleep over at their place. We all got drunk and went to the concert but before it even started my aunt called and said shes coming to pick me up. I started freaking out because they couldn’t know I was drunk but they found me through the tracker and took me home, realizing i had consumed alcohol. My aunt called me so many names and said I am a bad person, my dad called and yelled at me for hours, telling me I was to stay at home at all times now. I just wanted to die. I feel so trapped, I just want to explore and be able to do what i want, when I want. Im not even doing anything illegal I just want to have fun. But I cant even do that.

After talking to my friends, they said I could move out and live with them until the internship ended. The problem is that there is no way my family would allow me to do that. My plan is to leave in a couple days in the morning before anyone wakes up and leave a very-well written letter explaining everything. I dont know why I am so anxious about this, I haven’t been able to sleep and eat because i am scared of what they will do when they find out. The worst possible case is that my parents fly down here to Atlanta and come force me out but they don’t have access to inside the building so they really can’t to anything about it. 

Please tell me if this is a bad idea or should I continue living with my aunt for the rest of the summer.",24Jun2018,0

193,"I’m a  self employed . I have about a 100 customers, swimming pool maintenance business.
I’m professional. I’ve had my business 25 years.  I’m married, happily for almost 25yrs. I make weekly visits to customers pools adding chemicals , brushing ect. 

I’m NOT a “me too” person. I think Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein are very bad . But I think Chris hardwick did nothing wrong. 

Over the past 25 year I’ve had two incidents with men. Both said “ I surprised them”. Not true( I have a schedule)
They came out naked .
Side note: I have come up on customers showering or something. You can totally tell when it’s planned.
And when it’s an accident.

Both of these men laughingly told me-I swim in the nude( haha )you might catch me (wink wink.)
And of course when I arrived there they are naked.
I sent a letter in the mail quitting and I never go back.

Here is what happened last week I’ve been taking care of a family’s pool for 3 years. The wife works full time I’ve only met her once or twice the husband is semi retired. I see him maybe once or twice a month.
I guess his schedule varies. On my last visit he announced his child is going away to college in two weeks.
So he’s going to in stall a bell on the screen door so he knows when I arrive so he can come out naked.

Hahahaha. ( not funny to me) I just said please don’t come out naked.

We had this conversation while he was pressure washing his driveway ,me getting in my truck.
So he’s yelling this over the motor of the pressure washer. 
He also name drops some people from our community that I should know -I say I don’t know them my husband probably does and he adds well they know you. 
My husband works in a job where he knows a lot of people. I don’t know anyone. I’m pretty isolated to my customers. I don’t advertise ,my numbers are not published any where. I only work off referrals.

So in my mind I’ve been warned.  He gonna come out naked at some point.
Please understand i don’t think anything else will happen that is the worst. And the worst other side is I will have to quit. If this were to happen I would also email his wife and say the truth of my reason for quitting. But please also understand. IM THE ONE WHO LOSES. I will lose a customer. He will bad mouth me to all friends. My business is fine but these things do come up from time to time. Oh don’t hire her she is bad.

I talked to my husband he said quit. You don’t need this customer. Or he said to set my iPhone on voice record when I enter the pool area.

194,"One of the sisters has been cruel and abusive for years. Finally, the other sisters have cut her off from social media and do not have anything to do with her. They've tried for years and years and have been abused by this sister. Now she is getting counselling and the mom wants everyone to 'make nice' saying stuff like we have to heal the broken family and posting passive aggressive stuff on social media. Everyone has spoken several times to the mother and she says the right things, but her actions continue. Most recently she posted a photo of two sisters (one who's been cut off) saying 'good times that will happen again.' But none of the sisters want anything to happen again with this sister.

My parents started avoiding me like the plague so that I can study, which was actually kind of nice, but reduced my human contact to a minimum.

198,"TL:DR: I have been taking care of my sister since January 14th, my mother is willing to sign over rights to me how do I get this process started. 

Just to preface this story I am a 21 y/o married, financially stable, female. And my sister is a 13 y/o female. 

My mother signed away her parental rights to me when I was very young because she had drug issues. She signed me over to my abusive grandmother. She had my sister 8 years later and we all lived with my grandmother. My mother couldn’t take it anymore and left without us. My grandmother was mentally and emotionally abusive as well as severely mentally ill. I reached out multiple times and my schools (private schools) never did anything about it. My grandmother had an obsession with saying my sister was mentally ill and trying to get her committed to a mental institution and made a ward of the state. It eventually backfired on her and she was investigated by CPS and removed from my grandmothers custody and sent to love with my mother. They couldn’t do anything for me because I was 18 and I was too scared to get myself out. 

Eventually I did get myself out and moved in with my mother. My mother barely could keep a job and was a severe alcoholic. We had water/ electricity cut off constantly and she was also a hoarder and smoked in the house even knowing I have asthma and breathing issues. She kept lots of pets and let them urinate and defecate in the house. I got married and moved out then 4 months later I went back to my mothers house and basically told her I was taking my sister and she wasn’t ever coming back. And that if she had a problem with it we could call the police right now and they could come and see the conditions she lived it. My sister had no water, no food, no electricity, no bathrooms that worked, it was roach infested, etc. 

So I took her home with me and pulled her out of public school because she was failing. I homeschooled her and she finished out the year homeschooled but I want to enroll her in school this year but I can’t because I don’t have guardianship. I am in contact with our mother now. She is willing to sign over rights to me. She has no job, car, government assistance or anything. She is living with a cousin and relies on her for everything. 

I know I can call CPS but I don’t want them to take her away from me. I don’t think they will because she has been living with me for 6 months, I am married and financially stable. I have a car, a job that I have been working at for almost three years, my husband has been working at his job for 1&amp;1/2 years. We live in a CLEAN apartment. We have all the food we need, I am not on ANY government assistance whatsoever and I alone pull in around $50k a year. We have no debt whatsoever except for our car payment and have never missed a payment on any bill ever. Also neither one of us has ever been in any legal trouble and we have been married for over a year. Also we aren’t drinkers, or partiers. 

What are the steps that I need to take to get this ball rolling? I don’t have thousands of dollars for lawyers, the state I live in is Louisiana. As I stated previously, my mother is willing to sign over rights to me. Her father is not in the picture and signed over his parental rights when she was born. I’m scared to lose her and she is scared to lose me as we are all each other has ever had. She has food to eat, never has to worry about losing electricity or water or the roof over her head. She went from being a straight F student to all A’s. She wouldn’t even speak before and now has a vibrant and witty personality. Also we both have ASD. 

I’m sorry this is all over the place but also the landlord took pictures of the previous living conditions, sent them to me  and said she is ready and willing to come to my defense if necessary. 

Thanks for taking the time out to read this. And respond if you choose. I’m sorry if this was all over the place, or if I said something stupid or unnecessary. I’m young as well and am still trying to figure life out. ",24Jun2018,0

We are(I'm not so sure if I want her to be in my band anymore) are in a band together. The other band playing with us said we could use their amps she didn't bother reminding them last night at the show she needed to use them so when me and the drummer were setting up she grabbed her stuff and walked out.

I have been playing music for 5 years, and have been playing out for 2 years. I started using social media a year and half ago for my music and to get local shows. I am not bragging, but I have managed(so far) as I only use social media once every few weeks to get 230 followers. Lexi, has started using it but only has 90 followers she started bringing this up how its not fair and she said me and the drummer sucked because we never went to music school like her. Drummer has been playing for 5 years as well. Lexi? She has only been for 2 and she dropped out of music school after a year but acts all high and mighty for going. 

She has scared other members we have had before off for telling them they suck and bragging about going to school for it.

I just really want to know, why she acts like this? I tried explaining to her by text of what happened and that it was a miscommunication and that I wished she would have gotten me before running out so I could remind her about the sharing of amps. 

What does it sound like to you? Should we drop her? Or give another chance? What would you do? ",24Jun2018,1
201,"Ex isn't the best term. He's really more of a ""former lover"" and close friend. 

Let's call him Kyle, who I knew in college for a bit and we moved to different ends of the country after graduation. We've stayed in very consistent, intimate contact for the years that we've been physically separated. Kyle has visited the city I live several times and we've been together every time while both unattached. 

In January I planned this 5 day trip to his city over the 4th of July where I'll be staying with him. He informed me a day or so ago (so 12 days before I'll be there) that he's recently started seeing someone. I'll still be able to stay with him, he'd still like for me to stay with him, it'll just be in a guest room.

Fine, cool, no problem respecting his relationship. I'm not mad at him for being with someone.

204,"How does one go about finding a doctor? I have been going to my current doctor since I was kid. My parents have stopped seeing this doctor but up until recently I have had no reason to change.

 However, since I am getting older I am taking my health more seriously. In the past it was just normal illness they would take care of with antibiotics/whatever. 

The first red flag for me was when I decided to get my first physical last September. I had lost about 60 lbs and was simply trying to lead a healthy lifestyle. The doctor barely discussed this with me and just noted my bmi. I also have been having severe discomfort in my feet which makes standing for prolonged periods of time very difficult. He said he didn't noticed anything other than general tightness and wanted to refer me to physio therapy. Last thing i have a rather large cyst of my chest I have had for years. Not one mention of it. Nurse took my blood and that was it.

Since then I have returned for more things. I had been suffering from chronic sinus infections this last flu season. I went to clinic by my house a few times before calling the doctor. I went to doc and mentioned how often this is happening. They just gave me antibiotics but also noticed a polyp in my throat and gave me referal to the ENT doctor. I followed up and turned out to be benign.

The next thing was a few months I broke my small finger (boxer break). I was referred to a orthopedic surgeon. Turns outs it was already healing nicely and I would be fine. They just recommended therapy until I could make a fist again.

The bottom line is. I'm tired of being referred to someone else whenever I have a problem. I want to get the pains in my feet and legs looked at. I also been having anxiety and depression issues (saw them for this in the past and was referred). But thats another story.

So is this normal for a doctor to do? Or should I find a new doctor? If so how does one go about doing this? Call around schedule appointments for nothing/meeting?

I’ve been dating my bf for almost 3 years (known him for 8) and for the most part everything is pretty average when coming to your typical relationship. Except for the sex part.  We haven’t had sex in 7 months. 

We went from having sex quite a few times a week to nothing. 
It seems like he is never in the mood and says it’s because he’s depressed. He’s been going through a lot of family health issues and has been stressing him out - and I can see that. 

I guess I just want to know if this is normal? I know he loves me and is very supportive. But it is really bothering me. How do I deal with this?

I \[24F\] recently **decided to leave my graduate program (physician assistant studies) because I didn't feel like that was going to make me happy in the long run**. I no longer feel a passion for medicine and feel as though this isn't a field that I can half-ass my way through. So, I stood tall and left hoping that I could forge my own path toward something that would be a better fit for me (functional health, fitness, wellness, etc.). I've been so focused on medicine though, that I'm at a loss as to where to even start. I want to help people become healthy in terms of lifestyle, but I want to have a career that is sustainable (and will pay the bills obviously).

Fast forward to last night, my **boyfriend \[25M\] of almost 3.5 years broke up with me** out of the blue, and from what I gathered from the conversation it was mostly because he was struggling with providing emotional support for me while I go through this process of figuring out what to do in terms of my career. He said he wasn't happy anymore and he just thinks that this is the best decision for him. He's a phenomenal guy, honestly the kindest human I have ever met. I'm mostly hurt because it came as such a surprise, because when I was making the decision to leave school he said that he would support me no matter what. It actually comforted me knowing that I had him by my side through all of this tough junk. But now its just getting even more tough. 

I've already internalized the whole ""it will get better with time"" bit. I feel like I've hit absolute rock bottom (in respect to my own life, I know there are worse things that could happen) and I absolutely loved this man and would do anything to make him happy- which is why I tried not to fight his decision. 

We live together though, so now I'm faced with the reality of moving back home, where job prospects are not so good and I know I won't be happy at all. 

My main question is, **what the heck am I supposed to do to pick myself up and get my life moving forward**. I don't even know what to do as a job- again I'd love to just work to help people become healthier versions of themselves through food and fitness- and I'm afraid that this whole situation is just going to bring me so far down in confidence/mood that I won't be able to focus on creating positive things in my life.

216,"1. Have guests write their name on their cup

At most events, guest will want more than one cup of juice or other beverage especially if there is a meal involved. Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell whose cup is whose, which is why people change cups after each drink. Writing names on cups using a Sharpie on permanent marker will make them easier to differentiate. That way everyone used one cup for the whole event as opposed to multiple cups. People should also rinse their cup when changing drinks to avoid unpleasant mixtures and empty them when setting them aside to prevent contamination.

2. Swap the 16-ounce bottles for the eight-ounce ones

Full sized 16-ounce bottles are common at any formal event, party or dance. But do people finish those bottles? The answer is usually no. Most people don’t want to have to carry around a full bottle until they’re finished. From my own observations, most 16-ounce bottles have between 40 and 80&amp;#37; of the water remaining when they are disposed. 

3. Buy or Order 15-20&amp;#37; less than the recommended size

Serving sizes are often very board estimates of how much people will eat. People’s appetites vary greatly depending on their age, weight, height and what they’ve eaten prior. It’s also more likely for people to eat less than a recommended serving size of an item at an event out of respect for the other attendees.  On the other hand, it doesn’t hurt to have extra non-perishable snacks like granola bars and chips on hand just in case anyone is still hunger.

4. Cut into smaller portions

Not everyone may have eaten the food you are serving. People don’t always know how much to eat until they are full. Smaller potions give people the opportunity to try and come back for more later if the like it or if they are still hungry. 

5. Survey Attendees on food selection

Offering food that basically no one wants to eat is the biggest waste of time and money. Asking attendees to complete a survey on google form or other online survey platform is a simple and efficient way make sure that you are ordering or making to what the guest want and can greatly reduce the number of leftovers and wasted food. Surveys are usually best for large events that involve a buffet style meal.

6. Offer more plant-based foods

A growing number of people are becoming vegetarians and vegans for health and animal welfare reasons. The carbon footprint of producing meat in factory farms (which is how most meat is today produced) is greater than the total carbon footprint of the entire transportation sector. For every kg of beef produced, 27 kg of CO2 is emitted (the equivalent of driving 63 miles) and 6.9kg (equivalent to driving 16 miles) of CO2 emitted for every pound of chicken produced. Plant-based foods also tend to be lower in saturated fat and cholesterol, which makes them healthier.

7. Buy local ingredients

If you are making your own food for a special occasion, then try to seek out some fruits and vegetables from local farms or farmer’s markets (if it’s the right season). Locally grown foods generally use less pesticides and no preservatives. There are few carbon emissions since there is not much need for long distance transportation. 

8. Rent or borrow tables, chairs and other supplies

It’s not always feasible to buy extra tables, chairs and other durable party supplies because it will take up extra space in your storage room. If you don’t have large events frequently, it isn’t very cost effective to buy excess tables and chairs. 

9. Buy cups, plates, and napkins made with recycled content

Recycling conserves natural resources, but materials can’t be recycled if there isn’t demand for that material. Products that used recycled content close the loop in recycling by reusing the materials put out for recycling. Next time you go shopping for disposable cups, plates and napkins, look for ones that say, “contains recycled content” since took less energy and fewer natural resources to produce.

10. Use boxes to collect recyclables

If you don’t have enough recycling bins, use cardboard boxes to collect empty bottles, cans, and plastic cups (check with hauler on plastic cups). Make sure that each recycling bin is clearly labeled with a sign that tells guests what can be recycled. Avoid using plastic bags to collect recyclables since most waste haulers require materials to be loose in the collection container and plastic bags are also not recyclable. When you are done with the boxes, break them down and toss them in your recycling cart, barrel or dumpster. In the food serving and preparation process, you can also recycle clear plastic clamshells/boxes (clean and empty), top half of pizza boxes (if there aren’t grease spots), and disposable aluminum trays (quick rinse to remove food residue and crumple up). Other items such as plates, foam items, paper cups, utensils, food soiled containers, and napkins must be placed in the trash.",24Jun2018,1

221,"My driving test is coming up on Tuesday (26th) and I’ve had over two months of driving lessons. I’ve had previous driving experience before these lessons as well, I had 8 with a previous instructor a few years ago but because of depression I cancelled and never finished them or went for my test.  
Between this time I also bought a car to drive provisionally and try and motivate myself to get back into lessons and also brush up on my skills. So in total I’ve been driving for about two years irregularly. 

Honestly I have really good car control, my instructor has said as much numerous times, I suck at directions whilst driving but hey that’s what GPS is for. My worry is that I feel like even through all this time of driving experience, my road perception hasn’t improved all that much, I feel like when I’m driving it’s a lot of information to process at once - reading road signs, taking note of speed limits particularly in built up areas where it changes a lot at low speeds, being aware of your surroundings, knowing where you’re going. It feels like an overload to me, and while I haven’t done anything majorly dangerous as of yet, I feel like (especially because of how well I can handle the car) I too confidently make rash decisions suddenly like turning at a junction I didn’t know I was meant to be going down initially, so I can quickly correct it but it’s going faster than I’m supposed to, or trying to get past something that it turns out I can get past but for cautionary reasons my instructor probably would’ve waited for. I know in a test scenario that’s probably going to be something I’ll get failed on, not accumulating little minors but something big. 

I wasn’t anticipating passing my theory either but I got 49 of of 50 for the questions and I think it was 42 of of 44 for the hazard perception.

It's always good to potentially hear some sides I may not be considering myself. I'm 27 by the way

Basically, I currently live in the annex flat of my grandparents' house. I pay very low rent (£200 a month including bills), in a nice town about 45 minutes from London by train. Originally I moved here when I broke up with my GF and it was meant to be fairly temporary, but my grandparents really like having me here as I can help them out with computer and gardening stuff now and then, and in return I pay really low rent

I work from home as a freelance web designer so could live anywhere. Most of my friends and my GF live in London so I travel there a fair bit

Now, a very good friend of mine is buying his own place and asked me if I'd like to move into the second bedroom (it would just be us two). It's in a fairly remote part of London (zone 4 if that means anything to you guys), about 30 minutes on the Tube from Central London. It's a nice area though, not rough or anything. He's asking for very low rent (£350 a month including all bills), and given that I take the train to London pretty much every week to see my GF and friends, the difference would pretty much even out if I lived there. I know I'm extremely lucky to have two very affordable options in front of me

Pros of moving:

\-I feel a little lonely out here sometimes and don't have many friends in this town, so apart from weekends when I'm with my GF or friends I get quite lonely

\-I get on really well with this friend and I know living with him would be fun. It would be good to have someone to talk to and have dinner and drinks with and stuff, but still have my own room for working and having time to myself

\-I could get to my GF and friends in far less time and spend less on travel (although I'm currently 45 mins from London, the train is way more expensive than the local London tube and with all the changing and getting to the station it takes about 90 mins door to door. The mainline trains are also a pain in the ass)

\-While my grandparents are hands off most of the time, they are still right next door and although we get on very well sometimes it feels like I'd prefer some distance from family

Cons of moving:

\-I currently have a totally self-contained flat (it's an annex, but has a large bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom all for myself and my grandparents give me a lot of privacy), and would be giving that up for just a room in a shared flat. My current place is all really nicely done out and I'd essentially be giving up having the freedom of having somewhere just for me. My friend's place is decent but not as fancy as this one

\-I'd feel somewhat guilty as I know my grandparents really love having me here, and it's good I can help them out with stuff when they need it, especially as they get older (that said, I know I have to live my own life and I could still come and visit them, so I shouldn't let guilt play into it too much)

\-I have a cat who currently has garden access, and my friend's flat is on the fifth floor of a building. She's very happy for my cat to come along too, but he would become an indoor cat and I'm worried he might get sad, but I'd have to see how that goes

\-While I know life is fluid and you never know what's round the corner, my current situation is pretty stable and my friend could decide to move on/have the flat all to herself at any time/raise the rent

Sorry for the massive post, would just like some opinions! Of course I will give this very serious thought as once I move out of here my grandparents might rent the annex out and I couldn't just change my mind. I feel very lucky living here so cheaply but I also don't want to stay here just because it's easy. That said, living with other people always raises issues and even though me and my friend are really good buddies I'm sure there will be things that cause tensions now and then. But I guess that's something I'd just have to live with for the benefit of having company and the fun of living together

\*\*tl;dr\*\* I currently live in my grandparents' annex flat and pay very low rent. My very good friend has invited me to move in with him and the price difference would be negligible. I think it could be really fun, and I'd be nearer my GF and friends, but at the same time I have a very comfortable situation here and I'm not sure if moving would make me happier or not overall",24Jun2018,1
229,"I am 16. To be individual, to be better than average, to be unique has always been something really important to me. 

The past year I have started to look into myself and self improve. Now I feel like I'm just a dime of dozen, one of 7,2 billion humans and not special at all. In the past, I always felt like I'm superior to anyone else (I had great grades without learning, had really interesting childhood experiences, able to speak Russian, Chechen, English and German).

Being better than everyone else is so damn important to me. I never really took action, because it's safer to live with the thought that you could be great, but just don't want to.

What is really bothering me is that I compare myself to everyone I dislike. (It's my first year in highschool) 

**For example, there's this one guy who's 1 year younger than me. He is really depressed (Like I used to be) He is really self-sacrificing when he doesn't have to be, helping everyone, anytime (Like I used to be) Also he is really negative and well, unattractive (that's because he's depressed (Like I used to be)) and I always think ""What if I am/was like that?"" This thought is killing me.**

*What if people don't see me like I want to be seen? What makes me me? What if people thing of me, like I think of the people who I dislike? Does thinking these things make me, sub-consciously, terrible?*

I want to be liked, I want to be respected, I want to be an amazing individual. But doesn't everybody else too? 

There's this one girl who comes off as awkward and unsympathetic. A lot of people would stop thinking about her at this stage, but I sub-consiouscly relate to her because she also has a narcissist dad.

**I feel like I'm losing myself.** ",24Jun2018,1
230,"We had a cycle of breaking up. I would get fed up with how she would handle things. But she was only acting that way because she was anxious about pleasing me and then would do the wrong thing, making me angry. That would upset her more then upset me more, until it brought me to a breaking point. I would end the relationship because I didn’t know what else to do but would then not even a day later would say sorry and ask for her to take me back. The last and final one was 7 months ago. We’ve had time to make changes in our lives. Make new friends. Find ourselves. We just recently talked to each other and we kind of fell back into place where we left off. We discussed our problems. How we’re two different people. We have the same values and morals. We just fit so right. She makes me a better person and makes me want to be better. She’s a motivated person and is constantly trying to improve. She’s smart and funny. Beautiful. Gracious and kind. I feel like I can be my true self with her. We did drive each other crazy however. Towards the end it was a roller coaster of emotions. Right now I’m conflicted if I should try this again. I am afraid I’m doing this because Im lonely And miss her. I try to think why we broke up and what was the cause but I then think it could be fixed if we work at it. If it doesn’t work then that’d be even more time we spent on a failing relationship and missing opportunities in our lives we could be taking. I can’t see myself without her. I know my life wouldn’t be as great. I’m just scared it won’t work even if we try our hardest.",24Jun2018,1
231,"Around 3 days ago my partner who I was absolutely completely reliant on left me and I just went into a state of shock of denial so deep after one day of not being able to do anything but think about killing myself it kind of led me to fall into telling myself again and again that the universe was just messing with me and God really did favor me which was absolutely unlike me since not only was I an atheist, but also held a very strong belief that I was a God myself. I just vaguely held that belief until yesterday while I was staring at an empty chair I felt like God just showed up on it and I started speaking to it, asking it if things would be fine and if I'm doing the right things and it said yes and just generally comforted me. I had done drugs but they had worn off by the time this happened and they were just thc oil capsules. Besides that, I haven't ate at all in around 3 days as well but have been sleeping fine. I almost don't want it to go away at all because its comfort, but believe this might be something of concern. I believe that if I clear off an unoccupied chair thats in the same room as me, it'll sit there and be able to speak to me if I speak to it. I feel like its watching me right now and I'm ok with that

Its voice is a voice in my head thats kind of like a thought that isn't mine and it doesn't sound like my own

People take the initiative to start a conversation with her and doesn’t want to start one with me. When they do, I feel so awkward and don’t know what to talk about, which makes them less likely to want to continue conversing with me. My friend and I are working together during the holidays and she’s always welcomed by the other staffs while I’m awkwardly left alone. I have no idea what to do and soon, I will be assigned to a out-of-class school activity with her and I am afraid that I will be left alone again. I really want to talk to people and make friends but I just can’t.

I’m not just talking about romantic relationships here, I’m talking about friendships too. The bad thing is; when I do connect with someone, either romantically with a woman or just as friends with other people, they’re almost always bad news. I’m talking hard drug dealers/users, big time thieves, and extreme vandals. I have ended up in a horrible cycle where I’ll start hanging out with these people and get in too deep with them and eventually I almost always play either a minor or major role in some kind of crime that could get me time. After that happens too much, I distance myself from all of my shady friends and tell myself I’ll be a better person.

241,"So this is an throwaway account but here is the breakdown of my situation.

So I am friends with a 18 year old male and he is dating a 16 year old and they were in a relationship since middle school. My friend has been in rough times when he found out his ex was cheating on him so at that point he was needed the same attention as his ex. This relationship does gives him the attention he needs but in the cost of the female controlling his life. 

I didn't really know what was the situation until my friend became 18 and that is when he went open with me with his relationship. Basically what he told me that if he leaves her because he isn't happy with the relationship then she would report him for engaging in a sexual action with a minor. For me I do not know what to do since one if I call her out but she will report my friend for that reason of engaging in a sexual action with a minor. 

Now it might seem that I am not part of his situation but I do not like to see him this unhappy with his relationship and I want to help but he keeps on saying he got it under control but I know he doesn't expectually when his gf is threating to report him if he leaves.

So how do I help with his situation? And if it needs more detail I am willing to give more detail.",24Jun2018,1

244,"Not sure if I’m depressed or not but today I just feel absolutely shit and that everything is against me.

 At school my grades are rather good (about 4.3 since I’m taking APs and is like the top 10% of my year) however by the time I graduate (next year) I have to complete a fucking capstone project which I very overwhelming and I have no motivation to do it at all. It hit me really hard since I keep think that I won’t be able to graduate just because of a dumb fucking project.

My friends at school are pretty good. They are very fun to hangout with however I don’t open up to them. For some reason I just feel like something bad is going to happen if I do so. Also none of them seem to be depressed and I think telling them that I’m depressed would just be being bad news to them. It just doesn’t seem right to tell them.

At home my parents are extremely annoying. My mother literally knows nothing about tech and always ask help without finding her own solution. It just drives me crazy. My father is what I would call abusive. No he does not physically harm me. However he embarrasses me, right infront of my friends when we are playing games online and it’s not even a funny embarrassment. It was as if he doesn’t think about me at all. He doesn’t think if my friends hear him or not even though he clearly knows we were Skyping he just says whatever was in his mind without thinking who is being effected.Also he keeps demanding shit from me and keep telling me how I should act and what I need to do. It was like as if I am a moron who always need counseling. This to drives me insane but I continue to keep my feelings to myself. This is because all they will do to tell me hey I’ll pray for you or you should go meditate. 

Speaking of meditation, my parents are very religious. They are Buddhist and invest a lot into religion. My mother keeps going to temples and monks giving them offerings. This is because she hopes that her business will get better. This annoys the hell out of me because she have done this for a while now and nothing is improving at a reasonable rate so why continue wasting time on religion why not focus on the business. I’m not religious at all. My dad, luckily, isn’t as faithful as my mom however he does a lot of practices and keeps urging me to do it. Not to offend any religious people or anything but I feel like people who invest a lot is religion is just straight up stupid and it just piss me off when my parents are being very religious; hoping that things will improve because they give a certain group offerings and do certain practices just doesn’t makes sense to me. 

Then there’s my crush. She is the 1st girl I really get to talk to since I don’t really talk to anyone outside my group of friends(consisting of all guys since no girls at my school plays video games ) however it seems like she doesn’t feel the same way back. When I realize this, I was devastated. I was hoping for her to be the person I could tell how I’m really feeling about life, the things I’m worried about, or annoyed of; just being someone who I can trust and talk to. But now I feel like all my hopes have disappeared. I want to ask her out and have her be that person, but I’m afraid of a rejection and the potential to destroy our relationship. It would just mean that I lost hope for having a person I can trust and talk to. She is special to me, I don’t know why but i just don’t want our friendship to end because I ask her out. Obviously that probably isn’t going to be the outcome of me asking to date her but it’s a possibility.

Now i feel like life is not worth living anymore. I’ve considered suicide but that’s not the way I want to go. Doing so might be bringing other people down. They might think it’s their fault and might get depressed because of it. I don’t want that to happen because the reason I’m in this situation is because of me. I didn’t open up to anyone. You might think someone must’ve notice me being depressed but I hide that. I always keep my sad emotion to myself and mask it with a smile just in case. I don’t want to be the person who is sad all the time and ruin the atmosphere that’s why I mask my sad emotions with a smile.

I use to feel like I had so much potential, that I could do anything, that I could get into a good college, get a good job, and be successful. Simply just having to dream life. Obvious not everyone going to get that. But for me I don’t even know what to say. When i lost that dream and be in the situation I’m in right now. A year ago I had high hopes I was happy with where my life is going, I was one of the best performing student in my grade in math, physic, and chemistry all of which I would use for being an engineering(my dream job). Now my hopes are gone due to everything that’s happening. I don’t have the will to live with enthusiasm and spirit anymore, it just seem so pointless to try when there’s so many things against me. Part of it is my fault with the fact that I refuse to open up to anyone being a major part of it, but that is because I have trust issue. I’m afraid that if I tell my friends or parents they will make the situation worst. My mother tells everything about me, all my embarrassing moments goes to all her friends, my father doesn’t seem like he have to ability to help me, asking for help would just be pointless. My friends might be able to help but I’m afraid they will spread the fact that I hate my parents and it just seems like a bad idea. Right now I’m not really sure what to do and sometimes I fantasize about myself disappearing or starting to life over. I’m guessing that having someone to talk to is probably the best thing I could do but other than is there anything I could do to make myself feel good again. Also I don’t think meeting a therapist will help cause doing so means that I will have to tell my parents that I need a therapist and they would want to know why.",24Jun2018,1

249,"So looking for some other points of view about this situation, advice on what to do, or things we may not have thought about. So my husbands work has told him for the past year and a half or so that he would possibly be able to transfer within the company to the office in Seattle. In that time we have held off buying a house and moving out of our townhouse which we have outgrown because why buy a house if we aren't staying long and I'd rather just move once since it's a pain in the ass. Well it got serious and his boss sounded confident we would be relocating this past January and then things changed. The new product that his company came out with got insanely popular and his department (customer service) just couldn't keep up so any movements in the department got put on hold. Then his boss got fired and they are getting new directors and it's just been one thing after another. For the past year and a half we have been just thrown bread crumbs and lead on about moving.....it will happen when ""xyz"" happens in the company, and then that time/event comes or happens and then they change their mind and say oh no now ""abc"" needs to happen before you transfer. I am tired of being led on and waiting to be able to ""plant our roots"" because we are getting close to the point of wanting to start a family and I'd rather be living in a house when that happens and I also don't want to have to move either pregnant or with a child. We currently live in the south aka the Bible belt and as an atheist and northerner at heart, this southern culture just isn't for me and I absolutely do not want to live here forever. Qe have been here for about 5 years going to school and getting experience at our current jobs and I feel like I have learned this isn't  the place for me and I have tolerated  enough. The move would be to Seattle which we visited and I absolutely loved and feel that we would both fit in with that ""culture"" better. My husband's company has fantastic benefits and pay so he really doesn't want to leave it but he has tried looking for another job in Seattle at  similar companies but it has been hard because no companies want to have to hire and pay for relocation for a new employee (even though we offer to pay our own. Also side note if we got transferred with my husbands current company all moving expenses would be paid). Im a nurse so I would be able to find a job with no problem but it would be hard for my husband to find something just as good as his current job so that makes us hesitant to just up and move and he then look for a job when we get there. so the main issue is we are thinking of putting money down on a new construction house that will be finished in a few months because I am tired of putting off living comfortably in a house and moving forward in starting a family while we wait for his company to get their shit together. I mean it would be a pain in the ass to have to sell the house eventually but I hate feeling like we are at the mercy of his work and I want to move forward in life. I feel like it's Murphy's law and of course when we buy a house we will then get an answer about moving. Thoughts? Opinions? Advice?",24Jun2018,1

255,"So, I'm in the process of moving about 800 miles across country for grad school. I've yet to visit, the town or the school, and I only have 2 more months to find a place to live. The problem is that I don't know about signing a lease to a place without first seeing it or the surrounding area. So, I obviously have to go visit. Now, I cannot find a plane ticket for under $350. Additionally, I'd need a rental when I arrive. I figure, the best way for me to visit would be to just rent a car and take the +13 hours road trip. So, I start planning. I first find an apartment to look at and schedule a tour. This was last week. I then start looking for car rentals and find one. I plan on paying for it with my new credit card, which, I'm waiting for in the mail. Then, the day I'm supposed to get the rental, my credit card, which, I've been waiting 2 weeks for, doesn't arrive in the mail. Since my entire trip was depending on the credit card, I have to cancel the rental reservation and reschedule the apartment tour. Fast forward a week. My credit card is still not here. I get the pin. I get the account information. No card. That was yesterday (Saturday), so there's no chance I'll get it today. My mother has given me enough money for the trip. I put that in checkings. I then look at car rentals and they're ALL booked within a 30 mile radius at enterprise. I have no experience renting anywhere else, but I look into it. Avis? A bit more expensive, but I've no other choice. So, I start reserving a car and I see that they don't accept debit cards from people under 25. I'm under 25. They accept credit cards, but the card I've been waiting 3 weeks for still isn't here. If I do pay with a debit card, they'll do a credit check. Since I just opened a credit card account, my score went down 15 points. I'm already worried that I've shot myself in the foot here and won't be able to find an apartment with such a low score. I can't really handle another credit inquiry, other than for an apartment. So, I now have to wait till tomorrow for my credit card. Mail doesn't come until 11am. I wouldn't be able to hit the road until 12pm at best. Which means I would be driving through moutains at 1am (which I really don't want to do). My apartment tour is Tuesday morning. I also have to consider a scenario where my card doesn't arrive tomorrow. Everything considered, I'm thinking about rescheduling the apartment viewing again. I doubt they'll let me, let alone even consider me as a serious applicant after this. What should I do?

256,"More than five hours of sleep is a fish I catch every night, more often that not they turn out to be six or seven hour salmons and even eight hour trouts if I'm feeling extra lazy. Now most of you might think this is all gooid and well and I'm living an average human's dream, but you'd you'd be wrong.   


Mere hours after breakfast and not even half into the day I start feeling my eyelids putting on weight and my limps and joints dissolving to jelly. No, It's not just tiredness and sloth, I'm \*\*actually\*\* fucking sleepy, aI even tried it out once, when I just wanted to sleep during the day, I went to bed and woke up seven hours later, I'm not kidding lol. This is the crazy part though, an hour after I woke up, I went to bed again. And I slept for nice nine hours.

257,"It does not help me at all, but I'm not sure how to avoid doing this. How do you gauge anything - success, beauty, talent- in a way that doesn't compare yourself to others? It is a weird concept to me because I wouldn't know what a successful person looked like if I couldn't compare them to all of the other people in the world.

259,"I got sick in April of this year. It was a simple cold, so I held off on seeing a doctor for several weeks because I thought it would go away. When I realized it wasn’t going away, I called my doctor. My original PCP (Dr. A***** Z*****) said they wouldn’t take me even as a self-pay because my insurance plan was no longer covered by them. I then called the PCP that was on my insurance card, Dr. Z**** F. S****** whom I had seen a year earlier with similar symptoms. I was also informed they no longer accepted my insurance. I logged into my health insurance account on the Community Health Choice website and saw Dr. B** N***** was my new PCP. I called his office 5 times over the course of an entire day and only got a recording stating their office hours were from 9AM-5PM and to call back when they were open (all the calls I made occurred during their “office hours.”) I then called my Insurance company asking what I could do to see someone as I felt really sick. They said I could go to an Urgent Care. I really felt I need a PCP and not an urgent care doctor to get adequate treatment (plus they are far more expensive), so I asked if I had any other options. The lady said they had a thing called Teledoc and I could call them, send photos, and they were primary care physicians and would be able to help me. Within a couple hours, I got to talk to one on the phone, explained my condition, and he prescribed Augmentin. I did 10 days on it and 3 days after my last dose, my symptoms are back, but worse. I now have an irritating cough. I called Teledoc again on Saturday because I woke up that morning feeling like I was dying. He said I had bronchitis, but only prescribed me cough medicine, no antibiotics. I still feel awful, but I also feel extremely helpless. I pay $276.46 a month for my insurance, and I can’t even see a PCP in person when I need it. Not only that, my cold has now turned into bronchitis, and I still have no one treating it. If I didn’t have health insurance, my original PCP Dr. Z***** would’ve let me pay cash for my treatment and seen me three weeks ago. I called the insurance to change my PCP and will call first thing Monday AM to set up an appointment with them, (hopefully they answer), but I am considering canceling my health insurance. In 2014 I paid $129.23 a month and never had any trouble seeing a physician when I needed one. In 2017, I paid $223.57 and still had no difficulties seeing a doctor. I (29 years old) now pay $276.46, have a $6,000 personal deductible, and I haven’t been able to see a Primary Care Physician. I’ve always made sure to have health insurance, so I have peace of mind that I won’t be in debt for the rest of my life if I get in a car accident, or get cancer, but I am wondering if that’s the wrong way to do things. I’ve done some research, and in Texas, doctor offices and hospitals can’t go after your house if it’s homesteaded, or one personal vehicle per household. I also have a small company set up as an LLC and I will go to a lawyer to ensure it’s safe from debt, but from the research I’ve done, it’s also safe if it’s set up properly. They also can’t garnish wages in Texas, and the only thing in danger would be money sitting in a bank account (not really a concern for me). What I am wondering is has anyone else dropped their health insurance, and do you think it was a good decision? Or is there any advice anyone can offer in my situation? ",24Jun2018,1

She ended up reinvesting the money she's given upfront and planned to purchase the goods after she got somw profit from this money. Unfortunately things did not go as planned and she lost all the money. 

Now she owes soemone a very huge sum of money and came to my other sister and I for help. 

She is in huge trouble. Her customer hasn't taken any legal action or involved the authorities... yet. 

I'm personally struggling financially and living paycheck to paycheck. The only way I can help is by taking out a bank loan. Im very hesitant because it's going to be tedious paying it off and I will have gone back to zero. I will have to put off everything I have been working towards including going back to school.

263,"My cat has managed to act normally for the past few months while she had cancer and we didn't know about it, she had gotten worse and worse over the last few months of her life, and we kept taking her to the vet to see what was wrong, but the idiot didn't do anything about it, just saying her unhealthiness was just 'from an infection'

Today it got so bad that she had trouble breathing, and we ended up euthanizing her because she was so sick, and the cancer had spread all over her body and her lungs were failing. I had watched her die when we euthanized her, and I don't know what to do anymore. The last thing she did before she died was look up at me and my mom with a terrified look and then just slumped over. The vets charged us for having her 'put to sleep' They killed her right in front of us and then asked for money.

Dicks.

I can't get over the fact she's dead. 

We buried her in the backyard and she looked so peaceful lying in her box, but I was too busy crying to... I don't know, help dig the grave?

I need help getting over the loss, the stress is so high my limbs won't work and I have this awful headache. We just have these things of cat food and her water bowls lying around, and now it just seems like a cruel reminder of what was.

264,"My sister treats me like shit. She knows I’m such a nice person and all my weaknesses which she uses against me. She always gives me the silent treatment and makes everyone in my family think it’s their fault when no one did anything to her. It’s so frustrating and annoying; to be honest it makes me not like my sister at all. We’re growing apart. I always give in and try to talk to her, but she gives me attitude or one word answer and doesn’t even look at me. I can’t sit in a room with her, she gives out the worst vibes and I don’t need that in my life. She needs to get help. Today I was planning on going to the movies with her and she ended up making other plans without telling me. I saw her getting ready and asked her if she was going somewhere and she just said yes (in an attitude of course). So now I’m going to the movies by myself. I always invite her to come with me wherever I go. But she leaves (honestly sneaks out of) the house before I can see her. It’s weird and she does it all the time.

268,"My little sister is 17 and a senior in high school, her friends are a year and a grade above her. Last night she went to celebrate one of their birthdays at their house. She only thought it would be the four of them, but then one of the girls invited her older cousin, and then he invited a friend of his own, unbeknownst to any of them. There were also two older women, I think mid-twenties, who one of the girls knew.

They got drunk. Then they got really drunk. Then they started making out with each other. Then they started to strip.

It was my sister's first time being drunk so she didn't know what to expect. Things escalated really fast and she wasn't ready for it. At first it was just the girls making out with each other, but then the guys started trying to join in. They kept saying no. The guys then started touching the girls and trying to dry hump them. My sister says that they were very aggressive and very forceful.

As time went on, she eventually realized what was happening and did what she could do sober up because she knew that the other girls were too drunk to defend themselves. At one point, a guy started smacking her friend's ass she knew she needed to physically get in between them in order to protect her, so she laid herself on top of her because she was too drunk to do anything else.

But then the dude fucking DRAGGED the girl from underneath her and started VIOLENTLY FUCKING DRY HUMPING her. That was fucking terrifying for her, and when she tells me the story, she says that she's afraid she'll never be able to get that image out of her head.

Then that same girl went to the bathroom by herself. While she was in there, the dude fucking came in behind her and shut the light off. He was trying to rape her, and the only thing that she could do was hold onto the door for dear life and to keep saying ""no, no, no,"" and eventually he left.

Another girl started vomiting all over herself and the furniture. My sister had to clean up the vomit by herself because the older girls who were there did nothing, and her friends were too drunk to move. She was so scared of something happening that she slept sitting up so that she could move if she needed to.

So like, I'm fucking furious and I also feel hopeless. My sister's a hero, she does so much for everyone and to hear that she did so much to protect her friends last night makes me want to cry. I also kind of hate myself because I feel like I'm never there to protect her when stuff like this happens.

She came home about an hour ago, I've been checking on her to try and make sure she's okay, I'm about to make her some food. I also texted her friend to make sure she was okay. Right now we've told our mom and our grandmother, and she's thinking about telling a teacher who the girls are very close with. To be honest I don't think anything will come of telling our parents, we're not very close with them and they're also pretty old school. When I was on the phone with our grandmother, the first thing she said was that they ""put themselves in that situation"". I love her and I know she means well, but honestly fuck off with that kind of mentality, we don't need that right now.

I just feel like I need to do more. Part of me wants to try to get the police involved and track down the assholes who did this, but I know that the girls wouldn't agree to that and I know that it would cause a lot of emotional strain. I just want to make sure that they never come into contact with them again. They're supposed to be having another party tonight and I don't want them to hang out with any of the people they were there with last night. My god, the girl's older cousin said that he would protect her because he respects her, but then he fucking does this? I'm so pissed. I hate the world.

Just tell me what to do.",24Jun2018,3
269,"Back in 2014, my two best friends, my brothers who I would live or die for, decided that they didn't want me in their lives. The older of the two, who is about 4 years older than me, had gotten married in 2007 and spent 7 years making plans with me, but then cancelling at the last minute or showing 7p very late and leaving very early. In the winter of 2013, I outright told him that I had no hope for the future and he only replied with ""I thought that might be true."" I still don't know what his response means...

In 2014, he called to apologize and ask me to give him a second chance, but his tone for very forced and after 20+ years of friendship, good or bad, I knew he wasn't being sincere. I summoned every ounce of strength I could, fighting through the tears, and told him ""no."" I thought it was the right thing to do, but I've questioned the decision ever since. I told my other friend that I really needed to talk about what had happened, but he told me that he didn't want to talk about it. Later that year, I told him that I was losing sleep over it and needed a friend to be there for me, but he said, ""I can't be that for you amymore."" I had been friends with him for 32 years. I am 33...

Ever since then, it has been hard to trust people. Last year, I started playing an online game and, earlier this year, met someone who seemed like she could be an amazing friend. It had been almost 4 years since I lost my first friend and I had been closed off to the world during that time. When I met this person, I felt, for the first time in years, like I could once again get close to someone. We talked every day for 4 months and became increasingly close every day. We called each other best friends and spent a ton of time together each day. It was great for the first 4 months or so, but recently things have changed.

The last couple of weeks, she has been super distant, emotionally. When we talk, she only writes one-word or very short responses. Some days, she only responds with emojis. Not long ago, I brought it up to her and asked what was going on. She said that she knew she was distant and had felt herself distancing herself. She told me that she still enjoys reading what I write to her, but that she can't always think of what to say back. She apologized and promised to do better, but she still felt far away.

I feel hurt over the way she has been recently and I am worried that I am losing her. I know it might feel like that thought goes from zero to sixty, so to speak, but after losing my other friends, I can't help but think it. Part of me wants to say something to her again, but another part of me just wants to let her go. I'm not trying to be melodramatic, but I am so afraid of being hurt again. I feel like I might not have been ready to let people in yet and I kind of feel like it was a mistake to try to be her friend.

I am not sure how to move forward or what to do next. I am trying to be patient, but I feel like the pressure is getting worse, the longer I wait. I am hoping that someone here has been through something similar and can help to give me some guidance. Or even, maybe, a little hope.

270,"I work in the glorious security industry. I work nights, 8 or 12 hour shifts. During shift you spend 2 hours outside where you must do at least 3 patrols of the premises, 2 hours watching CCTV swapping with 1 other guard.

3 days a week I work with a guard who has been here for 17 years, he is mid 60s and is very set in his ways. He would never admit it, but he loves to gossip about other employees who he disagree's with. He is slow to accept change and is very critical of any need for said changes when they do happen, part of this is because he's been here soo long he doesn't accept other people seeming to know better than him. The kind of fellow who doesn't accept supervisors because he knows more than them, but doesn't want the responsibility of being a supervisor himself either. Generally speaking we get along fine, most of the gossip is harmless.

Although frowned upon by management, it's common practice for guards to chat for 5 minutes or so during swap overs. Here is the problem, when I come to swap with him he doesn't get up off the char.. He just sits in the chair talking for 15 minutes gossiping, then he will get up and keep talking for a further 10-15 minutes. I don't mind a good chat here and there, but to be honest i'd rather listen to my audio book than the stories he has told me again and again. I've tried giving minimal replies so the conversation dries up, but he's quite a machine and does the talking for both of us.

I used to think this was just the way he was, but I've come to realise he does it partly because if he spends 25-30m talking, in the time left he can comfortable do his patrols, have a smoke and it all goes very quick for him. This is not an assumption, he mentioned it. So it's just a time killer for him, but it's killing me!

So, I could talk to him easily enough. I know he won't take it well though, he will take it very personally and he will likely gossip about me to other guards because of it, then become overly critical about how I do my job. This workplace is the kind of somewhat toxic environment that if all the guards turn on you, you will likely be moved to another site and I don't want that. I could take it to my supervisor, but he is... a story for another time perhaps.. it's not really an option leave it at that.

So, shall I just suck it up and enjoy my relatively cushy job while it last?

271,"LONG STORY. brace yourselves lol.

So there was this girl that i started talking to at work 3 months ago. I enjoyed talking to her every second and she seemed interested in whatever I was saying. She laughed at the jokes I would say and I just made her laugh easily in general. She would casually touch my hand or shoulder and wouldn’t pull away whenever I would touch her hand. I stayed falling for this girl, I liked her a lot. Eventually I got her number and her Snapchat and just started texting her a lot. I enjoyed her company at work all the time and we just clicked. Then we went out 2 times. First, we went to the park and eat. Second to the movies. Everything seemed fine and I thought I was going somewhere with this girl. Until the following days that I worked with her, she would act distant at times. She would talk to me at times and then she wouldn’t. My jokes didn’t make laugh as easily as before. We still hugged every time we left home but she was still confusing me if she still liked me. I’ve told her plenty of romantic things over time and thought maybe she still likes me if she doesn’t mind being told this. She would always put on her Snapchat story that she is sad or having guy or love issues and thought maybe it was me, she told me it wasn’t. I was even more confused. I just finally told her that why does she even bother with being sad not being able to find love when she could be with me. She rejected me :(. She said she didn’t feel that way and said sorry if she ever made feel this way. After this I haven’t texted her in 2 weeks, and I haven’t worked with her anymore since I got a new job. I’m still processing this rejection. It hurts big time, but I don’t know if she’s testing me on the rejection. I’ve seen her a couple of times whenever I picked up my last few checks, and she still says hi. Funny enough it seems as if I never said that to her since there is no awkward tension between us..... so basically I’m a nut shell, should I still try to pursue her (if it was a test) or should I just move on and she if she comes back around (not 70/30 probably) I appreciate anymore reading all this.

277,"Hi guys,
So basically tomorrow I got my first interview ever for a job and I'll also stay at the company for a 2-week trial and if things go well I'll get this job.  
To provide some background info, I am 19-years old and didn't even finish high school or have any previous experience. I was involved in a lot of trouble as a teen and spent like 2 years and a half in a juvenile detention center so therefore I'm not looked at as the best person ever. I do however seek a change and want to get something great out of my life.  
The job is for a ""Social Media Coordinator"" position and I've only been selected for this because I have a blog and my ""future boss - I hope"" seen it in my CV and said I can write really well and also because I've been able to put myself in a good light over the phone conversation that we had.  
Howere, I also got kind of a huge problem with my social skills and got anxiety and I really don't find myself comfortable. I'm literally 15-hours away from the interview (also it won't even be in my city, I'm traveling for 2 weeks to a bigger city just for this) and I'm already shaking. I don't really know what to do or how to act once I get there.  
So...fellow experienced Redditors, any tips on this? And specifically, if I get asked about my criminal background (didn't bring it into discussion yet), how should I react? Also, any other tips related to this would really help.

It was a breakup. The girl I dated we were only together for a month, but it felt like an eternity. We had so much in common, and then two days after we had sex for the first time we ended it. I have a lot of anxiety / social depression issues, and her rationale for dumping me was ""you are like a parent to me. You watch over me too much."" This was not my intention, but maybe I did do it? I deleted all of our text threads and such because they were too painful to look at, so I have nothing to go off of.

She's just been talking shit about me for so long now (we ended it about 2 months ago) and I don't know how to go about it. School hasn't started yet (we broke it off right after summer started) so I hate to think of the rumors that will swirl about me when I enter my senior year (HS). 

I don't have many friends, but the ones I do were being guys, and were like ""did you fuck her?"" I said yes, because that is what happened, but I got a text from her this morning that said ""Stop telling people we had sex, I'm gonna deny it"".

280,"so it is my first time posting anything on reddit and the only thing i thought i really needed to get out or maybe read some similar advice was about my ex.. so i started going out with him when i was like 14 but he was officially mu bf till i was 15, we experienced so many beautiful time together and we went through alot of good and bad. somehow i always knew that i only wanted to be with him but time was against us and last year he told me he was going to live somewhere else( i live in Mexico and he was moving to Canada) it was really hard for me to understand how he wanted to go so bad when well i was here and we were supposed you know be us forever but then i had to thing outside myself and i knew it was the best for him so even if i didn’t wanted to i accept it and we broke up. for a while we felt some kind of weird not good feeling about each other. i was mad at him but i never stopped loving him. a semester passed and i was better, i was not mad at him anymore i knew i had to carry on with my life and i hoped he would to. then another guy tried like to hit on me and it was good it felt good cause they were totally different personalities and everyone was telling me to go for it that it would be better for me but somehow i always ended up comparing him with my ex like for example we talked about things but i knew deep inside me i didnt want his answer or his advice i wanted my ex’s so i decided to break it off, we are still great friends tho he was able to understand i was not ready. then like maybe march my ex texted me started talking felt amazing then i got a little bit drunk and sent him a message telling him that i couldnt go on that i missed him and that i still felt something for him. he agreed with me(by that time i was living in Italy and he was still in canada although when summer began i would be back to mexico and well him too) we saw each other after a year and i felt the relief of my life, felt safe, pure and home once again we went out a few days more before we talked about us and what was going to happen. we decided that it was better if we didnt get back together bc he was going back to canada and am staying here so we are just enjoying our time before he goes again buuut now that you know a little bit of the background i need advice on this. i feel like i am falling harder than before cause we changed and matured and it feels better than before it feels so right to be with him but i am scared cause if i do show him all the love i have for him when he leaves i might break harder than before and i dont want to try long distance cause i dont want him to hold back for me or the other way around we are to young for that( i am 17 he is 18) but i have this feeling like he is my forever and at least i want him to be. but am scared that this time will really be our last cause we are about to go to college and you know life is about to change real hard and i dont want cause it might be our definite goodbye so what should i doo talk with him?? or accept it cause am to young? how do i know he is the onee if i have a world to discover idkk please i need some advice on thiss

281,"A couple of days ago I got an invitation to my high school class’s 10 year reunion, which got me super excited as I would get to see people I haven’t seen in 10 years, obviously. I went to an international school in a different country, so my friends are spread out all over the world currently which makes it really hard to see them, this would be such a good chance.

The day after I got this invitation, I was having lunch with an old friend from middle school (I went to middle school in the country I currently live in) and she mentioned that her wedding is going to be on the same date as the reunion (she has no relation to my high school so doesn’t know about the reunion). So I haven’t been formally invited to the wedding but I did go to her engagement party last year and the way she told me to ”save the date” sounded like I would be invited. I don’t really see her anymore, maybe once a year, and I don’t really know her fiancé or other friends but we were best friends in middle school.

Now I’m really conflicted about which event to attend! I wish I could somehow do both but since they are in different countries that definitely won’t be possible. Help me, Reddit?!",24Jun2018,2
283,"So my college help me get a summer internship this year and I was super excited because I love the stuff I do (field technician for telecommunications) but so far it’s been one of the sorest experiences in my life... the guy I work with is a huge asshole to me and I can’t stand him

Basically I was supposed to work with another intern this year but he got fired because he failed the drug test ): this really sucks for me because I learn 10X better when I have someone learning with me and forcing me to keep up with them

So now I pretty much work all day with this 1 coworker doing installs and I hate him with a burning passion, he constantly insults me and degrades me by calling me a “fucking retard” “window licker” “paint chip eater” and just stuff like that, now I can take a LOT of shit before I get upset... but this coworker reminds me a lot of my dad... he insults me the same way he’s the same age and he makes me feel super insecure about everything I do

I understand that I’m a slow and I have to work a lot harder to understand something, but he makes everything tougher because sometimes I have to ask him what my next step is and he blows up on me, or sometimes HE will misplace and tool and get pissed and blame me (I never argue with him) 

I also don’t want to go to my supervisor about it because he’s a jerk and will only make it worse by telling him or making fun of me, also don’t want to risk my supervisor forcing me to work with him because I don’t like him as a person because he constantly tells me about how he’s fucking like 5 different girls and doesn’t tell any of them about each other even tho 3 of them are trying to pursue a relationship with him (makes me sick just thinking about it) 

So I’m in a very difficult spot, because I can’t quit or else I’ll be “forced” to leave my college and I can’t really go to my supervisor about it either, all this has been really stressing me out as well, and any advise on what you think I should do would be much appreciated 

also sorry for all the details that aren’t needed I just have been very stressed out and all this has been building up and I feel like this would be a good place to rant a bit as well",24Jun2018,1

287,"TL;DR: My bf of 4 years and I broke up months ago, but I was still so much into him. Few weeks ago I met another guy in Tinder. Now my ex wants to win me back and I don't know if I should try with the new guy or go back with my ex.   
 

Long version:   
 I \[F/26\] have been dating this guy \[M/28\] for 4 years, and living together for almost 3. Everything was perfect at the beginning but around 1,5 years ago our relationship started to get damaged (not his fault, not my fault, it was more like different life expectances). The situation got way worse and at the end he said I should move away (the flat we were living is his propierty). I was so devastated, it really broke me to the point of crying day and night and I even begged that I could change and everything would go better. But anyway, at the end I found a shared flat with a female friend and I moved away last February.   
 

When I left my (ex)bf's flat I still was sure we could fix our thing so we were still in contact and we met some times. He was still cold and not very receptive. I was so blindly in love that I still tried.  
 

My new flatmate \[F/25\] convinced me one night that we got drunk to make a Tinder account. That happened around 1 month ago. I've been always against meeting people through dating apps but that particular day I was so drunk and so hurted because I had another ""ex-bf crisis"", that I accepted and made an account.   
 

Anyway, along the random matches I got there was this particular guy \[M/27\]. I kinda felt an automatic connection with him, we've been in some dates and just everything goes so smoothly, just the opposite as it happened with my ex.   
 

Things would have been so easy but also around 5 weeks ago or so my ex kinda realized that I was the love of his life (or something like that) and now he's the one sending me messages, asking to meet and being super-sweet. I still have so strong feelings towards him, but also I remember how bad were our times together in the past. 

When I was meeting this ""new guy"" in Tinder I wanted to be open and honest. I didn't go into details of the situation with my ex but I kinda told him that in my current life stage I'm not yet prepared to have another relationship, and even though I really like him, I wouldn't mind if he has the chance of meeting other women who have more clear ideas. 

Well that was the theory. I thought I wouldn't really mind if he gets to know others but yesterday I just bumped into him and he was with another Tinder date. We both saw each other and we didn't say anything (I was with a group of friends), but later at night we had a phone call and he explained that yes, indeed that was a date (their first) but he still is interested on me and would like to have a chance. 

I've been madly jealous, but of course I was the one encouraging him to meet others. And also at same time I'm still talking with my ex. 

Now I don't know what to do. Of course I'm not yet in love with this Tinder guy but I have a very strong interest on him. I have love for my ex but I also have so bad feelings because the things in the past that I don't know what to do...",24Jun2018,1

290,"I have a few very close friends, but only one that has been my best friend since we were 5 (Now we are in our 20s). She lives on the same street as my family, so we have grown up together and we've been through a lot. To the point where we pretty much consider one another family. She is super trustworthy and considerate. But she is also very entitled since she was spoiled a bit as a kid.  When I was younger, I could deal with this and just let her take charge. But as I get older and more confident, I've realized that I don't want to waste any time around negative or controlling people. I have cut out a few people in my life for that reason, but never her because we have such a strong connection. I have grown confident enough to stick up for myself and my point of view to her, but I also find myself sometimes having to walk on eggshells and be super careful to say the right things around her in order to avoid conflict when I'm not in the mood to argue. I don't see that as being fair to me and it's draining sometimes. 

Our time together is not constantly bad, so the good times are making me want to stay connected with her. And I know that the closer you get in a relationship, the more you clash. But where is the line between normal and too much? I am planning on moving out of my parent's house within the next year, which can create a little bit more space between us. Should I start to distance myself? Or am I being immature since all close friends fight? ",24Jun2018,2
291,"I gained 10 pounds this semester at college due to stress, binge eating, and sleep deprivation. I used to weigh 122 pounds and now I’m at 132 pounds. The reason why I gained weight is I would starve myself during the day by not eating enough and binge eat at night because I would become extremely hungry. I’m trying to lose the weight and get back to 122 pounds. I chsanged my diet so that I am not starving myself during the day. For breakfast I eat Greek yogurt, for lunch I eat a salad with ranch and an appele (sometimes I skip lunch if I get up later), and for dinner I have a chicken salad with ranch or chicken with barbecue sauce with chicken broth vegetable soup. I still get hungry at around midnight and I’ll have salmon with tartar sauce with chicken broth vegetable soup. When I was 122 pounds, I ate exactly the same except I did not have soup. Without the addition of soup, I would get hungry hours later and want to eat again. Then around 10 o’ clock at night I would yfeel extremely hungry, but luckily this stopped. I’ve been also riding my exercise bike at least 15 minutes a day for about a month. Sometimes I’ll ride it for 30 minutes also. I don’t understand why despite exercising and dieting for a month I haven’t lost a pound. It’s really frustrating.",24Jun2018,0
292,"I'm 22 and I've been feeling really bummed out about my social life. There's a number of reasons that have led to me feeling this way. I apologize if this gets lengthy, but I feel its needed to explain my situation. 

The first coming from the decision my parents made to homeschool me till the 6th grade, the only friend I had during that time was a neighbor kid who lived down the street, but he ended up moving half way across the state after a few years. When I got to 6th grade, my parents sent me to a private religious school (their choice), which had about 400 kids total in all of the middle school and high school combined. Due to the size of the school and religious expectations of the students, there wasn’t many different social groups and it was either you fit in with the few groups that existed or you didn’t, which I didn't. I ended up spending a lot of my time secluded in my room learning how to program which eventually led to a business I started when I was 15.

The second reason being, I decided not to goto college because I wanted to focus my time on the online business I had started because it was showing a lot of promise. However because of that choice, I only found myself more socially secluded than I was before, the only people I interacted with were online - outside of the rare hang out with a friend from high school. The business actually took off for a few years and I did fairly well for myself, but it eventually came to an end and I decided it was time for me to get out of my parents basement and go do something with my life that involved interacting with other people. I ended up moving to the big city, where I knew absolutely no one, but I landed a job at a now rapidly growing tech startup. All seems great, right? It isn't. I don't interact with many people outside of work, and I find myself extremely alone. I thought putting myself out of my comfort zone would help me, but I don't have the social skills I should have acquired growing up that are needed to meet new people.

The last reason, I've been diagnosed with depression by my therapist and psychiatrist. I attempted suicide by overdosing on tylenol the day before my 21st birthday, it was then I sought professional help. There were a few other events that led up to that, but it's not worth getting into. I just feel so alone in this world, and it just doesn't seem like things are going to get better like I've always told myself. I honestly just feel like a cog in the machine at my job, and the energy I put into it is all I'm worth. I don't know what I should do with my life at this point that'll help me socially, I just feel like I've missed the boat on so many life experiences. I've channeled all my time into being a workaholic in order to distract myself from the reality that I am socially inept. I honestly feel like I'll die alone, or do something harmful if I don't get my life in order now.

What would you do in my situation? I'm financially comfortable to take a couple years off of work, but I'm not sure what I could do to better help myself socially. If I'm not working, I won't be getting any social interaction/attention outside the little I already have.",24Jun2018,1

Most recently there was an incident where one member of our team could have been seriously injured because of the head chef's budget cutting and arrogance, and we were all treated like we were incompetent for it having happened. 

We have all had individual issues with the company and that was the group last straw.

300,"Hey everyone! I'll try to keep this short. Also, secondary account because privacy.

I've been working at my current job for about a year. I started at $10/hr as a part-time weekend receptionist. I worked my way up through the company \*very\* quickly. It was maybe 3 months before I was given more hours and started working part time for their marketing department. They didn't raise my pay then, but I was just happy with the increased hours. 

Maybe a month after that, my boss mentioned needing someone to make some graphics for the company's website and social media pages. I mentioned that I'm good at photoshop and I offered. He told me to impress him and that I did. He then started giving me several photoshop project a day for him to post to our company's social media pages. \*\*At this time, he also kept insisting that I don't tell anybody about the work that I'm doing for him.\*\* I thought this was really weird, but I was excited that I was getting the opportunity to impress my boss so I didn't press it.

Maybe a week into that, my boss sat me down and offered to put me on full-time. I jumped at this opportunity. I said yes, yes, yes! He then said that he had an idea for a while to start up a minor social media department within the company and he wanted to know if I'd be interested in managing it. He told me it was a promotion, to the position of Social Media Manager. This happened on my birthday, of all days, and was some of the most exciting news I've received this year. Still no pay raise, but again, I was just excited about all of this. I told my friends and family and they took me out to dinner to celebrate among other things.

Well. . . a couple of days later, my boss fired some people in the marketing department, and he insisted on me dropping my graphics projects for now and focusing on doing my previous job in the marketing department. He even asked me to work overtime. He wanted me to work 13 hours on some days. I told him this wasn't possible as I have to take care of my toddler niece on weekdays, as no one else can take her. 

The night before he wanted me to work a 13 hour shift, he texted me, saying that it's imperative I come in the next day. I told him I wasn't able to, as I had my niece and I couldn't just leave her alone. He responded, ""I gave you the time I need you in tomorrow. Overnight is plenty of time to make accommodations. I expect you to be here on time tomorrow."" I stood my ground and apologized for arguing but insisted that there was nothing I could do and I had already explained my situation to him. The next day, I came in on my regular schedule. He gave me a threatening, ""I will be pulling you aside today to discuss your behavior last night."" but he didn't speak to me the rest of the day, and everything has gone normally since. I knew this is how it would play out, as I am incredibly valuable to the company and I don't think they could fire me if they wanted to. This was maybe 2 weeks ago.

So, my promotion never came, I've been made to do extra work outside my job description, I'm being treated poorly, and I'm not getting paid nearly as much as the others in my department. I go above and beyond and I'm arguably better at my job than anyone else in my department, but I've stopped being praise for it and instead it has just came to be expected of me. These are the reason I've decided to search for other jobs.

Well, I got 2 pretty incredible job offers this week and I'm going to put in my 2 weeks as soon as possible. My questions are, \*\*should I first try to demand a pay raise or that promotion with the threat of me leaving? Or should I just put in my 2 weeks and move on? Should I include any of my qualms in the 2 weeks notice?\*\* 

Thank you all so much in advance for your help! :)

TLDR I am incredibly good at my job and valuable to the company. I was given a really exciting promotion but it was retracted after my boss fired some people in my department and needed me to stay in that department. Despite all of the extra work I do, I'm not even being paid as much as my coworkers and to top it off, my boss has begun \*expecting\* me to go above and beyond and is a bully when I don't.

302,"This may be a little long so I apologize, but I just need to get this off my chest. 

So my(22M) fiancee(23F) and I have been dating for 3 years now and just got engaged this last November. Things for the most part have been fine aside from having heated arguments every two months or so
 (nothing serious, money stuff, wedding stuff, at most raised voices)
 
But here in the last month or two I've found myself having feelings for her sister (19F). 

We'll call Fiancee R and her sister N.

I haven't really paid it any mind and to be honest have ignored it for obvious reasons. About a week to two weeks ago though I was kind of day dreaming and fantasizing about N and I running away together. That's when it occurred to me that ""wow, I actually have developed incredibly strong feelings for her.""

Now N is all I can think about. Not so much in a sexual way, but I can't help but think about ""us"" in little moments and it has been absolutely havoc on my mental health.

I would never act on these feelings, as I would never want to hurt my fiancee, but I feel guilty for the way I feel.

I acknowledge that even if R and I were to separate; it would never work out. 1. N would never betray her sister like that. (Which, for the record I whole heartedly would hope to be the case.)

2. I'm fairly certain N only tolerates me.
When we first met I was fairly far right politically, and she is far left. I'm now more left leaning now that I'm out of my family's home (story for another time) but I feel as though she still holds that against me.

And 3. I would feel absolute guilt for what I'd have done.

I talked to my best friend about my having these thoughts and feelings and he says that it is a troubling sign and that I should reconsider the wedding. (Although he and a handful of our friends feel that our getting married is a bad idea)

My concern is how do i get rid of these feelings for her sister? Its too late to just break up with R as we've already gotten engaged and have spent so much money on our wedding. (Legit, first week of our engament she went and bought a fucking dress.) I am seeing a therapist already and I plan on talking to him about it, but thats not till later in the week.

304,"**In Short:**

So, lets get to the problem, I said ""(similar to this) I used to like you"" to this one friend/classmate I've know for a year. We pretty much stopped talking like friends even though we're in this same program and see each other often during class. After that, she stopped frequenting with the other people and says she has to go (she doesn't that soon).

**Extended:**

Well, it began in the spring of 2017 when we had this one class. We worked near each other, I didn't know she was in my program., and I thought she was cute.  Got to know her better and found out somethings (like the program) and teased her a bit (playfully). We were pretty good friends by the end of the semester, exchanged numbers during so. Although, we never text. Now I look at it, she was kind of, liked being alone, and almost never came to meet other people in the program.

In the fall semester, I've got to see her a couple of times and say hi, nothing else. Then spring of 2018 went similarly too. She meet some of the other program people.

Then we had two classes for this last semester and we sat together/very near to. We pretty much re-met, things about us changed a lot. We worked and walked through the day often. She finally came to meet the other people in the program almost everyday and made good friends. We were pretty comfortable together (not like that, will explain myself later). I've actually pick something out of her words and asked about *it* (let it be a thing most people don't know and I don't thing saying it would be right, so just ""*It*"" for now), she said it was just a random thought. We also talked about our dreams for the future and really deeply take about our ambitions. I thought it was cute of how enthusiastic she was.

She also had to drop one of the classes to go visit a university out of state and it was going to take place the last week of school.

Then, one day out of nowhere, we were alone oddly in a loud place. Then she looks pretty anxious, asked me something like ""Do you wanna here something crazy?"" Well, partially of ""*It*"" was is true.  I said *it's* okay.  Then the conversation goes a bit like a headless chicken. We really talk and she says she is also moving in the middle of the year, presumably regular school year. She also says she has this crush (we've made this joke with the soda once), I shrug it off; but then actually points out the guy (said he look interesting) and asked for advice, didn't have any. She ask mine next, I didn't say. Then she asked if my crush was in the room (felt like I should hint), I said yeah. She also talked about how this boy said he liked her, she kinda gave this odd response: (similar) Whats the point of love or dating someone if she was going to leave. Then the big weight of the conversation hits me like a truck and it seems like I the first to actually know what she said. So yeah, I was asked to never tell. But, I've felt unfair due to me not giving equal or more information of myself.

So the next day, we talked and we went to go our separate ways to do homework. But me being a dumb ass had an impulse to say what I thought, said (similar to) ""I feel unfair, so I'll tell you my crush. Just not now."" She continues to  guess who, I decide to tell her when we leave each other be.  So then I say (similar) ""Well, I used to like you"" with out looking at her long, emphasize (I don't think she picked that up), and walk off.  Behind me, she ask why. I didn't respond or I didn't answer (idk). Later, I emailed (this chat thing) asking to not think any less of me. Next day, she said it was fine and smiled.

So, then she kinda didn't look to want to talk to me at all, like she was avoiding. We had some tours and activities with the program, and she just didn't look to like she wanted converse. I mean, in a group, she was still friendly. So I stopped trying to talk. But she was also doing this with the other people in the program and classmates to a lesser degree. So, Thursday was the last day for her this semester. She just departed alone like usual and gave this less enthusiastic good-bye to our friends and I.

I also did this other thing. I didn't some research on to *""it""* and wrote notes down on to it to see what psychology says about it. So the second last day, I gave it to her. She was still friendly about it ( although I was bit reckless to give it to her, forgetting that she only told me).

So here we are today:

I do think we will see her this fall. 

So here comes of what I thought of her:

*What do you mean you like her? (crush related)*

To the question, I would say yes. Well, at first I say she is her as smart, outgoing, and cute. Then it was a small crush I guess. Now, I think the same, but now extremely ambitious. Like I really hope she succeeds. (*\*talks to self\* what a lame way of explaining yourself)* Just ask if you want more.

So, I've haven't really said what she might be thinking over things. She may have only talked to me of being a classmate; although, we stuck together even when there were other chances. She may have told those thing because: 1. she thinks I am understanding, 2. she just ditched the info on to me, 3. unsure of other. Then why she avoids me could be due to; 1. unattraction, 2. unconfident, 3. uncomfortablity, 4. sees no point to try, and 5. unsure. Then people and others: 1. she could be socially anxious or 2. that she doesn't she a point to try (one my friends say that she could be faking it /s, but that doesn't seem like it.

What I asking, etc.:

Uh......

1. I am really unsure of how to face ( lack of better words) her. I know I want to be her friend this upcoming semester, I just don't how or that I should. Pretty sure she'll have a hard time (she acts likes it nothing, but I know that must not be true). 
2. I guess you could give me criticisms, etc. of what I did. Please nothing brutal. ( Just so you know, I'm no r/niceguys) 
3. Also, if you ('ll) need more info or clarification, just ask.
4. Typos?

Well, please respond.

306,"The title is pretty self-explanatory- every time I think about my ex a little deeper than just in passing, I get a lot of anxiety. My heart starts to race, my hands shake, and it takes me like an hour to calm myself down. He was not a good partner. He did not hit me but he did a lot of other things that really damaged me. Thankfully I have absolutely no contact with him or any of his friends/family. However, when I do happen to think about some bad things that happened in the relationship, or read/see/hear something that reminds me of them, I can’t stop myself from panicking.

307,"She goes to the same school as me and goes the same school program as me, but she is in another class than me. We were bestfriends since kindergarden up until 5th or 6th grade or something but then we lost contact and never visited each other again.

We also went to the same lower secondary school, from 8th to 10th grade, but we just occasionally spoke together and never visited each other.

Now we have both just finished 11th grade at upper secondary school and are beginning our 12th grade this autumn. I don't know why but I just now really began to miss her. The only way we interact with each other these days is this snap streak we have together, but all she sends is just a picture of the roof in her room and two ""s""s painted in red. 

I was wondering if there was some way I could try to become friends with her again this summer break. We are both travelling to Thailand this month at the same time, but I wouldn't take the chance of randomly meeting her there. 

I was thinking of just taking my bicycle to the football field in our town and sending a snap of the field to a few people I know and just write    ""Does somebody want to join the football field?"" and then I would include her in the people I send the snap to and see if she would come.

311,"Hello Reddit. I’d like to tell you guys about my co-worker who I work with at my job. I live in New Delhi in a nice apartment and make good money as a engineer. I have a little bit of suspicion of one of my co-workers, Rajeet who is allegedly getting married to a 14 year old girl.

I heard some of his friends teasing him about it and I did some digging and I asked some of his friends and they told me that he’s gonna marry a 14 year old in 3 weeks. I immediately got butterflies in my stomach and after that I did some investigating and found his bride, Naima. I just found out that she’s one of my friend’s cousins and he told me that he’s not happy about what Rajeet is doing. He tried to file a police report last week but they refused him since it’s for their religion and they have no control over that. 

This is why I hate the justice system in India since it let’s Monsters marry little girls and eventually molest then and ruin their lives. I don’t know how to tackle this situation at this point since I don’t want Naima to get married at AGE 14. She can’t even consent to something like that and she’s in secondary school.

313,"I am 23 years old and have been smoking cannabis since I was 14 years old. I still live at home with my parents as a result of some stuff not going my way after high school, I attempted to join the military (disqualified for because I had/have asthma, though I haven't had an asthma attack since 2001). Then I attempted school, dropped out over a stupid reason. Then my dad got my a job at his work where I worked for about 2 years, attending school part time as well. 

I eventually quit the job so I could attend school full time and move out of my parents house by transferring to a state school. Don't get me wrong, I want to continue my education, but moving out is going to be a huge plus.

So last night, as I usually do, I climbed out of my window and smoked some cannabis outside, apparently my dad smelled it or something and the next day throws a fit about how he caught me smoking, only he already had ""caught"" me smoking on numerous other occasions over the years, only this time he was threatening to kick me out, sell my car which is under his name, that I paid the insurance for until I had to quit my job in order to attend school. I do work now again and am able to pay him, but he refuses to take the money for the car. 

My dad is very well off and makes a lot of money, while I know that isn't an excuse, he does pay for my car insurance, but I pay for everything else in my life, including college which i've spent about 6,000$ to attend (and now had to take out loans) in order to continue going, with no help from him, not that I asked for any. 

I have been doing great in school, all A's and 1 B, and I am set to be able to transfer to my dream school by the Fall of 2019, but not if I get kicked out for smoking cannabis. 

What do I do? Hes a brick wall and he just shuts down everything I say. I said I wouldn't smoke at the house anymore, offered to pay for my car insurance with the little money I have working part time, but he just says no for no apparent reason. Cannabis is also legal in the state I live in, so when he threatened to call the police on me smoking I couldn't help but smile a bit.

I don't know. I guess im trying to just get this out there so I can feel good about having asked someone, because I already figure that there is no solution to this problem. 

My dad grew up in a time where you were expected to move out with your girlfriend and get married at age 20, and here I am at age 23 without a college degree and without a girlfriend. But I am doing what I can, I have a job and I go to school and I try to leave the house as much as I can as to not bother him with my presence. I just really think my dad hates me or something, I have never been able to please him my entire life, and it causes stress, because for some reason I care and want to be able to please him, but what I enjoy is what he hates, and it's just really frustrating.

315,"I currently live in my parents empty home (they don't currently live here). They've let me know they'll be moving back to this home within a few weeks, and I am totally welcome to stay if I'd like. We have a good relationship.

So the question is, should I stay at home with my parents, or leave and rent an apartment?

I'm a 28 yr old male and make $80k per year. An apartment will cost around $1450 per month, which I can afford given my salary. Staying at home would allow me to save a ton of money, but at the same time I would be 'reverting' to living with my parents, and losing privacy and independence which I've grown to value.

One of my goals is to eventually find a partner and get married. My parents home is in a suburban area, and this would allow me to move closer to the city, thus an opportunity to meet more people my age.

There might be other aspects I'm not considering, but right now it's finances/saving a ton of money/spending time with parents vs. independence and lifestyle which would allow me to expand my social circle.

316,"Hello Everyone, 

It's my first post here so please let me know if I screw up. Basically, lately I've realized that most games for me just piss me off and I don't enjoy them. I think this stems from the lack of other things to do.  I don't believe that video games themselves are the problem, or that they are bad. I have had countless good times playing with friends. Yet, as I grow older am I am starting to question what I get from them much anymore. I see my friends with hundreds of hours in a game and instead of looking up to them, as they have obviously sunk more time than I have, I am starting to get this feeling in my gut that I'm wasting my life away.

I started going to the gym this week, so I have enjoyed that. I would also like to pick up reading again. Other than music though, which I have played in the past, I'm not sure what else to do. Part of the problem is that when I come home at night,  I stop feeling motivated to do things and I just end up playing games out of habit. Can anyone offer me some advice on how I can stop being a zombie, and actually take control of my free time? Thank you. ",24Jun2018,1

319,"So here's the situation. I am currently 18 years old and I will be leaving for college in August. I am a virgin, but i've been thinking about having sex recently, and the issue is, I just don't really know what to do.

I went on nexplanon a little over 2 weeks ago, so i'm on birth control &amp; I have been really thinking about if I want to go to college a virgin. I have a friend who i've been pretty close with since early this year. We went to prom together and we've just gotten really close over the past couple months. I feel incredibly comfortable with him, and recently i've been thinking about the prospect of losing my virginity to him. I know that he cares about me, as I know that he likes me and I like him as well, but the issue is that i'll be leaving in a little over a month, and our relationship is already slightly complicated. We both know that we like each other, but due to the circumstance of me leaving soon, and the fact that I don't want a boyfriend going into college, I just don't know if it would be the best idea.

On one hand, I can't really think of a better person for my first time to be with. He's not a virgin, so he has a little experience and would be able to guide me and he probably cares more about me and making me comfortable than any other guy i've met. We've kissed, but that's as far as we've ever gone. The complicating part, is i'm terrified that if I do have sex with him, i'll get attached and then leaving will be even harder. However, I also think that me leaving is slightly a positive in my mind, because even if I do get slightly attached, I won't have an excuse to stay and be in a relationship, as i'll have to leave for college, so i'll kind of have an ""out"" in a way. I also don't want to hurt him in this whole ordeal, but I feel as if I tell him exactly what will and won't come out of it and set very clear guidelines, it should be ok.

321,"Background:

I had a friends with benefits. But probably not anymore. We rarely talked. All of the times we met were just light conversation that ended in sex, some cuddling, and occasionally staying the night. I am not interested in a relationship with him, Just sex, cuddling and light conversation. 

Our ""friendship"" started with a hookup. I was not, and never expected a relationship. The sex was just awesome. 

Fast forward two two days ago and I texted seeing if he wanted to meet. The day before we hooked up, smoked some weed and I stayed the night. I asked if he wanted to meet again tomorrow and he said yes. I was just looking forward to more sex. 

Then the next day I texted again to see if he still wanted to meet. I offered to bring over some cigarettes and make a meal for him because he just had surgery. He said he just wanted to play games with friends. Fine with me. I don't give a fuck. I mentioned How I just had a bad day and was wanting to cuddle and talk about my bad day. Nothing that has not happened before. 

Two days and he has yet to respond. I texted saying I know our relationship is just physical and I am fine with that. It is just sex to me. No response. 

I was told on trueoffmychest that I am acting like a girlfriend. Am I? 

To me I was just trying to be a good friend by bringing cigarettes and make a meal. I get how it could be taken to be acting like a girlfriend, but I was just hoping that would get me over in order to have sex again. And I was trying to be nice. I brought vodka and ice cream over the night before. I have bought him cigarettes before. It is not like it was abnormal. 

So am I acting like a girlfriend? He has now ghosted me. That is what bothers me the most. If you don't fucking like me just say so. I won't be heartbroken. It was just sex. That can be got from a lot of guys. If he just said I find you annoying and want to stop being friends I would be just fine. It would not hurt me in the least. We were just pieces of meat to each other to fuck anyway. 

Any advice?

Just for background info I'm an economics student, I very much love my major and you can say that chose to study it out of my own free will (almost)

I decided that I should probably minor and I think my major on it's own is more than enough (i'm planning on taking quantitative electives and concentrations within my major if I decided to do a masters) so I decided to minor is things that interest me even if it has no academic benefit which in my case is

\-political science

\-digital media (basically a graphic design minor)

\-Psychology

I was considering doing business and CS but I think the business minor won't be beneficial to me since almost all the courses are ones I do within in my major and CS sort of intimidates me and I don't think i'll be able to graduate with honours also the passion is no longer there. 

I've been told that doing the graphic design minor isn't that useful since I could learn these things on my own via online courses however I want to be able to get advice and proper criticism. 

As for psychology this one sort of complements my major or at least something i'm interested in, behavioural economics. I know some very very basic background of it and it seems interesting at first glance.

Political science: I wanted to do a double major however it seems like the department isn't that good and the 

I sort of lost passion to a lot of things including my major i'm guessing because of my depression and i've become even more indecisive because I want to maintain a high GPA but also be able to do a masters

I'm planning on doing 2 minors (most likely pols and graphic design)

tl;dr: Should I minor in graphics design even though i'm an economics student because it's something I like and minor something else that might be relevant or should I drop the whole idea and minor in something more academics friendly",24Jun2018,1

The first one would be borrowing money from a good friend and his family with them understanding that I wouldn’t know when I could pay it off as I still need to pay for things like rent and basic living expenses. This would allow me to finish this coming semester and to then look for a job within my field. 

The second option would be to move to Nevada where I would take a job as a chemical engineer and earn somewhere in the range of 65-80k a year but making the commitment to finish school within a certain time frame at a university in the state. This would solve my funds problem but it opens the door of adding time to my schooling since the near by state school does not offer bioengineering has a bachelors degree. I would have to switch to one that they do offer. 


There are other factors like moving away from my girlfriend for 6 mos until she finishes school, moving farther away from family if I take the second option. The first well it’s hard for me to accept help from other especially monetary help.

Stacy doesn't have a job, shes never had one. We all moved in together on the promise that her husband zach would pay for the both of them. Zach can hardly afford to pay for 2 people though, hes constantly short on bills and rent , so me and Lance pay for their half a lot. We also pay for everything else, food, toiletries, and other needs. Stacy tends to take this for granted, she never says thank you and often runs through all of the supplies then tells us we need to buy more. It has irritated me but I continue to help them because they are my friends and if I dont, Stacy will get upset and Zach in turn gets upset and its just a mess. So far they easily owe us over a couple thousand. 
Stacy refuses to get a job because she claims she has depression. (I don't believe it, but I guess I don't know) so instead she smokes weed (which I buy for myself for my own depression) all day and lives off of us. She seems like a very happy person in general.
I don't care that she won't get a job so much, that's her own business. But I am annoyed that I help them so much because she doesn't work and I never get even a thank you, it's kind of expected from them.

Now, they realize they can't afford much. So to ""fix"" this, stacy wants her best friend to move in with us, so her best friend can pay her rent for her. The house is already very full, and the only spare bedroom is hardly a bedroom at all, so it would be very cramped. I don't know her best friend very well either and the whole thing would make me uncomfortable since I'm the beginning we agreed it would just be us 4. I don't even know how we would split rent if we tried that, since she would be getting a very small room.

So I don't see the point of bringing someone new in, it may be rude of me to say but it feels to me that she just wants to pass responsibility onto someone else to pay for her instead of getting a job. But every time I raise concerns, stacy gets mad at me for not being cooperative in helping her friend move in. Maybe I'm the jerk, but I don't know what to say or how to resolve this, or if I just let her win and have her friend move in even though I'm not comfortable with more people here.

I’m ready to pull my hair out because I don’t know what to do so any advice or really anything is all appreciated and welcomed. Currently I’m going through a break up with my best friend of five years and of all things it’s over a boy. So you have a little background of the whole situation, I want you all to know I’m pretty introverted and don’t make friends very easily and she’s the same exact way. We both have bad social anxiety and found solace with one another. Anyways, when I do make friends I’m really loyal to them. So, to put it lightly, I became quite invested in this friendship and we were inseparable. After being best friends for a year she moved 3,000 miles away but that didn’t deter our love and respect for one another. We talked on the phone for hours at least once a year and texted daily. We only got to see one another once a year for a week or two. So this year it was her turn to come out and visit me. She was goning to stay for two weeks at my house. So here lays the problem. A boy she’s had an on and off friendship with for four years came back into her life a month before she was flying out. This is boy has feeling for her and constantly try’s to get her to go out with him and to just give him a chance. She’s told me for years how incompatible they are and how she doesn’t like how negative he is. Not to mention he’s been really rude and mean to me in the past, that was actually one of the reasons she ended her friendship with him a few years back. Anyways, I was slightly annoyed that they started talking again because I knew it was probably not going to last and I was going to have to hear her be upset about it for the millionth time. So like he had for the entirety of their friendship, he asked her out on a date and she said yes. He lived close by to me so she was gonna go on a date with him while coming to visit me. She didn’t even tell me it was a date until a few days before she was coming. She told me for weeks he just wanted to hang out. It started out as she was goning to spend a whole day and night with him. I told her that if she did that I would be very upset and she talked with her mom and sister and they both said it was messed up and she shouldn’t do that. So the it became a couple of hours and now his sister and I were invited along to join them. I was fine with that and I didn’t press the issue. So she comes down and everything’s great but the next day I get sick so I decided I would meet them for dinner after the movie was over. I come back to pick her up and I tell her I’m there and she says she’s goning to go with them. So I was annoyed by that. Then my mom called and told me to pick my brother up because he got sick at his basketball practice. So I told her I’d pick up Chris and to just have them drop her off at my house when they’re done. Two hours later I get a call from her inviting my to bowl, which she know I hate, so of course I tell her no. I’m sad that’s she’s going to be gone so long but I’m happy for her because I know she really wanted to see him. So she gets back at 11:30 at night and tells me how amazing her night was and then she tells me they invited us to the beach. I get upset with her because it was only supposed to be this one time thing and she knows I don’t like either of them, like I said above him and his whole family have been very rude and mean to me. I also know I’ll get third wheeled by her if I go and I tell her that and she tells me that won’t happen. She sees I’ve very clearly distressed about it and says we don’t have to go. That should go been the end of it but for two days all she does is whine about how she wants to see him again. So my mistake was telling her we’d go, I wanted her to be happy so I decided me being uncomfortable for a few hours so she could be happy would be fine. So we go, and immediately she leaves to be with him and it’s like that the whole damn day we’re there. I mean they are literally all over one another and it’s pissing me off because she literally acted like I wasn’t even there. Towards the end of the day we get invited to go swimming at his house and she wants to go so I said okay. We picked everything up and she decided she was going to drive back with them rather than come with me which hurt my feelings. I arrive to there house and she walking outside with him. She tells me she’s going to walk around with him and come swimming later. Again, she knows how I feel about this family and she left me alone with them. I surprisingly had a good time. At 11:30 I was wiped and was ready to head back home. I told her I was leaving and asked if she was coming home with me. She couldn’t even look me in the eyes when she said she was going to stay. So that royal pissed me off and hurt me so badly. She knew what she was doing was going to hurt me and she knew it was wrong but did it anyways. She didn’t come back home until 9:00 at night the following day. We talked and I told her how hurt I was by her actions and then she said she had to leave and couldn’t be around me knowing she hurt me so much. So what does she do, she goes back to there house and says she’ll come back the next morning. I asked her to stay but she said she had to do this for herself. We had two good days before all hell broke lose again. My mom exploded on her for all the chaos she caused in our house that week. She told her she was a coward and selfish and how disappointed she was in how she had acted the whole week. So after that she was gonna fly home early but then called him and decided she would stay but was gonna stay with him. I cried and told her to stay and fight this together. And she looked me in the eye and said she wasn’t a good person and then gave me a hug and left. We texted and she said she’d come back in a couple of days if things got better but was going to go to Arizona with them. I asked her if we could meet one more time before she left on the 26 and she said maybe. I got so mad and I was so hurt. I pretty much deleted her from my life and unfollowed her on everything. I was so hurt I just couldn’t watch her out there with them. I miss her so much and I’ve been waiting for her to contact me but I don’t think she will especially because I unfollowed her on everything. Everyone says I shouldn’t try to work this out with her and that she doesn’t deserve my friendship. But I love her so much, she was my best friend, my sister and I don’t want this to be it. I’m so torn and I need help. Thank you(:",24Jun2018,0

333,"I used to be a goofy kind of guy. 

When I went to college I was undisciplined. Skipped class, blew through money, eventually the consequences caught up with me and I learned my lesson. 

I had to work two jobs and go to school to finish my degree. Once my degree was finished I took a very stressful long hours job for 2 years. I became obsessed with:

1) doing well in my current job to move forward
2) making/saving money, anyway possible

I've moved up to a much less stressful job (although the pay isn't much better).

However, I find myself incapable of switching off work/money-mode. People want to talk about the newest movie/game and I'm not interested because I feel like those are a waste of time/money (which they're not!). I had to sit down and think about why i'm not excited about anything but money. Money became my hobby.

I can see people's eyes glaze over when all I have to talk about are my investment plans/saving money/side gigs/new job application. That's when I realized I overcorrected from silly dgaf guy to boring crotchety frugal guy.

I don't really remember what I did for fun before I became so boring. I'm still scraping by but have extra time on my hands to hopefully get back the fun person I use to be.

I've tried watching comedies
I go to the park every morning
I'm (slowly) relearning guitar
Exercising 
but I feel like i'm just forcing myself to do this. I feel like i've turned into a complete tool.

Are there any other suggestions that might get me back to my goofy self or is this just part of growing up?",24Jun2018,1
334,"I am looking for some advice regarding a huge life decision that I have to make coming up very shortly.

I am going to try to make this as short as possible as it is a very long story. On September 18th of last year… I was engaged to be married on September 30th. I realized that I did not want to get married as I was starting to have panic attacks and was so anxious of everything moving forward. I did not want this for me. So two weeks before the wedding… I called it off and a week later I moved out. 

Shortly after this I found a friend that was going through a very rough time with her marriage. We shall call her “Jane”. Jane and I connected quickly through our common love for cycling and our present very difficult situations. Needless to say it turned into more than a friendship since Jane informed me her husband and she had an “open marriage”. In hindsight this was terrible of me to start something with her since they were already going through rough times and undoubtedly this would make things so much worse. We provided each other love and emotional support. I have never felt anything like I felt with her. The world faded away when I was with her and I loved her then and even now as I write this. 

Fast forward to present day… Jane and her husband are getting a divorce and I can’t help but feel responsible for this happening. I lose sleep on it every day. I see a therapist weekly and talk about everything that I have thought about doing. I cry almost on a daily basis and Jane has even mentioned that I was responsible for pushing her to do this. To make matters worse…. I was a top cyclist in the club I ride with a year ago and now I am broken. I hurt my back last September when I moved and the pain has built up to the point where just last week I found I have a herniated disc which is pushing on my sciatic nerve and causes intense pain in my leg that mostly forces me to walk with a limp. Needless to say I am a shadow of my former self on and off the bike. 

Now for the life changing decision…. I work for an international company and an opportunity has come up for me to work in Europe for 6 weeks with the intention that if all goes well…. I will be able to pack my stuff up here and live in Europe for an undetermined amount of time. I broached the subject with Jane and she has all but shut down. She is disappointed in me and saying that if I take this opportunity than I am only thinking about myself and not what’s best for “us.” My heart and brain are saying two different things. My heart says to stay here and support her through this and be by her side to come out the other side together. My brain says to take the opportunity in Europe as this is a once in a lifetime chance and will catapult my career with the company. I just don’t really know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Either decision seems so daunting and I just want to shut down and ball up in a corner and forget about everything.  For the sake of length some details have been left out so please ask if you want to know more.    ",24Jun2018,1
335,"I'm going to community college soon before I go to regular college which isn't far from here. I want to start dating, but here's the problem I have:

The town I live in is a white trash redneck town. Everyone in this town is so fat and unhealthy, it seems 1 in 20 people are a healthy weight, and even then, they have other health issues such as a lack of sunlight, diabetes, a diet high in sugar and sodium, etc. I have yet to meet someone that's well-educated.

I need to be around smart, well-educated people that care about their bodies, minds, and life, not mindless, aspiration-less hippos that think ""teachers are heroes"", ""Trump is the greatest president of all time"", and ""Big Macs are healthy"".

And before anyone says anything about my thinking that teachers aren't heroes, there's not really anything heroic about not teaching practical knowledge in a system that needs major change. Plus, claiming a person is objectively a hero is ridiculous. We're human. We can do good or bad things. We have a good and evil side to us.

I relate so terribly to everyone I've come across here. No one does what the rest of the US does. It's like a culture on a micro scale, largely oblivious to the macro scale, that thinks its on the macro scale.

I want to meet someone that has aspirations, that's intelligent, that's well-educated, that has common interests (not subjects but types of subjects), that understands me, and that wants to improve themselves. I want to be with someone that can challenge me, that's interested in learning, that provides an equal, or close to equal, exchange in energy, that shares some of the same values, that's intellectual, that doesn't shoot me down, that wants to do what's right, that I can connect with, that helps improve me, and that I feel emotion/energy from rather than what feels like I'm talking to a computer.

337,"Hey guys, this is my first throwaway account I have made because I don't want this on my main account because I find this situation a bit embarrassing. Well let's start now, there is this girl I used to like (let's call her A.) who I thought was pretty cute and I had liked her for a few months last year when she asked if I wanted to start a streak on snapchat, I stopped crushing on her because she was 2 years younger than me and I thought the difference was too big. (16M btw.) We stopped our streak after a few months and I kind of lost interest after that. Then back in March she started doing them again and she started talking to me, during that time I was trying to talk with another girl (Let's call her B.) and I wasn't really busy with girl A, I also remember that when I had a job for a day, Girl A came up to the counter but she was too shy to come talk to me. Recently I got rejected by Girl B after talking to her for 3 months. Girl A really started talking to me much and we snapchatted each other frequently. Until yesterday something sad happened, I found out that apparently Girl A has a boyfriend, I don't know for how long already but I presume a week or two. I asked her best friend who asked me for a streak too (Yeah it's getting a bit confusing.) for confirmation and she told me it was real, after that she told girl A what I had asked her and Girl A started sending me messages asking me why and if I liked her, I kind of avoided the question but later on in the conversation she told me that she used to like me and thought I was cute for a while until a week or two ago. I asked her why she didn't tell me anything and she said she thought she was too young for me because she thought I was a senior (I'm pretty tall for my age so I understand.) I think she still has feelings for me because she tries to set up a lot of convo's on Social Media and I have no idea what to do. People think I'm good with girls but reality is that I am pretty awkward with them because my last girlfriend was like 6 or 7 years ago and that wasn't even really serious. :P So guys do you know what I should do? Help and advice is really appreciated as this is the second romantic setback in a short period of time for me. :( ",24Jun2018,1

Hi throwaway for obvious reasons...
And NSFW

I'm an 18year old male living in UK. 
I was watching porm before, and even though I'm straight I prefer to watch Gay Porn. Well I prefer to watch people my age so I searched for Young twink, and only seeing people with stubble and tattoos I then search for young teen. 
I start watching a video of someone masturbing and noticed they sounded super young I read the username and it was something like ""14yearoldwank"" and I instantly closed the tab. 

I didn't mean to watch those 10 seconds of course, what am I best to do? As I already work with children and want to become a teacher any criminal activity could jeopardize that dramatically...

It was on Pornhub, should I report the video?

Thanks, I'm really worried right now",24Jun2018,0
339,"I'm a 21 year old male, and for the past few years there has been this girl that i have just felt special around. All tho the two of us hardly talk, but when she does she is always nice to me. I just have all these feeling trapped inside of me and i can't get the courage to get them out to her. I think she is away at college which is a thousand miles away from where i live. I get so lonely when shes not around. Even tho we don't do anything together or talk much, I enjoy seeing her smiling face when she is around, and i miss her when shes gone. 


I have thought about sending her a simple card to let her know I'm thinking of her. I wouldn't want to dump it all on her at one time, just something simple to possibly start a communication. I understand that sitting around waiting for her is most likely not going to work, But every time i think of being brave and doing something like that I just freeze and I am unable to do it. I just afraid of rejection, afraid of ruining any friendliness there might be. Her parents have always been nice to me as well and i know them well, and I am afraid of ruining that.

He's usually very nice to all the people around him and he's very patient. For him to snap like this, a problem must go on for at least a while. Which means I've been screwing up for some time.

342,"I am 15 years old, and am male. As of lately, it has felt miserable to tolerate my family. My younger sister is 11 years old, and is utterly toxic towards me, she also has severe ADHD. She breaks out into physical fights over extremely small things and accuses me of things I did not do, but with me only, an example being today she accused of taking a last piece of a specific food, and she kept trying to kick me over it. She, as a person, constantly depends on other people, and whenever I decline to help with anything, she calls me names, and again tries to hurt me. She also believes that whatever she picks out, she owns, the example being said piece of food, despite my mother saying it is for everyone. She also constantly wants me to do things I do not want to do in the given moment. All of this may seem sort of benign, but my parents do not handle this well. Both of my parents were in the U.S military, and my mother became physically disabled as a result, and it is seemingly severe, thought she can still move, it strains her on a day to day bases, she also really hates her job currently, so we get the worst of her. My father is still in the military, and is often on deployment. How this relates to my sister and I is my mother often attempts to deal my younger sister and I, but fails to do so. She often ends up screaming at the both of us, and says ""Why can't you just get along?"" I attempt, and I try so hard to get along with my younger sister, but she borders the line of verbally abusive, and then she starts to physically hurt me; I just break down... and act out, regretfully... I am also on the autism spectrum, so at school I do not have much close friends, and to add insult to injury, I love subjects not much people at school enjoy. At school I actually get along with people, and I am not bullied, but I find it difficult to get close to anyone, so often I am at home. I do sports at school, specifically Track and Cross Country. The same things I had mentioned about my family has been going on for about 2-3 years, and whenever I bring it up to my parents, they deny it, and get offended as they think I am questioning their parenting. At home I have emotional breakdowns at least once or twice a month, and this year at school I have had a breakdown 3 times this year.  I have asked my parents if I can go to a counselor, and they said I can, but they repetitively keep putting it off.

Well I moved to a city about 2 and a half hours away from where I used to live (Los Angeles). I left my mother and girlfriend (we’re still together) for Oceanside. I had to make this move because, well, I had been searching for an engineering job for a year and finally received one offer in Oceanside. The weather is beautiful and it’s close to the beach but I feel like it’s just not home,  I feel like something is amiss. The distance is having a huge effect on my relationship and now we’re on a “break”.

It’s weird because I just don’t feel like I belong here for some reason it’s been a month and a half now but I haven’t gotten used to it at all. At this rate I may want to move back to Los Angeles as soon as I have the necessary experience for jobs which will be at least three years..

347,"I recently found a job abroad and I am sending some of my salary back to my mom who is struggling financially. I know I am hurting the economy by being a lousy immigrant but that's beside the point. My mom works as a secretary for the government but because of a mortgage she took with my dad (now divorced) years back, she has to pay 50&amp;#37; of her already low salary to the bank. Because of this, she is barely scraping by and when I was unemployed, she had to take fast loans because her credit rating is garbage. This means that 60&amp;#37; of her salary goes towards loans. Apart from my money, she also relies on my grandma's pension, with whom she lives with. 

The problem is that she spends the majority of the money I send to her on cigarettes. Now, I don't mind her having some fun (she's my mama after all) but I hate that my support is going towards her addiction. It is slowly killing her and her financial situation is worse off because of it. Last week, I sent her enough money to get by for the month but a week later, she calls to tell me that they have almost run out. I made some calculations and it turned out that 50&amp;#37; of the money was spent on cigarettes. 

She is extremely smart but incredibly stubborn. I tell her that, if she doesn't want to quit, she should start rolling tobacco because she would save at least half of the money. Her response was ""No thank you, I'm just not good at making my own cigarettes"". I then propose to buy her a vape  but she said ""no, it's just not the same"". Me and my dad even suggested to her to come live with us but she also refused.

I just don't know what to do. She keeps making excuses that a pack of smokes isn't \*that\* expensive but in her situation, the math proves otherwise. Should I have my therapist contact her for a session? I want my mom to live a happy and stress-free life, not harm herself with her addiction. ",24Jun2018,2

351,"I have and always been an extreme pessimist and that way of life has led me down a very unhappy and lonely road. I've lived this life for so long that negativity has become a habbit. I have recently decided to give religion a chance as many religious people I've met have been radiantly happy and positive and I've noticed a lot of changes in my way of thinking, I find myself confiding in god more and more which is great. It's helped quite a bit, but it's not nearly enough.

Progress has been made, I know it, but the progress I make never feels good enough. I know I am still extremely negative and have many ugly traits that I want to be rid of, I kick them for a while but as time passes I find myself back in a pit of negativity, sometimes completely unaware of my own negativity until I sit down and reflect. Despite being so negative my greatest wish is to put good into the world before my time is up, but negative thoughts push that wish back further and further. 

Changing something about yourself is one thing, but changing your entire identity feels like a Herculean challenge the likes of which I've never had to face before. Constant failure in changing my ways has led me to frustration. The people around me are as negative as I am, so any attempt at positivity is met with negativity, which in return makes me negative.

Simply put I am unhappy. I'm unhappy with myself and unhappy with those around me. I'll be joining the military soon just to start a new life, to be my own man away from those that bring out the worst in me, but I don't want to go in blind.

So last week, I decided I was going to go out on a limb and write a note to a girl I work with and put it on her car. It was just a note saying my name (she knew my face and name) and that she should follow me on instagram (she did). Our messages back and forth have been kinda flirty but not too flirty.. Just in the way of more unique conversation instead of regular “where are you from?” Questions.

At the end of the week last week, I asked her out in person, and she said she wants to get coffee at the end of this week.

How should I approach this? Text her during the week leading up to the date? Not text her at all? I’m very new to dating in general and she seems way out of my league looks wise, I’m just trying to get some pointers.

Also, as a side note, I have NEVER done what I did to get her to add me on something like instagram before... I just kinda figured I’d go out on a limb and try it and it seems to have worked so far!

I have been dating my boyfriend for almost 2 years. We don't live together or share closets. Well today I decided to clean his room because I could not find some clothes of mine at home. Which is when I opened his closet and found a full womans outfit, bra and underwear included.

Immediately I confronted him, ""Who's are these and how did she leave without ANY of it on?"" His face was pure shock and ""I honestly have no idea, that is so weird. Are you sure theyre not yours?""

1. They weren't my size.
2. They weren't my style.

Then I found the Halloween wig. Which he then declined more, ""Babe I have no idea where any of that came from.""

Having fallen for lies and been cheated on in the past, I asked his best friend if he hid a wig in his closet or something and just assumed he had a one nighter while we were on a break.

He finally came out to me as a cross dresser. Saying ""its something I have been thinking about and decided to try. But I really dont want to talk about it anymore.""

What do I do? I feel like we should talk more about this but I don't want to push him in a shame hole or anything. Should I just pretend he didnt say anything or what? Anyone experience this before?

I punch him in the noes and another friend (E) separates us. Later on in the night, its time to leave and I tell my sister we're leaving. B flips out again and tells me I'm not taking her home. I tell him that no one else is, sure as shit not him. He's drunk and I wouldn't trust him to walk to his car, let alone drive. Now E is between us to make sure another fight doesn't ensue. No such luck. B swings at me and E removes him from the room before I could even react. 

Fast forward a couple days later and my parents have heard the story, more specifically, my sister's side. I tell them the other half of what happened.

About a week later, I meet with him to apologize on more friendly terms. I get through my part and all he can say to me is ""same."" At this point in the conversation, I decide that I can't associate myself with this person anymore. It wasn't just this party that led me to that decision. He's over reacted about various things, taking a few starbursts, not buying him something from 7-11. He's constantly late or flakes all together and yells while I'm driving. The party pushed me over the edge and I realized that he's just not someone I want to be around. Which is a problem because he's still dating my sister. Now whenever he comes over, I usually leave the house or go to my room. Dad is on my side but won't tell B he's not welcome at our house. Mom thinks I'm being childish and need to get over myself. 

My parents have been arguing about the whole situation and its been going on for a couple months. They. have full screaming matches which I get dragged into and they always come back to B should apologize to me again. I keep saying that I don't want his apology because I'm not gonna accept a third shitty attempt. Then I'm the bad guy for letting B ""live in my head,"" and refusing to get over the situation, when in reality, I've come to dislike him and would rather not see or speak to him.

Recently, my cousins came over and B wanted to meet my aunt and see the cousins again. One cousin said she doesn't really like him and the other said he didn't care either way. I said I'd prefer if he didn't come because it would ruin the whole atmosphere. Well he came over, I left, and now we're back to fighting because I don't wanna suppress my feelings and coexist with him

Ideally I would like my family to get back to normal without sacrificing my happiness in the process.  I just want to know from an unbiased source if I'm in the wrong and any tips to make the situation better

361,"Made a throw away account for the purpose of posting this thread. 

To sketch the situation, I’m currently employed in a retail store, a rather small one for a big franchise. I have two coworkers, who have the exact same position as me (salesman/saleswomen). Each of us work with a 38 hours schedule meaning that our schedule doesn’t allow much room for switching shifts and whatnot.

Coworker Anna (fictional name) and I are a great duo. Running the store with the both of us isn’t much of an issue. We joke around a lot,  have common interests and find it tasks to get things done. She has the most experience in our branch.

Coworker Barbara (fictional name once again) however is the problem we’re facing right now. She likes to call us on our days off with complaints about things not being done, always worries about tasks she can’t complete in time and likes to have reoccurring discussions on small issues that are not directly work related.  On top of that, there is some form of sexism going on in our workplace, which isn’t exactly enjoyable. 

To give you an example of last weeks incident, we had a 3 days event where each of us had to work a single day with a student (due to budget cuts and whatnot). While this isn’t an issue for myself or Anna, Barbara freaked out and regularly called both myself and Anna with problems she was facing. Barbara received feedback on what was done incorrectly and how she could improve her work ethic but she went totally ballistic on us. She demanded that this was the last time she was ever going to work with a student on a special event day, claiming that there was little to no time to complete tasks and wanted an extra pair of hands to help out on special event days. Since that’s nearly impossible due to our tight schedule, we refused the demand and told her we had our rights to take off a day and not take extra hours (which by the way are not paid). Another demand she made was that either Anna or myself switched shifts on a day where she had our holidays planned in (she didn’t had to work) in order to receive an extra day off. 

While checking camera footage with Anna, we noticed that Barbara took a 2 hour break at noon, frequently went to the bathroom (like she does every day for at least 15 minutes) and did little to no effort in completing tasks in time. For Barbara, this was the last straw. She couldn’t stand the fact that we were checking up on her, pulled the victim card (as she does regularly). There’s a lack of admitting to her own faults and often (read always) blames others for the mistakes she made. In the past, she had threatened with quitting her job, mentioned that she isn’t going to stay for long anymore.

To sum it all up, I’ve kept myself quite for a long time and am planning to go to one of our management meetings to discuss this issue. There’s no room for constructive criticism and/or discussions, every feedback is taken as a personal insult and her attitude and lack of professionalism is taking its toll. Both Anna and I are planning eventually quit our jobs if this isn’t being taken care of. I didn’t take this job to be a daycare provider.

How can I solve this situation and have the best possible outcome? If there’s any need for elaboration, feel free to ask.",24Jun2018,1

365,"Hey!

I'm 19 years old and was born and raised in Minnesota. I got my associate's degree from a community college last winter and I've been looking into schools that would fit my career path, which unfortunately, there are none that I could go to without living on campus. While pondering this, I realized that I don't think I really want to stay in this state. Half the year is really nice, the other half is almost numbing. I've never enjoyed any winter activities, and I actually tend to become incredibly asocial and lazy because I have no real motivation to do anything during the cold months. On top of this, I spun out on one of the main highways (I-94) last winter while heading to class. 

At that point, I kinda realized that I'm just done with all of it. The cold makes me uncomfortable; I don't enjoy the white-knuckled, soul-shattering anxiety that comes with driving in the winter (which again, is half the year here); and I don't like the outdoor-centric culture (everyone here has a cabin or goes up to the lake). On the other hand, I do love my family/friends and would obviously miss them if I chose to move out of state.

Now I'm faced with several questions that I don't know how to approach. Where would I move? Obviously somewhere without a traditional winter, but *where?* Would I want to try moving there before I head back to school? What do you even need to undergo such a move? How do I get my feet in the water here? Is this even worth it (how do I weigh the pros and cons)?

Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thank you for your time!",24Jun2018,1
366,"Okay so me and a good friend of mine who I have known since the age of eight went to a local music festival tonight and it went great and my friend got way too drunk and we went over to my apartment to pick up my girlfriend because it’s real close to the venue we were at and he ended up being sick in my bathroom and I argued back and forth with him to be sick in the toilet if he was going to be sick, instead of sitting on the toilet and simply leaning over into the tub and spewing and blocking up the bathtub with vomit. So I ended up shouting and being pretty impatient after a while and he got upset and started to cry because he was so drunk, after he sobered up we talked it out and I felt guilty and I wanted to end this good day we had on a high note not a low one so I recommend we go back to the park the festival was on at, all three of us this time and we brought a joint to smoke, we were walking down the pathway in the park and two younger guys came up to us being loud and asking for a cigarette and just generally giving off an asshole vibe so we just kept walking as we said Na but my friend decided to walk back a couple meters with them and talk to them, he is a sociable guy so I didn’t think anything of it so me and my girlfriend kept walking a few meters ahead and we came around a corner and about sixty seconds later I realised my friend wasn’t following so I told my girlfriend and we turned back and instantly called to ask If he was with those guys but his phone was off and we couldn’t see him, I asked around and asked the security people around the venue if they saw my friend I came in with and no luck so the next best bet was just wait outside my place and he turned up, with a black eye and no cellphone. The two guys were like 17 and we are 21 but my friend is kinda small and not aggressive what so ever. I knew they were pricks but I didn’t think they would just jump someone  for no reason at all.

367,"I've hated smoking ever since I was a kid, aside from the obvious  reasons why smoking is factually proven to do nothing but bad things and is  just all around a shitty thing to take part in, it makes  me feel like absolute garbage. 


When I was a kid and my mom would take me to these parties where you can hardly see because of the thick smoke of all these people killing themselves and blinding me while filling my lungs with ass-gas. It makes me sick. Always has, always will. It isn't just a feeling of ""wah I'm uncomfortable because I'm a pussy  that can't handle 'a little smoke' "" but legit makes me physically ill any time I catch a whiff of the stuff. Even if they're not even smoking but have smoked earlier so it's still on them I have to fight the urge to projectile vomit all over the place. So it makes it pretty hard to engage in any kind of actual conversation since I have to focus so heavily on not blowing chunks and suppressing the intense migraines that cigarette smoke gives me. 


So now that you know how tapped I am when it comes to smoking, my best friend is an insane chain smoker, dude must smoke 2 packs a day at least. Whenever we hang out it's like every 10 minutes he says ""gonna go outside to smoke"" and then smokes 3-7 cigarettes before he waits  another 20 minutes to do it again. 


This is really depressing for me because A) my buddy is killing himself (excluding all those stories where one person out of 7 billion say they smoked since they were 3 and lived to be 134 y/o) and B) god damn is that shit disgusting and makes me not want to be around him at all. It's a prime example in itself so I can't really relate it to something else, maybe like imagine  you have a friend that likes to cut off his legs once a day by swinging a buzz saw on a string over his head until it cuts off his legs so the more you hang out with them the more the buzz saw chips away at your own legs. It's disgusting and he won't stop and it's not my place to make him stop, we're all adults so he can do whatever he wants, but **god damn**. 


This is going to seem like I'm blowing this way out of proportion, to you maybe I am. But this is how I actually think with this subject. I just can't understand how A) people can choose to smoke and B) people around those people choose to stay around them even though they ruin their health, clothes, over-all fitness and make them smell like ass-garbage for days. Everyone around him excluding me smokes as much as he does too so he's literally buried by other degenerates so there's no way he's going to change. I don't have the money to buy a gas mask.

369,"I (23m) just had a first date with a girl (21) off tinder and all things considered went not bad. Coffee and hanging out, conversation was a little slow paced but quite comfortable, and I know I can come across as slightly aloof but in a polite way (as opposed to pompous or something). And I am interested in her.

At the end we didn't kiss, even though I got the impression she expected it, so I kind of regret not going for it but not the end of the world.

I'm down to hang out again but I'm unsure how to go about it. People often say wait a couple days before messaging but I feel like since I didn't close the kiss that could make me look too disinterested. Maybe I'll message her tonight and say it was fun (and maybe say we should do something again sometime?) Or ask for her number since I only have her on tinder?

Also unsure what else I should suggest, I've never been on a second date. Maybe comedy show/movie/arcade/mini golf/drinks or something more loose than a formal coffee date.

370,"My family dynamic is as follows: dad, mom, bro 1 (26), me (F, 25), sister (23), bro 2 (18), and bro 3(15).

Bro 3 is very intelligent and talented. He has great grades, he's a year ahead in math (will take trig/pre-calc next year as a sophomore), and plays the trumpet really well. He made co-section leader along with a senior for next year's marching band.

My siblings and I haven't always been kind to him. Bro 1 was a bit of a bully to all of us growing up, but has grown out of it and apologized. My sister is a piece of work honestly (various health issues both physical and mental) but she recognizes that bro 3 is a really cool kid. Bro 2 has autism and loves pretty much everyone, really sweet kid. He's the only one of us who never picked on bro 3 at any point. We (Bro 1, me, sis) used to find bro 3 incredibly annoying. Sometimes he was- he's 15 and every kid is annoying. 

Now he's one of my best friends, honestly. We play the Pokemon games together and I introduced him to Avatar: The Last Airbender. We both like Minecraft (or the idea of it, my computer is a potato and only barely runs it). We've really bonded over these things. He is such a cool kid with a great sense of humor (he loves puns and dad jokes).

In elementary school, he had a few really good friends that he hung out with a lot. But in junior high he saw them a lot less, and he's not really friends with any of them now. One of them has been in some of his classes and now kind of laughs at the things he says, in a ha-ha-just-kidding-but-not-really type of way.

He hasn't made many friends in high school at all. In band, there's been a sort of social hierarchy where seniors have precedence. Since bro 3 is so talented and hard-working, he's made his way up through the ranks and alienated a few of the older kids- which then filters down to people his own age. Some of them think he's stuck-up, but he's really just a bit shy and awkward around people because he's not sure if they will like him or not.

At church it's the same. There aren't any issues with religion itself, it's just that all of the teenage boys have very different interests and he doesn't really relate to any of them. They think he's stuck-up, too.

This last week he went to high adventure camp with the church group. He's in the Boy Scouts. He had fun, but he did something to his knee and scraped himself up on a natural water slide they went on. So he's been limping and bandaging himself up. He's in some pain (It isn't bad enough for a doctor but it's all a bit sensitive still).

Today at church, they were talking about camp. Bro 3 has issues with food. It used to be anxiety about trying new things but these days it has more to do with habit and stubbornness. One boy kept bringing up that Bro 3 wouldn't eat a lot of the food they had at camp. It was phrased as gentle ribbing, but my brother was kind of hurt by it- especially as it's one of the things that bro 1 and sis and I used to give him a hard time about.

What it all boils down to is that he doesn't have many friends that aren't family. I try to be a good friend as well as a good sister, but I know that a grown woman ten years older doesn't really replace people your own age. Bro 3 is smart, talented, and sensitive, but also introverted, shy, and more than a little awkward. He is lonely at school and church, while being surrounded by people his own age.

My question to you all is this: are there things I can do to help him that I'm not doing? What can I tell him when he vents to me about mean people? What advice can I give him to help him make friends?

He's really in a lot of pain over this, and it hurts me to see how lonely and depressed he's getting. If I had a job or money I'd take him out for ice cream and stuff.

Thanks in advance.",24Jun2018,2
371,"Sorry if this is long winded but I feel like I should explain as much as possible. He and I are the only men in a predominately female work environment. He is openly gay, and knows I am straight, and quite honestly I think he’s a pretty good friend and most of the time I enjoy our conversations. Before he would make a comment every once in a while about how I was “easy on the eyes” or how he “loved to watch me walk away” but it was only happening occassionally and it was obviously just being playful so I would laugh it off and it wouldn’t really bother me. However, recently he’s started to make these types of comments much more frequently (at least once or twice a day) and has been getting much more physical, I.e. asking for hugs “to make his day better” (which both times I obliged have been uncomfortably long, so I tend to just not respond to that anymore). This past weekend he asked me if I wanted to stop by his place and have some drinks, and when I said I was busy he got a little bit pushy and insisted that I could at least stop by for a little bit. I eventually just said maybe so that he would stop asking me about it. I’ve mentioned ex-gfs/hook ups in conversations we’ve had in the past so I know that he knows I am straight, so I’m not sure if maybe he’s just joking around and being playful or if I’m right to feel uncomfortable. Also, another of my coworkers (19f) says similar things to me on occasion and it’s never really bothered me, so I’m not sure if it would be fair for me to ask him to stop without saying anything to her about it as well. I’m only gonna be working at this place for another month or so, so part of me thinks it would just be best to suck it up and ignore it for the next month and just forget about it afterward.

I just got this job as bar-back at a restaurant. Absolutely loved working as bar-back, even though I've only had 2 shifts so far.

But, on my second 9-hour shift, they pulled me to do dishwasher, because the original guy didn't show up. Worst day of my life in a long time. Pretty much I had to scrape (with my gloved hands) all the left over food off of every single dish, then pass it to someone else to spray it down. What made it hard was, the entire time I was behind because of how much dishes were coming in. (it was Friday night). I couldn't move away from that area because I would get behind. About 2 hours in, I almost passed out. I was so over-worked, I began throwing dishes away like they were food and didn't notice until someone started pulling them all out. 

The ONE AND ONLY reason I made it through was because I had the mindset, ""Just this one day.""

But, I just got my schedule for this week... First thing I saw was only 2 shifts, both bar back. But only 14 hours on what is supposed to be a full-time schedule. Just when I thought it can't get any worse, I refresh the page to find out that one of the shifts were changed to Dishwasher (Another Friday night). I don't want to do it again, at all.

382,"I was naive getting into my first relationship. He was the first boy to show me any genuine attention and i was overly excited at the notion that anyone could find me attractive. Our friend threw us in a group chat, said “date,” and then left. He then texted me and after awkward conversation about what had just happened, he proceeded to ask me out. In my opinion, then entire thing felt staged and forced and it made me incredibly uncomfortable but i said yes anyway. We ended up dating for almost nine months and it was, to say the least, traumatic. The first three months were fantastic, despite the constant bickering between us. After that though, he started to change. It was as if he had lost interest in me. He wouldn’t allow me to touch him in public, we hardly ever kissed or did anything remotely sexual, he would never compliment me or tell me he loved me. I had an allergic reaction on new year’s eve and his friend was more worried about my wellbeing than he was. Things were so different and he was so foreign. Other things changed too. He started showing feelings for his best friend, when i brought it up though he of course denied it. He would attack my character and my personal appearance also. He would use such a harsh tone with me all the time. Sometimes things would get slightly physical, he even slapped my foot in front of my mother. Yes, it was just my foot, but in my mother’s eyes, he might as well have slapped me in the face too. My mom even asked me after he left if he always treated me that way. She said she didn’t approve of the way i was being treated by him and thought i deserved better. After 5 months, he did try to end things with me, but being the immature person i was, i insisted we stay together. Things got progressively worse after that. During the four months before the relationship ended, i began to move on, almost as a way to protect myself from the hurt i was experiencing. Despite moving on, I still to this day, blame myself for the abuse i experienced. However, I am grateful it wasn’t any worse because had it been, I might not be here today to tell my story. After he broke up with me, I moved on very quickly. It was a mistake but also a blessing. Unintentionally, i began to develop feelings for one of his close friends. A few weeks later, we started to date. Although my abuser and his/my friends had encouraged me to move on, something had changed. At first, my abuser had expressed that he did not care that i was dating his friend and that he only wanted me to be happy, but after manipulation from his best friend (the one he has feelings for) he became angry. His step sister had also expressed anger for me dating my abuser’s friend. These were the same people who had encouraged me to move on. Never had i had people turn on me so quickly. My abuser had even reached out to me and told me that i should have come to him the second i had feelings for anyone else. My life became a living hell. I had lost almost all my friends, had rumors spread about me around my high school, and had people posting about me online. His step sister had gone as far as telling the people she knew that she openly hated me. As if having to see my abuser every day in the halls wasn’t enough, i was not borderline being bullied. School has since ended, and I had hoped the bullying too. However it appears I just can’t get away from the people who made my sophomore year a living hell. My sister’s boyfriend’s birthday party was today and I was purposely told to not come so that I wouldn’t cause a scene because the people who had been making fun of me and my abuser would be there. I live everyday in fear of what they might do next, yet my abuser lives happily, knowing that he has won. He has lost no friends. He is not made fun of or hated. He has gained more than I will ever and there is nothing i can do about, because who would ever believe me?",24Jun2018,1
383,"So I have one year left of taking my IGCSEs so I’m almost 15. I’ve recently taken my mock exams (the ones you take a year before the real ones) and I’ve got my results. I studied soo hard for this and I’ve gotten mostly Bs and a couple Cs. I mean I know they are good grades and I want to feel proud but all of my friends get straight As and A*s... I try to not compare myself with others but it’s hard. I also feel pressure from my family to get good grades because I’m seen as the “smart one”. It doesn’t sound like a bad thing but they expect me to be a doctor or a famous artist and I don’t know if I can. I have room to improve of course but I studied a lot for this, I focus in school, have good attendance, and I hand in basically all of my assignments. Do I just have to accept that it’s unlikely I’ll get straight As? I honestly don’t think I can work much harder and maintain my social life and hobbies as well... ",24Jun2018,1
384,"I have a coworker (let's call her sara) that has been causing a lot of drama at work. She did it so much that it made my other coworker uncomfortable and she requested a schedule change so that she could with me instead. This pissed Sara off because for some reason she does not like it when the schedule changes even when it doesn't affecther hours. She was venting about it to my other coworker and finally put two and two together and realized that she didn't want to work with her anymore. She said ""it's because you don't want to work with me right?? If that's why then I am going to stab you in the throat."" Our boss didnt take it seriously and basically said ""oh she was just upset, she will get over it and be back to normal next week."" This happened last month. I still worked with her and just tried to be civil because it didnt have anything to do with me. Well tonight she tried to micro manage me and tell me how to clean. I just ignored it and did my job the best that I could- which apparently wasn't up to her standards because she kept getting more and more pissed off. It then became obvious that we were going to have to stay late about 15-20 minutes, which is really common when we are this busy. But that pissed her off even more and she started slamming doors and slamming things around. It wasn't super hard, like I wasn't afraid that she was going to break anything, but it still made me feel uneasy. I couldn't tell if she was just irritable and didn't want to be there or was about to threaten me. It seemed like the less I reacted theo it the more it pissed her off. I don't know how to tell my boss that she makes me uncomfortable. This was only a two hour shift. I don't want to avoid her completely because I'm afraid it may make the situation worse. I'm wondering if I should tell my boss that I would be more comfortable if someone else worked with us so I don't have to be alone with her. I finally found a job that I genuinely like and I don't want to have to leave because of my coworker but I don't feel safe working alone with her. How should I approach my boss with this?

385,"I took shrooms two days ago and I was having a bad trip. I didn't know who I was. I felt like nobody liked me, and I felt like I was dead.

I texted her during all this and she still hasn't said anything to me. I've talked to her many times in the middle of the night when she has panic attacks. This time, I reach out to her when I need someone, and she ignores me.

what should I do? Do I text her now and tell her that I'm fine now? maybe she was just freaked out? I WANT to wait for her to reach out and tell her that this dynamic is messed up. I'm always here for her, but I reach out and she's nowhere to be found.",24Jun2018,2
386,"As the title says, this is in Canada. I'm 15 and have a 17 year old brother who has been causing hell for my entire family. The past few months, my brother has been stealing credit cards from my parents, cash from my siblings and despite locking down everything, he's been breaking into closets and everything in order to retrieve credit cards/snacks/cash. This is screwing up my parents credit, putting them 2k+ in debt and they don't want to call a hospital about it. He's been going to therapy and it loosened up for a bit but when he lost his job it completely went to shit again. Since he's not 18 yet, what could any of us do? We're already down to hiding literally everything and very little credit cards but if we leave anything out it'll be gone in seconds. Buying a safe won't help, he'll break into that too.

387,"So here is the story. My wife and I have two boys who we have adopted when they were young. (2 and 4) they are now teens. Ours youngest who is 17. Has gotten himself in a lot of trouble recently. At the beginning of the year he got busted for pot in school and is currently serving parole. About a month ago he broke into our clubhouse in our modular home park. He’s gotten himself cought for that. The park has come to us and said he needs to be out of the park in 60 days or he will be trespassing. So this means we have to move. 

We are now trying to buy a home. We had planned on doing this  eventually but our time table has moved up. So we don’t have the money put away like we wanted. We have qualified for a loan but it is an FHA. And after finding the perfect home we have placed a bid on it and are it the process of head towards closing. We some money set aside for the down payment and closing cost. We did ask for $3000 in consetions. 

My fear is that I will run out of money to do this or that the assessment on the house will come out less than the asking price and loss this house. Also our son may end up in jail for his current situation and for breaking parole. More money out the door. 

No sure what to do. ",24Jun2018,1
