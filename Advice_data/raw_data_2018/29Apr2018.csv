0,"I was a good student in undergrad and didn't know what to do with my life.  I had a 3.9 GPA, and my parents really pushed me to apply for law school.  They are really well off and offered to pay for it in full.

I got into a top ten law school, but I didn't do too well.  It's the first time I ever had bad grades and I have a 3.2 GPA now.  I graduate in three weeks, and I have not been able to find a job even though most people at my school have.

Some of the jobs I am interviewing for have really ridiculous hours.  One of them paid $80,000 but wanted me to BILL 2400 hours a year.  That really means working like 2600 hours a year when factoring in time at work like lunch and meetings.

I also really really really don't like law.  Being a lawyer (at least at a firm) is basically like being a professional research paper writer for 8-10 hours a day.  This is not what I envisioned myself doing with my life at all.  I don't even care about the money and would totally accept positions I could have gotten out of undergrad.

I've been trying to convince my parents I don't want to be a lawyer, and they've budged a little, but it's just so hard to convince them completely without an idea of having something to do.  I'm graduating from a top ten school and am moving back to live at my parents house while I study for the bar and then indefinitely.

I really pushed myself after wanting to drop out even though I didn't like this.  I did three years of law school and now the bar exam, and I feel like its all for a profession I can't stand.

I also don't fit the personality of an attorney at all.  I'm not awkward, but I'm not a smooth talker or someone who enjoys arguing a lot.  I'm more laid back.  I grew up with a lot of anxiety and being laid back helped me cope.  I feel like being an attorney requires me to roll back all the coping I did to deal with my stress.  I don't know how to explain it, but I just don't think I fit what lawyers are.  And I feel so different from them when I interview at firms.

I like business and I like science and I think a lot of other careers sound interesting.  I'm not in any debt, but what do I do right now?  I'm only 25 so I can definitely go on other paths.  I know I probably rely on my parents too much, but it's so hard to really think about other careers when I have to read thousands of pages and write 25 page papers all the time.",29Apr2018,1
2,"Hi, I'm struggling with talking to this girl and have been for about a year. I've been a shy dude my whole life, but I've seemed to be able to break out of the shell long enough to go for a few girls in my past. This one; however, is different. For some reason, I just can't talk to her. Despite the opportunities I've had, as well as the reasons that I have that tell me I should talk to her, I just can't. This girl has stared at me a lot, to the point where we make eye contact almost once every two days or so. Just this past week on Monday I was standing in the lunch line, and she was on the opposite side of the room in that lunch line and she was staring at me, I made eye contact with her and looked down, unsure of what to do, but I looked back up and she was still going so I locked eyes and we stood there staring at each other for a moment, and neither of us moved. Furthermore, she is good friends with my sister and whilst my sister was telling her something I said, she said ""Same,"" and then proceeded to say ""I am *insert my real name here*."" Even after all of this, I still struggle to speak to her and can't work up the courage to break the silence. Oddly enough, I spoke to this girl some last year, and she thinks I'm a funny guy and seems to be pretty comfortable with speaking to me, according to my sister. What would you guys suggest I do? I need serious help, I don't have much time and I need some solid advice. Thank you.",29Apr2018,1

15,"How do I enter the present? The only time I get stuff done is when I'm chasing after a reward, and I have to receive that reward relatively quickly without too much time and effort. I'm a very ""Just a sec"" person. It's an illusion similar to the desire for the addictive substance/activity distorting your evaluation. It's never ""Just a sec"", because you can't take action in the present without being IN the present. It drives me nuts. I become addicted very easily too. Also, I'm good at adapting, but I have get stuck in what I just adapted to (e.g. choreography in a sport).

You know how people will plan to do something like read books, start exercising, etc. but they never do? It's like that. Part of me is an ""In a sec"" aspect while the following aspect is a conservative, ""safe place"", routine aspect. I can switch between the future and the past easily, and I can look at my surroundings, but it's very hard to be in the present and become immersed in my surroundings.

16,"I’m 23 and my eldest sister is 29. When my father walked out, my sister stepped in and ran the household so understandably she and my mom are very close.

However ever since I was born, my sister and I don’t get along at all. We rarely say hi or bye and when we even speak to one word to each other, we get infuriated and my moms already fed up of it.

My sister is a very pessimistic person and whines all the time. For instance if someone accidentally pushes her in a mall, she would come home and go on a tirade about it. No kidding. My mom would sit and listen quietly.

She also complains about everything I do. Like if I carry or cuddle my cat after coming home, she would scream, “SHE DIDNT WASH HER HANDS! OMG.” If I do a similar thing, like if I call her out for not washing her dishes, she would tell my mother who then reprimands.

My mother treats me differently but I don’t say anything because she easily misunderstands my words and gets very upset. So I stay quiet. I can’t move out because I just finished university and moved back home. I don’t have affordability to move out.

I have a lot of pent-up anger and it’s now affecting my relationship with my mother. I’m actually holding grudges against her and she doesn’t understand why.

17,"Ok. So this is a bit of a ramble, but I'll start from the beginning. 

In december I reached out to a girl who had gone to the same high school as me (though we never really spoke to each other). Her social media posts showed we had a lot of similar interests and she seemed like a cool person, and I have been really lonely since well forever. I've had friends come and go but I've always felt like I never had anything in common with them, like I was the outsider who didn't quite fit. My boyfriend has lots of friends and I consider them my friends, but I guess I felt like I didn't have any genuine friends that were my own. I'd tried making friends at work, but while my work relationships are great, it didn't translate to free-time friendships. I'd tried using Bumble, but didn't really connect with anyone. I basically felt like I'd exhausted my resources and was about to give up so it felt like time to throw caution to the wind. So I messaged her and asked if she'd like to hang out sometime. She responded asking if I'd like to go for coffee the next morning. We set plans, but the next morning she asked to postpone so we did. Then we met up the next morning and hung out for an hour or two and talked and it felt promising. 

Anyways from there we made plans again and started hanging out every week or two. I am really relaxed and don't mind going some time without seeing someone, and I also don't mind hanging out three days in a row. And since it was a new friendship it felt right not to overwhelm her with my presence. 

So anyways I guess where my doubts come from... She often reschedules or cancels plans at the last minute and today is the second time she's made plans and then never followed up. She apologizes often for being flaky and inconsistent, and usually her reason for canceling is that she feels emotionally drained. I understand that feeling totally. I don't think I've ever canceled our plans and I've probably initiated plans more often then her. She often says I'm so sweet and she really wants to see me. 

None of this is hate or frustration towards her. If anything I'm frustrated with myself, as I feel that maybe I'm overbearing or unwanted. She's a very sweet person and I wonder if she would be able to tell me / cut me out if she didn't enjoy hanging out with me. I guess I'm just scared that she doesn't actually want to be my friend. I have a history of being bullied &amp; maybe this is making me paranoid.. I dunno.. 

From the information given does it sound like she wants to be my friend or is she trying to gently get rid of me? ",29Apr2018,1
18,My mother loves our family dog. She is the only one in the family who likes this dog and the only person this dog relatively likes. The dog is very very aggressive. I still have scars on my arms from attacks. Although (dog) she's old now her aggression has not changed. I really don't like saying it but I don't want this dog to live with us much longer. She is an allergy problem for me and she attacks my feet. We recently found out she (dog) has some kind of medical issue that's life threatening but we can save her. I heard ranges of 3-4k in medical fees. Should I tell my mother not to go through with saving her dog? As much as I love dogs this dog is the reason I never got my own (2 dogs would kill me and my father with allergies) and she is the definition of evil. Everyone I know calls her satan or little devil. We've done nothing but treat her well and give her a good home since she was a pup. Would it be wrong if I just told her not to go through with the dogs treatment as a favor for me and everyone else in the household?,29Apr2018,1
19,"Look, this is a weird question but I just want to hear other people's experience or what's the norm. I've asked question before and people seemed to take it more seriously than I mean it. To clarify it's relatively minor (no memory loss or actually feeling like I'm not me really). Moreso just a feeling usually like I'm sleepwalking a lot of the time, even if I get a decent amount of sleep or I'm not too tired.

Overall I'm a pretty average well adjusted 24 year old, got a job friends etc (no relationship tho). And I'm personable I think, people seem to like me, but my interactions seem to come so unconsciously I'll often not feel like I was mentally there until I'm alone again. And sometimes when I'm alone, like now, my brain just feels so fogged over and I just feel really numb.

I was (self diagnosed) depressed as a teen and had anxiety in my very early 20s but I feel like most of the time lately I've been in a decent place, but sometimes I just feel really dissociated and life is going by without me.

20,"Just a warning, this is going to be lengthy. Thanks in advance for reading.

So I was going through pictures on my phone, trying to clear out some space and I ran into some pictures of a few years ago that had all my siblings and I together. Started thinking back to how things were then, just kinda reminiscing, and the more I looked at my little brother in the pictures, the more I realized how far apart we are from each other. 

Growing up, it was like a typical older brother, little brother relationship. But once he started to get into his teens, things just sort of distanced between us. It wasn't that we disliked each other or anything, we just stopped the little kid shit from before and kinda just minded our business. 

Looking back on things, it almost felt like we were more roommates than we were siblings. We never talked or did anything together if we weren't being forced to. 4 years ago, he came out to me that he was gay and I later learned I was the second to last person to find out, one behind my father. Even my cousins and aunts/uncles knew before me. He said he was scared to tell me and my dad because I often said insensitive shit just around the house and stuff (I was never serious but he didn't know that and that's completely on me). I felt like shit because that was the first moment I truly felt like I'd failed him as an older brother. Somewhere down the line, he lost that trust or connection with me and I sat there and explained to him that he was my brother no matter what I loved him regardless. 

Things seemed alright for a little while but I ended up transferring colleges across the country and last night, when I was going through those pictures, it hit me that we are at that point again where he feels more like an acquaintance than anything else. I have a great relationship with my older sister. I'm closer to her than I am anyone else in my life. My little sister and I have a good relationship. Not like my older sister but I can't find many faults. 

But none of that is there with my brother. We only talk when I'm home on break or if I call home and he happens to answer the phone. And even when I am home, he just sits in his room all day or is at work. The little talking we do seems more like a formality or something if that makes sense. 

I don't want to just randomly start butting into his life all of the sudden because I still know how he is and it would make him feel uncomfortable and it'd honestly just be awkward. But I also don't want my little brother feeling like this stranger to me. I will say it's not like he puts any effort to talk to me either but I can't help but feel like that goes back to where I felt like I failed him. I'm not really sure what to do and I don't even feel comfortable bringing it up with anyone in my family. ",29Apr2018,1

Anyway, the streets I live on are so not busy that I know when a car goes by, and they drive by quickly. I don’t think the noise I’m hearing is from cars playing music like I think it is, but I don’t know where else it could be coming from.

29,"This guy and I have been in each others lives for 16 years. We go from being super close for several months, to distant and pretty nonexistent to each other. Last spring/summer, we grew very close again after my dad died. He was going through a divorce and has a 3 (now 4) year old son. We started hanging out a lot and took random spontaneous trips to Boston and Bayonne together. We would also call each other on our hour ride drives home from work. 

It got to the point where we both kind of felt like we were starting to develop feelings for each other. I wasn’t sure how I felt about being in a relationship in general, let alone a serious one with someone who has a son. He also didn’t know if he wanted to throw another “motherly figure” into his sons life while he is still trying to understand that his mother was leaving. So, we decided to take it slow, just be friends, and see where things went.

In August, it was his ex-wife’s weekend visit with their son, so he showed up at my house drunk. I tried getting him to calm down and go to sleep, but he kept trying to hook up with me. The next morning, I left for work and called him on my way home to ask if we could talk. He brushed me off and never tried talking about what happened again. He eventually just stopped talking to me all together. My friend told me that he was set up with some girl and had been sleeping with her, but not bringing her home when he had his son. I started seeing someone else and tried not thinking about it. 

It is now April, and he randomly texted me asking if we could talk and that he missed me. I called him out and said he hasn’t spoken to me since August, so it made no sense for him to talk to me now except if his girlfriend dumped him. He did admit that she did just dump him. I then told him that him trying to talk to me only because he was dumped, makes me feel like he doesn’t respect me as a friend. He apologized for doing that to me. I said that there was no need to apologize; but if he wants to be my friend then he needs to stay in my life regardless of whether he’s dating someone or not. ",29Apr2018,1

It was in my direction and turned so that the screen was facing me,In the video I thought I saw someone holding a white poster (my project was a white poster) and I thought she was recording me. Especially because when I started looking at her she was looking down to her phone kind of and when I started looking at the phone she quickly put it away. I got upset and I stopped presenting and I was like "" why were you recording a video of me Hannah ?"" and everyone turned around to look at her. My teacher said "" excuse me, Hannah, you have no right to be recording ANYONE in this classroom."" and she just said ""I wasn't.."" and he said that her phone shouldn't even be out right now. I got upset and I stopped presenting and I went back to my seat. She came to me afterwards and she was like "" I wasn't even taking a video of you"" "" you know what I was doing ? I was literally just looking at photos of myself"".(which means she admitted to even being on snapchat ) and then she opened her snapchat and she was like "" see this is my story, you're not in my story. these are my saved photos - you're not in here and the last thing I sent was like 2 hours ago"". So I don't know it's really possible that I just embarrassed her in front of the class for no reason. and I said "" okay I'm sorry"" and she was like "" yeah, next time don't just fucking assume shit alright ?"" and then I just stayed silent. I mean it's totally possible I was just being overly suspicious but I really thought she was taking a video of me.

She lost weight and her behavior changed. She became very nasty.

She said it was all my fault even though I apologized. He denied he did anything wrong. I think he's probably not being faithful to her, but anyway I tried being this woman's friend. I tried talking to her, even tried making plans with her and she always made up excuses to not hang out with me. 

I feel like she's more popular than me. On Instagram she just follows a lot of celebrity accounts. Her page is open so anyone can see her photos and she gets 10+ likes on her photos compared to me.

47,"Hello, first time asking for advice here so I hope I'm doing this right. 
I have been dating this girl for 6 months and we got into a huge argument. She broke up with me, and now almost two weeks later she is dating someone else now. It hurts me so much to know that she moved on. I don't really think me and her have a chance again. I just need advice about this, how do I proceed. I am devastated and I can't do anything about it but watch. And I hate that, it makes me sad and mad to see that she likes him. Ugh!  And now it seems she has to choose between me and him. 
But I hate it, I hate that she has to choose. She said she loves me but yet somehow she has to choose??? If I dated anyone then I'd kick them the hell out and have her. There is no contest, I would have her back in a heartbeat. But she dates this guy now and she has to decide? I'm sorry for the rant, but if she loved me, like she said, then wouldn't she choose me over this new guy!
It bothers me that this is a contest now. Like she JUST MET THIS GUY, she legit just met him she said! And this new guy and I have to compete? Yet me and her have history. We dated 6 months and we were best friends for..like over a year I'd say. We've only been broken up for almost 2 weeks, how can she lose the feeling of love so fast. I loved her with everything but she got over me so quickly and now it's a contest!?!  
Sorry for rant, it just happened pretty recent so I'm just sad at the moment. I miss her. 
Any advice on how to proceed, and/or cope, or win her back would be the amazing. Thanks!",29Apr2018,3

50,"My uncle passed away last month, and although it was sad my family has since recovered and will be holding a funeral soon. He was single and unemployed yet somehow still had a great deal of money which he regularly spent on food and technology that he rarely ate/used. For the week after his passing we would take several of his things, something I felt bad about but it might have just been some weird way my father could cope with his death. 

One of these items we took was his phone, a very new and nice one. My father used it for a week or two before passing it to my younger brother who has become addicted to the fucking thing. Not even half an hour ago I found it in our bathroom, a rare thing to happen as he usually takes it everywhere he goes. The opportunities in my head were endless but I settled on going through his internet history. 

Many giggles were had at the frequent visits to XHamster, but scrolling further I got into searches that had happened before my brother got the phone. I recognized searches for people and places that lined up with conversations my father and I have had about them. Then I got passed that and found several visits to Craigslist. Some of them where just normal Craigslist offers for chairs and whatnot, although the overwhelming majority were for the M4M tab in the ""personals"" section. Referencing the dates of the visits and the day my uncle passed away it became clear that these were from him.

I'm not homophobic, I'm bi myself. Frankly I don't really give a shit that my uncle was gay/bi, he was divorced and living alone so he wasn't cheating on anyone. What I am concerned about is the rest of my family, who are very conservative. I don't believe my mother and father are homophobic to the point where they'd hate him, although I can't say the same for anyone else I'm related to and even then my parents might still judge him for it. 

His funeral is going to happen in about 2 weeks, maybe more, maybe less. I want it to go well. I want my uncle to be remembered fondly by his family. His death was very sudden so I can't say whether he planned on coming out or not, in fact those Craigslist searches might have been taken out of context and he was actually just... well I have no clue what the fuck else he would've been doing. I just don't know how to tell my family, or if I even should tell my family. 

What do I do?",29Apr2018,2
52,"This is the most pathetic shit I have ever written but alas I need advice and to be talked off a small ledge 🙄

Housesat for my aunt and uncle, in order to make sure their two boys don’t throw a party (and no one allowed over) My cousin asked if he could have 3 people over. I felt a ultra strong compulsion to be the “cool cousin” and said sure. Just said as far as everyone is concerned I’m asleep. 

He had some friends over and they had some beer and played video games. I went to bed. I seriously regret this decision. My aunt and uncle trusted me. I had one job... ONE JOB and fucked it. 

My older cousin said he’d say I was asleep and they were in the basement (feasible, it’s a big house). But my aunt and uncle are perceptive and my younger cousin will prob cave if they put any pressure under him. 

Anyway I feel dumb as shit even writing this like I’m expecting my cousins to cover for me?? Oh my god people. 

So do I just immediately come clean when I talk to them or lie low? I feel very badly about it and know this is relationship damaging. It’s on me, I’m just not sure what to do from here.

57,"Hi, I'm 39 male, and I found this new girlfriend, 32 years old and she seems to be a good match in every aspect - pretty, smart, independent, almost everything which would make a base for a lasting relationship.

Alas, after dating her for three weeks, meeting almost every day, she still doesn't want to kiss me, because kissing leads to sex, and she thinks that's too early. I get that this might be considered normal depending on culture and upbringing, but as a healthy man I have a strong sex drive, and I think good sex is a very important part of any healthy relationship, especially in the beginning. We cuddle and hug a lot, and my body reacts accordingly, but she doesn't want to go further just yet. I asked her and she says that she wants to fall in love first. Well, science and my personal experience tells me that love is largely a result of sex, and not the other way round (you can read up on Oxytocin if you don't believe that).

I think we're pretty much stuck here and I don't know what I should do. Obviously I don't want to push her to have sex because it would just feel weird for both of us. Also I don't think that she will be able to just decide to proceed some day, because I think the whole problem is her mind stopping her from following the feelings of her body - she is unable to let go. I can't be in a relationship without sex, because my body is craving for it.

Any advice?

I genuinely enjoy entertaining people and making youtube/music, I know like every other kid my age \-_-/.

I've been feeling a little sad for the past couple of months so I am looking for change of some sort.

62,"I started with a new company a month ago as a Junior Marketing Manager. There is a director of marketing, myself, and three other team members below me. 

I've spent the last month just sitting back and absorbing all sides. I met with the director individually to get info on how he runs the department. I met with the 3 other team members  to hear their frustrations and ideas for improvement. And I met with the COO to get his perspective on what could be improved in our department.

Everyone has told me that the director (my boss) is the issue. He has ADHD (seriously), so he is very disorganized and just spends all day ping ponging from topic to topic. It doesn't help that we're all in one room, so we all have to listen to him ping pong around. It's extremely distracting and confusing to the team because whatever he brings up, they think is a priority even though it's not.

Perhaps worse is I've discovered he is a huge bottleneck of information. He has one-off meetings with other departments and gets information that the marketing department desperately needs to plan and do our jobs. But he doesn't share the information he gets. We get minimal information in a disjointed way and aren't told things until the very last minute. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not. The COO told me the director has some control issues and some bad history with other departments so it could be intentional.

Anyways, in order to do my job effectively and help manage projects, I need the director to stop distracting the team and to share information. I think I need to have an honest conversation with him to share some of the feedback I've gotten from others. But I don't know how to say it professionally and productively.

65,"I(24M) have a masters degree in music performance. A year ago I decided to take some time away from a potential career in music because I felt burnt out on it. In July I started a business with my dad (whom I’ve always had a close relationship with), and a good friend of his. We sell pretty much all parts related to large scale agricultural farmers. The business has taken off and I’m bringing home a very comfortable living for myself. All signs point to business continuing to increase with me having the potential to make quite a bit more money than I already am now. 

The problem is, I just don’t enjoy being there. As much as I love my dad and his friend, they are much older than me and I don’t share a lot of common interests. Most all of our customers are in their late 50’s and so most days I don’t interact with people my age. On top of that, we are all working 7-7 M-F, and 7-1 on Saturday. My dad is a farmer and has worked these type of hours his whole life, but for me it’s just too much. I don’t feel like I have much of a life outside of work. I don’t have a ton of time to spend with my girlfriend, or friends because on top of the hours I work, I have a 30min commute to get there.

I know if I quit I wouldn’t make as much money in a new job as I am now, but at this point I don’t care. I’d rather make a little less but have more time to live life. The problem is, I just don’t know how to leave. My dad and the other owner depend on me to keep all of the tech up in the business. I don’t think they could handle it without me. In addition to this, 2 people is not enough to run the store and it’s hard to find really good employees. Then there is the fact that it’s my dad and I’m worried about our relationship if I leave. I could see myself getting back into music and teaching, and I feel like I’d enjoy that much more. I just feel stuck right now. How much should I value my personal happiness when it could adversely affect my dad? I also own a 33% stake in the business which throws a wrench into things.",29Apr2018,2
67,"I never had a girlfriend whatsoever. This post might sound like I’m being a whiny little boy, but I need some help. My experience with girls was straight up bad and some of it were just petty as hell. It seems to be a reoccurring cycle in my life and I don’t know how to stop it. This cycle is truly frustrating and it doesn’t make any sense.

Like I remember when I start crushing on girls back in elementary school and got my heartbroken by this one girl I had feelings for since when we first met in 1st grade. Then middle school was just bunch of Ls left and right with being slammed with rejection. Usually over for being “big” or “unattractive”. Most of my crushes back then act like they were into me just to waste my time. Being rejected so much caused me to go to finding girls online.

I went from apps like MeetMe to Tinder to find some chicks. Most I got from it was being catfished or being left on read and even blocked. I had a point in time when I became a so called “misogynist” just because of the treatment I get from girls. Then I start focusing on myself then boom a girl come to me. It’s like every time I focus on me, a girl comes my way and she’s just a waste of time. Either she just use me to get revenge on her ex, waste my time, or want to get male attention.

I was like “fuck this relationship stuff”. Then somehow I managed to get a lot of female friends. Most of my female friends were girls I try to talk to who wasn’t feeling me like that so they friend zoned me. Some of my guy friends are jealous at how I can get a lot of female friends, but they say that’ll be a turn off to other girls. They said it makes me appeared as “gay” or “I got hoes”. My guy friends said I should make one of my female friends my best friend or friend with benefits. The FWB thing completely failed because either she has a boyfriend or I’m not sexually attractive. The best friend thing is nothing special at all because it’s just a title and we don’t do anything that differentiates them from other female friends.

Still, i’m inexperienced in this field and i’d like to have some words of wisdom or tips that could prevent me from doing something stupid.

So I had a package delivered to my P.O box in the post office of my city, but the package arrived at a different city and a different post office, at a P.O box of the same number. I do not own this P.O box and therefore cannot claim my package. I had a call with the post office and they told me the sender must have made a mistake. I had a conversation with the sender, and I can confirm that she had indeed sent the package to the correct city. She sent me the shipping slip, and it had all the correct info. The fault is therefore (I assume) in EMS’s hands. 

I had another call with the post office and they told me that if I sent in an email with the whole story, provided with the shipping slip, that my package would be transferred to my P.O box. I did that, and am currently awaiting their reply.

International search isn’t possible, since the sender is from russia and the only way she’d be able to initiate a search is in written form at the post office. This would take months, and my package would be sent back to her by then.

So, did I do everything correctly? Any words of wisdom?

76,"I'll just start out with saying that I'm closer to my Grandma than I am my own Mom and it is just my aunt and I dealing with this and I debated on putting this on offmychest but here it is. Also that she lives in a very nice Assisted Living place but previous to this, she was very self sufficient. 


Things I want advice on:

1) If anyone has any insight on how I can help my Grandma in any way?  Maybe you've had a family member go through something similar? Physically or Mentally?

2) How did you cope when you're losing someone so important to you?


Any comments are fine, don't be mean. 


My Grandma's medical history:

- Had a surgery years ago to shorten her urinary tract
- Has degenerative bones (hurts to move)
- has kidney problems, so has a kidney specialist
- Arterial Fibulation - heart problems
- within the last two years has been having chronic, terrible bladder infections. 

With her kidney problems and bladder infections, the doctor stressed to us and her about how important it is for her to drink a ton of water.  My Aunt bought her a 20oz cup and basically begged her to drink 2 of them a day.  

She argued that it hurt too much to get up and down all night to go to the bathroom.  She said that we just don't understand how much it hurts.  My aunt and I would break down crying, begging her to drink the water.  It doesn't matter that we don't understand how much it hurts, the bottom line is that she needed to drink the water.  She promised she would.


The bladder infections got worse. We noticed about 6 months ago that she just didn't seem as sharp as normal and would repeat stuff.  Her doctor said that the infections were affecting her mind and that with antibiotics and drinking water, she would clear up. 

Well, last Friday, the assisted living place called my Aunt and said she wasn't well and was complaining of trouble breathing.  My aunt had them take her to the hospital. 

Turns out she hadn't eaten or drank anything in 3 days and her kidneys shut down. Her A-Fib was also acting up, which was causing the breathing problems.  My Aunt went into her apartment and found 20 plates of rotting food that hadn't been touched from the Assist. Living's kitchen.  She had soiled her blankets and just pushed them to the floor.  Her shower had clothes in them and obviously hadn't been used in quite some time. My aunt also found anti biotics that she hadn't been taking. 

She's been in the hospital 8 days and her kidneys are working and got a lot better for a while but have been going down hill for the past 4 days.  

Her mental state seems sharp at times as in recalling past events and stuff but then she will think that the people from her assisted living place are walking around outside her room and she has started lieing.  She'll tell you anything you want to hear to keep you from bugging her.  'Did you eat lunch?'  'Yep, it was really good.' ... she didn't eat lunch.  I called her and asked her what she was doing and she said she just had a bath.  She hasn't had a bath in a week.  (shouldn't the nurses be helping her with that?)  

And she still WILL NOT DRINK ENOUGH WATER.  And she gets all snippy when you bug her about it.  They had her drink a bottle and a half of water with some sort of solution in it in under an hour and my aunt had to badger her into it.  She said she would rather die than drink it so fast. 

Her sanitation is just... bad.  She uses a toilet right next her bed and doesn't seem to want to wash her hands.  Her nails are actually stained yellow from it... we give her hand sanitizer and she uses it but complains that its too cold. She just stays gross... I won't go into everything but she fights tooth and nail when we try to make her sanitation better.  She has an IV thing in so we can't make her take a shower. We had a small window where we could but she complained that it was too cold to do it. 


I am so angry with her.  I feel like she did this to herself by being so hard headed.  But I guess that just doesn't matter any more ... I don't know what to do... I go up to the hospital almost every day.   When she finally gets out, the assisted living people will help remind her to eat and drink water but... we can't drink it for her. 


TLDR:  My grandma is in terrible shape because she refused to drink enough water. I'm heartbroken and just broken in general.  Any advise?",29Apr2018,1

81,"So, I've been working in my current place of work for about two years now. Some details before we get into it. I'm 20 years old and this is the first job I've had. I've been working it for about 2 years now. it's partime retail.
Anyways, I think when I first started working there It was like any partime job for a teenager. I was super eager to make money so I often took shifts that my co-workers offered and even stayed overnight to help with freight when asked. Late last year around the holiday season we lost two supervisors and my boss asked if I would be willing to move up to a temporary key holder position so as to be able to help with managing the store. I agreed thinking more about raise I was getting(which only went from 8.50 to 9.00) to really think it through. Since then I've been given many tasks as a management team member. Such tasks include opening the store in the morning, talking to coaching team members, working with customers directly as a manager, etc. At first I was doing quite well and I heard my boss was even bragging to other mangers about how good I was. This upgrade to my title, the departure of two supervisors, and my boss having to leave for multiple business trips left us with 3 persons in management in the store, and this has roughly added about 20 hours extra a week to my already 30 hours. I attended college in the evening and am only available to working morning shifts, which require me to leave my home by 5:30 am and then drive 45 minutes to work and then work until 4 in the afternoon until the next supervisor can relieve me, I then proceed to class and leave there around 10 pm. Recently I've been having some trouble with sleeping and I've been late to work because I've overslept, though all day I'm very tired. My girlfriend has even pointed out to me that in the year we've been dating I went from talking about my hobbies and activities, to no stop worrying and talking about work.

84,"I'm a 19 year old female undergrad who interns in a lab with other undergraduates, graduate students, and PhD's. Around last year, I struck up a friendship with an MD/PhD who works in an adjacent lab, George. George is 45 years old, but I always thought our friendship stemmed from the fact that I spoke Spanish which is his native language, and that he felt like he was able to communicate better with me.

I was disillusioned of this last November when he told me he had feelings for me and that I should ""expect a kiss from him in the future"". I freaked out and told the graduate student I worked for (who was also a close friend), George and I had a big falling out and haven't talked for the last six months.

Recently, George approached me to iron things out and we ended up reconciling, calling a lot of what happened a misunderstanding (since I never told him he was making me uncomfortable, I just went straight to my grad student). We agreed we would go back to being friends -- I explicitly told him, ""just friends"", making it clear what I was referring to. Since then, however, things have been weird.

The very next day, I was at the lab very late, like 11pm (this may seem weird, but lots of undergrads come in to do lab work at night since we have class/other jobs during the day). I didn't realize it but George was the only other person in the lab. He comes into the room I was in, bringing me a beer (in retrospect I should NOT have drank this, because it was open, but hindsight is 20/20 and it ended up ok anyway), and we talk. It comes up somewhere in the conversation that I never went to my high school prom because I find dances uncomfortable and don't like being held that close like that.

A little later, I get up to leave, but he said I ""need to give him five minutes in his office"". I ask why, and he proceeds to put on a song on his computer and have me dance with him. He holds one of my hands and puts the other on my hip. A couple times he spins me and sort of dances while hugging me from behind. The entire time I'm shaking my head, saying that I'm uncomfortable and don't like it, but he just laughs and says its only three minutes and not the end of the world. (I will say I do have a tendency to nervous laugh, which was definitely the case here, but I did very explicitly say that I was uncomfortable). Once again, it's very late and we're the only ones on the floor. I quickly leave after the song is done, telling him I won't ever do that again. He responds ""I don't know, I can be very stubborn sometimes"". I leave feeling very gross and icky inside.

A little later he texts me asking me to coffee, I never respond. The next couple days I avoid him completely. Today I get a call from a blocked number (he knows I don't usually answer his calls) and its him, telling me he's feeling ""paranoid"" about things and just wants to make sure everything is fine, because I ""haven't been saying goodbye to him when I leave"". I told him sometimes I just don't see him and am not going to go out of my way to look for him.

So, what do I do about this? Does this constitute harassment or have I not been straightforward enough with him? He was already reported to the university when the first incident happened in November, and nothing really came of that. I want to quit the lab completely, but I really enjoy the important work that's being done there, not to mention I'll eventually need a recommendation from the lab. How do I go about this??

TL;DR: I'm a 19 year old lab intern and a 45 year old doctor has been hitting on me and being weirdly flirty for awhile, despite my attempts to tell him I'm uncomfortable. Admittedly, said attempts may not have been straightforward enough, but now I hate being at the lab.",29Apr2018,6

Mom is friends with a woman on the block. Her daughter is my age (18) and I talk with her when I see her but that's about it. When we first met we did hang out a couple times, but we both realized we're not really like each other and so we've kept more of a casual/formal relationship.

Anyways, my mom was telling her mom how she wants me to take some graduation photos, and her daughter overheard and said she could do my makeup and take pictures (she offered it for free, but I didn't want to do that).

So today she spent about 1.5 hours doing my makeup, 15 min to go to a river, an hour to take pictures, and then 15 min back to my house.

I gave her $50 (she tried giving it back but I wouldn't accept)

Later my mom told me that I should've only given her 40 and not 50. But I disagree.

So far, all I know is that they are long legged sac spiders and they are constantly popping up out of nowhere. They never used to be a problem until sometime last summer. I remember one night there were literally five or six on the ceiling.
I just don’t know where they’re coming from and I just wish I could get rid of them. I have one window in my room but I don’t think they’re coming in through there. The only other places could be through the wall plate for the coaxial  that comes from outside into my room or maybe from under the door to the hallway? It seems like they are coming from one side of the room only. They don’t seem to be that big of a problem throughout the rest of the house.

And this time when I went to talk to him (I’ve been very polite the entire time) instead of agreeing he started arguing with me—saying that we are the first neighbors in five years to say his TV is too loud, how we’re disturbing him and bringing up that we’ve only lived here for a month (which I’m not really sure what that has to do about anything? Is it a seniority thing?).

101,"Hi guys. I’m a 24 year old male virgin. Just turned 24 a week ago. I got close to losing my virginity when I was 18, but the girl chased after some other guy right before we were about to have sex lol. Anyway, ever since then I’ve developed trust issues with women I’m attracted to. In addition, I haven’t really pursued any woman since I was 18 because I hate the emotional rollercoaster of love. When I like a girl, i fall hard and can only think about her 24/7. I absolutely hate not being able to think straight and have a clear head. Also, I want to be a stand up comedian and the thought of accidentally getting a girl pregnant and not being able to follow that dream anymore is my biggest fear. Recently, I met this girl. I was streaming in twitch, believe it or not, and she came in to watch me and was immediately drawn to my personality. I really like her too. She plays video games, goes to the gym, and has a whole bunch of other things in common with me. She lives in the Bay Area, but is coming to DC and wants to meet me. I’m not sure if I should though. I’m scared of falling in love with her and losing focus on my dream. Should I take a chance and meet her? I’ve always seen myself as a dead average looking dude. However, I work at a grocery store and have caught groups of girls calling me hot and girls whispering how cute I am. I was like “damn, all the girls that I think are drop dead gorgeous and way out of my league, could I actually get them?” What do you guys think. Should I pursue women I find attractive, especially the girl I met on twitch, or should I maintain my focus on being a stand up comedian? I haven’t stepped on stage yet, but plan to soon, and already have 60 pages of jokes typed up. I just feel like my sense of humor is my gift in life and making people laugh is what I was put on this earth to do. At the grocery store I’m just a store associate making 13 an hr. I graduated from college with a management degree, but had a hard time finding a management position since I had no retail experience. I’m working for the grocery store to gain experience, but don’t want to move up with the company anymore because corporate tends to “bully” and treat managers and employees as just numbers. I got offered a job at Sherwin Williams for 50,000 a year, but am nervous to take it. I just feel like I’m too dumb to have managerial responsibilities. I make stupid mistakes sometimes and literally feel unintelligent afterwards, even though I graduated with a 3.9 gpa. Is it normal to feel dumb sometimes and beat yourself up over it? Anyway, I don’t want to be in a 9-5 my whole life. My plan is to step on stage and keep stacking money (have 20,000 saved up), so when my opportunity in comedy comes along and I can take it and not stress about money. ",29Apr2018,2

Every morning, around 5am, I am woken up by what I can only describe as the sound of a switch turning on and off by itself. It’s so loud that it genuinely wakes me up. Sometimes it’s preceeded by a “marbledrop”, that sound that’s similar to a ball dropping on a floor and which is pretty normal from what I’ve read online.

The switching sound happens about 20 times before calming down for 2-3 minutes. Then so on until about 7:30am, when it stops completely until the next day.

113,"Hello

Context:

I’m in my late twenties and I graduated college about two years ago. I grew up in a small town. I was the first person to go to college in my family. I’m first\-generation American from a low\-income family. In high school, I showed promise in design and art. I attended an expensive school. Classic story: I was young, naïve, and had a burning desire to study. That dream gave me a great education but left me with $120k debt. I don’t regret the education. It changed my life in ways I would have never imagine. I struggled but I made it through. I had the opportunity to intern abroad with a successful firm. It was a rough unpaid 8 months. I sold my car and worked a summer job to get there. The experience was invaluable and opened my eyes to a world beyond my wildest dreams. I was working with the greats. I tried my best, but they were short staffed and I sometimes couldn’t keep up. I would stay well past my hours and work weekends to get everything done. I busted my ass for the boss. After all, I was living the dream. However, I had trouble following instructions for reasons I’ll go into later. I was verbally abused many times but I stuck it through. A small price to pay for learning I would say to myself. I thought this world\-class experience would make it easier to find a job. 

I was wrong.

Since graduating in 2016, I moved back home with my parents. Isolated and working without direction I began to become depressed. After a few months I moved with my sister who lives in a major city. I found my groove and started working in restaurants determined to start my own thing. This didn’t work out. I decided to move up to an even bigger city and get a studio job. Working in random places while attempting to woo design firms with my portfolio. I managed to get an unpaid internship and that was all. After a year in the city I decide to leave. I needed to rethink my strategy. Which brings me back to living with my parents. It made sense economically.

Now: 

I have a job. I’m in control of my time here. I help manage a small local non\-profit. It pays almost nothing but it's enough to pay my loans and some rent. My home environment is not welcoming. I'm constantly being reminded of my failures. Luckily, I’m resolved to believe that I will solve this. I want to keep my head high but today it’s been especially difficult and I need help. I’ve been here for almost 5 months and I’m tired. I want to get my life started. I continue to be active. I'm competing in major competitions. I'm applying to jobs. I'm working with my schools success advisor. I'm learning how to program. I'm pushing on.

122,"I need advice! Sorry!!! This will be long. 

So my dad passed away three years ago and after his death one of my half siblings and I got into a fight and he completely stopped talking to me due to his issues with my parents will.  

I remained on good terms with my other half sibling though which is his full brother... we talk here and there but aren't particularly close.   

This week I received a phone call &amp; found out that the sibling that fought with me passed away and it's pretty much being kept a secret. I can tell that he was sick for a few months from some fb investigating. 

What do I do? I know I definitely would not be welcome to the funeral. I know his side of the family does not like me.. but how do I support the sibling that is still on good terms with me? I called but he didn't answer and never called back. 

I feel like a text message is disrespectful. Should I send a card and flowers? I feel like it would be disrespectful to send condolences when he didn't like me. Just confused on what I should do in the situation &amp; need advice. If I do send a card what do I even write....

123,"So a really good friend of mine that I knew for 10 years committed suicide on the 26th of December of 2017. This has made me feel very insecure and almost depressed. He lived 40+ minutes away from me. But the thing is he told me that we will go to Arizona to check out a school there. And we were supposed to hang out on Thursday the 28th. But I have no idea what caused him to take his life. I got the call from his aunt at 11pm on that Tuesday as I was going to bed that he is in the hospital. And my mom came in my room later and told me that his mom told her that he hung himself. I did not talk to or see him that day. But earlier that day he uploaded a Snapchat video of him watching Lord of The Rings on a Macbook Pro. And the regret I already have is why did I not talk to him on that day? That's what is bothering me about my friends death the most. Is that I wish I asked him if he wants to hang out with me on that day. But I had no idea that he was gonna do this because there were no warning signs or I did not get any feelings that he was gonna do this. But he smoked weed alot and I heard later that he took XANAX(anti-anxiety pill) and mixed it with weed and painkillers. But I am not sure if that was the cause of his death. I asked my Parents and Friends about why do I have such a regret of not reaching out to my friend that day because I wish I reached out to him and ask ""Hey wanna hang out?"" or something? But they keep telling me to not have such regrets and there was no way that I was going to prevent my friends suicide. Why do I keep feeling guilty? I miss my friend. And I wish he was still here physically. But I heard he had depression and he never told me that he actually had depression. I miss my friend and I want him to be physically here again. What do I do? On the Monday(1 day earlier) that I saw him he was completely normal I did not notice anything strange in him his suicide just completely caught me by surprise. The 25th of December of 2017 is the last time I saw my friend. The thing I am trying to figure out is why he would do such a thing and not think about his friends? Cause I miss my friend so much. I wish I talked to him on the day he killed himself but then again I had no idea that he had depression or was planning suicide. But still I can only imagine if he would've been alive if I asked him on text if he wants to hang out. My friends suicide has been tormenting me and I keep asking myself why did he take his own life? I really wish I called him up but my other friend tried to call him but he did not respond to his phone call on the day he killed himself. I have been struggling to focus in class. I keep thinking about him day and night 24/7. The thing I miss the most is hanging out with him and skating. I wish I attempted to call him up that day and it's haunting me. I've been struggling to have a piece of mind because of this. Please help. Any useful advice? I miss my friend. His decision to end his life just completely sent shockwaves through my body.

125,"So I've never asked for Internet advice before so here it goes. I'm 22 and a junior in college. I decided to take my required Spanish course this semester, and doing well so far. The thing is that I'm finding myself very sad and obsessed over my professor. She's just wonderful, intelligent, quirky, and gets a kick out of her own nerdy interests. She makes me want to grow up and go out and be somebody. I just admire her so much. Basically I'm sorta of a secret admirer, since I'm an introvert and don't talk much, but she does make a conscious effort to interact with all students, so we've had our short, professional moments. 

I find it very difficult to find anyone to get excited about these days. Her brightness is something people just don't have a lot of the time. I've just become so enamored with her. To top it off she's only like 25, so I don't know, my silly romanticizing brain wants to believe I could have a chance. I'd like to think I'm not horrible looking. I mean girls liked me in high school..?? No luck with women since then though. I'm introverted and awkward AND she's taken, and moving to a different state after this semester.  

Why is that I find someone so wonderful and she has to be taken? After this week I'll never see her again. I wish there was something I could do or say. I thought about writing her a note or something (no, I'm not planning on putting my phone number on it), something short and classy ,so she'll at least know that this quiet weird kid appreciated her. Is this a bad idea? Will she even care? 

And yes, I totally get that this is kind of silly, but I can't help how I feel. I just can't get her out of my mind.  I'm not typically this naive, but I have a very romantic heart, and maybe I'm too much of a dreamer. The sad thing is that this situation is making me realize that life is not some romantic movie, and she won't come running away with me. I just don't know how to deal with this.",29Apr2018,1
126,"My best friend (21M) has been married to a girl (21f), for a little under a year, and she’s been getting increasingly emotionally abusive and manipulative over the last six months, even to go as far as to say he can’t hang out with me and another close friend of ours, and trying to make him quit several hobbies he enjoys, and drop out of college. 
He’s normally a really happy and outgoing person, and I’ve noticed he’s been withdrawn and making excuses to avoid hanging out with us “so she doesn’t get upset”. 
She regularly threatens divorce as way to control him, and kicked him out a few days ago. 
Since she’s kicked him out, a friend of ours has been saying she’s been talking about a guy a lot at work that she has an interest in, and she admitted to kissing him “a few times”.  She also told me (19f) that she was in love with me about four months ago, and that’s why she doesn’t like him anymore, but since she’s claimed she only said that to manipulate him to stop talking to me. 
I’m very worried about him, and I’ve told him multiple times that I support whatever makes him happy as long as he’s safe.
She asked him to come back after the guy rejected her, and when he said no she threatened suicide, and said she was going to hurt herself in other ways. 
I wouldn’t normally post about this, but it hurts to see my best friend going through I went through with my ex fiancé. I know from experience that being stuck in this loop isn’t healthy, and he does too, but he wants to try and make things work. 
I’m not sure what else I can say to him to try and help him through this either way.

133,"I only ever go after girls that I can reasonably court. Along with that, I have a very specific preference in the girls I like. I have plenty of friends, in fact I have too many. Even with that I'm still almost entirely handicapped speaking with women I find attractive. I've had one girlfriend in my entire life and was madly attracted to her, she sadly *cheated* on me (I didn't know) and to get out of our relationship she lied to all of mine and her friends that I had tried to rape her. After being horrified for the past two and a half years over that I've finally settled to actually having a crush on someone again. I've finally been, for a lack of words, inducted into my crushes friend group and am now able to actually interact more with her. Getting to know her she seems to be the first girl I know who actually shares the same tastes and values as me. I tend to overthink things and I can't help but focus on how I get mixed messages from her with my attempts to flirt. Now I'm afraid that she doesn't like my flirting or she finds me creepy and my whole new group of friends thinks I'm just crazy because I cannot stand the thought of people not liking me. Right now in the middle of the night im completely fearful for the rest of my life, what if I end up not marrying until I'm in my 30's.

134,"I'm posting here in hopes to see other perspectives and possibly help me decide how to deal with this mean neighbor.  
  
It's a older couple who owns a house next door from us, us is me and my girlfriend who pay rent. Me and her just live our lifes for the most part and don't really pay attention to anyone around us, we had no idea these people didn't like us but my sister did warn me about them because she use to live here prior. She told me they are very nosy and are the type to always stare out their window and are just generally judgemental.  
  
Anyways the 'beef' all started like 5 months ago, one day it was below freezing outside, girlfriend let the dog go out to the bathroom real quick and he pooped near the gutter apart of their sidewalk and didn't pick it up. It was an honest mistake but one day her mom came to pick her up and the neighbors confronted the mother about that poop incident which I thought was pretty sad because they should have just confronted us but whatever, it was dealt with. From that point on you can feel their negative energy all the time, they even called the cops on us because my girlfriend parked the car in front of the fire hydrant on the block for 2 hours to rest before continuing to look for parking.  
  
But anyways yesterday was the 'bully' incident. His wife made some kind of comment about me and my girlfriend and our dog so I confronted her to talk about what her problem with us is, remind you I'm just some skinny guy who does honestly look weak. We were pretty much arguing because I was trying to explain to her something about dog phycology that she didn't understand because I do have experience working with animals and I knew she was wrong in this case and whilst this little argument her husband comes storming outside and gets all in my face all pumped up belittling me. He talked down to me and it did hurt me inside because I don't know how to stand up for myself as I use to always be bullied as a child. It was obvious he wanted to start a fight but I'm not a fighter so i just sucked it in. After his rage was over I tried talking to him ""hey man what's your problem dude, let's just talk about it"" and when I speak in a civil manner he is unwilling to compromise. He only talked when he was raging, so he ignored me and went back home and now I am stuck with this negative energy because whatever this problem is, it feels like it's not settled so I Don't know what to do....  
  
Deep down I feel like I should confront him again and just talk like a normal human but what if he gets loud with me again? do I stand my ground despite him being more in shape?  
  
Or do I just generally ignore them even though they will continue to talk bad about us and emit this negative energy?

135,"I'm a 21 year old female and I met this 25 year old man at our mutual friend's birthday party a few months back. He seemed friendly but we didn't talk much. He added me on Instagram and will comment on my posts sometimes (nothing flirtatious). Yesterday he mentioned how he's the only person who hasn't seen Avengers. I replied ""you're not alone."" So he asked if I wanted to go see it with him and I jokingly said ""sure"" because I thought he lived in the Philippines so I didn't think he was serious. Turns out, he lives here and I just misheard my friend at her party when she said that his girlfriend lives in the Philippines. He seemed really excited though and even said, ""I finally have someone to go to the movies with!"" which confused me. Why didn't he have anyone he could go with? He also wants to grab dinner beforehand. I'm really not interested in anything other than a platonic relationship with him but even that is off-putting. I think this is because most men who ask me out to things like this, even after I make sure they know I'm not interested in them that way, still try to make a move. My gut tells me this is one of those times. Am I being paranoid? Do you think he really just wants someone to go see Avengers with? If a man asks you out to a movie, would you think there's a chance that it's platonic? I'm concerned with how excited and surprised he was. He already bought the tickets",29Apr2018,2

My biggest issue now is that I lose things ALL THE TIME! I forget things A LOT! I'm like Ben Stiller in The Life of Walter Mitty when I space out and have insane scenarios in my head. It's really frustrating having to spend 10 minutes looking for my car keys when I have to hurry and get to work. As a result, people are often very frustrated with me and everyone in my life, whether older or younger, have bullied me, lectured me, yelled at me, and generally made me feel like a responsibility rather than a friend.

I feel like a pushover at my new job. I am afraid that this might cost me my job, but I don't let myself stress over getting fired because it's not worth it and I'm not doing too bad anymore.

My father doesn’t want me marrying this guy because he doesn’t have a job yet. And my dad feels like he doesn’t have the potential to grow or be successful.

2. My dad doesn’t approve. At all.

One night me and this colleague decided to go to the pub for one drink after work we ended up bar hopping all over the place she then invited me back to her flat to continue drinking (we didn't stop until the sun rose)

I'm not sure how it came up but we started talking about our girl crushes and I described three celebrities I found attractive they were all brunette Caucasians like my colleague. My colleague replied ""next you are going to say me"" this put me on the spot, I ignored her question but then she repeated her question on three separate occasions, I just laughed it off. She was very flirty that night and telling me stuff she never tells anyone. (She's a closed book) she has never had a bf and needs to drink a bottle of wine before she goes on a date with guys. She also said she came out to her parents as a joke, which thought was odd!

We both decided we would go to a gay bar in the future for a laugh. Monday comes and I thanked my colleague for Friday night she said she had a good time and then said we should go to a gay bar on the DL. 

It's now summer and we are going out for drinks often just me and her. We went to the pub we both got very drunk. We were on the train home and she summons me off the train to sit at the platform, she was asking me very leading questions ""do I fancy this girl at work, do I fancy that girl at work"" she then asked if I fancied her. I was very drunk and I said yes and that I sometimes had butterflies in her presence she laughed hysterically 

The next day my colleagues were having a big night out and she completely ignored me all night and wouldn't look me in the eye. I sent her a message the following day asking if we could meet on Monday. We go to the pub she then told me she finds our friendship too intense she was shocked and disgusted by what I said and said we should keep our distance. For 8 months this girl ignored me completely she would never look me in the eye. I was devastated and it took me a long time to get over her. I eventually moved on and started dating one guy whom I liked very very much 

Last week we had a work drinks and she came out, she was getting drunk, then started speaking to me I was very shocked, we've had no contact whatsoever for months( all my attempts to reach out to her went unanswered). All our colleagues leave it's just me and this girl. We decide to go to a wine bar, we stayed out drinking till 2am I decided to get in an uber and told my colleague she was welcome to hop in we get to her flat and she asked if I would like to come in for some wine (it was 2.30am and we had work the following day) we started speaking about why we fell out and about her family problems. She said she didn't hate me and missed my company but she didn't know how to handle the situation. I told her some really personal stuff (strict catholic up bringing, her father is misogynistic and she doesn't get in with her parents) We then both passed out on the sofa cuddling. 

The next day we wake up for work. She couldn't look me in the eye and screamed at me to leave her flat immediately. I saw her at work that day but she completely ignored me again couldn't look me in the eye and literally ran away when she saw me. I sent her a message but she just ignored it

These things have always interfered with my life, but have never caused tremendous problems or roadblocks until now.

I wonder if it's just a matter of growing up and having to face life, meaning, life getting harder and harder because it does as one grows up, and then the difficulties these issues cause, becoming more pronounced. 

Or if these problems are more like diseases, in the way that they get progressively worse, and things that I've always been able to handle, becoming more difficult to handle.

Do mental health issues emerge, and get worse because that is their natural progression or tendency? Do mental health issues and the problems they cause become more pronounced as you grow older because you have more responsibilities and life becomes more difficult with less dependence on parents?

Or have my issues become worse because of the choices I've made? If so, what choices did I make that led me down this path?",29Apr2018,5

So in my class we are a total of fifty eight students. About twenty of those are part of the biggest friends group in our class. Almost all of them pretend to be my friends in school but don’t want to hang out with me if they don’t have to.

They talk about going out, eating etc in front of me without inviting me and I have to ask if I can come and they say yes but even then it is awkward and I can tell that they don’t want me there.They pretend to be friends with me but when there is a fight or whatever no one takes my side and they immediately start talking shit. 

They get tired of their facade and just say everything they think about me. And here’s the kicker, after the fight where they fucked me over and supported someone else they go right back to pretending to be my friends again. 

I only have around three real friends. Two of them are part of the group and are better friends with some people in the group than me but are still friends with me and I can tell that they are real. 

They support me in fights, they invite me to go out with the group and even when I am invited they still don’t want me there but try to play it off. They invite me to go out alone with them, they invite me home to hangout, they introduce me to their family members, they see how everybody else in the group are fake towards me and they help. They talk to me about it and tell me what they think about the people.

They are just great people and I want to know more great people. The third friend isn’t friend with most people in the group but he is friends with the other two. He is my very best and closest friend that understands how I feel. 

Anyway, how do I deal with these fake friends?",29Apr2018,1

161,"So, I’ve known my bf for about 6 months now, we met at a party and that’s it. Now, 3 months ago we started dating, everything went fairly quickly as I do think we’ve liked each other for a very very long time prior to anything. 

Now, I live with my parents (Gap year waiting for uni to start/move out in August 2018), and they give me a lot of liberty (I just go do whatever whenever), but do ask about my life out of interest. Therefore, I’ve been lying about my whereabouts to not tell them I was in fact going to my bf’s place. 

Note: I’ve been living with my dad and stepmom for the past year in Europe, while, previously, I lived with my mom in South America (where she is from). My dad and I went 7 years without seeing each other and, although we are in a good place, our relationship has been severely compromised by that. Nasty divorce as well. 

Now, I’ve taken the lie too far, my family in SA knows about my bf but I haven’t got a clue of how to tell my European parents about him without compromising their trust in me. I am terrified I’ve screwed over our relationship (by that I mean with me and my parents). I am also scared of how that will affect my study, will they even allow me to move out to go to uni after this? I would like to get some advice on how to tell them without screwing everything up. 

TL,DR: I’m scared my parents will lose their trust in me because I’ve been lying about where I’ve been hanging out for the past 3 months to hang out with my bf. I am even more scared they will not allow me to move out for uni when it starts (September).

164,"Hi,

Thanks in advance if you take the time to read this. It's currently 430am and im at work so forgive me for any typos or formatting errors.

Let me preface by saying I'm a 23 year old college student who just got accepted as a transfer student into HSU this last week to get my BS in soil science.

But that wont happen if i keep doing what i'm doing - which is why I'm here. 

I'm currently a full time student at my CC and working 40 hours a week at a side job. This side job requires i wake up at 345am most days to get to my work by 445am.

I've only had this job for a month, I originally acquired it bc i ran out of financial aid options for this semester - community colleges are very limited in financial aid options even for low income students in california. 

Its starting to take a toll on my school - i have a mountain of homework for my calc class i havent touched yet, two exams this week, and finals in two weeks. 

All i have time for with this shit is to work, eat, and sleep. Ive tried talking to my manager about it but i'm ""the only opener"" so changing my schedule was out of the question.

I feel stuck. I almost didnt come in this morning because I'm starting to get sick from such lack of sleep.

At the same time - i need the money to pay my bills (car, cellphone, insurance, credit cards). 

So what do I do? As of right now I'm 98% committed to quitting at the end of my shift today. I foresee myself bombing my finals if this keeps up, and I don't want to put myself even further behind than i already am.

Thanks",29Apr2018,3
165,"I'm almost 17, with a ""superior-very high"" IQ and I wasted a lot of my time. I say wasted because I didn't do what will impact my future. During my childhood I used to play a lot of games and hang out with a lot of wrong people. I was a bad-average student in school (bad in all things, especially math and my native language). Then, during my teen years, I used to play basketball and I was quite good, thought I was gonna be a pro, but I had to quit, just because of the illness that I got, which made me sad. But it wasn't that heart-breaking because I started learning programming, which I thought is very cool. That lead me to start learning mathematics from the basic concepts and after a year I was the first in math and a top 10 student in my school from all the things there were. However I still lack basic knowledge in math, so I study it almost everyday and I sometimes get burned out of it, but I persist. Maybe I would be a top 1 student in my school, but I'm very bad at my native language. I have the lowest grade out of all of the subjects that I'm studying, so the average grade gets lowered a lot because of it, which makes me not a top 1 student in school. So I really gotta start learning it. Because without it, I won't be able to get into an university for free and that'll be bad because my parents aren't rich. Anyways, I somehow have very good grades in science, but I still want to learn about physics, chemistry from the basic concepts too, even though I won't even need those things in my future. I guess I'm a maximalist, very egoistic and curious. In my future I see myself as a programmer, but I don't know what I'd be programming. I'm kinda interested in games, because I think of myself as creative, but I'd also want to do something related to artificial intelligence, but how you already know I lack basic knowledge in almost all the things, so I don't know how I'd become an artificial intelligence specialist. Honestly, I just want to be somewhere, where I can make some kind of an impact to the world, be useful in some kind of way, just be in the technology field I guess. I don't know if I can make any of this happen because I've started programming and learning mathematics not so long ago so I'm not one of those prodigy progamming kids, which will potentially take the opportunities from me and because of my fault. I'm scared to progress and I don't know where I should focus. I know that I must do things that will greatly impact my future life, but for some reason, I can't start. So I just think about existence almost everyday and about the opportunities wasted. I have some dreams (they're NOT dreams about having houses and cars), but they're not achievable if I don't become extraordinary in any of the things. And it's hard for me to imagine me going to a monotonous work, where I can't fully express myself. I'd rather not live if that ever happens. I don't know if I have enough time left to achieve something before university. I need help! I'll take any advice you give and I'll try to change myself, my current state of being, but I'm not sure if there's enough time left for me to do that.

Despite doing ok in uni and her part time job, she struggles with basic things - sometimes she'll forgo food for 2 days if I forget to feed her. In general, she very often says how she used to be better at everything and how she changed for the worse. She cries about 3 times a week.

I tried talking her into seeking professional help, but she doesn't think anything will come of it.
I tried getting her to exercise together, but that doesn't seem to work either.

169,"I’ll start from the beginning. He always came in the shop but would never say a word to me. I always found him strange and quite frankly annoying when he wouldn’t answer me when I asked if he wanted a bag etc. One day he walks in. I ask him if he wants a bag and he doesn’t answer then he says this:
Him: “were those your brothers you were at the park with?” (I’d been to the park a few days prior and hadn’t seen him. Clearly he’d been watching).
Me: no my nephews
Him:
Him: do you live on this estate?
Me: yes
Him: do you live with your parents
Me: yes... (not knowing where this conversation was going).
Him: you live in *insert street name next to my street* don’t you?
Me: yes (I lied. I live in the street next to it but I was so shocked I wasn’t about to correct him). 
Him: do you want to hang out sometime.
Me: no!
Him: do you have a boyfriend
Me: yes (a lie)
Him: okay *then walks out without saying another word*

After that he came in the shop and apologised for asking me out (not for his invasive questions). Since then I haven’t spoken to him in the hopes he’d get lost.
Although I was wrong. I’ve later seen him in my street twice. 
Once I got off a bus and saw him walking into my street. In the 19 years I’ve lived there he’s never once come into my street EVER. I phoned my mam straight away and told her to watch out for him as he went passed the window. In the mean time I hid behind vans and watched him. He was looking around at all the houses (probably hoping to see me). The second time he actually came to my door. He pushed a news paper through my letter box (his brother delivers papers and I assume he was helping him?). I shit myself and hid. He also walks past the shop window regularly and looks inside to check if I’m working. 

So not only has he watched me when I’m out but now he’s trying to find my house as-well. I’ve made sure all my family know about him incase I ever go missing or worse. 
Some of you might think I didn’t have to answer his questions but at the time I’d never been in that situation and I’m not very good at communicating. So I honestly didn’t know what to say and I know now I’d never answer those questions again if a stranger asked them. ",29Apr2018,7

I live in the Midwestern United States and work as an engineer at an aerospace engineering company. I've been here for nearly 4 years after moved here from Philly (where I'm from originally after graduating and growing up there).

I recently just received an offer to work at another division of my company in New England. I'm struggling to determine whether or not I should take it.

Reasons to stay:
1.) I have friends here. Not sure if I want to do that all over again at the age of 26
2.) It's familiar
3.) The outdoor and hobby scene is OK
4.) My job is ok. Not as challenging as I would want but I know I could be successful if I stuck around.
5.) Cost of living is very low relative to my income

The reasons to go:
1.) 3 hours from home / college friends as opposed to 9 now (that's the difference between a drive home after work, and a whole day of driving in my mind)
2.) New job seems challenging. But admittedly similar to my current role (in terms of what I would be doing)
3.) The outdoors there are awesome and I think I can still do my hobbies.
4.) It's a fresh start.

173,"Background Story: A group of (5 guys,including myself) occasionally go to the bar for a few drinks every other weekend or so depending on everyone's school schedule. One friend, Albert, is a piece of shit who's unbearable when he's drunk. He's the typical asshole who grows proportionally worse as he drinks.

Main Story: To forget about all my upcoming exams this weekend, I decide to go out with another group of friends and dance the night away. At the bar, I run into Albert and another friend from our 5 man group. Albert is immediately pissed that I went out with another group when I had denied him the day before. He then proceeds to bring up an incident in which I got in a fight with some other shit head we know. In that fight, being the person I am, I decided to break it up and not continuing fighting since I'm not the type to fight. That shit head, we can call him Alex, told Albert that I got ""beat"" and so Albert repeatedly said he would gladly call him to do it again. Trying to be the bigger man, I brushed it off and walked away. 

My issue at the moment is that I see both Albert and Alex occasionally because we all live in a series of houses owned by non-profit organization. These houses are all in a cul-de-sac. What I don't understand is how I should deal with this issue?

-Should I go to Albert and kick his ass but potentially lose my scholarship home?

-Should I stay calm and simply ignore Alex and Albert who graduates in one week?

-Confront Alex who's making me look like a loser to the friends that we know?

Genuinely going through scenarios in my head of what else I could have done to avoid this and what would be the best way to approach people like these teens.

I'm 20, female by the way. Currently in my final year of university.

Specifically, I have never received a job, position of responsibility, university place etc which I was interviewed for. I get incredibly nervous about interviews, even thinking about them, and when in the interview, often it might even feel like it's going really well, but I'll come out and realise I said exactly the thing that I wasn't supposed to say. I know what employers want to hear, I know I'm a hard worker, I know I'm smart enough to be good at a job, I just find it really difficult to sell myself. Being rejected from jobs makes me less inclined to apply for more things, through fear of rejection, and fear of spending so much time applying, travelling to interview, just for another rejection. The worst part is that even though I KNOW I should, I never ask interviewers for feedback. I'm worried it would knock my confidence too much to hear it, and I feel like I know what I did wrong on each occasion.

I've realised this pattern crops up in the rest of my life too. I'm scared to talk to a guy I'm interested in because I'm worried he will reject me. I was thinking about going travelling next year but I'm too scared that something will go wrong. I usually don't suggest movies, music, restaurants to anyone because I'm worried they won't like my suggestion and I'll look stupid.

I told him that it was not going to be like last time and that I was able to be cool this time around based on the fact that I’ve matured and was able to see how I behaved in retrospect. Well after we met up, his emails died off. For some reason, it felt like we ran out of things to talk about. I asked him why this was happening. Why were we emailing every day for a month until we met up and now all of a sudden, the conversation stops? His answer was that because it was a build up of excitement and after the excitement happened, there had to be moments where we don’t talk so that the next time we meet up, it’s exciting again. I kind of get what he’s saying but it just feels wrong to me. Like I’m trying to be cool and laid back and not needy but it just doesn’t feel right that we just meet up for sex and then there is not much to say in between, when there was before we met up. He’s honest about how it seems like he is just using me, but he says that is not his intention.
I guess I am finding myself unable to be as cool as I thought I could be. Like right where I was 2 years ago when this first ended. I don’t want to be needy or high maintenance but I guess I just am! I just want to have someone to fuck and not care if he talks to me in between but I’m finding it difficult to be ok with that. So his red flags are making me want raise my white flag, but then I won’t have anyone to fuck. Why can’t I just be cool???",29Apr2018,0

191,"Hey guys, posting from a throwaway because some people know my main:

So, me (18/M) and my girlfriend (17/F) have been dating for about a year and a half and are both going to college in the fall, but different colleges around 2 hours away, and my college does not allow freshman to have cars on campus. Also, I'm working almost all summer, and she is leaving around late June to see her family for a month, then heading straight to college after that. 

The thing is, I'm just not sure what to do. This might sound suuuper cheesy, especially coming from a high school kid, but I feel like we've made a legitimate connection in the year and a half that we've been together. We haven't had any arguments in the time we've been dating, her family really likes me and vice versa, and just its been pretty damn perfect the entire time we've been dating.

So since we're going to seperate colleges and its going to be hard to see each other, what should I do? Facetiming/calling is an option, but I know there are other fish in the sea that will be closer to where I am, but I just want to hear what you guys would have to say.

Thanks in advance.",29Apr2018,1
192,"I come home this morning from my friend's house sleep deprived and slightly hungover. I took my recently bought breakfast burrito to the living room to watch some TV/relax. As I'm walking over, my dad(70) tells me to eat at the table with him. ""We need to talk about something"". ""You have a sister"" he says matter of factly. At first I take this as a joke and dismiss it, but as he elaborates I start to believe him. His cousin, who he hadn't been in contact with since his adolescence, informed him a few weeks ago that he might have a child. He took a DNA test and it turns out he has a 50 year old Hawaiian daughter. This happened when he was in his 20s. The woman never informed him. 

This was before my mom and dad were together. My mom seems fine with it. I didn't show any emotion through the talk. *I'm not sure how I should feel about the situation*. I've been an only child my whole life - with my closest relatives being in a different country. This event might change my personal identity and my overall view of my father. I'm pretty self-conscious of my dads age. I find it weird that I have a 70 year old dad and ~ 50 year old sister.  My mom is also fucking 50. Is this situation something I should be upset about? I don't really want to talk to my friends or parents about this. Writing this is sort of a personal therapy session, thanks for reading. Any input is appreciated.

194,"To start off with, I never really liked school growing up. I finished high school with an ATAR of 58 (I’m Australian, highest ATAR is 99.95 I believe) and like most people just out of high school, I had no idea I wanted to do. I studied engineering and metal work during high school and loved both of those subjects. 

At the time I finished high school I wanted to try to get into uni doing an engineering course because I was always told it was different to high school so I should enjoy it more. Since I didn’t have a high enough ATAR to get into the engineering course I had to go into the university’s college program to prove to them I was serious and had the knowledge to get into uni. This took a year and I successfully completed it, so the following uni I started my engineering course, started out great and got an average of 65-70/100 in my subjects, then into the second semester of engineering and my mental health just fell apart, I decided to withdraw from my subjects and take a break, over the summer I completed a maths subject related to my course and I went back into the following semester (at this stage it was technically 3rd overall year at uni including the college). Once again my mental health broke down again and I did some thinking and decided to change into a commerce degree as this relates heavily to my current job which doesn’t require a degree but would be useful, I love this commerce degree I’m doing and I successfully completed my first semester in it, not I’m in the second semester and the stress of it all is unbelievable, I no longer want to attend university. 

I have a massive debt due to the studies, but I’ve also been offered a full time job, which I can repay my debts with. I have no idea what I should do, but every day that passes while I’m studying at uni causes me to have anxiety attacks and episodes of depression, I’ve also been on medication for this for a year now and I find when I’m not studying at uni I don’t experience any of the depression or anxiety. I will most like end up leaving university, but I would like to hear some opinions. I don’t want to make a mistake. ",29Apr2018,3

196,"Okay this is going to be long so I’ll apologize now. I’ll also try to be as detailed as I can be. So on Monday of last week my boyfriend totaled his car. He was turning left and he had almost finished his turn when a motorcyclist t-boned his back passenger door, totaling both the cars. There was a witness who stopped to tell the police she did not see the motorcyclist. There were also no skid marks in the road and my boyfriend said he didn’t hear a honk. From the position of his car in the road, it seems like the motorcyclist wasn’t paying attention and failed to try to yield to my boyfriend, who was already over halfway done with his turn and about to pull into the street out of the way of oncoming traffic. His insurance company has been contacting his step dad and not my boyfriend so all the information I know is what my boyfriend has gotten from his step dad. The insurance company advised them to take my boyfriend off of his parents insurance plan because they were almost certain the other guy would try to sue and if my boyfriend has his own policy, he wouldn’t be able to sue for nearly as much. The other guy has a broken leg, something punctured in his throat, and a totaled car but was stabilized in the ambulance and has remained so. My boyfriend is okay but has a totaled car as well. His insurance was able to provide him a rental car for around 40 days. His insurance company is saying it’s possible that the other party will try to sue for more than the 25,000 of what his new policy will be worth and then he will have to file for bankruptcy. I’ve asked a few friends because I am worried but I seem to be getting more confused. Is this true? I thought it was the insurance company’s job to try to get the other guy to settle for as little as possible; why would they agree to settle for so much that my boyfriend will have to go to such far lengths as to have to declare bankruptcy? To what extent will the insurance company go to try to prove my boyfriend was not at fault? We both currently live at home but we’re planning to move out in about a year once done with school; this plan will be ruined if he does have to file for bankruptcy. Do you think we have anything to be worried about? My friend keeps telling me the insurance company will take care of it and will not be quick to settle for any amount of money the guy wants. My boyfriend also mentioned that he will only get about half of the money his car is worth but i’m not sure why he wouldn’t get all of it (it’s worth about 10,000 on kelley blue book). There is also a traffic light about a block before the accident happened as we believe the motorcyclist was speeding. Is it possible for the insurance company, or even the police, to try to retrieve these tapes to see if he was actually speeding? What will happen if he does have to file for bankruptcy? Will it be as bad as I or my boyfriend anticipate? We also live in California. Not that this is related to the case, but my boyfriend and I are both struggling with mental health a little bit. Him more so than me that he started to see a counselor but hasn’t gone back since the accident. I’m worried so much that it leaves me too braindead to focus on my schoolwork or my job. If anyone has been in a similar situation it would mean more than i can ever have words to explain if you can try to help. I know no one here can tell us exactly what will happen. Im just looking for someone who may have experience and possibly be able to ease my mind. The unknown is terrifying and it seems as though this accident was not by the fault of my boyfriend. It would crush both of us for his future to temporarily be derailed because of this guy on the motorcycle. I don’t understand why he can’t just apply for disability while his broken leg is healing and can’t work; it also seems like the insurance company (which is a small one I believe) seems to be making everything so much more difficult.

198,"So here's my situation...

I never knew my father. I was born to a single mother, and that was my family until I was six. Then my Mom married my stepfather and had a kid with him, my half-brother. 

Fast forward to today. I am 30 years old, and my mother has never been clear on who my actual father is. I took the ancestry.com DNA test to determine what nationalities I am (because I didn't know half my genetics). I logged on the site 3 days after I got the results. Then, I click DNA matches (which finds others who took the test, and determines if they are related to you). And what do you know, the first person on that list it literally said 'blah blah is your father'.  And he logged in 3 days ago, which leads me to believe he knows about the results. Now, I need to talk to my mom, which I am doing today. I don't know how to process this information. I kind of thought I was fatherless and that's it. Having an actual father kind of scares me. I don't know if he knew about me or not, but he must have seen that I was his child.

Has anyone else been in this situation? If so, how did they handle it? My mom always said, ""she didn't know who my father was""- it could be one of two men. I guess I know now lol. I'm not sure if I want to make contact, it really depends on whether he actually knew of me or not. Thanks! Any help would be appreciated.

199,"So I (19 M) and my ex (18 F) broke up like four months ago due to long distance college issues. Specifically: We got in an argument and broke up. She got upset, her friends took her out and left her drunk and alone with a guy, which she came directly to me about the next morning because she felt “dirty and guilty”. We haven’t talked really in those four months, but right now we’re home for summer and she won’t stop sending me memes and idk what to do. She’s obviously trying to get my attention and probably wants to talk, but idk. It was a pretty rough breakup for me and I’m still not completely over her. It just sucked because she goes out partying a lot, and now I know she’s easily separated from her friends - and I don’t really believe in that whole “I was drunk” excuse.  Despite going out with new girls, I still think about her everyday and how much I want her and I to work out...

I could be overthinking, and maybe she’s just trying to be friends - but so far, I’ve just left her on read. I don’t watch her snapchat stories either, and she’s told me that she always checks for my name out of the ~250 that watch her story. She just keeps sending me stuff like she’s craving attention from me and is getting frustrated that I won’t give it.

Keep in mind that our relationship existed over social media for 7 months, im not trying to sound like some person that’s obsessed with it, that’s just how I kept in touch with her. The memes she sends are very bad too if that has anything to do with it... they’re not even funny lol.

202,"Our family is absolutely devastated... 

A little back story to the situation:

My mother is a devout Mormon. No sex before marriage, no alcohol, the whole thing. My parents have been married for 26 years. There have been ups and downs like there are in most marriages, but recent events have unfolded that are terrible, dark truths. And we are all struggling to figure out how to handle this. 

About 1 year ago my mother did one of those ancestry DNA tests where it says where your ancestors came from and other interesting bits of information. Well, she got one of those tests for herself, and one for each of her parents. When the results came in, she was given information she didn’t expect... the man she thought was her father, was not her father. Her mother had cheated on him and conceived my mother in a one night stand. Through a little digging on ancestry, she was able to determine that her father was between four brothers. (One of the brothers had taken an ancestry test, and she was matched to him as an uncle). She contacted him and he reached out to each of his brothers, and they all agreed to take an ancestry test to determine who her father was. 

A few weeks go by, and she apparently had been talking to her newly found biological uncle everyday via email and texting. They had the beginnings of a relationship, and my family just thought “wow, that’s nice that she’s getting to know that side of her family”. She finds out the the oldest of the four brothers is her father, and she flies out to meet him. She spends a few days there, and comes home. When we asked her how It was, she said something to the effect of “I really like him, but I don’t feel the same connection as I do with my uncle”

She continues talking to this uncle, and he invited her to fly out to Vietnam where he was going to do some sightseeing and sort of document different places he went while he was there during the war. She happily obliged, which we thought was a little strange because she NEVER travels. She hadn’t even left the United States before this trip, and she is 45. A few weeks after that trip, she then flew out to visit her uncle in his town.

Anyways... she just confessed to the whole family that she started sleeping with him while they were on that trip to Vietnam. And also when she went out to visit him. Her biological uncle. Is that as bad as I think It is? Because I think It is absolutely disgusting. We have all decided that It would be best to cut her off, and only allow her back into our lives if she were to seek psychiatric treatment. We have given her many opportunities to throw down her pride, and let us help her. She always turns It down, and blames my father for her actions. She threw away all of her values to sleep with her biological uncle who is about 30 years older than her... She says they are in love, and he’s getting a divorce too so that they can get married. And the real kicker to the whole thing... she says “The Lord is cool with it” LOL. Okay.

Do you think we are doing the right thing? What would you guys do in this situation?

TLDR; my mom cheated on my dad with her 72 year old biological uncle. After countless offerings of help, we’ve decided to cut her off and allow no contact until she has sought the psychiatric help she clearly needs. ",29Apr2018,2

One of my oldest and closest friends is married with three kids, the latest only a year old. We've been friends since we were toddlers, and I'm Godfather to his firstborn.

During his life his relationships have been more or less disastrous, with the exception of his latest, which led to marriage some years back. Overall it's working great between them.

He and his wife have four kids to date, all boys, and three of them are carbon copies for him both visually and in personality. The fourth and latest one looks nothing like him. While the other three are all blonde and blue eyes the fourth is a brunette. 

This probably wouldn't have made me suspicious, but the kid looks nothing like him. Instead he's a dead ringer for one of his wife's childhood friends, whom I've met on various occasions. At first the was a slight resemblance, but as the kid grows he looks more and more like the guy, and I'm staying to get convinced that it's not actually my friends child.

Both my friend and the other guy have a couple of fairly distinct facial features not share by eachother, and the first three kids have my friend's, while the last one the other guy's.

Concidering the history, what should I do? I don't know if I can tell him of my suspicions without it backfiring and ending our friendship, or just plain running his life.

He’s the kind of person who swears he’s coming to see us, me and my brother, but almost never shows. The problem isn’t in the fact that he never appears but that he doesn’t show, so naturally instead of waiting for him you make other plans, then micracously one day when he says he’s coming he shows, but you’ve gotten so used to him not coming you have other plans so when you get mad about it the first thing he says ‘the time I came you were too busy’

My family encourages this behavior. I no longer have contact with my father and refuse to have anything to do with him because of his lies and bullshit. 

Instead of blaming him, they tell me it’s my fault, they tell me I’m expecting too much from him, they point at me and tell me it’s my issues and my problems letting him live in a fantasy world where he does no wrong.

At this point the tables have been turned once again. I’m doing wrong by wanting nothing to do with him, I’m just mad because he won’t do what I want, he’s the martyr whose ungrateful daughter cut him off and blame him for everything wrong in my life.... that is how my family sees it and tells me.

I have issues with men now. Despite me being sweet and kind I can never keep a guys interest until we have sex then the distance starts and I end up abanonded time and again. I don’t get mad over little things and don’t freak. I get mad when they stand me up, and I fear sex at this point because every time I’ve done it they claim it’s good but then they end up disappearing. 

I feel like a prisoner in my own home. The manipulation of my family has led to depression and severe mental illness. I see the problems clear as day and they only make up excuses and refuse to listen to anything I have to say.

The ignorance of men doing wrong and then turning it back on me has been done so often I made plans to have sperm donation done when I’m ready to have kids, am planning on moving to another state and changing my phone number once there, and am ready to spend the rest of my life alone because I can’t handle the bullshit of people.

A major example is a dog my dad dropped off at my uncles. Said he would be here for two weeks.....a year ago. He never gave the animal flea pills or even keeps his hair cut, I’ve been the one handling it because my uncle long ago stopped asking my dad when he was coming back for the animal, instead he does nothing, gets mad when I take care of him and tells me I’m creating a problem by taking care of an animal that it’s obvious my dad doesn’t care for. They want the dog to suffer for no reason. But my father is doing no wrong, I am. Because I don’t want to see an innocent animal suffer and I care for him when I can.

I would rather care for that animal then my father to be honest. I’m fighting anger everyday. And everyday I imagine what life would be like if he was just dead, if he was dead I wouldn’t have to put up with this bullshit any longer. 

Just because he’s my father he has the right to come in and out of my life as he sees fit and nobody listens to a word I say.",29Apr2018,1

217,"This is going to be a long rant. 

My neighborhood sits next to a JW church. They’re constantly mobilized in the neighborhood, knocking on everyone’s doors, including mine. I have posted signs such as “No Trespassing”, or “No soliciting”. 

I recently upped the ante on the no trespassing sign where I got the one that follows the initial warning with a “violators will be shot, survivors will be shot again” which is more so a joke. Though it still hasn’t worked, because the solicitors keep coming. I’ve even told them not to show up at my door regardless if I’m home or not. Still doesn’t work. 

What I mean by all of this “not working”, is simply I tell them no, and mention that I have posted signs also saying no. They just sneak by when I’m not home and shove pamphlets and brochures into my door, then return after a week or two.

I’ve been brainstorming what I could do if they stop by when I’m home. These ideas range from calling the police, to BILLING them for my time. 

I’m definitely liking the billing them idea, I’ll sit and tune out the solicitors, and then charge them $100, or so. ",29Apr2018,10
218,"Was going to local university for 3 years, but realized it's not the course for me as I have always hated the university system, and went because I thought it's the only way to ""make it"" in life. Decided to drop out because I was just always depressed and didn't really have a degree I was pursuing. 

I tried enlisting in the Navy, got a contract as a Nuclear Engineer, with the recruiting officers really hyping me up because being in the Nuclear program is the hardest thing apparently to get into, and after lots of testing and time, held my contract in my hand and they said I'm basically going to ship out and can sign the contract once I clear my medical.

I failed my medical because I have an eye disease called Keratoconus, which is an AUTOMATIC PROHIBITION. Spent a few weeks trying to waiver in but apparently there's no possibility so I gave up on that. With the promises I was told, thinking this would be a radical change in my life of being in the Navy, I spent all my money and quit my job. I can't go back to my University because I have loans due (and also don't want to go back regardless). Basically starting over with nothing but my car and living with my girlfriend.

I'm 26, living in Orange county (Westminster) California, and was looking to some trade school programs like Welding at Orange coast college or something of the sort! Any advice would be great to hear!",29Apr2018,1

222,"Ok so here it goes. I’m in love with this girl I’m going to call Jessica. I met her in December and we immediately clicked and started to sort of kind of date but unofficially. She had just broken up with her boyfriend of 3 years who lived in Texas at the time so me and her weren’t going to be in an actual relationship for a while which I understood. But I genuinely loved her. On like December 28th, her boyfriend came back and she got back together with him. She kept on talking to me like everything was fine whenever she was back with him. When I told her I knew, she didn’t seem to really care how it hurt me. The next day, she went back up to Texas with him for the whole Christmas. It hurt me so much. She then came back and I felt like I hated her. For what she did to me and made me feel for the whole month since I met her. But we eventually started hanging out again a lot and I just fell in love with her even more but I was just her friend. Until I was leaving her house and she came back out and we kissed. The next day was just weird. I didn’t know what to think and she said she wasn’t going to break up with him so it confused me. We kept on kissing each night though until it progressed into her asking one night after I had poured my heart out to her if we could have sex. I told her no. But we ended up doing it anyways. I fucking hated myself. I only did it because I thought maybe it would open her eyes to how much I love her. I thought it would change things. It changed nothing and then she went back up to Texas and I hurt again. I managed to successfully tell her I was done. Tell her it was me or him. We didn’t talk for 5 days until she called me on the 5th day In Texas crying her eyes out that she had hurt me. She came back and we were just friends again. Until we kissed again and the cycle repeated. Her boyfriend just moved back and they broke up but she still won’t get with me and it hurts. Not to mention that she lies when they’re hanging out. Every night I go home and just want to end it and all of this bullshit. I love her so much but how much more can I actually take? Not much",29Apr2018,0
223,"I'm 17, and a junior in high school. My parents, just like every stereotypical asian parent, have always expected me to get into an ivy league/top 10 school for college. I've spent the entirety of high school (or really, my entire life) trying my best to take the hardest classes, get good grades and do extracurriculars, all for the goal of getting into a college my parents would approve of. 

From the outside, it might look like I'm doing great. I seem happy, I have a great circle of friends, an awesome boyfriend and decent grades. In reality, I'm falling apart. I regularly get 5-6 hours of sleep a night because of how much work I have to do. I feel like I'm constantly on edge. Sometimes I get stressed out to the point where I'm hyperventilating or crying. It doesn't help that my school is really competitive and pretty much takes 3-5 AP classes in a year. Also, my brother has never done well in school, so my parents see me as the one who's supposed to have everything together. 

But I don't have everything together. I'm tired, and I just want to stop trying. I almost want to say ""screw grades, screw everything"" and just go to an average college. I don't know if I can carry on like this until graduation. It makes me feel stupid and weak because even though I try so hard, I don't have the most amazing grades and I'm not going to end up at a college they want me to go to. 

For example, I'm going to end up with a B- or B in math, which doesn't sound bad to most people, but would be completely unacceptable to my parents. My mom's already yelled at me about it, but it's the best I can do. I'm just not the greatest at math, and they refuse to accept that. I do homework, I ask my teacher for help, I practice, I study for tests and I'm working my ass off. I don't know what more I can do. I can do better, but I'll never be that 4.0 student who plays a varsity sport and wins awards. I'll never be who they want, and I'm tired. 

I don't really know what advice I'm asking for. I just feel so done with everything and I feel like I'll break down at any moment. Sorry for the massive wall of text...",29Apr2018,2
224,"Looking for some guidance on breaking some terrible news to my dad.

I've just had a very upset call this afternoon to say my uncle has suddenly and tragically passed away. He was only in his 50s.

The difficult part of it all is that he has lived a very secluded life, had depression and anxiety, and has always remained close to my dad since they were kids. They have supported each other through the hardest times of their lives and he's the only family my dad has apart from me.

What makes things complicated is that my dad is in prison and I don't get to talk to him that often. I am now all my dad has left and I have to break the news that his baby brother has tragically died. I just don't know how to say it - I know there is no easy way to. He is going to be distraught. 

My dilemma is I am expecting him to call this evening; he usually calls every week or two to check in. I feel absolutely awful - he will have go grieve on his own. I was thinking of trying tp book in a visit but the earliest I could get in if there is space would be Tuesday. Do I tell him over the phone - or wait to tell him in person so I can support him and potentially not get a visit? He will need to make arrangements to get an order of leave to go to the funeral - I'm thinking is it best to tell him as soon as possible so that he can put those steps in place? How do I even break that news that the brother he loves and was going to live with when he came out has died? I'm so upset I feel so terrible. 

I'm in between a rock and a hard place - any advice would be really appreciated. 

Tldr; need to break to news to my dad in prison that his baby brother has passed - not sure how to do it or what to say",29Apr2018,3
225,"Yesterday I found my father unresponsive, not breathing. Called 911 and followed their instructions, eventually paramedics arrived and tried to revive him with no luck. They took him to a hospital and eventually got his heart beating again after 30 minutes but still no actual response from him.  
The doctors are telling me I should let him pass away peacefully but I feel it's still too soon for that... I don't want him to suffer but at the same time I don't want to be too hasty. This isn't my first time dealing with a family death though, my mother passed away in 2012 but I still have no actual experience with the procedures that come next because my mother's side of the family handled that, unfortunately for my father's side of the family there's only my uncle, who is usually unreliable, an ex-con, doesn't have much more experience with this than I do. As well as my aunt, who I also don't expect to be much help due to how she's nursing home-bound herself.  
I also didn't complete highschool and I currently don't have my GED, which is going to make it hard for me to secure a job so I can have income flowing in again. This is honestly something I hate myself for, not placing more importance on school until my back is against the wall, I did however schedule my GED test for math so I am in the process of working towards getting it...  
My father also has life insurance for a small amount of money, although it is a decent amount for my particular situation currently. I'm on section8 housing assistance, so my rent is minimal and having my uncle move in with me will help lower the electricity bill since he has budgeting assistance in his name for electricity, other than that I don't know what I could cut down on realistically... I've got a $50 phone bill and Comcast internet+tv which is about a little over $100 a month, but I need the internet though as it's a really important utility in helping me secure a job after I (hopefully) get my GED.  
  
Sorry for the long wall of text... TL;DR: my father is most likely on his way out, I have no mother, I have no GED because I relied on my parents foolishly for too long, and no one I can reliably turn to except possibly on my mother's side of the family  
  
I just need advice on smart things I could/should be doing right now to help me stay in the game until I can get on my feet.",29Apr2018,23
226,"So I went through almost an entire year completely UNABLE to find a job. I searched and searched and searched, and finally, February of this year, I found a job (Pays barely above minimum, but it's full time, so it's a start, I guess.) Anyway, during my period of being unemployed, my parents were helping me pay my car payment (Which they hardly could do, we've been relatively poor my entire life) which is $240/mo. Great, right? Well, in November of 2017, my cars shitty tires (which have been fixed since this accident) had almost no tread and I went sliding down an exit trying to get off the highway. My car bumped into a car in front of me and left a scratch the size of my fucking pinky nail. Not a big deal. Tried to work something out because (and here's the kicker) I couldn't afford insurance! I have to drive my girlfriend to and from places because she can't drive (medical reasons). SO, my license got suspended, I owe this dickhead in a fucking kia $1000 for a tiny goddamn scratch, etc. ANYWAY, I'm working extremely hard at this new job. Got promoted to Shift Manager within a month. BUT I make so little money that every cent I make goes toward catching my car up. I FINALLY get caught up, and I'm ready to start saving for that accident I got into. WELL, HERE'S WHERE SHIT HITS THE FUCKING FAN. I was driving and getting dinner on my way home because I got off late (like 10:30pm) and there was a cop next to me in the left turning lane. My birthday is April 5th. It's like April 21st or something. Anyway, as you can expect, in my state of financial ruin, I couldn't afford to get my tags renewed. I (stupidly) thought that I had until the end of the month to renew my tags, but nope, I didn't. ANYWAY, the cop pulls me over, tells me my tags are expired, asks if I'm the registered owner of the vehicle, etc. Yes, yes, yes, whatever. Says that I'm driving under a suspended license (which I thought I fixed, but apparently I didn't. I payed the like $250 fee by selling my ps4 and other shit, thinking it would lift the suspension. It didn't.) Anyway, he writes me a citation for obstructed view (over a fucking air freshener hanging from my mirror), driving under a suspended license, and expired tags. SO NOW, my license is suspended, I can't drive anywhere, I STILL can't afford insurance, I can't afford any court costs that there's going to be, I can't afford to file an SR22 and reinstate my license, and basically, my life is in shambles right now and I'm only 22. It seems as if no matte what I do I can't catch a break and I don't know what to do.

So now I'm required to make an appearance at court on the 9th of May, and I'm stuck paying almost $250 to the bank every single month for this car that I can't drive. I just have no idea what to do at all. I can't file bankruptcy because my dad co signed on the loan and they'll go after him too. I'm just so fucked and I'm in this situation that I can't even begin to get out of and it's really starting to weigh on me mentally (like dangerously.) 


Please, any advice is appreciated, I don't know what to do and I'm starting to lose hope. Thanks.",29Apr2018,5
227,"Tufts vs Villanova

I’m studying Mechanical Engineering at both schools. 

Villanova:

I went to admitted students weekend at Villanova and really liked what I saw there. I’m not really a social butterfly, and it seems like there are a lot of people here who are outgoing and have similar backgrounds to me, which I think will help me make friends quickly. The academics here aren’t as demanding as they would be at Tufts, and this would allow me to ease my way into college. They have a D1 running program that I could practice with (but not really compete), or a club running team that is probably very competitive. I’d say this is the safe bet for me. 

Tufts:

This was my top reach school when I applied, and I got in. The student body is very diverse and I think it would give me a better taste of what the real world is like. The academics are more demanding but are still manageable. Athletics are D3 and so I’d have a good shot at running on the cross country and track team here. I think overall, I’d be more challenged here socially, athletically, and academically, and I could come out being a much better person than I am now if I succeed. Tufts is sort of a gamble, but I see it as a high-risk high-reward scenario. 


Overall, both are located by great cities, and I’m very fortunate to say that financial aid is not an issue for me. Obviously even if I flipped a coin, there’s a 100% chance that I’d be picking a great school that would set me up to have a great life. Sadly, I can only go to one of these schools. ",29Apr2018,1

Lately my relationship with my girlfriend has been a bit turbulent and not so great. However, I live with her and I worry if we broke up if I'd be able to find a living situation I am happy with (would probably have to move back into a houseshare).  I also wonder about the other girl.  I understand we have history but we've always stayed friends and we definitely have a lot more in common than I do with my current girlfriend and I think about her a lot and even dream about her sometimes (not always sexual or anything but quite frequently in my dreams). However, I also worry that maybe it's a situation of grass is always greener. I also suffer from premature ejaculation which has been a big part of why I've stayed with my current girlfriend (even through the bad times), because I feel like she's the only girl that is supportive of it.

I try to aks within his random informations. But sometimes i cant. If i dont show excitement or writr ""sorry i dont in the mood now"" thats a mistake. He dont even know i have a slight depression because he never cared or asked ""why dont you go out?.

I'm not American, I'm a 22 year old sad excuse of a man who worked hard through High-School and earned a somewhat substantial scholarship that would've covered my 4 year degree and anything directly related to University. I was absolutely ecstatic for this new part of my life, you wouldn't believe me.

My dream degree was taught at a campus that was in the other corner of the country, so of course I would have had to get a residence or some kind of dwelling for the time I were to spend there.

Problem was, back in 2014 my country was still in recession from the recent world economical crysis; My dad had been jobless for the better part of the last 3 years, so my mom told me to pick another degree closer to home in order to avoid paying for a residence (which would've amounted to aproximately 2/3 of the scholarship). So I picked something that I had absolutely no interest in in order to provide for my family with part of the scholarship, the other part paying for the degree itself (and transportation).

I hated it. I couldn't bear to see all my mates I graduated High-School with's social media and seeing they were going where I was meant to go and enjoying their choices of degrees, generally having a blast in University while I was wasting two hours a day in the train alone to spend eight more in a classroom learning about something I had no interest at all. I became more depressed as time went on, until it all culminated this year in a harrowing finale.

I've failed. I've failed this stupid degree, I've been booted from it. I managed to more or less pass these last three years because honestly I'm not that bad a student, I don't think so at least, but my grades were less than stellar because most of the time I didn't even bother to go to class or to study prior to the last day before a test, and they only progressively got worse. I can't even go back to it for two years, they say; Not that I would want to anyway, but I've spent almost four years doing this and I won't even have a God-damned piece of paper to show for it.

I come to you because I have a question, or THE question, because it'll decide what direction my life will take. The question being that of the title: Should I go back to University? Should I start a completely new 4 year degree?

To be clear. My family's economical situation hasn't got any better, I still can't find a part-time job and still don't have my drivers license because it costs a fortune here. We are still poor as can be for a first world nation. I still (probably) can't go do what I wanted to do, but some new degrees have sprung close to home in the meantime which don't sound half bad. They might not be what I want to do but are similar enough that I can see myself not absolutely abhorring going to class for them.

The pros to doing so are self-evident: more employment options, the prospect of a career, the fulfilling of the apparent prophecy foreseen by family and teachers for my whole life that said I HAD to get a degree ever since I was a child, feeling like I'm worth something once more. And possibly a myriad more.

The cons are more obscure to see if you are not inside my mind, but I can try and lay them out for you: I hated University, I disliked the professors and the classmates (made zero friends in four years), I disliked the culture, I disliked the attitudes necessary. I don't think I'm made to be the archetypical student. If it were up to me, I'd just cram for months and do the exams and field-exercises required for the degree in a single semester and be done with it. But I don't call the shots in this life.

I honestly don't want to do another four years, but I feel it is completely necessary, because for all my shortcomings I still keep a glimmer of pride from my previous self, and refuse to be a servile loser. I won't clean anything or serve anything to anyone, ever, I refuse. I also don't want to do the equivalent of an Associates Degree, at that point I'd rather do another four years because an Associates is next to worthless here anyway, and I also see it below me to go for a Bachelors-lite, as dumb as that sounds. Is there any jobs for college-failures that don't put you in the lowest rung of society? There's plenty of things I'd be glad to do, as long as it's not anything servile. I like everything equine-related (non-veterinarian field, though) so a job in that field would be pretty nice, I loved riding and caring for the horses (even cleaning their messes) when I was a kid and went to the local stables with the school riding club, and have ever since. Something out in the open would be great, too, or something that allows me to travel or relocate somewhere else; I just want to get away from this terrible town I live in that only reminds me of how much of a failure I am.

I want to say thank you to all who have read this diatribe, and apologize again for not being able to be more concise. So, again, thank you!

247,"I'm wanting to take right action (think of that ""Just do it!"" meme or breaking from routine but not making the new thing a one-time thing), but I pussy foot my way around it. It's like trying to run into a cold shower. You work yourself up run in there like William Wallace, but then you run away like a pussy. There's a barrier in the way.

I think just just ""being"" by emptying my mind with no goal and being present-oriented should work, but the question is how do I become present-oriented? How do you do something with no goal in mind? What's the purpose of doing something with no goal in mind?

I'm usually in my head, future-oriented or past-oriented. I have an addiction-prone, ""Just a sec"" personality. It's never ""one sec"". That's an illusion, and I give into comfort, novelty, and routine instead of getting off by butt and getting things done.

I found this, but it doesn't exactly explain how to enter the state of mind:

248,"So I'm an adult with disabilities and have a hard time making friends. My friendships usually don't work out. I went to middle school with a couple of people who I have on social media, but rarely talk to. When I do reach out to them they'll either not respond and just look at my message, not look at my message at all or they send a few replies and that's it. One of them can take a few weeks to get back to me. I miss being close with them. I feel like once I stopped going to our school that we drifted apart. We even went to different high schools and throughout all of this we lived in different cities and towns. We still live apart from each other but none of us drive as far as I know. I know one of them told me he took public transportation here once and it took him about 2 hours to get here. I really want to reach out to them and be straight forward but I'm not sure it will get me anywhere. I don't want to bother them. I hung out with another old classmate a few years ago and after we hung out I never heard from him again. 

I figured we would all get along and be friends because we have disabilities. I feel like I'm the problem. I don't know why they won't be my friends.

I am 19 years young.... and I have been friends with let’s call her ‘M’ okay so M and I have been friends for about seven years now and I’ve only now just come to realise how selfish she really is. we live together and I’m constantly hearing about her problems and this is all via Social media, never actually gave to face.... even though we live together, so anyway what happens is she’s constantly saying things like “I’m sad and this would really make me happy” or “ is this happening because blah blah blah me me me “. The amount of things she talks about that doesn’t include herself is nada because it’s constantly what can you do for meeee. Like she takes no consideration of anybody else’s feelings and expects everyone to get onto their knees and bow down to her, and that may sound crazy but that’s just how it feels. I am 19 years old studying and have a part time job so no I am not rich and just barely getting by..... YES a typical 19 year old and she expects myself and other limited friends (1 including family lol) to travel JUST SPECIFICALLY for her birthday.... and she said that “well whoever doesn’t come to my birthday can forget about being my friend” Like dudeeeeee you’re just as broke as me and I’m trying to save for a car and other necessities and you expect me to pay for a fucking flight for a birthday..... A BIRTHDAY  it’s just a joke..... Honestly there’s a hell of a lot more crap that she has put me through and I’m sick of it, I can’t deal with it but I just kind of want some clarification as to whether or not I’m over reacting or if how I’m feeling is actually justified because what she’s DEMANDING is actually crazy....

250,"For almost all my life I've wondered who my father was. My mother is no help. I've always felt like she was hiding who my father was. Whenever I would ask her about him the stories would always be different. (She likes exaggerating the truth. Hence why I think she's lying about not knowing who my father is.) The story is that she had a one night stand with a guy she met at a bar and that's it. Didn't get the guy's name. Didn't know anything about him. I remember asking her when I was 12 if she had any idea where he might be and she told me the last she heard from him was that he was living in Texas working on an oil mine. Then later she told me that apparently he was in the Air Force. Then when I was about 20 I tried asking her again and she said she went to three different bars that night. And I asked her which bar did she think she met my dad in and she just laughed and said, ""I don't know. I hooked up with a bunch of different guys in each bar. 

I really want to find him. I think I deserve to know who he is and where I come from and if he knew about me because I really think my mom knows who he is. Is there anyone here who knows how I can find him even with little to no clue of who he is? Has anyone been in the same situation as me and found their biological parent?",29Apr2018,2

253,"I’m fine with neighbors having people over and throwing parties, I’m fine with street parking as long as my driveway isn’t blocked, and I’m fine with loud music until midnight, our houses are 300 ft apart minimum so it’s easy to avoid bothering each other to live and let live. However, my neighbors parties frequently end up in the streets with screaming guests.

I’ve asked politely about their guests noise levels and their screaming in the streets, blasting music out of their open cars and more at 1 am in front of my house and over the winter it was fine with the cold weather keeping everyone in. Last night for a good hour they screamed and honked car horns in the street.

Last night I thought I saw a flash out of my window in the side yard which is fenced off and not viewable from the streets while a group of people were smoking in front of MY house. I thought nothing of it and continued with my night. About an hour later I noticed movement and looked out the same window, I saw someone there and ran to my door, by the time I unlocked and opened it the person was sprinting across the street to my neighbor. This morning there was a ball in my fenced yard. There’s no way this ball could get there without someone being in my yard, it’s too light to be thrown or kicked that far. I will be looking at the security camera footage that show both front and back, but not side if the house where he was peeping, when my boyfriend comes back from a family visit tomorrow.

My question is, what can I do? If this behavior continues I will be calling the police, especially considering the state of those driving home, but if someone was in my fenced yard peeping, are there any charges to be pressed? Should I approach this directly?",29Apr2018,4
254,I had to take my husband to the hospital today. A few weeks ago he attempted suicide. And all week he's been talking about killing himself. Well yesterday I came home early from work. He was being really distant from me. This morning I asked how he was feeling and he told me about how he had planned to kill himself last night but I came home early so it ruined his plan. So I told him it might be best if we took him to get admitted because I didn't want him to hurting himself while I am at work or something. But I can't help but feel like I am forcing him into this.

255,"I'm 22 and graduating from university in two months. Earlier today my mother was telling me about her best friend's daughter and what she's up to. Her best friend's daughter was my childhood best friend up until the age of 11. We're both 22 years old now and I feel like since the age of 11 we have both diverged significantly and whenever I hear of her I can't help but almost mourn the life I should be having if it wasn't for fear.

We were the best of friends until 11, then whilst I attended a state school (worst in the area) she went to a private school. Her parents were accomplished in both their careers and hobbies. My parents were both unemployed my whole childhood. Growing up, her father hated that I was friends with his daughter as I wasn't ""good enough"". He had a lot of personal issues and now I am older I empathise with him a lot, but he hated my background. He never told me this and was civil to me but I picked up on it and it was later told to me when I was older. 

Since the ages of 11 to 22, whilst my old best friend have diverged in personality our lives have also paralleled each other. We both got similar grades, attend similar universities and do similar courses and are graduating in the same year. But whilst she is embracing graduation and off to travel the World before getting a PhD abroad, I am lost, terrified of the future and feel completely alone. I feel like my own behaviour has stunted me, and hearing of an old friend today has really caused me to take a look at my life. I know it probably seems from this post that I am jealous of my old friend or unhealthily stuck in the past, but that's not the case. It's just hearing from people who, for all intents and purposes, were at the same ""starting line"" as you have used what they have been given to create a beautiful life for themselves whereas I feel like I have wasted my opportunities.

I am good at taking exams so received good grades, despite this I attended the local university which was not the ""best"" university I could have gotten into so I could live at home still. There is nothing inherently bad about my university so I don't regret going there, but I know that I could have gone somewhere much better. I feel like I wasn't stretched academically there as I got the highest grades in my graduating class. I wasn't stretched socially as I was driving home back to mommy and daddy after each class. I feel like in some ways I am stagnant, as I am essentially still living the same life as a high-school student just with more expensive textbooks and more homework(!). I am thinking of applying for grad school however this would again mean living at home and attending the same university because I can't afford to move out like I could have for undergrad (the loan for grad school covers tuition only, whilst at undergrad it covered tuition and living expenses). So I don't know what to do. I am graduating university two years ""late"" at 23 because I changed majors, and my mom is saying I am getting ""older and older"" and so shouldn't take a gap year. 

I just feel like I have so many blessings in my life, good health, a good education, a genuine interest in the field of my undergrad, but I am too scared to do anything with it. I am even putting off applying for grad school as I have to find an academic reference and I am nervous to ask my tutor, even though I know they would be more than happy to oblige. One example is in my first year of college I had a two hour break in my timetable and I was too nervous to just sit in a coffee shop and study, so I would walk around outside in the freezing cold and rain for two hours instead. It's like I don't do things for my own best interest because of fear.

256,"Ok I want to preface this by saying I have learned you should always take responsibility for your hard earned money by keeping track of your paycheques and to not trust other people to have their shit together...

...But come on. It’s April 29th and I just learned that tomorrow I owe the government $1600 dollars in income taxes. My employer has not been taxing me for a year. 

To put into context I have worked for the same company for almost eight years, since I was 16. I have never had issues until now. I trusted things were done properly and had gotten into the habit of not checking pay cheques after a few years.

I manage a small team at a retail store and a couple have come to me with the same issue. In both cases I handled the situation with payroll administrators and people from HR by correcting the taxes, but no one was able to do anything about the amount they already owed. I was told that’s just how it is. 

I’m saving in order to go back to school in the fall and while this won’t prevent me it certainly hurts to have to dip into college savings to afford this. 

Has anyone been through a similar situation but had a different way of handling things? I’m wondering what all my options could be. 

PS: I’m aware I have myself to blame for not catching this throughout an entire year. I’m still very upset with my employer though, they had a responsibility to have things in order and this has become a pattern for them. The company is a shit show right now.

262,"Hi, everyone. I'm a 20F, and I've been struggling with my confidence for maybe half a year now. I used to be really confident in myself and never felt bad about myself when I looked in the mirror because I saw mostly my good qualities and accepted my flaws. But I have no idea how I got to that point.

About 9 months ago I started seeing this guy who was a powerlifter and really judgemental and although he'd say he liked my body, that he liked thick women, he would always talk about how hot other, fitter women were when I was with him and how his ideal woman was basically really thin and fit. He stopped complimenting me altogether after a month or so and then would occasionally make hints at me losing weight or if I talked about dieting he was really eager to give me information on it, which was great, but at a point I told him I'd found a calorie limit that was still letting me drop weight while still building good muscle mass. He told me to eat less to get the weight to come off. And idk, ever since him I've felt really insecure about not being perfect and skinny and now I compare myself to every skinny woman I see. I feel like I'm 15 again. 

I'm fit, I powerlift too and do aerial training but I still have fat on my body. I'm strong but I'm still overweight. I'm really curvy (39-34-46), but I can't seem to stop feeling like if I'm not perfect and have a flat stomach then I'm disgusting and fat, there's no in between. And I know I'd look incredible if I could just get this fat off my stomach, I still have maybe 20-30lbs to lose before then.

So I guess what I'm really asking is how can I love myself while I'm losing weight? So far it's been going really slowly, I've dropped 5lbs in 3 months, but I've made substantial weight lifting gains and people tell me I look a lot thinner so I'm guessing I just gained muscle and lost fat. 

It's just taking a really long time and I can't seem to stop hating myself in the interim.

New poster here, please be kind.

Well, you see, I am a very anxious person and recently I started a new career as a freelance translator. I translate English/Portuguese by the way.

I started on Upwork back in January, things have been slow, but mostly ok. My first job went perfectly, the second not so much, the client disappeared, I got paid but didn't get any feedback, the third job was with the same client as the first and it went really well.

The problems started around last week, I read some rumors that upwork was deleting accounts for sending too many proposals and not getting enough jobs. that led me to have an anxiety attack, with led me to panic and fervently expand my business.

I created profiles on various other freelance platforms, Fiverr, PPH, etc., and decided to start a personal blog to use as a portfolio. last Saturday I got my first job outside of Upwork after a week.:)

I know that I am being impatient and that these things take time, I can rationalize that...

But I would love some advice on how to get my career going.

how do I promote my gigs? where do I do it?

After this I decided I would have more options for college if I moved in with my mom in Colorado. So for my last year of high school I moved to Colorado. At first it was fine but I quickly began to grow homesick. During my first year of University at UCCS I began to feel very unhappy and the feeling of being homesick only grew. During my third semester of university I flew back to West Virginia during thanksgiving break and for the first time in two years I felt happy. When I returned to Colorado the feeling of unhappiness only grew. Recently I changed my major from Spanish to biology so I could pursue a career that might make me happy again. I am finishing my fourth semester of college and am about to go into my fifth. I am unsure of what to do with my life currently and the feeling of unhappiness wont go away.

So 1 year post-loan, he's only ever talked about it when I bring it up, and he's never ready to take responsibility for it. He tries to weasel out of it when it doesn't get heated by saying stuff like, ""But I've done a lot for you"" (which he hasn't, and even if he had, unless it was stated that it was for the debt, it wouldn't count), or ""I would've gotten it without you anyway, so it's your fault"" (then why ask me for shit anyway??). If it does get heated, he starts with telling me to fuck off, which is only the start. Then he says he doesn't have the money (he just blew a metric shit ton on a Playstation 4, Magic the Gathering cards, and accessories), and if I call him on said PS4, he suggests, ever so politely for me to shut the hell up, and if asked why I should, won't answer.

What the hell do I do to get through to a guy who won't even directly address it, much less actually pay me back. Am I in the wrong for getting angered by his spending habits on various things for himself, but never wanting to return my favor? 

TLDR; Friend is being a dickbag about paying me back, no one in the group wants to help, I need advice on how to handle this. ",29Apr2018,14
275,"Hey Reddit, I'm losing it. I need help.
A mere 3 days after my car caught fire and ruined a lot going on in my life right now, I was borrowing my mother's car only to hit a MASSIVE pothole that I simply did not have time to move out of the way of..anddd I'm going to have to foot the bill of her rim (2015 too yay!!) I've already been stressing so bad that it literally hurts my stomach and then this happens. I broke down in tears immediately. I don't know what to do anymore.
I've always refused help and could never ask for it.. I don't want this to turn into a sob story, a charity case, an excuse for me to make a quick easy buck..I just really need help guys.
I've had a good lower-middle class white American life. Always had a roof over my head, parents still together and still young (I'm 25, brother is 26 and they're both 43), bright future ahead of us all. We've just always been plagued by financial troubles. We've always been able to put food on the table, and please let me implore that i KNOW so many people have it so much worse than I do (which is actually part of why I never ask for help..I tend to discredit myself and my own struggles.) But we've just forever had to put things on hold to save up money.
2 years ago I had to leave university as a junior in chemistry. I was working 40hrs or more a week, studying relentlessly, on food stamps, struggling severely with suicidal depression and anxiety..life got too real too quickly. Ever since then I've focused on nothing but working every moment I can, just trying to get ahead so that I can focus on things I really want to pursue in life. After lots of ups and downs, where I'm at now is having to stay in a small apartment with my parents while I build my money back up..the one stable thing I had was my beloved Subaru Outback which just caught fire while I was driving down the highway and totally knock me off course. I used to be an avid backpacker and have trekked the JMT, lived in Yellowstone for a bit, hitched all over the US..I don't remember the last hike I went on.
I've taught myself to play several instruments since I was 12, always dreamed of being in a band, but I can't tell you the last time I picked up my guitar. I used to write, I used to be politically/socially involved, I used to learn every day...One might say laziness, just pick it back up and go! Do it! But it's strange...all my passion has just been sucked away from me. 
But more importantly, there are so many ways I've wanted to give back to the world in exchange for my rent here..I want to help those who have struggled with anxiety and depression. I'm a vegan and want to use my knowledge of chemistry and nutrition to create new and better food products. I want to continue learning and find ways I can help with the overarching problems in the world today.
Where would your money go? Well in an immediate sense, at the moment it would help me get a new car and make steps toward getting an apartment and get myself back on my feet. Another issue is my credit tanked after some loans kicking in that I totally overlooked, and now I'm worrying about my ability to find a place even when I do have enough cash on hand. So hopefully I can work on my credit too if nothing else. But what I'm really working towards right now is starting a business. I've reflected long and hard on how I can't do this day job bullshit anymore, its literally killing me. I need to make my dreams happen in my own way. I'm feeling my passion slowly return as I become more and more engaged in the idea of opening a recreationl marijuana business. Not just as another stoner who wants to make it big...I want to bring light to the beauty of cannabis and its extensive benefits. It's the only thing that has allowed me to stay off of anti-depressants for 3 years running now, and has literally saved my grandfather's life. He has multiple myeloma and we make RSO to treat his symptoms--he should have passed 3 years ago, yet here he is still the same handyman he always was, always out in his furniture workshop building something. I want that to be something I can talk about seriously so we can start administering better treatments to terminally ill loved ones. I know everything I'd have to do to run either a dispensary, cultivation center, edibles facility, literally any part of it. I'm very passionate about it and even have a great network of people to employ/work with but lack the funds.

I feel like I'm just babbling at this point. I'm sorry..I live a pretty lonely life lately, don't get out much other than for work and don't really have anyone to talk to about what I'm going through so this sort of just turned into word vomit. Anyone who can help me whether monetarily or pointing me in the right direction of ways to get my business off the ground, I will 1000% find a way to return the generousity. I'll edit this later and give it a more concise structure, and post a gofundme or something if I can figure out how to do it anonymously (honestly this whole thing gives me a lot of anxiety, very ashamed of myself and don't want my name plastered all over for people I know to see)..but I figure this covers most of it for now.

If you're reading this, or even if not, I appreciate you as a human being with complex emotions and desires, and I wish you nothing but good fortune in your days to come. Thank you for your time.

276,"Hello all, just about a year ago I got assaulted by my \(then\) boyfriend. It was traumatic, scary, over\-whelming. The cops were called, It caused a neighborhood ruckus.

After that, I broke up with him, he threatened people close to me, and told him to never contact me again. I was afraid to press charges because I didn't want him to get out of jail later and come out to get me. I consider myself pretty strong, but I'm a little 5'3 120 lb girl, and I couldn't do anything to defend myself when it initially happened. The thought of being in that situation again scared me and I would not want to even put myself NEAR being in that position again.

A little bit after he finally started leaving me alone, this girl \(someone he was seeing,  I'm assuming\) messaged me on facebook through his account and said some sh\*tty things to me. I blocked him on all social media after that.

He has been texting me messages telling me how he is doing ever since then. He hasn't said anything mean, so I just ignore them. \(I never respond\) He has called a few times and left messages, I ignored those, too.

I'm afraid to block him on my phone because I don't want him to keep sending me messages and end up getting pissed because I'm ignoring him, and saying something like, ""I'm going to come to your house and f\*ck you up!"" Or something completely idiotic, that he would most likely try to follow through with. \(He knows where my parents live, but I stay there sometimes, too.\) I still wouldn't reply but I could let my parents know to keep an eye out, and possibly alert the cops.

Recently \(the past few months\) he has been asking to hangout, to which I have still not replied, but last night he sent me a really gross, raunchy message. I'm not sure if he sent it to me, or if it's another girl that saw his texts to me on his phone and was jealous, so she texted me to scare me/piss me off, OR if it was actually him.

In my experience, usually ignoring someone will make them stop. But seeing as it's been over a year and he is still texting me, I'm not sure what to do.

I'm afraid to block him, and technically him texting me isn't hurting me in any way. I would just rather not have to deal with sh\*tty messages like the one sent to me yesterday.

Should I just keep ignoring him? Should I block him and just forget about it? \(probably my least likely option, seeing as it might put me at risk\) Or should I message him and tell him to leave me alone and it he messages me again I'm going to press charges. \(Something I did the first time, which worked for a while. When he finally texted me again after that he wasn't mean, so I just let it go because I didn't want to stir the pot.\)

Thank you for reading.",29Apr2018,1
279,My father plays alot of trickery on me and tries to get under my skin. Then uses it against me. For example he will leave the garage door open but won't close it himself even though he used it and me not knowing about it at all that was open he will blame me saying why didn't you close the garage door? Or if their is a urine mess from our dog that I didn't not notice because I was in another room I would have cleaned it up obviously if I saw it  but he blames me for not cleaning it up even if he saw it first and just uses it against me and he feels holier than thou is too fucking lazy to clean the mess and help out. He will argue with me for fun and its fucking annoying and he's impossible to argue with because he can't admit hes wrong so Iv been just giving him the silent treatment because I don't know how to defuse those kinds of situations.

281,"I’m rather concerned about the mental health of my father. He often says something that upsets me, then when my mother and he argue afterwards, he seems to make some excuse up. 

For example, here is a real argument that happened today: we were eating dinner at this bar and grill place, and seemingly out of the blue he starts making comments about me possibly having mental disorders. I quite calmly tell him that I’m aware I could have a mental disorder but I don’t think I can overcome it on my own. He replies “You’re 16; you should be able to get your own help.” He goes on to say things in a mocking tone like how he thinks I’ll have to call home when I’m at university about how to pay rents and similar things — although I’m very confident that I’ll be able to deal with such things when the time comes. When the argument was over, he told my mother it was “over a grilled tomato” (seriously, that was his excuse) and “I should grow up and start being stupid”.

As a result of him, my mother is mad at me and the whole family thinks I ruined the holiday, when I think, in reality, it is him that “ruined it”.

My brother seems to be on his side, because when I mention something I heard my father bring up, my brother swears blind he didn’t say anything of the sort. This is even if my sister, and she is the most reliable family member, says he did, in fact, say those things. 

I’m not sure. Maybe I’m the one who has a mental disorder? Schizophrenia could be an explanation, though I am in no way a professional and this is just surmising. 

I feel that the males of the family take joy in making my life a misery: they know I have a short temper, and a normal family wouldn’t do this, but they get a kick out of annoying me until I snap and end up shouting at them. Then when I shout, they act as if I’m getting angry at nothing at all. They tell me to be quiet and call me a psycho for shouting when they are the ones that instigated my anger outburst. Everything I’ve said in this paragraph also applies to my brother.

That’s about all there is to explain. I’m in quite dire need of advice because I’m getting sick of my father making me feel worthless.",29Apr2018,2
282,"So.... don't know where to start.

After school I moved to a big city from bumfuck nowhere with a background of bullying and no friends. I'm living here now for 6 1/2 years. Since I'm not the most extroverted person... I never managed to make friends. But somehow I managed to get raped 4 times during that time because I'm gay and sometimes I've sexdates. And 4 of them ended... well. I'm balding on the forehead since im 20. It's like the hair my dad. It happened when I got 20 and as it's know it'll be forever. But I'm so annoyed to never ever be able to make holidays on the beach or go swimming anymore because people would see how even more ugly I am. I always war a cap or a beanie. I also have a metabolism disorder which was diagnosed when I was 13 and weighted 115 kg while eating normal. I'm down to ~80 kg since I was 15 but my skin never recovered. I tried sport but... didn't help much. Gave it up after a 3/4 year. I'm writing my master thesis in neuroscience right now and will do my phD afterwards. My prof and the people on the department are so friendly and full of praise - it's the first time I ever feel people don't despise me, that people don't have a problem with me beeing there. And my prof already asked about doing my phD at his department. 
But...  I drink like a bottle of booze every evening. It's not like I miss a day or that it would affect my research. I'm even in the lab every weekend and holidays because sitting home alone is unnerving after a quarter century. 

But I just don't know. What shall I do? I'm drinking since years because of the loneliness mixed with the pain of seeing other people just living their life with friends where a life is more than just sitting alone at home. Also... I'm gay and.. I'm no 10/10 but also no 0/10. Or perhaps I'm a 0/10 but... bevor moving I always thought in the big city I'd find my spot, find friends and could also participate in the lgbt/gay-scene. Well, I only was laughed at when I strolled around when there was CSD and similiar stuff.

I'm in some way lucky. I _love_ my 'job'. I always wanted to do what i'm doing now as a profession and it looks like that I'm doing it very well. But having no social life for my whole life will be the ruin of me if there won't be a change. I just want sometimes to talk with someone. Just some interactions with someone else which are not on a professional level. Just talking with another human about this and that. What can I do to get that? Also, how shall I cope with seeing everyone having fun in life while my whole life was suffering for... nothing and always feeling like the most ugly person in the room with so many evidence where people told me that/acted like it? I'm no robot that just lives for doing his task. Everytime someone in the lab talks about these holidays or that weekend I feel so much pain in my chest and just vanish for a smoke.

We had the most amazing time, went to three different places, got drunk, made out like teenagers and the whole thing just felt like a movie.

I still want the house though, and have the money to pay the entire security deposit by myself to hold it. It's in an amazing area for a great price, multiple bedrooms, lots of parking, pets allowed, private landlord, the whole nine yards - I know I could find some other roommates willing to rent it. 

But in the meantime, is it smart to pay the deposit by myself to secure it? Like I said, I have the money available but I cannot afford the monthly rent all by myself. I'd have to cross my fingers that I'd find another interested party in a months time.

I need to give the landlord an answer by tomorrow but really want to go for it. I don't think I'll find a deal like this again.

291,"So yeah basically from a young age (13yrs) I was introduced too the greatest thing known on this planet.....MARIJUANA!!!! 

At this time I was meeting up with older friends and just getting blazed god I had some proper whitey missions and god knows how I managed to even make it home not looking spaced out most nights.

Eventually things turned into a nightmarish lifestyle for me due to my parents being so against my way in life with Mary Jane by my side most of the time, it wasn’t like I was going out with my friends causing trouble or getting in to any police situations either they genuinely just despised the whole aspects of what marijuana was and did for the world.

I thought against this for many years of coming in endlessly stoned and being hailed abuse left right and centre but whilst I was working that’s when I started to heavily smoke at the age of 15/16 years as I was earning money and lets face it weeds a lot easier to get than alcohol and I would rather smoke than become addicted to a substance that you can’t control the actions in which it targets your way of thinking and bodily actions. 

Over this period of time at school and how my lifestyle at school had been affected by bullying for me just trying to be another person in the world I’d have slowly realised through having to be independent that I could happily smoke weed rather than go to the lessons that in sense didn’t matter so anytime at school I’d be studying creative lessons and just not following any of the schools conduct in rules but weed probably made me last my school years in high school as tbh it was hell and I’m so happy that I don’t have to look back at that time. 

So eventually I’d become the black sheep of the family being stoned all the time dealing with social anxiety and depression in the best way I could as it genuinely made me chilled not having to panic about being at home with the family from hell as such but yeah this is the situation I testified about to my parents.....

So if I go out to earn money to have some form of pleasure (GETTING HIGH AS FUCK) in my life regardless of what it is that I choose to do, in what form or way would that affect your lifestyle when I’m not bringing anyone harm from this plant which should be legalised just like the alcohol my dad would consume and this wasn’t like a little anmount we are talking like 6/7 bottles a beer a night after work at 7/8 at night then drinking out on weekends at friends etc like yeah the social drinking aspect I can relate too but the whole coming home drinking situation for me didn’t lie so well because when we argued about this his alcoholic attitude would come out into a person who wasn’t nice and would see me as a demon to the household yeah got kicked out few times and had to stay at friends etc.

Even to this day they still hate the fact I use weed daily but I can’t see the fact he drinks everyday as a bad thing because it’s so normalised in such a form which is destroying emotions and personality’s because it’s never one drink or so it’s always next one and next after that where I could have 3 spliff a day and be fine. 

Parents who can’t function in the new modern life need to have lessons on how they understand and process future situations that weren’t relevant at their times in life at my age.

295,"This is gonna be a long post, so my apologies about that.

A few years ago, when I was in 11th grade \(I’m a college sophomore now\) in a country that’s not USA, this guy who used to be in one of my SAT prep classes started to try to talk to me. I was like ok whatever during class. But after that he started messaging me on Snapchat, Facebook and other places WAY too much. I told him to back off and I was uncomfortable, after which is confessed his undying love for me \(mind you, I’ve known him for only a few weeks\). I’m like??? Politely tell him to buzz off. He does for a little bit, but then comes back again and keeps doing that for the next two years I was in that country. I’m not talking annoying messaging. I’m talking threatening to harm himself if I don’t talk to him, getting his mom to try to get to talk to me, manic desires and tendencies, and things on those lines. I was scared for my safety. My cousin even tried talking to him nicely and telling him to stop bothering me, and later very sternly. Nothing worked.

Then I moved here to US for college and I thought that would be the end of my problems. Because he has these hiatus periods, I thought he was gone for good. I had changed all my social media profiles, made everything private, and all that. One day he emails me on my college email, which he got from the online directory apparently. All this time all I’m doing is ignoring him, not responding to anything he says, or even showing any sign I can ever read/see his advances. Some of what he said also includes him coming to US to “surprise” visit me and take me back to my country with him. I thought I can live with just ignoring him, even if it is stressful at times. This goes on till date. I have tried to block him on all social media but he resurfaces with new profiles. 

He has been messaging me on Facebook for a little bit in this past period, but today he messaged a friend of mine on Facebook, telling her how we very super close and dating \(wtf\) back then and he wanted to talk to me. Thank goodness she was a good friend so she told me about it and wouldn’t have any of his shit, and blocked him. But this was the last straw for me. He can’t be harassing my Facebook friends.

Any help or advice is appreciated. I don’t know whether to keep ignoring him, or message him to buzz off and stop bothering my friends, and that I’m in a relationship \(I’m not\). Needless to say, he has many mental issues and he’s not stable, so I don’t want to do anything that tips him over. Any ways to stop this since he is in a different country? ",29Apr2018,11

My parents told me that I needed to stop being silly. By the time I was 13, I kind of knew that I could possibly have depression. I knew that it wasn't normal for someone my age to think about suicide every day and no one should feel as worthless and pathetic as I did then. My relatives seemed to notice and would always ask why I was so sad. How did my parents respond? ""Oh, you know teenagers. They're so moody!"" ""You need to fix your attitude. Stop acting like that. People will think something is wrong with you."" From the time I was 12 until around 16, I thought about suicide literally every day. I would even make comments referring to my thoughts, but my parents would always change the subject to something else or repeat the same sentiment, that I have an attitude problem or I'm not thinking clearly. It was then that I realized that they don't care. When I turned 21, I began to secretly see a psychologist, because I've come to find myself plotting my suicide and I'm scared.

303,"Hey all,

\(There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those who don't wanna read a lot\)

To avoid rambling, I'll cut right to the chase. My girlfriend just turned 22. We've been together and steady for almost 10 months, and I couldn't have asked for a better time. She's smart, kind, generous, and strives to be the best she can in everything. Not to mention, she's funny and fun to be around. 

There's a few key details leading up to the decision I've gotta explain briefly:

Firstly,

She started on birth control about a month after we started going out. First 3 weeks' pills have varying levels of hormones, and the last weeks' worth of pills is a 'placebo' set, meaning there's a bit of a drop and climb in the levels of hormones in her system, sometimes leading to unexplained emotions, like extreme stress, guilt, anger... Not too unheard of for PMS / hormone fluxes.  Girlfriend has asked her doctors \(2\-3 months back\) if mood swings accompany birth control. They've told her yes: it's not unheard of for emotions to be affected by the changing hormone levels.

Second,

Her parents are divorced, they haven't talked for years. Mom's from across the Atlantic and dad from the USA. Mom is the 'alcoholic\-who\-blames\-dad\-for\-everything' type, and dad is bipolar. Every phone call with mom ends with girlfriend crying, as she's blamed for all of her mother's problems. Dad's never around, workaholic. She's tough though, I talk her through it and she always seems fine in the end. 

Last week, dad overheard mom on speaker \(as usual, she's blaming everyone she knows in USA for her life's problems, cussin' up a storm at girlfriend's family here\). Dad took the phone and a screaming match ensued for a few hours. In the midst of this storm, dad exposes some pretty shocking details of mom's past that were unknown till this point. Girlfriend overhears, has a mental breakdown.

And lastly,

Dad's side of the family is the type who has over\-confidence in medication. Any kind of pain or discomfort, and they've got a bottle of pills that can fix it. Not in an unhealthy, addiction flavored way; more like a \(way\) over\-cautious, caring parent type of way. But its to the point that when I mention that my stomach is growling, I'm presented with an anti\-nausea pill before I'm offered toast. 

After the breakdown \(not to mention finals are coming up\), girlfriend wondered if the swings might have something to do with her dad's bipolar\-ism and mom's crazy.

Her reaction: A few days ago \(without including me at all\) she went to her ""family doctor who knows her family's history,"" and asked what she should do. The doctor told her that she's probably depressed, and prescribed her with a 90\-day supply of Bupropion. She was also informed that it might be the birth control's rapid manipulation of hormones, and that she should also skip the placebos, taking only the hormone pills. On the same day, she picked up a bottle of 30, 150MG tablets that are now resting in her purse, ready to be consumed. 

When I asked, she said she was at the doctors office for around a half hour. \(*that's 30 minutes!*\)

I'm astonished that a doctor would tell her to try both remedies at once. Wouldn't it make more sense to try one remedy at a time and narrow down what the problem actually is, before jumping straight to ""You're depressed, it's probably genetic. Here's an anti\-depression prescription, it'll be ready today"" No tests, no discussions, no explanation of what Bupropion does or what possible side effects it has. In and out in a half hour, bottle of pills already prepped at the local pharmacy. 

And even if they had substantial, concrete evidence to support the decision, I simply *cannot* get on board with the idea that my beautiful, funny, happy girlfriend is depressed. After 10 months, I would not at all describe her as ever once appearing depressed. Everyone has little dips of sadness, and especially when you have such heavy hormonal changes on a monthly basis! But depression?? I just can't bring myself to support the idea for one second. 

Lastly, to support why I'm so upset: I'm no doctor, hell I'm barely 20. But I've done my research on Bupropion, and I know exactly how it works. \(Here's a good link that explains it's function\)

I don't believe that this is the correct way to be using Bupropion at all. Hell, you could give this pill to a man who just gambled his life away and is living on the streets, and he'd feel like a million dollars. But is that the right way to cheer him up? 

So here's why I'm here:

I love my girlfriend. I really do. She's the happiest, best thing that's ever happened to my life. But my instinctual reaction is to tell her that she will not take those pills, or we're through. I don't wanna say that! I can't... She means the world to me! But holy hell! If she's that willing to jump on a life\-long prescription of daily pills \(at age 22!!!\) that replaces genuine happiness with a chemical, what else will she lay down for? I don't know. It just seems wrong. 

I sat and tried to convince her that there must be another way, and I tried to explain her that it doesn't make sense to attempt and solve the problem with two remedies, and she just kept saying stuff like 'it'll be ok"" and ""I have to do something"" and ""my dad knows how these pills work, they're safe."" 

All I know is her doctor's a lazy fool, and that she's just looking for a way out and she'll take the first solution that anyone throws at her. She's tried meditating dozens of times, and she's been going to counseling since she first moved to USA in 2015. I understand that attitude is a choice... I can't seem to get that into her head. 

TL;DR / conclusion:

If she takes these Bupropion tablets as instructed, they *will* cure her 'depression.'  Chemically, they can't fail. And that's what I'm afraid of. Because once those pills 'cure' it, she'll solidify the concept in her brain that it's the only way for her to be happy in life. But I have to believe that there's another way. There has to be. And I want with all of my heart and soul to stop her from becoming dependent on these pills. I just don't know the right way to do it. ",29Apr2018,1
304,"ever since my 8yr ltr ended 2.5 yrs ago, I've always been in and out of relationships, like if one ends I'm already back on tinder or OKC and finding the next girl(s) to talk to. Its always the same cycle, I find a girl I really dig, she ends up cheating on me. I then go try to console the pain and fight the feelings of loneliness by jumping right back into online dating and usually date someone I don't like that much but the company is better than nothing so this goes on for a month or two before we break up. Rinse and repeat.

I don't even know if im broken up with the girl im currently dating at the moment as we haven't talked in two and a half days from talking non stop usually for the last two months. Back story on that, friday night the boys were all going to the bar to watch the game so I invited her and she said no she'll just go home instead so I said alright and told them I Was going, few hours later when its time to go, she starts telling me that I know what she wants, which after repeating a million times I don't know, despite her inisiting that I do, she texts me to stay at my house with her. I said no I've already told everyone I""m going, so she leaves without a kiss or a hug, just a bye, and we havent talked since. So childish, if she had told me that upfront I probably would have stayed.

Anywho, I have so much going on in my life I dont even really have time to date at the moment, but the urge is already there to start dating again and find someone new to occupy my time with.

315,"I'm really trying to get over the fact that my boyfriend chose to view a video that was of a teacher in our previous school (3 years ago, we weren't dating back then). A handful of his friends basically conspired to take upskirting videos of the teacher, and sent it to their clique individually. I was pretty heartbroken when I knew that he chose to watch the video because he was ""immature and horny"" (he said that himself). I told him that it wasn't about the lack of maturity but the lack of principles, and gave an analogy of how children don't tend to steal because it's a known fact that stealing is wrong. 'Twas also the first time I cried in front of him because he was the first guy I've ever decided to be in a relationship with and it made me question if I made a wise choice (context: Before we got together, my friends were discouraging me because they didn't really believe he was a good fit). His friends tried defending him by saying ""Hey be grateful he isn't gay!"" or ""It's in the past!"". Both reasons sounded ridiculous to me due to obvious reasons. I did try to accept that it's in the past but we both knew that my problem laid in the fact that he knew it was wrong but still viewed the video. I honestly tried to find loopholes to forgive him, like asking for details about the video (bad quality = can't see it as clearly etcetc). He said it was in bad quality, but you could see what the teacher was wearing underneath, and I was very relieved to know she wore safety shorts, but it really didn't help lessen my disappointment in him still. He cried when I cried because he does the crying in the relationship hence it definitely shook him a little to know that I was this sad over his mistake (I'm an INTJ). I want to forgive him because I know he's remorseful, and I know he loves me dearly, but it's just painfully difficult to, hence I'm going to trouble you Redditors for a bit.

I’m in my second year of uni, currently studying digital media technology. Don’t want to delve too much into my personal life but I’m a boy, turning 21 soon. I’m really laidback and that’s where the problem lies. 

I’ve got a PHP based e-commerce website due for Thursday. I missed the original deadline last Thursday so I’m capped at 40%, so it’s basically a pass or fail deadline I have now. I haven’t really gone to many labs or lectures for the course because I tend to just learn it all on the last week and cram it that way. This is the first ever assignment I’ve gone past the deadline on.

After completing the sign up and log in element of the website I’m struggling piece together the products page, shopping cart and admin features to the website. I’m only going for the lower boundaries anyway but I can’t seem to make any sense of how to do it. I followed a YouTube tutorial for many of the bits I’ve done, and the YouTube tutorials I’m watching now don’t really fit into what I already have. I understand what’s going on when I’m run through it, I’d like to think I understand the concepts on a very basic level for a computing based student.

The purpose of this isn’t really for direct PHP help, however if anyone has any then I won’t say no lol. It’s just more for help around different ways I can approach the coursework. I’ve got a few more things from other modules this week however I’m confident I can get them done. I’ve gone my whole life learning how to get around things more efficiently, rather than directly learning them.

Anyway, besides that, my mother reckons I might have been this way due to childhood trauma and conditioning. I didn't really consider it that much until I properly thought about it.

Now onto the more sensitive part. My dad has always been, how do I put it? A terrible human being, absolutely disgusting and vile and I've been having his sexual comments and off colour advances for mostly all my adolescent life. (Sexual comments, butt slapping, obsessions with my body, peaking in when I get changed, odd romantic comments, ect, ect) He has basically done the family huge harm - and on top of that, he's a psychopath that tried to smash my head in with a hammer! Amazing stuff, I've only scraped the top here but I've always been pre-conditioned in that sense to fear men for that reason, somewhere in the back of my mind men give me the heeby jeebies because I'm scared they'd all end up like my amazing dad. 

Then cut to me being a starry-eyed wannabe artist at the age of 12. I had a famous 18-year-old female artist that I always idolised approach me and surprisingly wanted to be my friend. As a 12-year-old, I didn't really think this was odd so I completely went with it. At the time life was pretty rough, I was picked on quite a bit and outcasted - my idol was literally my only friend at this time. Honestly, to me, she was absolutely perfect, and I honestly wanted to keep her at all costs. I guess as the friendship progressed she'd want me to do extremely perverted acts, like teach me how to masturbate, and want my pictures and engage in really explicit roleplays. I had this connection for her, and since her weird perversions were at the time complimented with her pristine personality I thought nothing of it. In fact, this actually went on for six years to the point I was in love with her. I'm not exactly sure in what way, but I thought I needed her until she ultimately stopped talking to me when I hit 16 years old. I told my mum, she was obviously mortified. I don't even think I could call myself a 'survivor' I still don't feel as if I were abused, honestly, I've been blaming it on myself but my mum thinks it's a massive reason why I swing towards females - apparently, I never used to be like this. 

Also, I don't know if this is relevant but when I was 12/13 years old, my next door neighbour who was indeed a female was really drunk, forced me to sit on her laps in my room and groped me - told me she'd take me horse riding but she never did. What a waste.

So TLDR: A shit dad and then two sexual encounters with female predators apparently made me bisexual as a comfort mechanism or am I well and truly bisexual? What are your opinions? I know my mum is homophobic, but if it's because I'm traumatised I'd rather seek help than try and help myself in unhealthy ways. 

Sorry, If it seems like I'm taking this light-heartedly. I just joke about terrible shit that happens to me. I figuired since we can have some sort of control over own emotions - I'd rather laugh about it right?

333,"Just as the title says, it's been a pain in the ass for me for years and I still can't handle it.

I'm definitely not a person which wants to make lots of friends, but the trouble is when I can't have any at all. I ran out of topics to say and I find small chit\-chat pointless \(later I just experience an awkward silence\). Recently I've met a girl \(like 3 weeks ago\) talked for a while and we even went out for something to drink \(the truth is that it was my first time, going out somewhere for a drink/food with someone, so I felt  kinda lucky\). The problem is that after 3 weeks I've ran out of things to say and she is a shy person which makes it even worse. It also really feels bad when she treats my friend better than me \(hugging and all that shit, while she is very distant to me\), when I asked her if he minds me talking to her, she just laughed and said ""why would he?"" \(obviously it was a question if he is her boyfriend, still that felt weird to me after that answer\). I think that our ""friendship"" is just starting to fall apart and I feel more tolerated than accepted.

The thing is that people tell me that I'm annoying, while I try not to be, people never specify why they think so which makes it even worse. My relationships never last more than 1 month and when I'm around people \(at school, or near my brother's friends\) I feel very lonely \(I actually feel good when I'm not at school, or around my brother's friends, I don't feel lonely at all when I'm not around people\).

Can someone tell me how to get any topics to say? I ran out of things to say very easily and that's a lot of trouble for me, also giving me any advice on how to be a better person would help a lot.

335,"So, I'm leaving college in under two months, and the reality of that has just sunk in. My computing teacher convinced me to get a degree apprenticeship. At the time, I had zero doubts that this is what I wanted to do. I could get a degree, without having to go to university (side note, I'd ""known"" I didn't want to go to university for years prior to this).

Problem with this is, I can't find anything. I've looked everywhere and have only found one web development apprenticeship remotely close to me; it's only a higher, and I heard nothing back after applying.

I'm starting to freak out now, not only because I can't find any apprenticeships, but also because I'm really regretting not applying for uni. Now that I'm leaving, I realise how much I've wasted my life up to now. In all my time at school/college, I've been outside with friends twice; college is the only time I see anybody my age, so I'm dreading leaving.

I now realise why everybody else is going to university. If I'm being honest, I how it sounds bad, but I couldn't care less about the qualification I get at the end of it. It's the experience I want. I want to carry on learning and I want to redeem myself and actually spend time with friends.

I got a job at McDonald's about a month ago, but quit after three weeks. I couldn't physically take it, which I think really changed my mind on the apprenticeship thing.

Well, now I have no idea what to do with my life. I'm still hopelessly looking for an apprenticeship, but even if I find one, I really doubt I'll get it. I'm stressing out so much, and my parents are stressing even more.

Please, somebody help me; I really messed this up. What do I do now?",29Apr2018,1

341,"Hi!

I'm currently studying computer science in a small town in Germany for 6 months. I'm also working in a small IT consulting company and they recently made me a very attractive offer.

They asked me to quit my study and start working in the company full time. They would cover all costs for a private university where I could study the same course and I would get a decent salary, as well. In my opinion a great offer and it would take me about 3 years to complete the study. 

I thought about quitting uni anyway because I don't want to stay in my hometown anymore. But if I accept the job offer I have to stay in my hometown for a minimum of 4 years. And starting working full time without much free time. Don't understand me wrong. I have a great family and great friends here but I feel like I'm not happy if I stay here. It was always a dream to travel the world and live in different cities far away from home. It feels like missing something from the world if I stay here. I'm also start to regret going to uni immediately after finishing school. So now I don't know what to do:

- take the job offer and have a great education + save job in the future with good salary. But staying in my hometown.

- refuse the offer and quit uni. Going on travel and get back to uni after 1/2 years

344,"Hey everybody.
Three months ago I've met with a girl on the internet. We started talking and we still talk to this day everyday. We talk about everything, and we kid around a lot but sometimes we talk about important stuff too. That's how I met her. She has a personal problem and I have my own problems, so we're here for each other. I compliment her often and she gets so happy. I started to like her and about a month later she started sending heart emojis and I though she also liked me. I asked her to be my valentine on Valentine's day, via text. Yeah I know, it's silly but I wanted to give it a shot. She said that I was a friend to her. She also said that she cared for me, even more than she cares for herself! Probably because she needs my support through this hard time in her life. So we kept talking. She had a birthday about a couple of weeks ago and I sent her a long text containing full of compliments, and she loved it! Recently she started to send me kissing emojies with heart, and she sends me a lots of hearts occasionally. But I don't thinks she sends those as if she has feelings for me. I don't know. We live like 10 hours from each other. She has school and I have school, so we can't meet in person. But we're looking forward to it as soon as it is possible. I haven't tried to call her since I am very shy just like her. We've talked about this but it hasn't happened yet. I still like her very much. I've seen her, she sometimes send photos of her and she has also seen me and she thinks I'm good looking. I am pretty much in friendzone right now. Is it possible to get out of this friendzone? If so, how? Is it stupid to have feelings for someone whom you haven't met in real life?",29Apr2018,1
345,"February last year my girlfriend who I was madly in love with broke up with me, I was experiencing issues with my mental health at the time and she said that she found it too hard to be with me knowing that sometimes she'd call me and I'd be fine, and others I'd be really low.
It's not that I was ever horrid to her, or would take it out on her, but as I know she cared a lot for me she found it difficult, and having never really experienced anything on a deep emotional level before in life got scared and ran away. Blocked me on everything and refused to talk to me. In the fleeting conversations we did have during this time it got very emotional, I tried to commit suicide, and as you can imagine my head wasn't exactly the clearest when we did speak. I think my overly emotional reaction probably tore apart any chance of reconciliation in the future - something she said she hoped for initially... that we'd cross paths again and things would be different. 
She then moved city for university, 

It's now over a year later and I still miss her, I still feel as though she may have been 'the one' and I think that enough time has passed to not be able to dismiss how I feel. I have to acknowledge that. I don't know what to do to be honest, maybe I'm naive to think anything can be done, I just know that there's something special about her and what we had and I miss her.

346,"First let me preface this by saying that my neighbor is not the type of guy you want to mess with, let alone confront.  He is a dangerous guy, deals drugs and has constant traffic and makes living in my community a nightmare.  All of that aside, I have no problem with his lifestyle and never wanted to interfere until now.  He has AT LEAST three pitbull puppies and is obviously raising them to fight.  He lives in a second story condo and keeps them locked on the porch EVERY DAY ALL DAY.  There is food and water, but the porch is COVERED in feces.  Additionally, the sounds are horrendous from these poor dogs.  There are scattered license plates and baby dolls for them to ""play"" with. These puppies have to be a few weeks old.  I have called thw cops anonymously a couple times and they won't do anything.  They sent an environmental officer out once amd nothing ever came of it.  I took pictures of the nightmare on the porch and sent it to the property management team and have still heard nothing.  I thought about getting a ladder and stealing them.  Its that bad.  Does anyone have any advice? Who can I contact? Please help.

347,"I (m) recently just got out of a three and a half year relationship with my girlfriend, because I hadn't been feeling happy, or as invested as before. We had talked about it previously, and decided to wait and see it the feeling would pass. It didn't and we broke up. What ensued was a lot of her blaming and guilting me, along with bad-mouthing to mutual friends. I am hurt by this, we had always been there for each other before and during the relationship, and I had really hoped we could have an amicable breakup. 

She has been doing this for a couple of weeks now, and it doesn't look close to stopping. 

I like to think I'm a decent, laid back person. I don't party, or anything like that. During our relationship she was never a wild person either, very cautious and never wanted too much to do with sexual activities. Now, she's hooking up with a guy who is obviously not a great person, from just being a massive jerk to engaging with drugs. She's talking to all of my friends now about threesomes, and how big this new guy's dick is, and comparing it to mine. 

Never in my life have I felt more betrayed by someone I trusted and cared about. My self esteem has taken a big hit, and some of my friends aren't the same around me. I think a lot now about how I may never find someone ""perfect"" for me, when I see friends with their SO's and how happy they are. I guess I just don't know how to look at the situation, having never been in it before. She was my first everything, and I did love her. Any advice would be great, and I'll try to answer when I can. 
Thank you.",29Apr2018,1
