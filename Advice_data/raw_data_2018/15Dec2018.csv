0,"Im a 13F and Im a major introvert
Literally

I have mild panic attacks (crying, screaming, completely out of control) at the literal thought of going outside.

Literally today in PE the changing room door was locked shut and we got a free period, while other people were chatting and stuff I just sat awkwardly on the floor and doodled in my planner. The teacher invited to sit with her on the bench, and not wanting to be rude, I accepted. 

We had a 5 MINUTE conversation about how I “tend to isolate myself” and after I felt incredibly exhausted. Like I could of just died right there and then.


Another incident involves music class, where we were assigned a group assessment where we have to play the chords and melody in the piano,  (1 person doing chords, one doing melody) and we need to have one person sing. The minimum was a group of 3.

I basically begged the teacher to work alone and now I have to play the chords and melody AND sing all by myself even though ive never even touched a piano before this.
So basically I just go to the music room and practice over and over and over.

The school looks down on people like me, and I have low grades due to my “lack of social skills”. People have began blaming my Mum for not raising me right even though Ive always been like this.


Tl;Dr: Teachers and school look down on my for being super introverted, get confronted in PE and do a 3 person group assessment by myself ",15Dec2018,1
1,"Hi all,

So title really sums everything up, but to go more in depth:

I have been in and out of college since immediately after I graduated high school in 2013. I have majored in 4 seperate fields since then.  Cyber Security was my latest, and likely most thought out endeavor -- at least I thought. Luckily I have only taken one semester in it, but I recently realized it's just not for me. 

I think the allure of the potential salary combined with my love of gaming/potentially helping people combined to create a false belief that I would enjoy this field. The reality is though, I hate talking about tech outside the confines of gaming, even talking about gaming I find incredibly forced, and I frankly find the field to be dull if I look beyond the salary.

While I found my dissatisfaction with IT this semester, I also found a field that I love (potentially), in the realm of political science and research. I have thought about making this my major, but I'm worried about continually pissing 2k away a semester (Community college).

I have a decent job monetarily for my age, making around 45k a year, but it does not engage my mind, and is not something I can imagine doing for more than probably a year more. I need advice. 

Thanks all!

Usually I don't show up to these sorts of things, I make up an excuse but I know she will be really pissed if I don't go so I'm going to go. 


She will be busy most of the time, I'm sort of friends with one other person going but her clique of friends are also going so she will be hanging out with them.

3,"I currently am an exercise physiologist working in a cardio/rehab rehabilitation gym. The best part about my job, and the main reason I am still employed there, is for my schedule. I work three days a week, 9 hours a day. 

The career change I was offered is in the financial world, as a financial advisor's assistant. The job has more potential for growth, a good salary, and great hours. However, my background has always been in health and wellness. 

The biggest thing holding me back is the fact that I get two days during the work week where I spend off, at home, with my two sons (3 and 1.5). I'm not ready to work 5 days a week, even at part-time hours.

11,"      I(14m) have a crush on a girl(14f) in my high school. I really think she’s just absolutely stunning, she makes my day great just when I speak to her. Butterflies run rampant in my stomach and I’m sure she reciprocates some feelings. However, I learned that she smokes weed on a weekly-monthly basis. 
     Now don’t get me wrong, obviously some people have anxiety issues or they need it for medical reasons, but she does not need it, nor does she lead a life stressful enough to smoke that much. Smoking really disgusts me, and it hurts to know that she smokes, because seeing people addicted to something is sad for me. I don’t know how to handle this, she’s an amazing person but she’s only 14 and smoking. 
     To recap, 14 y/o crush who is a girl smokes regularly, and it makes me quite sad to see, and I’m also disgusted by it.  
I want to know if there is anything I should say to her/ do that could possibly make this situation better for myself. Advice?

13,"I don't even know how to start this post. Well as the title says I'm starting to fall for one of my best friends, one who I consider my sister. We're REALLY close. Lets call her Sarah. We're both 16 by the way. 

I've known Sarah for little over a year now. We met in class and since we were both new in school we sat next to each other and became really good friends over the last year. I've always kinda liked Sarah, but since she had a boyfriend I just repressed my feelings towards her. This changed last August, after she broke up with her boyfriend. Turns out she too liked me and we agreed to be friends with benefits as soon as we got home from the holidays. Just a few days before the school year starts, Sarah gets back with her boyfriend. This didnt sit well with me, but I figured we never really did anything aside from sexting and sending nudes to each other so hey no big deal.

Well turns out she breaks up with him AGAIN, this time for good. Needless to say I took advantage of the situation and made out with her. After we made out and she got home, she texted me and told me that she wasnt really ready to be making out with dudes since she just broke up with her bf. I was like yeah okay cool take your time I can wait, I'm here for you if you need me. This all happened in September btw. 

So halloween comes around, and here in Spain we usually celebrate halloween by drinking alcohol and smoking pot in park benches just so you know, so I get there with my group of friends and I run into her, and her being high as a kite confesses to me she's been fucking some dude and hadnt told me in case it would hurt my feelings. I played it off and told her that it didnt matter and that we werent anything in the first place, she believed me and went with her group again. I felt pretty fucked up after that. 

Now comes the reason I'm writing this post. Last Sunday she calls me to walk her to her to her house, because she'd been smoking weed and was too high to walk home by herself.

We meet up and I notice right away she keeps looking at me. She then goes ""I still have time until my curfew lets sit somewhere and talk"" I said sure and we sit on a bench. The whole walk to the bench she keeps complimenting me, but I shrugged it off since she was pretty high. We sit down, and we start talking. She tells me she used to like me and that she's still attracted to me, and I tell her I felt the same way. Next thing I know, she pulls me by my hoodie and starts french kissing me out of nowhere. I walk her home, kiss her on her doorstep and head home. I thought my feelings were reciprocated for once. 

Next day comes, and she says she doesn't remember the 30 minute conversation we had on the bench, probably the most beautiful conversation we've ever had, and she barely remembers kissing me. She tells me she sees me as a friend and that she was high and not responsible for whatever happened. I told her that I didnt understand how one day she could be all over me and the next only seeing me as a friend, and she days she doesn't want to talk about it anymore. I agreed because if I kept going I was probably going to burst in tears.

So I went home and pretty much cried all the way there. I just didnt understand what I did wrong, because I knew and I know she's still attracted to me but I really don't knlw what to do. I really really like her and it's driving me crazy. Any advice is welcome, thanks for reading",15Dec2018,1

16,"Hey!
So, my partner and I rarely argue, but when we do it's because I'm naturally easy to anger. Today, we were having a conversation about my older sister who is a renown asshole, I was trying to word my thoughts but he kept interrupting me saying mean things about my sister(which I was too so it's not like it came out of nowhere). I just kinda snapped and told him to shut up. Because I got defensive cus even though she sucks, she's my sister. Anyways, he got upset cus whenever I get mad, I have a tendency to just tell him to shut up or just have small sudden outbursts where I'm just a complete jerk. 
Like always, I immediately regretted it and apologized. He got upset because he's tired of my being so mean. I told him we should talk it out but he said that it happens so often that he doesn't even know what to say. Which bothers me because he never really justifies my feelings, he just shuts me out. 
Now I do not know what to do because he just won't talk to me and ignored me when I tried to apologize and explain myself.
How do I make things better for us?

19,"Seriously at a loss right now. My nephew just turned 10 a couple days ago and he had an appointment with a therapist today. He has been going pretty regularly for a couple years now and this was the first time he lost control in front of her. A few minutes into a regular session, she mentioned wanting to have some bloodwork done on him for something to do with his medication. He is on one pill for anxiety and another to help his appetite because the first one decreases it. That is what he takes and it’s actually less than what has been recommended (i.e. adhd and other behavioural correctives).  My mother was at the appointment with him (I should mention he lives with her and my dad full time since he was about 6 months old)  and she witnessed him start to scream, grit his teeth, hit himself, scratch himself, and just keep repeating “you’ll never touch me. I’m not going, you can’t make me!” The entire thing lasted for over half an hour while my mom and two other therapists tried to calm him down. He did not stop until they mentioned calling 911 to have him taken away. He then started apologizing and begging my mom saying that he didn’t mean it and didn’t know why he was doing that. He has acted this way before. Hurting himself, threatening to run away, threatening to kill himself even. Started mostly this past year. He is constantly anxious and doesn’t want to try anything new. He hides behind my mom a lot for support. He is terrified of my dad. In fact, after the appointment on the way home, all he said was “please don’t tell Pop.” 
My nephew’s parents are mostly out of the picture. His mom lives in different care homes or on the streets. She is diagnosed bipolar schizophrenic and used to visit him sometimes but has not seen him in over a year. His dad (my brother) comes around rarely and treats him more like a little brother. There’s more to that but I will move on. 
My mom is very caring and tries to do what is best for my nephew. My dad, nearly 60, is a product of his time. Believes everything can be fixed with a spanking. He threatens to “beat his ass” for almost anything that he deems unacceptable. Since he retired a couple years ago, that is pretty much anything my nephew does. He yells at him pretty much every day. He grabs him suddenly while my nephew is walking by and hugs him tight and says he lives him but my nephew will almost always respond with “ouch, too tight, that hurts, etc,” and my dad will drop him aside and call him a sissy and say he’s being ridiculous. He will actually get mad at this kid for not being into his forceful and sudden affection.  We know my nephew has sensory issues. Diagnosed on the autism scale, walks on his toes, and constantly tears things into tiny pieces without even thinking about it. Honestly I could go on. Basically, I see this: a child with a few behavioural issues due to a combination of genetics and environment who is nervous in his own home. I see my dad making everything worse. A lot worse. He is a good provider and will apologize after his outburst (sometimes) but at the end of the day, he has the emotional range of a child. Can never be wrong and if you don’t agree with him, you can “shut up and get out of his house”. My mom calls me daily crying and worried they are screwing up my nephew. Afraid he is getting worse and actually questioning if she needs to leave my father. They have been married for 33 years and he can be a great guy, but his parenting skills are terrible and greatly impacting my developing nephew. 
Today, she wants to know if she should send my nephew to be voluntarily committed and assessed for a few days. I don’t know what to tell her. They are in Texas and I have seen the place they sent his mom, it is not okay to treat people that way. He is just a child. How can I help him?? PS-I live in Canada now and feel pretty useless. It’s tearing me up. 

TLDR: my nephew displayed self-harming behaviour at the therapist today and she recommended committing him but I think most of his issues are due to living with my angry emotionally abusive father full time. I don’t want him lost in a system. What can I do to help?",15Dec2018,1
20,"My brother in law is 18 and currently lives with me and my wife in our apartment. He is also somewhat slow in learning and understanding some things. I feel like that detail is important to all of this. I'll try to give a bit of background to this. My wife's mother is not a good person, plain and simple. She is very narcissistic and controlling and would physically and verbally abuse both of her kids, mainly my wife, for years. She's also not very smart and has gotten multiple DUI's and spends money like she's loaded, but repeatedly not being able to pay her expenses. We're currently no contact with her since around last December. 

My senior year, I helped my then girlfriend, now wife move out and in with my family; we did this while her mom was at work and she told her brother to ride the bus without her because she forgot something at home. It was crazy and nerve wracking. Within hours, both of them found out. Her brother began crying and her mom began to threaten us and my family. She threatened to call police and come for her which was followed by apologies and crying, and then more threats. She eventually stopped after about 2 weeks. After this, we began no contact with her and involuntarily with her brother because she wouldn't let us speak with him in any way. 

Fast forward to recently. My wife has been secretly talking with her brother for a few months. He would tell her about their mom and what she would do to him. This included yelling and threatening over stupid things, bad mouthing us saying we're bad people and how we don't appreciate what she did for both of us, again, mainly directed at my wife, and lying to him and others to continue her facade of being perfect or get her way with people. She even told him that we tried to brainwash him so he would leave her. It's so hypocritical that I can't even fathom these mental gymnastics she does. On the bright side, however, he now has a job, pays his own phone, and is doing well in school, and I feel that he's matured a lot in the past year. 

This past Monday, he called out of nowhere and began telling us he wanted to leave his mom. My wife was ready as soon as she heard that, but I was way more hesitant. I know he has pretty severe and unhealthy attachment issues to his mom and didn't want to have to take him back after a few days. I asked if he was 100% sure he wanted to leave and that he wouldn't change his mind after a few days or even weeks; We also told him he can't tell his mom or anyone associated with her where we live. He said yes and we brought him while his mom was out and he is currently living with us.

I feel like a major idiot now. Within 3 days, he brought up how he wants to go back and how he believes his mom learned his lesson. He talks about how he misses her and wants to go back next week; We've even overheard him talking to his mom in the other room or in the bathroom when he thinks we can't hear. It's genuinely infuriating and I've tried to keep it suppressed. I've talked to him about the situation and explaining why he's better off with us while trying not to make it feel like I was attacking him or his mom. We talked about his mom's mental health issues and her extremely immature and poor decisions, from the way she spends money and takes his money to her repetitive dangerous decisions like driving drunk and associating with bad people to her relationship decisions with people around her like lying about finances and even about her and her son's age. I asked him how he felt and he even explained and told me how he thinks she needs to fix herself. It really felt like he really understood what we were talking about and matured drastically from not even one year ago. I praised him for explaining things to me and for having a job and paying his own things and just being more of an adult now. We've even talked about compromises like taking him to visit his mom and spend holidays with her, and he seemed open to the idea. It felt great having this serious talk with him because it felt like I wasn't talking to a kid anymore. 
 
That's why it hurts that much more. I've never really told my wife, but I genuinely care and want to help him. My, ashamed to say, MIL is a God awful influence and the rest of my wife's family agree that CPS should have taken them years ago to live with their grandma. Her decisions affect him horribly and I can't stand him being with her. I want him to succeed and live a comfortable life, away from his mom and her crook boyfriend. We can give him his own space here and anything he needs for school and life whereas he was living in a literal 20 sq ft sunroom in a 2 bedroom apartment with 4 other people. I just don't know how to help him get over toxic mother and his attachment issues. I know therapy is the best choice but what else can we do to convince him to stay with us? I know he can become independent but his unhealthy attachment and his mom are holding him back.

Hey [/r/advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice)! This just happened yesterday, and I've sort of been struggling with how I feel about the situation. I'm not usually one to go to reddit for advice, but I definitely feel like an outside perspective on this whole thing would help me work through this.

My girlfriend (of 1 year) has been working at her new restaurant job for a little more than 2 months now. So far she loves it, and is very happy with the environment and the people she works with. Only one of her coworkers weirds her out a bit, but that's easily handled, no big deal at all. Everyone else seems great from what she's told me, but something she told me yesterday struck me as a bit odd.

Apparently, a couple weeks ago two of her coworkers were joking around and playfully asked her if she ""thinks \[her\] boyfriend can take us in a fight?"" She laughed it off, and just asked why that was even a necessary/relevant question, but apparently they insisted she answer in a sort of ""come on, what do you think?"" way, so she finally just said ""yeah, I do."" and I believe it just sort of fizzled out from there.

However, yesterday, another coworker who is friends with those original two brought it up to her again, ""jokingly"" and she responded the same way, but this time adding ""Yeah I do, hes got height on you!"" to which he responded ""Someone told me I could take him."" She insists both of these incidents were done in a very joking/playfully matter, and I completely believe her. But what am I really supposed to think here? I'm not sure how to grasp the concept of jokingly talking about if her significant other could take her coworkers in a fight. She's told me about their personalities, how they're sort of ""rough-housy"" types (it's worth noting I'm basically the opposite in that regard), and I get that there's those kind of people as well, but the whole thing just didn't resonate well with me when I heard it. For the record, I've been to her work, but never met these specific coworkers. It's very conflicting for me because she tells me she likes the other employees, and that they're generally really nice to be around. I feel like its worth mentioning also that she's told me one of these coworkers is evidently on probation for getting into a fight with someone and hurting them, and the other has ""been in a few fights before"". One of those two, I forget which, also has cheated on his current girlfriend before (both coworkers are in relationships). I'm really not trying to paint these guys as bad people, shit happens I know, but obviously that's going to make me, as her boyfriend, a little cautious/put off.

There's an upcoming Christmas party for her work that we're going to together, and I know I'll have no problems getting through a work function thing like that, but can someone tell me if I'm off-base for already having pretty low expectations meeting these people? Also, am I wrong for feeling uncomfortable with the notion of her going and getting drinks with said coworkers after work? The latter isn't something that's occurred yet, but her and I discussed that hypothetical once we started talking about all this other stuff.

34,"A friend of mine is on exchange in Europe currently renting an apartment with another student. His housemate has over the past months enforced some pretty unreasonable demands and has generally made his stay very unpleasant - to the point at which he would like to move out and find another place. The occupation of the apartment is all under the name of his housemate, who pays the full sum of the monthly rent to the property owner, while my friend then pays his housemate half that sum as his share of the rent.

39,"Hi guys. I’m 19 and I got to a small university where everyone knows each other.

I met this guy at a party last Frida and we exchanged numbers and hit it off very well.

I ended up getting drunk on Wed night, which is a lil out of character for me but hey I’m so with finals so....

Anyhow I ended up surprise texting him nude photos of me including some very intimate ones.

To my horror he has since started referring to me as a slur and he has been passing my pictures around without me permission.

It’s true I didn’t “ask for permission” to send them and he didn’t even ask me for them but when I was drunk it seemed like a brilliant decision.

I’m still pissed that he’s passing around these photos and now I’m getting a reputation around school that I don’t deserve.

Was this my fuck up for sending unsolicited nudes or is his this fault for sharing something that I intended *for his eyes only*?

40,"First things first. I'm 29 years woman old and am currently in a 5 years relationship with whom, till recently, I thought was a great guy. Because of his job, we moved from a big urban centre to a smaller town in the last year, which required a series of adaptations from both of us. While not that far away from where we used to live, our lives indeed changed because of it, Workwise, it has not changed that much to me, I always worked home office and did meetings elsewhere, so distances aside, nothing much changed. I make a decent amount of money my self and this change was done because my boyfriend had a very good career opportunity in a company in this new town.

So our story begins, I always liked to keep myself fit, so naturally, upon moving, I've found a new gym, the problem? It is a bit more limited in space and activities, but that turned out for the best because of that, I've met Boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I've never liked pumping iron and since the other classes weren't cutting it for me, I've decided to give both a try, I am now hooked to both.

Not only I feel great training, I feel very satisfied in the way you can perceive yourself progressing in martial arts. The big bonus resides in my gym mates, sincerely one of the most honest, friendly and happy bunch I've ever met. The problem? 13 out of 15 are guys.

At first, that was not a problem, until my bf actually went there to see me rolling, in close contact with other men. He started to complain but I quickly shut him down by inviting him to join us and see how sexual that kind of contact was, to which he deed, but gave up a month later. He was never fond of physical activities to begin so I was happy he tried and understanding when he decided to quit.

Things seemed to normalise in the next months until I was invited to go camping with the other gym people. I would never go to the middle of nowhere with a bunch of men without my bf, so I asked him to come with me, I always loved camping and he knew, so he came along. It was a 2 days and a half stay at one of the other member's ranch, in which we had a nice camping spot with a creek where you could fish and swim.

Everything was fine, the guys spent all day fishing, hunting, joking, training and grilling their catches. Food was amazing and I even had my own bathroom, I felt really included and really thankful to be there, for the first time, I began to realise that the countryside indeed had its charms. By the night of the second day, the problems began. My boyfriend started to get really angry at anything and to lash out of other people, to the point of being rude. He started complaining about the fish being badly seasoned, badly cooked and so on. Next thing, he is trying to measure his dick by insistently trying to flex about his new paycheck, trying to force the other people with us to reveal their income. I pulled him aside and asked him to stop, told him he was being not only rude but also a fool since he was flexing his income on people who were not exactly poor, including the owner of the big ass ranch which was our host. He then began lashing out at me, how I dragged him here to put him down because he could never win, I just had to put him down by making him stay around buff, handsome, shirtless men all day. That he knew they were flirting with me (they were not and are almost all in long relationships for the record) and so on.

The final day was very awkward, everybody was a bit quieter and the fun was ruined, at least for me. When we got home I tried to talk about it but he just lashed at me again, telling me I only went there because I enjoyed the attention I was given. He began a very asinine speech about how I was just being a bitch, that I was being childish and futile and so on. He ended up accusing me of doing it because he knew I've never wanted to move. We argued really hard and went to sleep in bad terms. The icing on the cake, he asked to at least show him some respect by making my Facebook profile private so the ""grunts"" would not have anywhere to stalk my picture.

I honestly feel very irritated and don't know exactly how to proceed. It's being almost a week, we are barely talking and I'm on the verge of dumping him if he doesn't grow a pair and apologises.",15Dec2018,1

42,"Hi, it's a long one

So, a bit of a backstory. When I was around 13, I met two people on the internet, a boy we'll call Adrian and a girl, we'll call her Lisa. So, we quickly became friends and began seeing each other (with our parents' approval, of course), despite living each on a different side of the country.

Long story short, Lisa went on her own way but we still got news occasionally, and Adrian and I became best friend (truth be told, we actually began dating before we/he realized he was gay). So, at this point I'm around 18 and we're able to see each other 2 times a year.

However, our relationship is still ambiguous (mind you, he had a boyfriend at the time and I believe he's still with him today) and I felt kinda stuck mentally with the idea we might get together someday but knowing it's quite impossible since, you know, I'm a girl, he's a boy, and a gay one.

Nevermind, we keep on seeing each other, nothing happens besides a kiss on a New Years Eve. We decided to go on holiday together, to another country, just the two of us. Plan was for me to meet him at his place, roughly a 2-hour train ride, then sleepover, then take the plane.

So we did. Holidays were great, until the last day. Adrian felt sick, so I had to tidy the place and prepare our luggages. We had to leave around 3 in the morning. He wakes up, and litterally doesn't speak a word to me until we got off the plane. So, at this point, I'm pissed. Got back to his place (my train was the next morning), he went straight to his room and to sleep.

At this point, I was starving. But, I was starving in a flat that wasn't mine and that I didn't know the adress of. So I starved. Next morning, Adrian's feeling better, I'm pissed as hell, he drives me back to the train station and I'm so relieved to go back home. He asks me if I'd like him to walk with me to the platform and I'm like ""no thanks, bye"", grabs my luggage and go by myself (I have anxiety, so note that I must have been REALLY pissed off to do that by myself).

Anyway, after some calls, I decided that we had drifted apart mentally, he was a lawyer and frankly, kinda racist, while I was still a student and  frankly, not racist at all. So yup. Two different worlds now, but I'm not disappointed. We had 7 good years of friendship, after all, and we made it work, so there's that.

Fast forward to today.

He sent me a message 4 days ago, because my hometown went under a terrorist attack and he was worried about me. I just told him I was safe, the sports arena I was in was on lockdown and we just had to wait for the authorities to allow us to go back home.
He then told me I was free to call him, if I ever wanted to.

But I just don't know. We really had a special friendship and made long-lasting and heart-warming memories. But he was also manipulative, made me believe we could have been together (admitted he wanted to have sex with me), and kept me in this little illusion, making me unable to meet someone. Despite him, if you recall, being in a relationship.

So now I'm lost and my brain won't shut down ever since. It seems like every time I'm moving on, someone is pulling me back like ""hey, remember how this was 4 years ago? You miss this, right?""

If anyone has an input... I know the logical move from me would be not to call him and move on. But it's not that easy to make the logical decision.",15Dec2018,1

45,"I'll try to keep it brief. 

Last night my (19F) boyfriend (22M) called me outside to come look at a cat. For context, we live in a gated apartment complex. He took me around the block and we sat kind of in front of a persons apartment, but remained on the sidewalk, trying to get the cats attention. A guy comes out of the apartment and says ""Keep walking"" in a pretty aggressive tone.

 I immediately start walking away, but my boyfriend goes *""what?""* the guy says again ""Keep walking."" My boyfriend goes ""Dude we were just trying to pet the fucking cat. Asshole."" And the man just keeps saying ""Keep walking."" 

I was kinda shocked that he really tried to challenge this guy, like, we were kinda sitting in front of his apartment at night. We had no ill intentions, but that man doesn't know that. He doesn't know us. When sitting in front of someone's home, and they tell you to go away, you don't confront them or get aggressive. That's how you get fucking shot. You just say ""My bad!"" And go the fuck away. 

This whole thing gave me bad anxiety for the rest of the night, but I didn't say anything then. I just wanted to forget about it. Today though, he brought it up again about how much of an asshole that guy was. I told him, pretty much the same thing i said above. ""I was more upset at the way you responded to him. Like, thats how you get shot etc etc."" 

And my boyfriend got really defenseive, like ""We weren't doing anything wrong, we were on the sidewalk. It's not like he owns the property on the sidewalk. We were just trying to pet the cat."" When i tried to explain my point further, he kinda cuts me off and says ""God forbid I say anything, ever. Shit."" 

I just stopped talking at that point and changed the subject. There's really no use after a certain point with him sometimes. 

And he's definitely been like this before. Where I've expressed something made me upset and he just plays pity party and says ""I guess I'm a piece of shit, then. Fuck me, right?"" And I end up comforting him. 

I've tried so many times to let him know that when he does this it makes me feel like I'm being brushed off. Like I was wrong to bring it up. It hurts, and it makes me feel icky.

Another thing is that I don't think she likes me because she's taller than me, and girls like guys who are taller than them.

47,"I did not have a strong urge to disagree when other people held a different opinion. However, such urge gradually developed to kind of an unhealthy degree.

For example, say I read some book, 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene for example. Say the author proposes that ' xxx is how power works' and I disagree, it would be kind of hard for me to just let it go. I would want to write in a comment in Amazon where I purchased the book that I disagree with 'xxx'. Or else I would probably be feeling that I haven't 'get it done' yet. Kind of like an OCD thing.

I think this kind of urge came from dealing with some bullies during my middle school years. When they said something stupid and I did not argue back, it would not be OK. And this arguing kind of became a habit.

This negatively influenced my life. I usually avoided social media posts just because I had this strong urge to disagree. For example, say a person posts something like 'Oh, this is the most interesting movie, ever!' Although I know it's just an exclamation and I also wouldn't actually argue about it, I would have a strong urge to argue that, 'no, 'interesting' is totally subjective, anything can be considered any interesting.'

This is very time wasting for me. I don't think most people have such a strong urge. How would you view people's different opinions? Thank you.

I have a boyfriend. He’s amazing. He supports me emotionally, makes me feel strong, and has really been the light of my world.

My mother sees this. One day in an argument she asked me who I loved more: my family or my boyfriend. 

The truth is my family is kinda abusive towards me. My mother screams at me frequently, humiliated me in public, and breaks promises made to me. My brother has truly been corrupted by my mother. In his core, I believe him to be a good soul, but he acts out frequently. He’s selfish (doesn’t share food/items/anything, even if he’s not using it), gets mad at everything, name calls, and is very physical. You may ask yourself if an eleven year old can really be THAT physical, but believe me he is. He’s tall for his age and he has a lot of muscles as he is an athlete. He could absolutely send me to a hospital if he truly wanted to. 

So, truthfully, I love my boyfriend more. He just treats me so much better than my family. But I still responded to my mother’s question that I love both equally. Of course there was outrage.

TL:DR- my current job pays way less and is taking a big impact on my overall well being and happiness but could provide long term benefits. Should I stay for the long term benefits? 

F/30- I’ve been working a job for about a year in public education... I use to work in the private sector but left because I believed that working in public would have better long term benefits, ie: healthcare benefits, more time off, opportunities for discounted schooling, retirement and personal savings account ( deducted automatically from my pay) , and opportunities to work at larger more prestigious institutions. 

I took a direct pay cut of $400 a month to take a entry level position at the public institution (I use to be in a mid level advisor role) as well as paying about $200-$300 more a month on union payments and retirement savings/ personal savings being automatically deducted from my account.

In the last few months I have applied to numerous jobs in a position a level higher than mine currently, this would help me recover the missed $400 a month I had at my previous institution.  I have been declined for all of the positions that I have applied to as there’s a lot of office politics that play a big part in who get specific positions.

My self-confidence and self worth is taking a big hit with the lost opportunities to advance myself, not to mention my mental health and well being as I now need to work a second job (so 6 sometimes 7 days a week to make ends just meet). In my most recent interview I was even questioned by human resources as to why I came to public institutions with my wide variety of background knowledge and experience. 

In the year that I’ve been here I’ve also been offered 2 jobs at my previous private institution ... I declined them simply because I was under the assumption I’d be able to move up where I am.... now I’m seeing people with much less experience and skills move into higher positions around me because they can play the office politics better than I can... I’m at a loss as to what to do... should I stick it out a bit longer or go back to public institutions? ",15Dec2018,1

61,"I’m in Texas, my dad lives in Maryland but is at a DC hospital. 

My dad has had long-standing health issues (diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, etc.) He had a heart attack in May that I flew home for the day it happened and stayed with him until he’d been home for a couple days. During this time, his brother didn’t come to visit him despite living ~15 minutes from the hospital and in a phone call with me, said he’d “washed his hands (of my dad)” and “didn’t care what happened to him one way or another.” 

After his heart attack, my dad was supposed to have open heart surgery ASAP, but he put it off several times until it was no longer an option. Last Friday he had surgery, and had requested that I wait to see him until he’s out of ICU. It’s been a week, he’s still in ICU, has developed several complications and will need to be moved to an assisted living center for the foreseeable future. 

Neither my cousin nor my uncle has responded to texts from me about how they are going to proceed with finding him a center to go to, how he is, etc. I have been begging the nurses at the hospital to give me care updates, but they’ve been super vague because I’m not listed as a point of contact. A different, more distant cousin is residing in my dad’s home, and the house still listed as my main residence, and doesn’t want me to stay there to visit my father. 

I feel that my dad didn’t realize when he created this advanced directive that he was effectively shutting me out due to HIPAA laws, or that my other family members would act like this. He is delirious and isn’t capable of making any changes. We are very close- we talk on the phone once per day and I’ve flown home several times this year to help him with things and see him. 

What are my options? I know my uncle doesn’t have his best interests at heart- they didn’t speak for 10+ years and have always had a tumultuous relationship. If my dad dies, god forbid, there’s quite a bit of money that could be in contention (10+ million) and my uncle has a history with other dying relatives of trying to get them to sign documents. 

I’m going crazy trying to find out how my dad is doing, cannot believe my family is shutting me out like this, and am desperate for any help on how to get more information about my dad and hopefully gain rights to care for him. Do I have any options?

Like I don’t want to be hurt by other people which is why I would want to isolate myself but I also want a solid friend group to spend time with.

64,"I’m 16F. My dad recently bought Disney’s circle. This means our wifi is entirely restricted and he can see everything we do. All VPNs are blocked as well. You cannot get out of this. 

My way around this, usually to watch porn, was to just use my data. This was inconvenient but not a big deal. However, I’ve now updated my device to iOS (whatever the new one is) and my entire phone is restricted through that since he is my parent on Apple. 

I tried to talk to him about how this is ridiculous and I am 16 and he doesn’t need to monitor me like a baby. 

This is really upsetting for me. Now, even if I go on my data, use different wifi, etc, I can’t do anything considered restricted on my phone. I’ve had a really tough week and this is just the cherry on top. 

I’m thinking if I leave our iCloud/Apple family, I will be ok. However, if I do this, I will lose my access to Apple Music under his plan (which I use frequently). But, I also don’t mind just paying for t myself

I rinse my waterbottle with water (give it a good shake) every day. But I never wash it with soap or scrub.

Today, I realized that there's some dark brown gunk in the crevices of the swirl where you screw on the cap. Also, there's some very slight brown residue at the bottom of the bottle.

I've never had any problem with mold in my water bottle but I think it's caused by this green tea. I shake in all the powder in the tea bag to the bottle as well, so I assume the bacteria from the green tea grew in the bottle.

The brown gunk on the screw cap crevices looks VERY similar to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1dvhux/guy_at_work_uses_the_same_water_bottle_for_weeks/

82,"My 30yo, non-communicative, autistic brother lives in a group home. There's one worker who tells us a lot of ""secrets"" and gives us advice. Usually it's minor recommendations like ""have them take this out of his care instructions"" or ""this is working well, get this documented,"" but sometimes she breaks the rules and cuts his hair or does other unsolicited favors that we often appreciate (and are against ""sillier"" rules).

She's great. I'll call her GE.

Yesterday GE told my mom that sometime during the last week another employee hit one of my brother's roommates and gave the roommate a black eye. I don't have a ton of information, but I don't think GE was there when it happened. (Note: the roommate that was hit is also non-communicative.) So I'm not sure how the incident is known, but I trust GE.

GE had my mom come over and examine my brother to check for visible signs of abuse together, and there were none (and we're bruisers). Supposedly, the roommate's family was officially informed of the incident, but we were not. According to GE, the group home is not going to take any action against this employee and we don't know which one it was.

I'm not crazy to think this is an issue, right? Though it would be hard/unlikely, there are ways for black eyes to occur accidentally, but I just trust GE so much. If she says it was intentional, something should be done. My mom is upset, but is in a ""well, there's nothing we can do"" state.

I have no idea how to address the issue without risking GE's job (as she wasn't supposed to tell us). I want the reportedly abusive employee gone (or at least known to us), but not at the cost of the only employee who reliably looks out for my brother.

Thoughts? 


Notes: Wisconsin; state-funded group home; removing him from the home is not a viable option (yes, the self harm he'd go through in response to a sudden move change is currently a higher risk to him than leaving him in the care of an employee that causes black eyes); current supervisor has already announced she's quitting (before the incident occurred) so there's not much hope of follow through there if we do figure out how to lodge a complaint while protecting GE",15Dec2018,1

TL;DR Title

After I moved into this apartment complex (Which is kinda small) I unboxed everything and sat down for a little bit. I was going to pay my light bill later on. After that, I really had no plans. When I drive to the place, I go in there and try to pay for my light bill, But the lady said ""Your fine, you already payed it already."" (Mind you that the light bill is way over 300 dollars) I looked at her dumbfounded, and after 3 seconds I say ""But I didn't pay it."" 

So we both look at each other with the same face and then I say ""Can you look up who payed for it?"" Then, she goes on her computer, and starts typing. Few minutes later she said ""No one has your account but you and your mother, sir"" Then, I leave with a dumbfounded look on my face. I then call my mother, and she says ""I didn't pay anything"" so I lightly brushed it off, because I really had no worries.

93,"Tl;dr:
My brain works like a roboter with one thread and my girlfriend wants to sneak into my active tasks to get attention but I first have to finish my task. She gets mad. Need help. 

My girlfriend (20) and I (21) are now in a two year relationship. We study together, live together and love us like nothing else. 

We are very happy and have a ton of fun all the time but one thing about us is off. She wants more time with me and I want to get stuff done.

You have to know my personality though, I am very objective, optimistic, egoistic, always positive, have literally no empathy or any social skills for that matter. I hate most people and don't care what people think about me. And I also have no friends except some I game with and see once a year at Gamescom. 

My girlfriend on the other hand has two states:
Super happy/ energetic and super depressed with no motivation to do anything at all (Because of UNI stress or friends issues etc.). She decides very emotionally and is very sensible too. 

I like to get work done if I begin it. For example finish making a YouTube Video, finish this last round of the Online Match or similar things. I also do stuff if I feel the urge to do it, not when I am asked to do it in order to prioritize and perfect efficiency while doing stuff.

For example:
My Girlfriend asks me to wash the dishes but I am currently cutting a YouTube Video so I tell her that I will do it in some minutes because I have to finish this up to let the video render in the time I wash the dishes. But then she's angry because I didn't begin it in her definition of ""some minutes"".

Now there is another problem that popped up some months ago:
I am a night owl and she is an early bird.
So she gets up way early and wants to get me out of the bed too but I am tired as shit and can't possibly get up with probably hurting myself. She is mad about it.

Also she wants to get in bed with me way early, like 9 p.m. and I say that I can't get this early into bed because I can't fucking sleep then (Currently writing this 4:30 a.m. btw). So she's mad. Also if I ask her to stay up and game in the living room for the night she's mad because I get into bed at 2 a.m. (Very quiet btw).

Now I had a talk with her about my egoistic approach to everything (which is true though) this evening and the conclusion was that she wants to spend more time with me (Since we only see us in the morning and the late evening (because of our different UNI times)) and that I would deny every situation to spend time with her. Which isn't true because I love spending time with but not just when I am working on something or if I am in the middle of something.

She told me that she is like a timeslot in my timetable and wants to get noticed no matter what I am doing if she insists to. But I am just working like that:
Now is UNI time, now is YouTube time, now is gaming Time and now is Girlfriend time.

I told her that we can do more stuff together but everything outside-related she has no motivation for and now I told her that we can do my YouTube Vids together and she actually likes that idea.

Now I am really sorry for the long read, but I find it important that you know these details to form a accurate answer...

What should I do?

So, I was working a three day gig away from home where the company put us up in hotels. I had my own room and there were about 200 of us- from different branches- so making new friends was bound to happen. As a smoker, I ended up chatting with the other person in the smoke pit the first day. He seemed a little quirky but overall a friendly kooky dude who was harmless. Looks to be around 65 and I’m 25F. 

As we had to be ready to leave our hotels before five am- we exchanged numbers to be able to make sure we both made it at that ungodly hour. Perhaps seeing no harm in this was my first mistake. But the morning was fine, we sat together during the day and he was friendly and normal. At the end of the three days we had become buddies (as one does with the human they are stuck next two for three days) but I would say the end of the trip was goodbye! Unless of course we ran into eachother at a work function again, then I’m sure we would continue the conversation. 

I was wrong. He started texting me that night that he missed me, I didn’t reply- he sent a number of messages and continued to send things and I continued to ignore it. I chalked it up to he’s probably drunk and will realize later this is not appropriate to say. I didn’t feel like arguing over text about it at the time.

A few days later he messaged me pertaining to work and so I replied. As soon as I replied he went off on another weird tangent about wanting to cook me dinner and calling me hon and a bunch of other stuff that made it clear he is not trying to be friends. He’s trying to lay game down on a co worker who is 40-50 years younger than him.  The messages have continued with things like “are u ignoring me hon? Jeez that’s not very nice” “ I thought we were buds don’t ya wanna say hello” “it’s Me by the way, in case ya didn’t know” “it’s not very nice to ignore people young lady”

So I’ve blocked his number.

But what am I supposed to say to him when inevitably we run into eachother again and he confronts me about ignoring him?

I used to have plenty of ambition. I thought I was going somewhere. I wanted to either be an art director, a singer, or a professional gamer, but when I think of my mom growing old and taking care of my sister by herself, my heart breaks and I can't bring myself to leave them. My mom encourages me that eventually I'll want to move out, whether from love or life, and that she'll be fine, but it is hard for me to imagine that. 

Most nights, she drinks up to 4 small glasses of wine, which is equal to about a regular sized bottle of wine. She isn't completely drunk from it, but it gets to the point where she sobs her eyes out and it crushes my spirit. Whenever I hear her cry, I wish I could just disappear or die. The night almost always ends with her passing out. Some nights she goes into a rage and starts banging on the walls and sometimes screaming. 

This has been going on since my father's passing, with on and off periods spanning 3 months at a time due to a sudden change in lifestyle, such as her joining the gym or making a commitment to not drink anymore. It seems that we always fall back into depression despite our best efforts. 

I dropped out of community college and cut off most of my friends for the 4th time this year temporarily because of severe depression. I can't muster the energy to go back to school or get a job because I feel guilty about leaving my mom to take care of my sister.

During my first week at my job he stopped me and told me how I shouldn't be nervous and that I'm doing great. He's amazing for that. So when he comes around I just don't know how to act. My body temperature gets hot and I start to mess up on my words when talking to others. When he's in the room, it feels like nothing else is there. I feel like he senses that I have feelings for him, and it really rubs him the wrong way. It could just be me being crazy but I just want to get to know him.

104,"So I am 16 years old, and I’ve had my learner’s permit for just about 6 months. I take my road test in a week. 

I have had tons of practice driving in my town, neighboring towns, and a good amount of interstate highway experience as well. I have good spatial awareness when behind the wheel and I parallel park very easily. Learning from friends, I have practiced on the exact course the instructors take you on at our local DMV, and I’ve had zero problems. 

With that being said, I’m still incredibly nervous and my test is all I can think about. Anyone have last-minute tips, reminders, or stress relievers?

He’s very insecure can be a little bit rude sometimes but i still have feelings for him. A few days ago I texted him “if you ever need someone to talk to I’m here for you; I hope whatever you’re going through passes.” I don’t think he liked me sending that because he avoided me for 2 days. He’s dealing with his ex of 2 years getting a boyfriend and I just wanted to be supportive. Last night, I found out my uncle got diagnosed With cancer and it hit me hard because I’m super close With my family. I’ll be flying home next Friday to be with them but I miss them dearly right now. I moved to a new state; don’t have many friends, the job I have sucks but I’m starting a new role in January so I’ve been a bit stressed. I went to his desk today told him I’m taking the rest of the week off due to the news and to get my mind right I started crying at work and left his desk to try and recover, I usually take a vanpool to work but after crying I just wanted a hug and support so I asked him to take me home. He said yes but that he couldn’t stay over which is fine. We talked the whole ride, everything was fine but I feel idk kinda desperate for doing that.

I would do the same to her but not as much like what she did. 

She also bragged about how great our relationship is to her friends and how much of a sex machine I am in bed (she pretty much said I’m the best I’ve ever had in bed. I believe it 😏) etc, etc. 

There was this one night where she kicked me out of her house and then when I was leaving she was following behind and screaming at me. I was going to spin around raise my arms and yell at her but instead I BAM smacked her across the face and she fell onto the floor crying and told me to just get tf out of her house. Messy I know. 

We made up eventually but the arguments continued and I eventually broke up with her. It’s been two months and she’s happy. I ran into her recently at a store then she smiled and said hi hun ! and we hugged. We talked for a little bit and she told me about how she’s the new manager at the company she works at and she just got a raise so good for her ! 
She was happy to see me and I was happy to see her so after she was done shopping she drove me home. 

We talk every now and then after that she’s a friend now but I miss the relationship we had...the fights weren’t fun but the chemistry we had was something I never had before and I don’t think it can be duplicated with anyone else. She’s old enough to be my mom anyhow (I’m 20 and she’s 43) I promised myself that I’m never gonna date an older woman again but now idk...I want to get back with her.

109,"Hello!

I recently moved to another country to be with my girlfriend. However, the problem is that she owns a cat. I am allergic to cats if I am in contact with them and have been all my life. Those symptoms are quite light and minor; they include running nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. These symptoms happen when I am near them, but that isn’t the case anymore. I am now living with a cat. I have been living with a cat for about two months now. 

For the first couple days, I seemed to be fine. Then certainly things became worse. My skin started to show signs of dryness. It becomes rough and red in certain parts such as my face (around the eyes and mouth), arms, chest, and back. I started to develop hives around those areas, too. It became quite painful and annoying. My eyes would water and constantly itch, the areas around my lips would be very dry and flaky and that caused it to bleed a little. Other areas were just itchy and there were small bumps, which made me uncomfortable. 

So I went to an allergist about a month ago. I get tested for confirmation of my allergies. It turns out that not only am I allergic to cats, but I am severely allergic to dust mites. The house that we live in is quite dirty to begin with. We’ve hired a cleaning lady to help clean once a week. Anyways, the doctor prescribes me new medicine that I can take and a cream for my skin. It has been working and reduces the allergies and pain.

We try to keep the bedroom clean and cat free. We have an air purifier and the cat does not enter the room. The problem is that the cat does not shut up. He meows 24/7 and starts to scratch the door as if he wants to enter constantly. He does this every night. It interrupts our sleep and annoys us. My girlfriend recently suggested to let him in and sleep with us. I don’t think it’s a good idea, but I know if I say something she will be upset. How can I live with a cat and survive with my allergies? How can I convince my girlfriend to not let the cat sleep with us? I really don’t want to go through all the pain and stress again of my allergic reactions. ",15Dec2018,1

He was borderline drunk and I told him to slow it down and not drive home drunk. We live right around the corner and he insisted he was fine and wasn’t drunk. Well even though I knew better, I left for church and then got there and felt sick. I text him to ask him if he made it home, he said he was still there and that he’d be leaving soon and quit drinking. I told him, I know you’re close to home but please text me or call me if you keep drinking and I will come take you home. Two hours later I’m about to head home and I get a text that he just got home. I walked in and he was on the couch, slurring his word, eyes barely open and and drunk AF. I was relieved he made it home until rage filled me. I felt sick that he drove that way, putting his life and others in danger. I asked him to promise me he would never do it again and then he started yelling at me, telling me I need to chill out and I’m over reacting. I hate when he turns it around on me, or minimizes things that are big deals. He said it was right around the corner and that somehow makes it okay??? I love him so much and don’t want to nag him, but I feel like this is something to be legitimately angry and concerned about!!!

Well I was over at a female friends house just to hang out and she starts chatting on me on social media while we are just hanging out. (her boyfriend and a couple of mutual friends are there). We get to talking and she comes out and says that she has had a crush on me for a long time. Well shit I have had a thing for her since we first met (was married at the time). Well we go to smoke a cigarette and she kisses me (we were drinking). All we did was kiss that night. Every time we were alone we made out.

Well I wake up the next day hungover and feel like shit, but she invites me over again that night. Well like a dumbass I say yes. I show up and its like nothing happened. Until she starts chatting me again. Well everyone that was there leaves and her boyfriend goes to bed. Things get a little heated (I'm not sharing the details on reddit).

114,"Background: (If I was in a house, it would be Slytherin. The majority of my family went/goes to Ivies and T20 schools and high achievement is expected. )

So my parents are making me fly with them to Florida for the annual family gathering. However, my older cousin is bringing his girlfriend down here and my dad wants me to spend quality time with them, even expects us to be some sort of ‘close.’ 

He has this idea of a big family that everyone will be there for everyone and everyone will have this tight relationship with each other. The problem is, we don’t and we only pretend for him, because when he gets upset, he goes nuclear and ruins everything.

When I was younger, I remember spending a lot of time with my older cousins and their friends and we had a lot of fun, but we never really got close because my dad would make an insane effort to isolate me from them because I was a girl and they were all boys. Later on, we had an ok relationship and now I still regularly talk with one of them and we just share shitposts with each other on Facebook but it’s still awkward. 

We all hide things from each other and we can’t trust each other with anything because we’re afraid that once the opportunity presents itself to narc for gain, someone will. Among me and my older cousins, we know most of the messed up shit all of us do/have done but we don’t say anything about it around our younger cousins or even each other most of the time. 

Each of us has our own secrets and there’s just this distance we all keep from each other, so it’s awkward when we have to spend family time together.

So this thing about the girlfriend. The cousin who’s dating her used to be my favorite because he was hilarious and fun to be around, then he started taking himself too seriously when he turned 19 and became a total pretentious stuck-up. The girl he’s dating is an international student here and super rich, and she’s also a model and 18, 3 years younger than him. So I’m being forced to play the wingman here for a reason I’m not sure about at the moment, but it may have something to do with my inability to form deep relationships with anyone and my depression, my dad thinks he can cure it by introducing me to a social environment like this.

I plan to drink a lot and go out for a smoke with my oldest cousin whenever I get the chance like I always do around this time of year in order to deal with family time, but when I’m sober, how can I better deal while I’m with them?

I’d appreciate any advice; thanks

116," Hey, I'll explain my situation.. I'm from Venezuela and I have a really old friend from ""childhood"", I'm 25 yo, I have known this person at least 10 years (we met in highschool). I dont consider myself a bad person, I'm hardworking and I love to work and earn my own things.  


Since in Venezuela things are really hard (working a min wage job isnt enough) we've to find other ways to earn our  livelihood, so I'm a web developer and I'm doing ""good"" in venezuelan standards, last month I've made at least 800$ (this is not all the time, most of this year has been very dry for me, but the clients started to appear this month and last month).  


He is very intelligent, and he always find a way to work things out, he found a way (I bet he just copied someone's idea or way) to exploit a system to earn money on a popular platform (I wont say the name of the platform) and has people working for him farming ads, at the end of the month he takes a cut 40% of the person earnings and the worker gets 60%, for us its a very good deal (you can get 300-400$ monthly if you work hard) and I found the way to exploit too.   


I'm starting to exploit the system too and get myself people to work for me, we live in the same area but I haven't told him and I think I wont do it, we get drinks occacionaly and chat frequently. That ""bug"" has problems frequently and he finds a way to fix it and I'm copying his fixes to my own ends.  


Am I a bad person? I just want to save money to get out of this shithole. My sister tells me I'm a faggot and my grandma is telling me start exploiting the system.

117,"I (F24) love my boyfriend(M22) a lot, and I’ve been with him for just over a year. For the most part, we get along really well. I feel like we have an amazing connection, one that I’ve never felt with any previous relationship. There is days where marriage has even crossed my mind. We live in a place where we both get to do what we love most, skiing and snowboarding. Currently I’m living a really awesome life, living in a mountain town, with the man I love. 

The thing is, I met him in a town that I was living in, thousands of kms away from my family. Lately I just can’t seem to shake off the idea that if I spent my life with him, I would never be anywhere near my family. He has told me doesn’t have any desire whatsoever to live in my home city. My family is so incredibly important to me. If I were to ever have kids of my own, it’s so important that they have grandparents in their life. My grandparents are also aging, and since I’ve been away for the last 5 years on the other side of the country, I’ve seen very little of them and it makes me very sad. I found out my grandpa had a stroke the other day and it was so scary to hear because I’m not anywhere close to him. He’s ok but for all I know, he could have another and it could be fatal. I also miss my cottage SO much. It is truly the happiest place on earth. I hate to say it but this has caused my to fantasize about other men but in my home city. 

I’m at such a crossroads because the idea of us breaking up makes me so sad and I don’t know if I’d ever get over him. I also feel like if I stay with him, I will constantly have the idea of moving back home in the back if my mind. When I look at my future, I can’t see him being in it. I’m also scared that if I leave him and move back to my home city, I’ll regret it from setting my expectations too high. Long distance wouldn’t really work, because he would never want to move to my home city, and if I want this future in my life, then obviously I wouldn’t go back out to where he is.

118,"I’m currently a highschool senior applying to college. My parents are both immigrants from China chasing that American Dream, but my older brother and I were both born in America. 

My mom in paticular has had this lifelong dream of having her kids become doctors and becoming extremely wealthy. My brother decided not to become a doctor, which was a massive disappointment to my parents. I was told that I was my mom’s last hope of achieving her dream. 

Unfortunately, I don’t want to become a doctor. I did my research and talked to people currently pursuing it/working in the med field, and I decided that I want to go for Physician’s Assistant. I was honest with my feelings and told my parents about what I thought. 

As you might expect this really pissed my mom off and she told me that if I don’t try to apply to med school she wouldn’t help pay for my tuition. I fear that she’d hold a grudge against me forever. She can be insanely petty and stubborn so this could really cause a rift in our relationship. She thinks that PAs are simply inferior doctors and that I should apply to medical school first, and then if I don’t get in anywhere just apply to PA school as a backup. I told her that they have different requirements, that they’re different careers, that I don’t want to be a doctor, that I think I’m a better fit for PA, that PA makes good money and the road to a PA degree is shorter. But she refuses to listen. She’s blinded by the prestige of an MD. She told me that nobody respects PAs, that PAs don’t make enough money, and that I need to set higher standards for myself. 

I’m disgusted by her obsession with prestige/money and her complete disregard of my personal wishes. However, I also have to consider that my parents sacrificed a lot to give me a better life. They’re paying for a big chunk of my undergrad tuition. I also grew up with privileges and opportunities that they could only dream of back in their childhoods. But it’s my life, not theirs. If they refuse to help pay for college, would it be plausible for me to get a job and support myself? (I’ve never held a paying job before)

They could have a point, and maybe I really am just a lazy, spoiled child who shies away from hard work. Idk. But becoming a doctor just does not sound attractive to me. And I don’t think I should sacrifice my social life and my 20’s and an ungodly amount of money to pursue something that I don’t really want.

124,"Little correction there, my boyfriend hates OUR dog. 
My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years and share an apartment together. Somewhere around 2 1/2 years in we decided to adopt a puppy together. Funny enough it was his idea. He had never had a dog and always wanted one, I on the other hand have lived with dogs my entire life, so I was excited. 
Once we got the dog I played a huge role in training him. I enjoyed it and had a lot of free time because I was in college and my boyfriend works full time. My dog is a whippet/pit bull mix. Something about the breed is that they're typically lazy but do have moments of high energy. Because I trained my dog he respects me and listens and when it's the two of use together he typically sleeps all day. However I visit the dog park with him and engage him in activities throughout the day so he will behave. 
When my boyfriend gets home from work my dog gets excited -typical behavior. He wants to play and he will bark and jump. My boyfriend hates this. I try to give my boyfriend tips or try to get him to train with my dog so that my dog will respect him. My boyfriend refuses. 
This has always been an issue but within the last 6 months it has increased. My dog has gotten increasingly more well behaved with me and less behaved with my biyfriend. 
In return my boyfriend spend ZERO time with me or my dog. He will literally lock himself in the bedroom and only come out to grab dinner and just go back in the bedroom. It is so bad that I even have to sleep out on the couch with my dog. 
I try to bring this up with my boyfriend in how ridiculous this is and he is convinced that this is normal. And if I want to spend time with him I should put our dog in a crate.

127,"So I'll try and keep this from being super long-winded.  But I'm afraid I won't be able to, because, well, context.  

So 12 years ago, I met her, fell in love, (lust)... got married, had a sweet little baby boy.  Three years in, I find out she cheated.  Blah, blah, blah... y'all know how the story goes.  Separation, divorce...

She decided to move out of state to be with this new guy.
Decided to take me 3 year old (at the time) son with her.  
This where some context may be needed.
When we separated, i lost my job shortly after, so I asked my best friend, (who was going through a similar situation) if we could live together for awhile to help each other out.  He agreed and it was great.  

Emotionally though I was wrecked for awhile, well 5 years to be exact.  

How did you just let her take your son?

At the time I didnt feel financially able to do so.  Living arrangements, etc.  

Her and I did have open ""visitation"" though.   He would come back every month for about a week or so.  

Obviously at first I was feeling the same as you may be just by reading this.  Angry, confused, trying to look at his (my sons) best interest.  

I have/had always believed that a child needs to be with his mother.  😔

I began with nothing more than pure hatred for this man that had ruined my life... but i; not so quickly realized it really wasnt him 100%..

I accepted the inevitable, and said to myself... you can either be filled with hate or you can try to be the bigger man and understand the situation, understand him, etc...

I did the latter, and I don't regret doing so.  I eventually began to ""respect"" him for at least his efforts with my son.
For literally years he lived in a ""relatively stable"" environment.  Thats all that matters in my opinion.

So, lets fast forward and assume not much has changed from my perspective, save for me getting remarried, to a wonderful woman.  Which was a hard thing for me, to say the least.  But Im happy in that department (for context).

So heres where it gets stupid... 

I was made aware just a few months ago, that my ex had cheated ""again"".  It honestly broke my heart... which is fucked up, or is it?

Upon finding this out, her husband, lost his shit.  Like literally... 72 hour hold in the corrections center. 

Understandably so, i guess... 

But my son is with me now... and just a few hours ago was facetiming his mom (my ex)...

He was laying on his bed when i came in saying why are you doing this again mom...

She said, ive given you a house, clothes, love, etc.... what else do you want from me... (not verbatim but the jist)

He said Im only 11 years old mom... she said yeah when i was 11 i was blah blah blah...  

So the first time ive realized how ""manipulative"" she is to my boy.  

Am I overreacting?  I mean, i think not... but just want some opinions.

I'd label myself a Naturalistic Pantheist, which roughly means I do not believe in the supernatural and my conception of ""God"" is the aggregate of all natural phenomena. It's often accused of being 'sexed up atheism' which isn't entirely inaccurate. I would just say that strict atheism is without any sort of spirituality which I find to be unfulfilling. 

To give a more precise description of what I practice, I would describe it as a mix of Existentialism and Perennial Mysticism, the latter being the concept that truths about existence can be found (theoretically) in all religions, admittedly often between a lot of nonsense.

However, I am not a scientist so I am always careful to try and limit my ideas to the realm of human behavior and use of symbolism to articulate abstract concepts. For example, I think Chakra meditation is a helpful tool but to me, it is a psychological phenomenon based on working through various emotional issues. However, I have also considered more broad ideas, such as whether the concepts of a physical vacuum and a social vacuum are only labeled as such in purely metaphorical terms or if they both represent some greater metaphysical law of existence that operates on multiple levels. (To be clear I am not claiming anything here, just giving an example of an idea I've had which I have not at all decided on.) 

So my ultimate question is, how do I effectively operate in this field without succumbing to nonsense or being associated with it?",15Dec2018,1
132," So I have 5 years of post grad work experience. I’ve done fairly well and managed to get a few promotions that have led me to the job I start
on Monday. However, in the past I have worked in the field. I was a a part of a team where I managed one portion of the country, and the rest of the team were in other parts. This will be the first time I have ever been in an office environment where the rest of my team is literally next to me in rows of desks. I know this might sound stupid, but i’m having a lot of anxiety about meeting and having to spend so much time around my team. I am a girl, so I feel like I am expected to be bubbly and outgoing most of the time. However, that’s just not my natural demeanor. I’m more of a quiet person who is used to working in a predominantly male field. I can get along with women and have a few close girl friends, but have little experience working with them. I’m nervous about being the new person in a situation where this is probably inevitabley drama. It’s extremely important that I am well liked because my husband holds an executive position within the same company, just in an different profession and building. However, I still feel like everything I do is also a reflection of him. 
On that note, I was hired for a position two levels above the one I start on Monday. Unfortunately with Q4 budget cuts that position was unexpectedly eliminated before I started. I was kindly given a different position, but one with less pay and prestige than the one I got originally. While I am thankful to have the job I have now, I am hell bent on working hard and learning as much as I can with the hopes of being promoted into the position I was offered originally, should one open up. I feel like this was  information that I would have kept to myself, but with it being a somewhat small department word got out I am joining the team as a level 3 as opposed to level 1. 
I was also planning on keeping my husbands position on the down low. It’s not that I would ever lie about who my husband is, we have the same last name so that wouldn’t work anyways, but I just wasn’t going to be broadcasting that my husband is the VP of department X.  Again, with it being a small department, word got out. It’s evidently led to some curiosity because people have been checking out our linked in profiles and one person I only met once tried adding me on social media. Basically I feel like I stepped out of a job where I made my own schedule and had some privacy and into one where I feel like a little bit of a spectacle before I’ve even started. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to smoothly adjust to this situation and tips on building relationships with coworkers in such a close environment? Or anything to avoid?

TL;DR I’m afraid i’ll have trouble adjusting to my new job where I’ll be working in an office for the first time and need some advice. ",15Dec2018,1
133,"So I was chatting with this girl on snapchat, and yes she is very pretty and I like her a bit. We had a pretty big school dance tonight and she was posting on her story about how she was bummed nobody asked her, kind of in an ""I'm joking but I'm not really joking"" kind of way. So I messaged her how I was suprised nobody asked her because she has a lot of friends and stuff. She was still bummed, so in an effort to cheer her up I lied and said ""I know at least a couple people who were considering asking you out, but they just didn't end up doing it I guess."" She wanted names of people, I guess so she could talk to them about it or whatever. The obvious problem here being that nobody actually (to my knowledge) wanted to ask her to the dance and now I feel like an idiot trying to come up with excuses to not tell her. She pretty much just said fuck it and stopped asking me. I can tell she's pretty mad and I'm just wondering what I should do.

I get my roommate, he's a junior, seems like a normal dude and we move in. Not many problems at all besides he's a little messy and I'm a bit more tidy. I don't like stuff just lying around like forks or plates when they're not in use or just a massive pile of dishes in the sink. I can look past that though because we're in school and college students are lazy and I'm a bit of a neat freak. BUT, throughout this whole semester I can count how many times on one hand how many times he's taken the trash out. Yeah I know it doesn't sound like a big deal but I'm sick of being the maid and the only buying stuff for the apartment. So sometimes I just won't take it out, but he'll let it just pile up, like a foot above the can, and won't do anything. So eventually I give in and I make a mess of taking this huge pile of shit out to the dumpster. But this time I put my foot down, I'm not taking it out for like 40th time in a row. And my roommate I guess feels the same way, because there is garbage spilling over onto the floor. I just want to know how to just bring up that I want him to take the fucking garbage out for once.

140,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

My first post in this subreddit but recently, I've come across a guilty feeling of hanging out with a friend of mine who hasn't really grown out of their own lifestyle. Bear in mind, here's the situation:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 27-year-old male who graduated from College who is making a good salary (also pretty healthy). My friend, a 26-year old male, however only has a high-school diploma and is making minimum wage and is overweight but refuses to lose weight. Two years ago, we bumped paths and decided to hang out. Little did I know, but he chose to not go to college and here's the kicker, never learned to drive a car.

Since then, every time we've hung out I've picked him up with my car and have taken him to places. But his demeanor has been driving me nuts. He's always asking me to take him to places like Taco Bell or Target and buys junk food all the time. One time, he asked me to take him to Sams Club with my membership so he could buy some things (I'm the errand boi). I'm not an idiot but I know he's leeching off my my car and the real kicker is that since I've been taking him to all these places in the past two years, he's never offered gas money and thinks I enjoy driving him to places for free. The first thing he does when he gets into my car is to change the music I'm playing so he can play his. When we text to hang out, his messages always sounds like this: ""Come get me"" or ""Get me around XX:XX"" since he knows he can't drive and I'm going to be the one picking him up all the time. He even has a facebook profile picture of him being skinny from like 4 years ago but refuses to post current pictures of himself because he's afraid of his self-image. 

&amp;#x200B;

My guilt is that this is my fault and I let this situation happen. He never appreciates me having worked this hard to get a degree and for learning how to drive a car (even buying a car). He even refused my offer to teach him to drive. So why did I put up with all this? Because I feel like if I told him we should no longer be friends, he'd commit suicide and will fall into a big depression.  If I could list all the annoying things, then 90% is what I call childish behavior and that's what I think of him, he's unable to act like an adult and does whatever he wants because of he has to same old lifestyle of a high school student.

TLDR: My friend never went to college, has a childish ego, and takes advantage of my car with little appreciation. Was wondering if we should stay friends.",15Dec2018,1
141,"So I am 30 year old lady, I was friend of this 33 year old married man and used to admire him for his intellect and kindness; 
I was already going through a painful breakup and he started helping me out emotionally, he was there to hear me out, my pain my crying and my anger.I've grown used to him;

Her friends has also started talking to me and looking at me for some time. She even came and sat next to me even though she didn’t have to. 
A week ago I gathered a lot of courage and I sent her a message on Snapchat. She responded with a short vid and an answer to my question. I asked her another question and she answered that one too and she added a selfie and a long row of hahahaha. After that I sent a funny answer and she replied with hahahaha. A few minutes later she sent a heart to me, so I sent one back. 

I was super happy and proud of myself. But for the entire week at school she and her friends have been kind of ignoring me. I’ve been trying to tell myself that she might be playing hard to get but if she is then it has gone to far in my opinion. She hasn’t texted me, not made a lot of eye contact, her friends seems to be neutral to me again and I’m getting tired of this confusion. 
What did I do wrong? 
Did I wait for too long?

148,"To preface I am 21, he is 37. We met right as I was turning 18 and he was (and is) absolutely wonderful. However, as the relationship progressed, I began to have more and more fears about the future. Ever since we started dating seriously, I've put my life on hold. I left my dream job - tattooing (not entirely due to the boyfriend, the boss was a drug addict) moved away to a small town because his job demanded it, I've also done numerous other things to accommodate ""us."" My goal is to move up to Seattle or Colorado and work in the tattoo industry. My issue is that whenever I try to get my foot back in the door at a local studio, he becomes clingy, saying that the long hours, clients and everything else that comes along with the job will ""ruin"" our relationship. I've been nothing but supportive of him and his career, yet I feel like he isn't comfortable doing the same for me. My other concerns are ""missing out"" on my youth, our day to day life was routine and boring. The sex was repetitive and mediocre at best. I felt like I went from 18 to 37 overnight, I left all my friends behind for him and I rarely go out. When we would try to go out, he'd be grouchy and whiney until we left. This led me to stop sharing things I enjoyed with him because the way he acted made me feel ashamed. I make an effort to support/show interest in things he enjoys. When I mention the future of moving, he seems interested in the idea but says it will take 10+ years because he needs to tie up loose ends with the business he runs. I understand that completely but I feel like it will never actually be a reality. He is extremely close to his family. They hold a pretty strong hand over his life/decisions and I doubt that he and they will realistically be okay with us moving that far away. Finally, I have an opportunity to live with my brother in southern China for nearly a year, when I told the boyfriend, he became understandably upset and told me not to go. Basically giving me an ultimatum of that opportunity or our relationship. He is a wonderfully supportive man though, I've been severely struggling with anxiety and severe depression since I was laid off (the store I was working at shut down) and he's been doing everything he can to take care of me.

And I don't really let people care for me when I'm sad either I care for myself because no one understands me like I do and I don't wanna burden ppl with things I can take care of myself.

18 M, just finishing up my first semester at college and boy do I not want to be here, especially because it will not help me pursue my goals.

There is nothing else I need to learn to pursue my goals, and spending anymore time and money here will be a waste. I have friends in Brooklyn looking for roommates, and all I need to do is find work to pay the bills.

\-Loss of Appetite, sometimes I'll go without breakfast or lunch. For some reason I'm healthy according to my doctor, but I know it's unhealthy to not eat those 2 meals.  
\-Mood Swings, sometimes I get very weird mood swings. Sometimes I'll be happy and watching youtube or something and think of something randomly that happened that was sad from my past and it'll ruin my mood and make me sad. Other times I'll be happy and completely fine, other times I'll switch from happy to aggravated and take my anger out (not physically, but just arguing blah blah blah).  
\-Loss In Things I Used To Do. I used to enjoy playing basketball and would go to my after school basketball program, now I've just stopped going cause I don't enjoy it as much. I used to hang with friends, and go out, I don't like going out very much anymore and barely talk to my friends.

I have been planning how I’m going to stand up to my boss and ask for insurance all night. I just want some reassurance.

159,"A quick run down of the situation. First year at a college away from home, met a guy that I really like. Having parents with a shitty relationship, I decide to ask my sister for advice on how to not be a shitty communicator, and yadda yadda. I also ask her to keep the conversation quiet, because things aren't serious and I don't want the news to spread. 

Fast forward a day or so, and my brother is suddenly pestering me with questions about it. Now, I'm not upset that she told my brother, but I /am/ upset that she told someone when she promised me she wouldn't. 

Now, Christmas break is coming up, and I know eventually she's going to ask me about it. I'm not really sure what reaction I should have. Part of me wants to get short with her and block the conversation off since she betrayed my trust a bit there, but I also don't think that would help the situation any. 

Help? (Also my first time on reddit, so hi everyone!)",15Dec2018,1

162,"Hey everyone, I'm a bit conflicted on an issue and was hoping I could get guided in the right direction.  


Througout the past few months, I noticed that whenever I counted my cash, the number kept going down. I thought I was losing my mind for the longest time or I was just really bad at counting. It got to the point where I would bundle the cash up by 50$ incremements just so I knew for certain it was correct. When I stated losing chunks of money again, I knew something was up and my sister was the only one who knew where my cash was. I confronted her and she denied it at first. After a few hours I asked again, and I guess the guilt was too much for her and she confessed. She stole an upwards of 400$. I'm not sure what to do moving forward, primarily because she is a bit of a neet and can't repay me. When I asked her why she stole (noting this was my college funding) she stated its because I would be too strict or mean, and thus she felt it was justified stealing from me.   


In essence, I'm really lost because me and her are very close, and I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. What should my approach be with her moving forward in life? Do I regain her trust or is it one of the few things time can't heal? Any advice would be appreciated.",15Dec2018,1

I'm meeting my boyfriend's parents this weekend and I could use some advice. From what I know about the plans we're probably going out to dinner with them after he and I compete at a weightlifting meet. Since it'll be shortly after he lifts I'm guessing it's not going to be formal. 

Mostly I'm just nervous about etiquitte: do I need to bring anything or offer to pay for dinner? I don't want to be rude but I also don't want to not do something and offend them. I'm guessing that they'll offer to pay and I'll send a thank you note? 

I'm also a little nervous about potentially sticking my foot in my mouth; I'm a liberal atheist, they're conservative and Catholic. Thankfully I grew up Catholic so I can say Grace if they asked. I'm planning on just avoiding those topics.

Girl was looking at me the whole time. As I’m not a confident person I never went up to her and asked her her name. When I left the gig I had a huge feeling of regret. Thinking I’d never see her again. 
But alas she found my bands Facebook page and messaged me.

As you can imagine I thought I’d never see that girl again and to get that unexpected message highlighted my day. We texted for a few days then we met. It was like a scene from a Hollywood film, “2 lovers finally meeting because of fate” she wasn’t supposed to be at the show and we were planning on dropping out the day before. we hit it off great in fact we hit it off that well we date for 3 years.

180,"Hi, I'm really looking for advice on how to deal with a breakup. 

I've known this guy since we were 12, and we're almost juniors in college now. We dated when we were 13, obviously broke up, but started talking again about 2 years ago. He was in an abusive relationship, which I helped him realize and helped him get out of. He then started dating me. 

When we dated, it was fucking amazing. He was everything I wanted. We argued, but after each argument we learned so much about each other and loved each other more. We spent almost every second of our lives with each other, which sounds like a lot, but for us it was normal. 

He then went to college, 4 hours away from our hometown. That was fine and didn't bother either of us. I remember driving up there at 2 am when I wasn't working because he asked and I was more than happy to do so. All of this went on until the December of last year. 

We made the god awful decision to have a threesome. It ended up with us drunk as fuck and him fucking the other girl while I sat in the bathroom crying. It took some time, but I got over it. In December, I saw his texts with this girl by accident after the incident. He had been blatantly flirting with her and being sexual with her. I was heart broken. This really fucked me up. I have a really hard time trusting anyone because of my family life and my childhood. It just. Fucked me.

I broke up with him, but we never truly broke up. We still hung around each other. Slept together. Spent nights together. I ended up getting accepted into the college he goes to, and it's an amazing well known top college, so I obviously chose to go.

A lot has happened between August and now. I treated him like shit. I won't deny it. We treated each other like shit. I said I didn't want an official relationship because of trust, and that's true. But we still did relationship things. We even held hands in public. 2 weeks ago, I stopped talking to him and him me. Just. Totally. 

We agreed to meet up so he would give me something of mine he had. He was going on a walk, and I joined him. It was great. We kissed, held hands, etc. We went to his dorm and obviously fucked. But afterwards, things had changed. I could feel him having no love for me. 

Everything has gotten nasty. He's officially dating this girl. He got with her 2 days after we fucked. I am heartbroken. I'm not proud, but I anonymously messaged her telling her we fucked and some other really mean shit. Me and him got into a huge argument and he said he wanted nothing to do with me, and he didn't want me in his life ever again.

I just keep thinking of the good times. The bad times don't matter anymore. Every argument, I wish I had just let him win or let it go. My thoughts keep coming back to him. I have better people to date who are interested in me. But I can't get over him. What do I do???",15Dec2018,1

This might be a long story, stay with me.

My roommates, who I met on craigslist, are a couple and we share a two bedroom apartment together. Though, sometimes I feel like I'm living in those arrangement where I dont have access to kitchen and living room because of how often they dominate the living room.

I didnt know them prior to moving in and probably would have stay far far away from them if I had met them outside. They both work full time, non student, rent is cheap (600each), volatile relationship/people. They are from this area and have families here. I am a full time student in my last two semesters and working part time as student researcher. I live on loans and credit card with no financial support from my single mother. So get to the details.

Let's make a summarized bullet points, otherwise I would be here all day:

-dirty dishes would pile for days into weeks

-barely clean around the apartment, once a month I scrub everything

-noise inconsiderstion to neighbors and myself, e.g. having a fight at 12 or 1am, yelling screaming, wailing, slamming doors, stumping, and slight physical altercations 

-drank considerable amount of my alcohol and blamed their friends for it (accidentally drank 4-5bottles over the span of 4 month?)

-use my food and toliet paper, even though I told them not to

-they have a bearded dragon, poor thing, theres no proper heat, diet, care, attention, regular hygiene, or clean the cage. (Backstory: before this big beardie, they bought a baby one and I watched them obliviously stunted the growth and traumatized it. 4 months, the baby lizard did not grow and was very inactive. They return the lizard to a pet shop and got the one they have now).
-treat my furnitures as if theirs. Me being nice decided to put my little square table that my (long distance) bf varnished for me out in the living room because they were slow on moving their stuff in and there was no table top space to use. It is now covered in ashes, various stains for liquids, and other crap.

-and they leave their clothings, like piles, all strewn across the living room, especially in my big bowl chair. 

Here's the problem:
I'm leaving the country for a month, now to late jan., and i will pay them rent before I leave (maybe i shouldn't, venmo would work over wifi internationally..?). I'm afraid that they will take my rent money and disappear before I get back. The only assurance I get is that they have a planned trip in January.  

Is there any precautions I can take to my trip less stressful? I thought about asking my nice upstairs neighbor to notify me (somehow?) If she sees anything weird.

187,"So I dated this boy in high school for a year, dumped him, and then we hooked up right before our first semester of college. He moved several states away for school, but we still texted and FaceTimed all the time. We were pretty emotionally attached at that point, but I had a not great semester mental health wise, so when he came back for thanksgiving I freaked out and ghosted him. Then I studied abroad for a semester and ignored him for a while, until we finally just started acting like normal friends again like nothing happened. He would come a home twice a year or so and we would hang out with our old friends and every thing was fine. This year, he came home in March and we were particularly nostalgic about high school days. When he left to go back to his school, I realized what a bitch I was to him and really regretted how I acted back then. I’ve been in love with him this whole time but I let my insecurity ruin everything. 

Any way, this summer I got really drunk with my friends one night and sent him a series of regrettable Snapchat’s, (me crying in my bathroom and pretty much telling him I was still in love with him and sorry for being a dick). He understandably was confused, and a week or so later we had a long FaceTime conversation where I explained myself and apologized for being a dumbass. He owned up for accelerating things too fast back in our first semester and pressuring me too much, which, along with my own insecurity, is what made me freak out and ghost him and flee the country for a semester lol. 

So since then, I’ve texted back and forth with him a few times maybe but it’s been quite a few months since the unfortunate drunken Snapchat incident. However, he’s decided that he’s coming back home for New Year’s Eve. Keep in mind, he has no family here anymore, the only reason he has to come home is to see me and our other friends. 

A stupid part of me is thinking “hm. We’re both in our senior year of college now. We graduate in may. With our degrees, he could move anywhere and so could I. It wouldn’t be COMPLETELY impractical for us to get back together, right?” 

  I don’t know what to do or if I even should do anything. I’m still in love with him, there’s no doubt about that, and he knows it.

Im about to graduate and move somewhere interesting and start my real adult life, so this has to get resolved somehow. 

I don’t know what he feels at this point. I’m trying to be calm and not make it a big deal but as you can probably tell from reading this, I’m not really a calm person lol. Any advice on how to deal would be much appreciated ",15Dec2018,1
188,"Hey guys!

So basically my math teacher has weighted the assignments in the grade book incorrectly. Like it’s completely off. I sent him an email pretty much politely calling him out and he has yet to respond to it. It’s been 4 days and he responds in 2 max which he says in the syllabus (ironic). 

The current state overemphasized the grade you got on your midterm (should be 15% counts as 25%), doesn’t weight our homework to the right percentage (10% currently - should be 25%) and finally he made the midterm apart of our 3 chapter exams. So that made it 4 items when it should just be the 3 chapter exams (30%) hence the title. Of course I’m acing everything but the midterm so this shit hurt me a lot. It’s the only reason I noticed it to be honest with you. Things didn’t add up when you ace everything and have a B-. If we were to go on the syllabus I would have an A- in the class. That’s a letter grade difference and why I even bothered to email him. This same thing has happened before in an art pre req class and I let it slide. Only because it was an A- to A difference. I’d have a 4.0 but owell, now I’m going to stick up for myself. 

I don’t know what to do. It genuinely feels like I’m being ignored, and he’s stalling till the end of the semester which is In literally a week or so. This very well might hurt and help students. But I believe I’m in the right to question him not honoring the syllabus. Does he HAVE to comply to what he stated in the beginning of the semester legally? I’m at a college atm and all our teachers hand out syllabuses on the structure of their classes day 1. I don’t mean to sound dramatic but doesn’t it risk the integrity of the school? My email was very much polite and nothing like this post. I’m sure it was an accident, but at this point I’m wondering if he’s gonna own up to it. ",15Dec2018,1
189,"I currently work a middle management job. I moved from a low paying job in a high position, with a boss and team that loved me, to a well paying job with a boss that I haven't gotten along with at all. Subsequently I haven't gelled well with the rest of the team, despite some serious efforts to do well by them. The last two years have been a roller-coaster of awful to tolerable, and my confidence has taken a serious beating from a boss that only knows how to criticize. The upside has been that I have a stable job and have found some friends at work, as well as having some significant perks to the job (free housing). 

The boss has \*just\* left for good and other staff that are difficult to work with are leaving soon as well. The new boss is a bit of a mystery. I met him once briefly, and my initial instinct is that he a good guy with a level head. However, despite things looking up significantly...... I've been offered another job. Slightly better pay in a higher position, but no perks and the position is so new that I would be paving the way through some serious barriers. The job is tough and I know nothing about my boss. I'd be fairly isolated in my new position and I'd also have to do all the things that happen when you move....

190,"I have this group of friends that I’ve known since we were kids. 

Recently, I’ve become less interested in hanging out with them, which has snowballed over the past few years. Really all we do is play video games together, but we don’t have much else in common. 

They don’t share similar goals. They don’t seem to have plans for long term careers. They don’t hang out with anyone else outside of the friend group. I’ve outgrown them in almost every way possible. 

It has gotten to the point where hanging out with them feels more like a chore since our families know each other really well. I despise this feeling, but I can’t help feeling guilty for wanting out so, so bad. Especially since our birthdays are within the same month and I look like a bad friend blowing them off every chance I get. 

I’m not one for burning bridges entirely, but I cannot stomach another dull moment with them. What’s best for me in this situation? Should I just keep making excuses? ",15Dec2018,1

He seems (and told me) to become really lonely, isolated from everyone. Barely making friends. He was there for me when I had a rough time too a while ago. But recently he started to be really demanding of my time and attention. He keeps texting me every day on discord, if my status is ""busy"" or ""online"" or even ""offline"" doesn't matter. I still get flooded with messages I'm not really interested in (like screenshots of a game he's playing). Recently he also texts me in the morning AS SOON AS I WAKE UP and get my phone, while I just wanna be in peace chilling in bed texting with my own bf. I gave him advice and tried to find a way how he can make friends, and told him that I need time for myself too, cause I must find a job and work on my portfolio/CV. But then he still texts me and seems upset when I don't respond. I'm that type of introverted person who really wants to help everyone, but this here just became such a burden and it's consuming so much of my energy. Been job hunting for months now, trying to stay positive, while I have financial issues and must move out asap from my parents house. I just can't take more.. Am I an asshole? What can I do? 


TLDR: A good LD friend of mine is going through a breakup, getting really lonely and isolated. But keeps on texting me, wanting my time, although I really need time for myself and my job hunting. I told him I gotta focus on myself and my work too, yet he keeps texting and it's so energy consuming to me to even respond to him. But if i dont, I feel like an asshole ""leaving him suffer alone"".

The video included my full voice, my online username, and my full name.

This is clearly a violation of Privacy Guidelines.

The uploader originally reuploaded with my full face on it, then he/she changed the video to audio only, with my face in black and white.

THIS VIDEO NEEDS TO BE FUCKING DELETED!!!

Does Youtube review privacy claims using robots? How can they say they were not able to identify a violation, in 1 mins???

I NEED THIS FUCKING VIDEO TO BE REMOVED!!!!!

What do I do now? I think the only option is to kill myself. I can cut my blood lines, or hang myself. There are many ways to kill myself then to report a video.

199,"I'm in college, not necessarily by my own choice. I was pressurized to go by my family. I didn't want to jump straight into full time school. I wanted to take a gap year, work, figure out what I really want to do with my life, etc. My family didnt like this idea. In their minds I'd be a failure because there's something inherently wrong with wanting to take a step back. Thing is I know they care about me deep deep down in their mind somewhere and I know they just want the best for me but at some point I should have a say in my own life, shouldn't I? 

Now it's all falling apart, I've apparently failed 2 classes this semester. (Almost entirely my fault, part fault to the absolute horror of a professor that I had but that's a completely different story). Now, my family is freaking the fuck out because my future didn't go how they thought it would. I wasnt ready for this and I knew it. It's maddening that it took something drastic to happen for them to realize it. Now they're tightening the ropes, going ballistic with wanting to control everything in my life thinking its going to fix anything.  

This whole control thing has happened before and they know for a fact it doesnt work with me. It only strains the relationship we have with each other. 

Ive been thinking about moving out for a while now but the whole money factor has always been an issue while going to school full time. Now that I don't think I'll be doing that anymore I'll be able to do that and take the ""gap year"" that I wanted in the first place.  However, as much as my family is fucked up Ill still have to remain in their presence until I get my own place. I haven't got a clue how to go about talking to them because whenever we have conversations that are more intense in nature it always turns into a screaming fest. 

I know they wouldn't just let me go but I thought perhaps saying that I will pay them back for all the money they wasted on my schooling, return the credit card theyve given me, etc. Essentially become a tenant to whom they're renting a room to, would ease their grip on me and perhaps have a better relationship with them in the future(???) However, they've mentioned time and time again that they are opposed to me paying them to live in my own house. 

I know this is complicated, it's all over the place and definitely a mess but I don't know how to approach this without causing complete chaos.

I’m 25(m) and I have a good job and a great family and amazing friends, but I just feel empty inside and I think it’s because I’ve put so much of my own self worth into relationships

Had a 5 year relationship with a girl who destroyed me and i still hold her on a pedestal. Took me 3-4 years to finally move on and then when I decide to date again I find this girl who I immediately fall for and we date for 3 months then she breaks up with me because “[she] can’t see a future with me” even though I’m “the best thing that’s happened to her. I have an from college that I should have been with but I left to try things again with 5yr girl. 

How can I be happy with being me? How can I stop looking to the past? I hate this quality in myself and I find it so hard to focus on me.

201,"So, the title pretty much says it. I just graduated yesterday and went out to a party last night to meet some classmates. A girl who I was really close with in my program came out to meet me at this party (I ubered there, she drove) and we were supposed to quickly leave after she got there because we had other class mates at a bar who wanted us to come. 

So she gets to the party and immediately just jumps on a table and starts dancing (she is a party animal). She was clearly already on another level and had no intention on leaving soon, especially since it turns out she knew people there. 

I tried hanging for as long as I could (hours) and talked with several people but couldn’t maintain a level of giving a shit at a certain point and was too tired and drunk to keep trying.  I could tell she was completely invested in hanging out with her friends, so once my Uber was getting close I let her know I was heading out. 

The reason all of this matters at all is because this is my closest friend throughout the program, and we went through a lot together over the past few years. I just want to ask if me leaving abruptly and not knowing her game plan on how she was getting home a dick move? 

Tl;dr: Friend comes out to meet me at party where I don’t know anyone, ends up having way more fun than I am, and I end up abruptly leaving (after telling her) after a few hours of not really having much fun. Should I have been more adamant about asking her what her plans were when leaving there since she was drunk. Or is that none of my business? ",15Dec2018,1

203,"Need help and advice.

Throughout our relationship, my fiancé has been overly reserved about sex. To the point where it seems like anything that reminds him of sex (me talking about it, me undressing) will get him frustrated.

We’re physically affectionate in other ways. When we do make love, it’s enjoyable for both of us.

So, we just went out with his guy friends at a hockey game and they openly talked/joked about sex, kinda like what stereotypical frat brothers would do. My fiancé could openly talk/joke about sex with them.

It was hurtful that he can communicate with others but not me.

l’ve told him many times how insecure that makes me.

He says that his inability to be sexually expressive is from his fear of disappointing me. He has had some negative experiences in the past with an ex verbalizing that she didn’t enjoy sex with him. l try my best to reassure him. 

While it’s uncomfortable talking about something so personal online, I️ feel so frustrated.

l’ve discussed this issue with him so many times. He’s even seeing a therapist and is discussing this issue. He says his therapist urges him to have more sex to overcome his fears. But l’m still feeling his negativity toward sex. 

Although l enjoy sex and the closeness it gives us, it doesn’t justify me leaving the man l love. 

I’ve also talked with a therapist about this issue before. We discussed being intimate without having sex. My fiancé assured me that he is interested in me sexually and expressed that he’s afraid of me leaving from getting bored with having sex with him, something that would never happen (but something that’s stuck in his mind because it happened with his ex). It helped me to understand how much pain his is in.


Nights like tonight still are so hard. l’m unable to sleep and feel anxious while he’s asleep in bed. l feel like there’s a whole aspect of him l don’t get to see and l don’t know if l should just accept that it won’t change.

    After a long paragraph from his friend insulting me, we made up. The thing is now he practically still acts like we’re in a relationship. 

     I told him I would always be there for him and I still want to be friends, but I didn’t expect this. He texted me literally from three pm till eleven pm yesterday. He called me as well. He tries to guilt trip me a lot and it just makes me feel even worse. (We live an hour away from each other) 

     He just talks to me so much. He also asks/talks about our sex life. I told him I was going to bed at eleven pm and he texts me, “I miss the good nights and I love you” and I totally understand but that just threw me off.

Again, I said no, but in the end, I was willing to compromise if *M* would just book a psychologist and I would give the contact number. By the end of it, I was told I was a useless person.

211,"I'm male, 25 years old, and struggling to live a healthy life. In fact, I don't know anyone with health issues as extreme as me. I used to sleep only 3-4 hours a day, vomit 3-4 times a week, feel sick/nauseous throughout the day, and suffer immobilizing anxiety from work.

I'll start from the beginning. Growing up, my parents physically abused me, and made me think that I deserved the abuse. I'm Chinese and physical abuse is part of the culture, and I never got any severe injuries from the beatings. But the issue was that the beatings were unjustified, although my parents convinced me otherwise at the time. They would beat me whenever they were upset, and then said they did it because they loved me. They would threaten to kick me out of the house. They would scream at me in public. One of my clearest memories was playing basketball when I was in elementary school, and having my dad mock and yell at me after the game for mistakes.

As I entered high school, I felt a desperate anxiety to get as far away from home as possible after graduation. I worked myself as hard as I could to get into the best colleges. I remember getting only 1-2 hours of sleep each day for two weeks to prepare a paper for a scientific competition. Also, when preparing for the SAT at an education center, I remember feeling stomach pain due to the anxiety (brain-gut) and having trouble falling asleep as a result.

Once I entered college, the stomach pain grew worse. I started taking Lanzoprazole or Tums every day, even though it says on the bottle that it should not be taken for more than two weeks. I had trouble fitting in in college, an experience that's probably common to many freshmen. But the difference was that I never overcame my inability to fit in. It was a lonely experience, which only aggravated my later academic troubles because I didn't have anyone to ask for help. When I reached my senior year, I had to complete a thesis project, but my thesis advisor told me that my project topic was not up to standards and that I would fail the class. It was approximately the middle of the academic quarter at this point, and I had submitted the project proposal already (which the advisor had approved), and it was too late to legally change advisors or drop the class. For the remainder of that quarter and the entirety of the next quarter, I only slept a few hours a day due to the anxiety of failing my thesis. I didn't talk to anyone about this, partly because I didn't have many friends to talk to but mostly because I was embarrassed since I was usually top in my classes. Then one day, I started urinating blood. Over the next few weeks, I went to get tested for cancer. I remember not feeling too scared during this time though; I think the potential for cancer made all the other issues seem trivial, and sitting in a peaceful hospital was less stressful than sitting alone in my dorm room worrying about failing my thesis. The medical tests all came back negative though. And eventually, I did complete my thesis and graduate on time with the rest of my class.  
When I started my first software engineering job, the loneliness really drove me out of control. In school, I would at least be in a class with other students and communicate with them about problem set, or occasionally grab a meal with them. In a tech company, I was sitting alone at my desk, without anyone to talk to. My manager and co-workers did not care at all about my career growth, and either assigned me no work or nasty bugs or pointless feature requests each cycle. Eventually, I got assigned a really nasty project that involved rewriting legacy software on a third-party system onto our company's infrastructure. But the legacy software was incomprehensible and inaccessible, and the engineer in charge of that legacy software refused to answer any emails or grant access. The project also required contributions from other teams' codebase, but none of the other teams were willing to do the work. I complained to my manager about the lack of help, but he responded that sometimes that's just part of the job and did nothing. I had to repeatedly compromise on features and quality technical design because building the full product was impossible without outside help. Eventually, the project was completed after one year of my full-time work, but our manager decided, without any stimulus, that they didn't want this project anymore. Then, other high-level engineers blamed me for the poor design of this project as the reason for not launching the project. They identified problems that I had specifically argued we needed to resolve, but couldn't resolve on my own because it involved other teams' code. In my performance evaluation, my manager wrote that I was unable to handle the difficulty of this project, and explained in our 1-on-1 meeting that it may take another year before I could get promoted, even though he had said a few months earlier that I had a chance to be promoted in that cycle. I wasn't willing to accept a one-year postponement, so I left the team.  
I joined a new team about 6 months ago, and things have been going better. I am mostly getting along with my teammates, and my manager is assigning impactful work for me to do. However, I'm still feeling social anxiety, and get self-destructive when I make a mistake around co-workers. I still feel nauseous and vomit occasionally, although I started walking on a stair machine in our company gym every night to help stimulate the stomach muscles to reduce the nausea.  
Thanks for sticking with me throughout this long story... The question is much shorter though. It is: How do I make myself mentally and physically healthier?  
I've tried meditation for my anxiety. I've started eating much more carefully to not aggravate my stomach. But it just hasn't completely worked. I'm dubious of seeing a therapist--the idea makes me uncomfortable.  
One last thing: I'm gay. I haven't come out. I've never had a relationship. I was hesitant about sharing this fact, as I'm doubtful that my poor health is related to my homosexuality. I don't find myself feeling extremely anxious about being gay. It's more of an occasional sadness. Sad that no one knows this truth about me, and that I can't have relationships with guys I'm attracted to.

213,"Apologies for anything hard to understand, I am very medicated.

My dad is currently high on something. He has been a meth addict since before I was born. My boyfriend and I got a place with my dad a week amd a half ago. 3 weeks ago he was a coherent and reliable adult. During the moving process he relapsed. I have drug tested him twice with a home test and both times he has passed with flying colors.

Something happened at work today so I had to take one of my as-needed medications. It knocks me out for 8-12 hours afterwards. It is taking all of my willpower to stay awake enough to type this.

My boyfriend woke me up a bit ago because my dad spent almost an hour pacing around the kitchen with his pants down (and blocking the only way to get to the bedroom where I was sleeping). My dad is definetly tweaking hard on something. If I was not so heavily medicated I would confront him and tell him he needs to leave.

The arrangement that we made before getting a place together was that if he messed up he would leave and my boyfriend and I would stay. Whatever he has been using this last week has not been showing up on my 5 panel home drug test.

Everything we own of value is currently in the house, so leaving isn't an option. We don't feel safe but I don't think this is something we can call the cops for help on. This is my first time living under the same roof with my dad in almost 10 years. I have no other adults in my life to turn to. We don't feel safe and I don't know what to do. This freaking medication is inhibiting my ability to process the situation and come to a rational decision.

Last year I was accepted onto the MSc International Relations (Research) at the LSE. A very prestigious school and excellent program for individuals looking to enter government, consulting, research, etc...

However, I unfortunately did not have the money to pay for the degree, hence why I deferred by a year and requested part-time studies in order to pay for it without going into ludicrous amounts of debt. 

In the mean-time, I got a job working at a VC-backed recruitment firm in London. I am on £26k here and make a commission on each placement that I make. I'm expected to make total all-in £50-65k in my first full year (2019) and there are plans that myself and another co-worker will be responsible for opening the U.S. NYC office in 2020/21--by then I should be targeting low six-figures. My work does not know that I have deferred a Masters and I am unsure of whether I should do the masters all together. I enjoy my job, but its incredibly difficult and demanding. I'm scared that if I don't do the Masters I am going to trap myself or miss out on great opportunities and higher pay. At the same time, there is a great track at my current work.

I understand that it's unhealthy to care so much but I don't know how to not care. Despite my lack of success I can't stop being passionate about what I'm doing, and while I'm glad I'm passionate I often find that being a negative factor for me. As soon as I upload anything I second guess myself and start looking only at all the things I did wrong, and getting little to no views just reinforces the idea that ""I'm never going to succeed on this platform"" in my head more intensely. It destroys my self-esteem constantly.

I know that I guess I should be taking a break or giving up or something but I literally cannot suppress my desire to succeed online. Every time I upload a video I then promptly get the feeling that I should be working on another upload. I just want people to like what I make so badly that I associate it with my self-worth. I know this isn't healthy.

TLDR, I'm letting my lack of success online affect my mental stability and well-being. I want to be entertaining so badly yet I find myself failing, and I take that failure and tell myself I'll never succeed.

Luckily it was at the foot of the bed.

But this is what I just experienced, and I’m traumatized. I’m laying in bed with no top, only boxer shorts, and sleeping. This guy barged in, drunk and high, and is breathing heavy.

I was so scared, I didn’t know what to do I was frozen. My mom was in the next room over, so after a minute of him laying down, I grabbed something to cover me and went to tell her.

226,"This is hard for me to write. Mostly because I feel so ashamed for how I feel about my husband's 4 year old son, so perhaps I'm writing this in hopes that someone will tell me I'm not a horrible human being. And that maybe there's still some hope.
A little background on myself. I'm a 26 year old female. Recently married. And I always thought I wanted to be a mom. Even as a child. My sister and I would play house and I just HAD to be the mother. I've been babysitting since I was 11, and before I got married, I'd been working as a nanny for a couple years and was a Sunday School teacher as well. I loved my jobs and I loved the children I worked with. Then I met my husband's son...
He was just about to turn 3 when I 1st met him and instantly I got a bad feeling. I still dont know what it was about him, but it was a bit unsettling. My husband is in the military and is currently stationed in Georgia while his son lives with his mother in Arizona. So they don't get to see each other very often, which means I've only been around him a few times. But those few times have been very telling. The first time his dad brought him over to my apartment, he threw his shoe at my cat and stole a ring my father gave me when he adopted me (I'm still not sure how he got ahold of it, as where i kept it, it should have been out of his reach.) I didn't find out until we dropped him back off at his mother's house and it fell out of his pocket. The only thing his mother did was tell him that stealing was bad. A few days later, his mother told me she was concerned because he had attacked his grandmother's miniature poodle. She said the dog was just sitting on the floor and her son charged at the dog and started choking her and punching her in the face...I was mortified. I worked as a vet tech a few years prior so I am a HUGE animal lover and  hearing that made my blood boil. And when I told my husband how alarming I found that, his response was ""he's only 3. He doesnt know any better."" There's  also been several times where he's thrown fits, hit others, and he just doesnt listen to adults, or anyone in an authoritarian position, which is frustrating to me on its own, because I grew up with very firm military parents who taught me at a young age to respect adults. 
Fast forward to right now. My husband  returned from deployment a few weeks ago, right before Thanksgiving. So his parents drove to see us, along with his son to stay for a week, and we're celebrating an early Christmas with them. Last night we let his son open up 2 gifts before bed. A set of Christmas pajamas and a book I had customized where it makes him the lead character in the story. I know...not the most exciting gifts for a 4 year old, so I was expecting much, but I also wasn't prepared for the lack of gratitude and the fit he threw. He said he didnt like the gifts and refused to say ""thank you"" when his grandmother asked him to. I felt like bursting into tears/punting him out the window. I desperately wanted to take all the other presents away and donate them to children that would actually be grateful. 
I've never disliked a child so much. I've never been so frustrated by a child this much. I have worked with many children in the past, and I know at times they can test your patience and they can be ""bratty""...but this...I've never in my life been involved with a child so disrespectful, ungrateful, with no boundaries and just what I feel is an evil energy. There's no other way to describe it. I truly feel that this child had an evil streak and it terrifies me and I'm ashamed at the same time. He gives me a bad feeling and it scares me from ever wanting to have children of my own. I will also say, the 1st time my older sister met him, without me giving her any background information, she told me that she didn't get a good feeling from him and was afraid to let her daughter play with him. So I'm not alone in that feeling.
But it could also mean that maybe I'm not as patient as I thought. Maybe I have high standards of how a child should act. Maybe I'm the problem. Like I mentioned earlier, I am a product of a military family. If I ever acted the way he did, I'd have my butt branded and my parents would've taken me to a donation center and made me personally donate all my gifts. I have worked with other kids in the past and I'm know to be firm and ""no-nonsense"" when it comes to respectful behavior, but the children I worked with prior, thrived off of the boundaries I set and we were still able to have fun together and be silly. They were all kind and caring kids...my husband's son isn't. And it hurts. And its scary.
I so desperately want to like him. I ultimately want whats best for him and it frustrates me because i don't see anyone disciplining him and when i speak up about it, or am firm with him about how he will be respectful in MY house, I get looks from everone and I feel like the bad guy. I didnt get a lick of sleep last night because I've been running everything over in my head. If theres a slight chance that my child would be like him, then I'm scared to have one. I used to look at motherhood as a wonderful and exciting thing. I know its a lot of hardwork, too, but i also know it's supposed to be one of the most fulfilling things in the world. But ever since his son's been here, I've been thinking of all the negative sides to having children and coming up with excuses to myself, as to why i shouldn't have kids. I also fear that, if i do have a child, what if my husband's son gets jealous and tries to hurt our baby... maybe I watch too much Dateline. But I honestly feel that if my husband is to ever get custody over his son, that I will need to lock up all the knives and any other object that can be used as a weapon. My husband also wants to teach him how to hunt eventually, and the thought of his son with a gun, makes me sick. 
I feel awful for feeling this way. He is just a child and more importantly, he's my husband's son. I've expressed my concern for the lack of discipline to my husband and he says he agrees with me and feels that if he had more parental rights to his son and could see him more, that his behavior would change. But I dont dare tell him all the other things I feel. He'd think I'm a monster and that I'm just picking on his 4 year old. I don't know what to do. Is it me? Am i just too strict, too impatient? If im scared of a 4 year old boy, maybe I'm not cut out to be a mother afterall. ",15Dec2018,1

228,"For this to make sense, I think it’s best if I say the whole story, so strap in.
So I’ve been having a long distance relationship with this girl for about more than half a month now, but we’ve actually known eachother for a much longer time than that. To keep privacy, let’s call her Mia. We met online around end of May, and I didn’t really think much of her at the time. We both had relationships, we were just kinda close friends who had similar interests. There were mainly 3 people she talked to the most on the internet, or rather Discord, where we’ve all met: Her boyfriend, lets call him Mike. Her best friend, his name is Daniel, and me. She had known Mike for a couple of months but the problem with him was he was mentally abusive to her. Always upset, always depressed and not letting her help him, always blaming himself or her. To make matters worse, he actually left her for another girl because apparently she helped him more than Mia so he decided to just throw her away like it’s nothing. My previous girlfriend had broken up with me about a month prior so I was single as well, and knowing what it was like, I decided to help her. She and I talked a lot about the situation and it was around this time that I decided to start attracting feelings for her. Having something in common with someone can do that to you, I wanted to be there for her. I wanted to show her I cared about her and all the time we spend together. It made me happy. But I made a mistake. I didn’t confess out of fear of rushing the relationship. When she said she wanted someone new, I told her to just look at her closest friends. This put two people up for her: Myself, and Daniel. Her best friend.
...she started dating Daniel 2 days later.
Those 3 weeks were probably the most grueling of my life, having to sit there everyday watching them be happy wishing that was you. And the worst part being forced to accept it in case they ever broke up and you could maybe come back for a second shot. I hated it, it was awful. But then she told me that Daniel wasn’t working out either. She said she hadn’t fully gotten over Mike, and she thought Daniel just didn’t fill that hole in her heart like she wanted. She wanted positivity in her life and him always being upset didn’t help her at all. She exposed her feelings for Daniel too quickly and now she was paying the price, or at least that’s how she put it.
So they broke up, but on good terms. They were still gonna be close friends. She told me she wanted a break from dating and I could see where she was coming from. So all I could do now was just wait for her to be ready. About 2 weeks ago, she told me I made her happy and she wanted to try things out. So we have been and it’s been amazing. She comes to me with my problems and I go to her with mine. I’m really happy with the situation and how we’re being right now, but she’s still best friends with Daniel. And if I had to guess, maybe they talk more than we do. There’s a part of me that fears she’s going to leave me to be with Daniel again, and that’s the last thing I want. I don’t want to have to go through that again. I don’t want to be alone and be forced to spectate watching her be with someone else because I hesitated and didn’t tell her. I’m scared. I’m posting here instead of there because she doesn’t use Reddit and I need someone who doesn’t know her to talk too. I know these last sentences make me sound like a jerk and maybe I’m paranoid over nothing.

232,"Hey guys. 

For context, I'm a guy who has a lot of insecurities and anxiety from having been cheated on and left for someone else in two different relationships. My girlfriend has anxiety, too, and her relationship with me is the first relationship she's had. We've been together for two months. 

I've been really struggling for a while with her texting me very infrequently. When we're together in person, everything seems fine, but when it comes to text I feel like we're not even together. 

So after a lot of stress and anxiety, I asked her last night, if she really had feelings for me or if she's just going through the motions of what she thinks a relationship should be. 

She said she doesn't know, and she may just be going through the motions. She doesn't want to share pictures of us on social media because, she says, she is worried about making a spectacle of me being her first boyfriend. She texts infrequently. But she also wants to see me all the time, when we had our talk, she cried and asked if we were breaking up. And she still wants me to meet her friends and family. 

I'm so, so confused and heartbroken. I don't know what I should do, whether I should try to move the relationship forward, and have hope, or if she'll never care for me the way I've started to care for her. All I can do is cry.

233,"I don’t want to give too many personal details but in our 20s, I’m female. 

My neighbor’s friend in an apartment complex, knocked on my door to talk about a subject we are both interested in. I’ve seen him around before and thought it would be a good opportunity to introduce myself, plus I like to know who comes around the apartment complex a lot (my section at least). Still the knocking was weird and he was excessive about it (I had just woken up and didn’t answer immediately)

Well he ends up talking to me for almost 2 hours regardless of how many hints I dropped that I had work to do. The conversation was normal at first but quickly turned personal (as you can imagine) and I repeatedly told him I did not want to discuss anything like that. I kept nicely trying to get him to leave and at this point he is annoying the rest of the people living in this same part of the building (keep in mind I did not invite him in so he’s standing in the hallway and the doors here are really thin). I very mistakenly gave him my number at this point so he would leave and I hoped he was just chatty in person. 

Fast forward a few hours and he texts me. I’m out running errands/driving and am not really messaging anyone back so I haven’t responded. At some point I check my phone and now have multiple texts and a phone call from him. Like “what are you doing” and “why aren’t you texting back.” This is excessive for me considering I barely know him and I was already annoyed from earlier about feeling the need to give him my number just so he would leave.

I don’t text back (plus between driving, Friday activity, and a show I had my phone tucked away for most of the night again not responding to hardly anyone). By the end of the night I have multiple missed calls, texts, and pictures one weirdly sexually.

I’m sure I’ll get shit for this as I feel I’m in the wrong somehow and not sure what to do. I’m already mildly scared of men from what both strangers and those closer to me have done in the past, especially when it comes to rejection or trying to end contact with them. He seemed somewhat normal from a distance and obsessive. I’m worried because I live alone and he probably knows that from the mutual neighbor of mine we both know. I think he will show back up and if I tell him I’m uncomfortable and don’t want him contacting me anymore I’m worried of what he might do. 

Am I overreacting and should just respond to him over text? I still feel like it is so odd for him to call/text me that much in not even a 12 hour timespan. It’s intrusive and threatening. Easy to say “stand your ground” or “you shouldn’t been scared just tell him” but this guy knows where I live and past experiences have me paranoid. I’m worried enough I’ve thought about getting a gun to keep in my apartment

I’m mostly frustrated because I feel like as a woman I am expected to be as nice as possible to not offend or make guys mad in case they retaliate. The whole time he was talking outside my apartment and kept not leaving I wanted to tell him off, why do people think they have a right to your time? It’s a difficult situation for me and sometimes I think I just can’t have make friends. I thought I could have a normal conversation with someone new but it turned into this

N was diagnosed with depression when I was friends with her but she wasn't really suicidal or anything. So some months after we drifted apart got really bad and I tried to comfort her the best I could but she was **very** mentally unstable and I really didn't know what to do. She would write long stories about killing herself a lot and post her self harm cuts. I got really busy and some stuff popped up in my own life so I didn't really talk to her after that.

This Wednesday one of her friends from her country told me that she killed herself. You can imagine my reaction to that. 

Today N messaged me and she told me that if I really cared for her I would bother to inform other people and that I actually thought she was little bitch and that I'm not really her true friend.

Therefore, i went for a local university in my home country. The problem is after that, i became depressed and could not excel in my studies. Consequently, i failed miserably the past three semesters studying here. In universities such as University of Toronto they do not accept people with more than 2 years of university studying, so my question is what can i do in order to get accepted in a good university top 50 ranking, like doing an international test or something ?

237,"This is the first time I'm going to talk about this in an open post, so let's get this out of the way:    
I live in Saudi Arabia (by birth, not choice).     
please keep all the politics aside, this just means that I have no access to alcohol, no dating, no movie theaters, shit internet, basically it's just so awful in many ways. I am not gonna pretend that it's *the* worst place, but it's pretty bad.    
I am now 26 years old, I love sports and tech, lived in south Korea for four years until two years ago, wasn't the best experience of existence but it was so much better than here.    
I'm not opposed to living here, I got my family and they love me and I love them but they have a very local ideology that I simply don't agree with, and I keep that to myself, so in a sense they don't really understand me (how very teenagey lol). 
   
My biggest issue however is that I can't find any stimulation, no talking or any meaningful contact with the other sex since because of religion and culture,(unless I wanna get married, and I don't), all the sports I like to play require teams, and I am but a single guy (did I mention I no longer have friends after coming home), I recently resigned from a shitty job I had because they stopped paying, so I really got nothing physical to do, movies and tv shows and the like also became a boring business that I don't seem to be able to get excited about, plus I am trying to spend time away from screens.    
I know many of you would suggest working out, and I did try it, but I just find it to be boring, can't go to the gym for more than two~three weeks before eventually giving up on it.    
I have a car but got no place to go, shopping or eating out is too expensive to sustain when I got no source of income.     
I wish I could find a job outside this country, like in the UAE for example.    
I don't know if I would get any feedback of value here, but I think I will feel better having written about.    
Sorry for the long and random thoughts, and I would appreciate any advice you can offer.    
Cheers, ",15Dec2018,1

244,"Hi everyone! 

I would love some tips (preferably from personal experience) on how to deal with the physiological side effects from overwork/stress/exhaustion. 

I have 2 jobs and work between 20-40 hours a week. This week I’m working 70, and my god my body is MELTING. 

Besides a couple of nights where I’ve had no other option than to sleep for 5 hours max, I’ve been hitting a minimum of 8 each night. But I’m constantly exhausted, my neck and shoulders are so tight I’m carrying this beast of a tension headache round with me, my blood pressure is in my boots as both my jobs involve standing and I have orthostatic hypotension, and I’m grinding my teeth every night. With my down time I’m running round buying Christmas presents and trying to meet with friends before we all depart for Christmas. My skin is dry and breaking out, my appetite is all over the place, and my brain essentially feels like I turned off screensaver mode and it’s screaming at me to turn it off. When I do have some down time at home, I spend it literally vegetating and scrolling through my phone.

What do you do when you’re working your ass off? What kind of things help?

NB: I’m a qualified medic, and understand that I should be getting around 9 hours sleep each night, and working less, and all of that. I’m not asking for medical advice, just life advice you may have accrued on the way and found it really helps when it’s crunch time.

We’ve had psychologists come in to take a look and they have all said that he needs to get over the denial stage with the help of friends and family otherwise his condition will worsen.

Our appartement is really small, my 13 year old brother used to sleep with my parents downstairs until 3 weeks ago. I handled things so that my brother starts sleeping in my room, because it's really weird that he still slept downstairs with my parents. 

Turns out, he snores. **It goes from helicopter to weird, wet niagara waterfall sounds**. It keeps me from sleeping. Due to my life already being on verge of collapse with school and mental health, this new sleeping problem is the icing on the cake.

Now my mum is workaholic. She believes in working without a break from five in the morning. While I have no problem with that the thing is it is  too much for me. 

She gets up in the morning, cooks, washes the clothes, cleans etc. No one helped her in the time I was away( because conservative society BS. the others are men and won't move their fingers to help). Now that I am back she wants me to help her. All the time.

Now it is easy to get cooks/maids for house work but she refused to get one. I tried asking her again and again but she has this complex that people will think less of her if she gets a maid/cook. Financially we are really well off. 

The problem is I end up doing three fourths of the house work, leaving no time for me. It frustrates me that she wouldn't agree to get a maid, and I'm exhausted from all the work. She keeps ordering me one thing after next to do and the only time I get is when she is asleep and by that time I am tired.

I can’t bring myself to do the simplest things, I am barely making it in school (I procrastinate), and don’t to the stuff that I have to, EVEN THOUGH it’s so fucking simple. 


I barely eat anything due to uhhh... stress and shitty family (I don’t want to be near them so I don’t go to the kitchen) (yes that’s bad I know)

I theoretically have a flat that I could move into (however it requires a big makeover, there’s no electricity in the outlets, so I’ll call an electrician, I have to repaint the walls, get a new fridge, remove some mould from the bathroom and there’s no internet) so that would take some time. 


And I can’t bring myself to do that either. 


For those reasons (huge stress, abusive family, constant hunger) I legit want to die (well not legit but you get the vibe) , and I was an ass to my gf. On top of that my OCD doesn’t help (yes I am getting therapy and it actually worked wonders). 



How do I get to do the stuff that... I have to do in order to pass, and to constantly... *fight* my way out of my shit moods?



EDIT

I know that what I need is support from my family (father mainly)  but i can’t really get that. He behaves like a man-child (regularly, as well as domestic violence, but not physical, except one time, however I went to the cops, but didn’t achieve anything, due to me thinking I could move to the flat that i mentioned). Oh and also, they lied to me about the flat’s condition - they said it’s ready to move in, but in reality it’s far from that, but they are still saying that in their opinion it doesn’t require work.

255,"A little background: I’m a woman in my twenties with pcos and I was recommended to a doctor who is considered one of the best out there. So at the appointment he introduced me to a diet that helps balance my hormones, and said I’ll see you again in a few months.

In the following months I tried sticking to the diet, but I had a lot of trouble doing that since it’s quite new to me and very strict and caused me a lot of nausea, and on top of that I’ve always had a bad relationship with food in which I eat when I’m emotional. 

I come up to the next appointment and this is where my fear begins. My doctor flips out at me because my blood test results were horrible and he was overall condescending towards me. I was completely frozen the whole time and just couldn’t wait to get out. 
He started to explain the diet to me again in a more harsh way, and didn’t bother asking me if I had any trouble with it. Overall I felt more like I was a failed experiment rather than a human being. At the end of the appointment he asked dryly if I had any questions, and I just came up with one that wasn’t even of my concern,but I just felt like I should say something. And again he answered in a way that made me feel stupid. 

Ever since that day I’ve been reliving the appointment in my head almost all the time and it would end with me either crying or having a panic attack over the thought of going back there. I can’t seem to get out of my head, and no matter what I’m doing it’s always at the back of my mind. I’ve been considering going to a different gynecologist because of this. 

So I’m asking for advice on wether or not I should find a new doctor (given that my current one is considered very good). I realize ofcourse this sounds very over dramatic but I just can’t seem to control my thoughts over this. I just feel like I should have a doctor who will listen to me and not be so intimidating.

Recently I've been on the hunt looking for a job, an actual proper stable job actually because to be fairly honest I've been dicking around my whole life being nothing but an insipid person who just stays at home on his computer and frankly I had enough.

I did some soul searching and finally focused on myself, trying to make myself better and I realized that I wanted to study business management/administration, and in turn, a very, very good opportunity popped up for me. My dad owns a franchise of a company and said that he wanted me to take over his position within the company, not necessarily being the ""owner"" because he is partnered with 1 other person, but rather wants me to buy a ""share"" within the franchise so I could be a partner and also take over his position as the General Manager/Project Manager in about 5-7 years when he decides to retire. I know deep within myself that management is something I want to do so I have that set in my mind..

&amp;#x200B;

However, during my job hunt, a sales company wanted to hire me and they wanted to hire me full time. I want to focus on my studies more than I do want to work and in about 2-3 months, universities will be starting and I think within a week or two, the applications will open. They don't want to switch me to part-time but would rather have me at full time and keep me around for years. Deep down I want to work, I want to give myself stability however I can't really find anything else that is part-time and also that is a job like this because the company wants me to make me a Sales Executive Officer, having the rest of the team to report to me, chasing up leads and meeting up with clients on fixed appointments. For me I feel like it would be an easy job but it's conflicting with what I want to be doing in the future, and I don't necessarily know any other type of job I could do unless I get a Responsible Servicing of Alcohol degree/certificate and worked at a liquor store (I live in Australia), but I feel like this job could give me really good stability.

268,"I am a 17 year old Junior in high school . During Feshman year(2016) I had an idea for a non profit organization, that I genuinely thought would help make an impact on the community. I do not really want to go into details, but for the sake of curiosity it involves bringing in underserved students interested in coding to our school in order to teach them full intermediate and higher level coding courses unavailable at their schools.(NOT INTRODUCTORY COURSES AS MOST ARE)I worked on it several months and then made a proposal to the school engineering department, where I then brought 2 friends aboard. For almost a year and half I did 75% of the work as the other 2 members could not be bothered and just thought the organization would just fail and die a slow death and were probably forced by their parents to stay in the service project. Finally, we started picking up speed , we brought on 3 other members, and decided to work during the last summer(2018). We made an insane amount of progress and unlike before we all did our part. We created a website, courses, proffessional curriculum, formal bussiness plan, etc.. From that point on up until know we are now an official non profit, have 25 members, 6 full courses, and won several competitions. As I said before because I did 75% of the work for most of the project's existence I tried and tried to get people to do work and attempted to show frustration in the most professional ways, but even though it finally worked it also made me the messenger of bad news to the team. Think of Steve Jobs where his passion and frustration ultimately lead to his downfall and removal from the company. I genuinely saw potential in the project from the start. The issue started when the team started working on apps and business plans where ""about us"" sections were being made only to see my name 3rd on a list of 24 with the title co-founder. From the start I assumed it was implied I founded the organization as I had the idea and carried the team for almost 2/3rds its existence. Finally, I brought it up and the central team(There are 25, but only 6 are involved in management and decisionmakimg) went bezurk as if this is out of nowhere. The problem here is that this is not something I can force, power is shared equally and because it is not in my team's self interest to give me my own title I cannot attain it even though it is an irrefutable fact.
I am also a dedicated student and now as an anxious Junior I, unlike before where I did not really bring it up, feel it is unfair to not have that founder title to differentiate myself when I apply to college. I feel me being the founder versus one of three ""co-founders"" makes severely understates my involvement. Some of you might say I am being greedy or needy, but the truth is I put the time and effort in and had the vision, and I feel like calling myself co-founder is similar to taking away nearly 1000 hours I put in myself into this project and throwing it away to be on the same playing field as others who did not put in the time, effort, or even emotion. I apologize for the length, but I would really appreciate any advice in how to handle this issue of getting my title back in a civilized professional way without hurting friendships. Once again the problem is not neccesarily that they do not believe I am the founder, it is that the other 2 ""cofounders"" don't want me to appear above them. Should I talk to an adult?

273,"This post might be a bit brief for now since I'm pretty tired, I'll post/edit in more depth later.

I'm in high school and am needing to be eating a lot more than I am currently, when I calculate it I'm usually having no more than 8700 kj, if I'm lucky, per day. This would be fine for someone my size, but not my age. I should be eating about 10000kj each day, but my stomach doesn't ever seem to want to take in more than I'm used to. I try to slowly ease into eating more food, but it gets sort of tedious, or at least I struggle to make much of an impact on my daily calories, as I'll end up feeling full the rest of the day. I don't know if there is some magical recipe/plan for slowly being able to intake more healthy calories each day, but also ways to permanently stretch your stomach a bit, not just temporarily.

274,"Okay... this is a weird one...

My friend and I haven’t been talking for awhile and out of the blue, she messages me and says she’s not doing well. Things have been rough. And at the end of the message, she says “And both my guinea pigs passed away this week. And I was not taking proper care of them and I am just really messed up.”.

What are circumstances where this can happen? Because this is obviously extremely worrisome. I’ve never owned guinea pigs before so, I don’t know how they tick at all. Are there perfect conditions that need to be met for them to stay alive? Or, did my friend straight up starve her pets due to negligence? What’s strange is that they died at the same time so, the cause of death for both has to be the same... 

Anyone who has some experience in guinea pigs that can at least theorize to what happenend?
And if my worries are true... am I supposed to do something? Two animals died in her care because she did not care for them. And she has a dog, who knows what could happen. Just concerned is all.

Thanks in advanced.

At times I genuinely appreciate this about her but at times I think oversteps her boundaries when she talks to me or talks to me as if I am her child or a pupil.

To be fair, I complained that I wanted to start paying for myself. Her parents still contribute to her rent and I do not comment. I have suggested maybe she should budget so she doesn't overspend and have to ask for money from her parents.

 There is a sense of inequality in her friendship - where one person is always giving the offer advice, criticism, correction and another person is not. She does not need validation from me like I need from her nor do I feel like she values my opinion honestly. It is difficult for me to communicate with her because I am highly sensitive and she is on the aggressive side. A lot of times I feel attacked by her criticism and correction.

She's developed resentment towards my mother and I ever since she ran away from the house to live with her boyfriend. My mother just got out of an abusive relationship with my father and found someone who loved her and actually cared for us very recently. My sister, being the way she is hates this and has told my mother multiple times she would kill her if given the chance. I called her out on this and I believe my brother told her. Now she really hates my mothers boyfriend(james), my mother, and I (me the most). She's convinced my younger sisters not even over the ages of 13 to say I've touched them to their friends while the evil sister say I've touched her too (she's been gone since February 2016). My mother knows this is all bullshit and my smallest sister has already told her it's a lie and that she was told to say this. My little sisters being the easily manipulated children, have already told their friends and now the police are involved. I'm at the risk of having my entire life destroyed and on verge of suicide because of my own sister. It doesn't even stop here, the police came to my house last night looking for me.

291,"For some context, this girl was in one of my classes and I thought she might like me and I really liked her, so I messaged her on social media. We agreed to hangout and we met up at a coffee shop. 

Like a day before the date I just started a conversation and it went really well, and we found out that we have similar hobbies like hiking and stuff. We talked that whole day, and I messaged her in the morning how I’ll see her later on today, and she said she was looking forward to it.

Anyways, the day comes and it’s a little slow at first but I think we really vibed with each other toward the end. We have a the same type of major, we’re the same ethnicity, and we had some similar music tastes. She had some funny stories of whatever and she talked about her plans for the break.

We talked for like an hour and something, and then she had to go study for a final. She invited me to study with her even though I don’t have that class, but I thought it would be better just to walk her there. I felt like it would be weird bc it was like a whole study group with other people, I wouldn’t be able to talk with her that much and  i don’t want mess anything up. 

Once we were walking and talking, I immediately felt like she got more comfortable and we met up with her friend. I made her friend and her laugh, and I think I kind of saved myself there. As soon as we walked out of the door she said we should hangout/smoke like in two or three days.

The only thing is though, idk if it’s due to finals that sometimes she seemed not necessarily disengaged but she wasn’t exactly matching my enthusiasm all the time. Like I felt we weren’t flirty and it was more platonic and friendly. This could be cuz she’s super stressed over finals week and she kept saying how tired she was and over everything. 

Another thing she did is turn sideways a couple of times to kind of look around or kind of away from me. I thought that was weird but I couldn’t tell if it was out of nervousness or maybe like my gaze was a little too much, or I couldn’t tell exactly what.

And the most troubling thing is that she has to leave back home over this upcoming break, so that’s going to make it hard to do anything. She only lives an hour away but still, I don’t know if that ruins my chances at all. I’m just thinking that if she really likes me that everything will workout, and if not it’ll just fizzle out and that will be that.

She’s also leaving on vacation like straight after finals so I would only get one day to hang out with her if that. She also said that that there’s no WiFi where she’s going so that’s just going to make it hard for me to keep the connection going,

I don’t even know if she’s as interested in me as I am into her. It’s just so complicated. Also if we were to smoke it would have to be the day before one of my finals, so I don’t know if I want to do that, but I feel like weed let’s you really connect with a person so I’m just going do it.

What do you guys think? Is this pretty standard for a first date, I don’t even know if I’d call it a first date bc it wasn’t as romantic as I thought it would be. I also realize that there’s only so much that can be done in a coffee shop, so there’s that.  I’m really stressing over this girl and I want things to work out.",15Dec2018,1

Alright, so on Tuesday I bought a few items from Sephora since I am travelling over Christmas for a few days and needed to top up a couple products. I suffer pretty bad from social anxiety, so braving the Christmas shopping mall crowd was not ideal enough.

Anyway I got home, opened up the bag and I was missing an item. I wasn’t mad, I was annoyed though. It wasn’t a cheap item. It was at least $30. I invest in my makeup product so spending this amount with my income is a decently big deal. I also had other bags of gifts with me, nothing fell from those. Nothing was taken from my purse. Nothing else missing from this bag of purchases. The bag was upright the whole time, even in my car. I ripped apart my house &amp; car, I could not find it... So when I was able to have time I went back into the store and told the cashier what happened I had to wait for them to check ‘security footage’. Mind you they left me waiting an hour and their response was so bizarre.

They basically told me it went in the bag, the cashier put it in. They watched it over and over. They didn’t even apologize for pretty much wasting my time, telling me it’s not their problem and took my receipt! I am pretty shocked because this is something that’s never happened to me before.

294,"I've been wavering between being ""friends"" with this person I met 8 months ago online. I was going through a dark depression and was really lonely before we started messaging and soon somehow feelings sort of developed I guess. All I know is the lonely ache I had been feeling vanished.

I had a health crisis this summer and this person really helped me by being there when I needed someone to text. I felt really close to him and I was so glad to have finally come across a person who seemed interested enough to be there for me, even if we hadn't met in real life. We had so much in common and we seemed to be able to just talk for hours on end and never run out of things to say.

Lately though I feel lonely again. I don't feel like I can go to him about anything anymore. I don't feel like I can be as vulnerable as I once was. This person has become like everyone else to me now. I don't feel like our friendship is real anymore. Instead I feel like it is more like a parent-child or patient-therapist type of relationship. I feel used. 

I've given this person a lot of my time, kindness and even prayers. I always try to lift him up when he's sad or offer advice when he tells me about a problem. I try to make him feel heard and validated because I know he didn't get that much growing up. But lately whenever I try to talk about me or what is bothering me I either get ignored or the topic changes immediately back to him. I know how Toby Keith feels now. I want to talk about me, too. I feel like I'm just a therapist to him now. And that makes me feel lonely again.

I don't know what changed. He didn't used to be like this. In the beginning he always seemed interested in getting to know me and asking me how I've been doing and letting me vent. Now it seems so one-sided. I'm not sure what to do. It kind of makes me not want to talk to him anymore to be honest.

296,"I'm sorry this is long and if it doesn't make much sense, I'm kinda frazzled right now. 

I've lived with my roommate for two years. We've been best friends since we were five. We've had our problems as any long friendships do, but we've always made up. However, this is much different now that it involves our living situation. We're 21 and 22. She lives with me, my husband, and our son. 

Some backstory: my roommate got a job at a fast food restaurant when she was 17ish. She worked there up until last May when she got into an accident, and because this fast food restaurant was 15 miles out of town, she had to find a job in town once she recovered as her car had also broken down around the same time. It was a really rough time for her and I supported her throughout it. 

She has a drinking problem, and we jokingly refer to her as a functional alcoholic. She would get drunk nightly by herself in her room, but always show up to work on time the next day. She paid rent on time. After her accident, she realized how much of a drinking problem she truly had, and cut back. I was proud of her.

I got pregnant and we all decided the best idea would be to move as our place would get cramped with another kid. We found a cheap house to rent and it was perfect. She had found a new job she liked and it paid more than her previous. The rent at our new place was significantly more, but with her new job, we could afford it.

She started to see this new guy around the same time we moved. He's not great for her. He has a couple felonies, he's a major alcoholic, and the one time I met him he I got the worst vibe from this dude. She started drinking heavily again and would always go to his place. I didn't care because she can do what she wants. 

However, I quickly noticed one day that she hadn't left the house in days, which was odd because I always noticed when she left for work (I'm a stay at home mom so I'm always home.) I asked her if she had work and she said she'd been working night shifts. I thought it was odd but her job was a 24/7 establishment so it wasn't far fetched. 

But my suspicions weren't satisfied and I decided to have my husband call the place and ask if she was there. A helpful employee said she hadn't shown up to work in a week. So she was lying to me. My husband and I freaked out, we can't afford her half of rent if she loses her job. We had to personally go to her job and beg her boss to take her back, and we gave her boss my number to call me if she ever pulled this shit again. 

Well the last couple weeks have been fine, she's been working. Then I get a call this morning she didn't show up and I go to check her room and she's not home so she's obviously at her boyfriends. I'm furious. She knows there's absolutely no way we can afford this place without her, and I had a talk with her that she needs to go to work. If she doesn't like her job she can find a new one. But she's so wrapped up with this dude and their drinking, it's affecting her work now. 

She doesn't talk to me about this, she avoids all conflict. I don't know what's going on in her head. My husband and I really want to avoid kicking her out and finding a new roommate because we don't want a stranger around our two small kids. And we don't want to break our lease to find a new place. I'm just so lost and I have no idea what I can do, some advice would be great. ",15Dec2018,1

I made a post on the dating advice forum about letting this relationship go but I am actually struggling a lot to leave this in the past and move on. I'll leave a link to this post if you want to know more details but I'll give a short version here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/a4baai/my_story_a_tale_of_letting_go/?utm_source=reddit-android

I've been at Uni since sept and I met this girl at a party, long story short we got close really quick and I asked her on a date. We had a wonderful evening and she stayed the night. In that same week, she wanted to become official and I went along with it because it felt right. We had a month long relationship that I thoroughly enjoyed and I envisioned this being the girl I would spend the rest of the days at Uni with. Sadly this wasn't to be as she decided one night at a party in my flat to sleep in my flatmates room while I was just next door. I've never fully trusted either him or her since then, despite being on and off with her a bit towards the end. 

We broke up and she wanted to have the exact same dynamic as the relationship, but without the relationship or me getting my needs met at all. Naturally I cut this off which became really messy because she still had no idea what she has done wrong and kept reaching out when I asked her to give me space, forcing me to tell her that we should go our separate ways.

Anyway, despite me trying constantly to move forward and leave her and this relationship in my past, I cannot seem to be able to walk away. Every time I'm on the precipice of moving beyond this, something happens that causes me to fall back into a negative position. I wrote that post on dating advice thinking it would help me move on but it hasn't. I still hold a lot of love towards her and there is still a lot of hurt and even anger towards her and my flatmate.

I am currently in a better place and this year was supposed to be the year where my grades went up. Unfortunately, that ended up not happening and now I am burnt out, tired and stressed.

Second question is how do I manage my time and stick to it?

I am not willing to give any of them up. However, I only lift and skate 2 days a week, my job at the rink are on the same day as my skating and so are my music lessons.

306,"Yesterday I started chatting to another girl online in my area, looking for friends as we are both new here (let's call her Rachel). She asked if I wanted to go for a drink with her mates later. I agreed and we all had a nice time chatting. When I offered for Rachel to come to mine for a few drinks as her friends were off to work and bars are expensive, she seemed really keen. On the way back I invited my friend (we'll call her Kate) over as she lives in the flat above me. We went to Kates as it's roomier and we agreed that my sofa is the definition of uncomfortable. We hung out, the 3 of us for a bit and it was fun. It got to 11:30PM and Kate wanted to go to bed, so Rachel and I went back to my flat and chilled for a while. She started acting a bit odd and I couldn't put my finger on what it was. Kate is training to be a pharmacist so earlier we had a conversation about benzos that I have a prescription for and when we got back to mine, Rachel asked me so many questions about registering for a GP and obtaining meds that made me feel like she was just seeking benzos and/or other meds. I'm chronically ill and have been on a lot of meds in my time, but she just hit me with all these questions about my personal life; medications, rent, etc. Maybe I was being silly but her behavior was weirding me out so I text Kate 'I'm scared haha.' I hinted that I could do with heading to bed and she said she was tired too and asked to crash at mine. I kind of wanted my space but I didn't want to be rude so I said 'you're welcome to but I only have 1 bedroom and the sofa is so uncomfortable. I can call you a cab if you like?' She also lives a 5 minute walk from me so I thought it was a bit weird she asked, but then again it was midnight. She was really persistent and started making these excuses for my suggestions like when she said she had no cash on her for a cab, I told her the company I use take card and she said 'some of the companies don't take card though.' I know this isn't a money issue as she dropped in conversations things that hinted she (and her parents) had money, and the area she lives in is double what I pay for my rent. I did offer to pay though. I asked her a few times what she was doing which she dodged with weird excuses then eventually she said she was going to walk home and she made me feel kind of guilty about her walking back. I again offered to call a cab for her but she said 'it's okay because I don't know where they'd stop outside my flat.'

Now this is the actual mystery. Around 10, when Rachel and I came back from the bar and we left my flat to go to Kates, Kate jokingly moaned at me for never locking my door so I locked it. Rachel and I came back to mine at 11:30 using my keys. I was sitting on the floor talking to Rachel and my keys were either in my bag next to me or on the coffee table. I don't really remember where exactly I put them but I know they were in the living room where I dumped my bag and coat. Went to pop out today and couldn't find my keys, turned the flat upside down, even looked in my shoes, my bed, bags, under cushions, everywhere. I have a ridiculously big and colourful keychain on my keys because it helps me find them in the dark pit of my handbag, so they're not likely to slip down the sofa or anything. I text her asking if she had seen them and she replied no but then offered to come round and help me look.

I don't know how to approach this and I realise I'm going to look like the biggest fucking bitch if I find my keys somewhere.

I don't know if I'm being paranoid because this is the first time I've been alone in this flat since I moved in with my boyfriend 6 months ago. He's been at his parents for a few days and gets back tomorrow. I need to go to the shop but I'm really worried now about leaving my door unlocked. Luckily I can manage without leaving the house until my boyfriend gets back.

If I say something to her all it would do is cause upset and I'd be such a horrible person if I was wrong. It's just how she suddenly started to make me feel uncomfortable when we were alone that's making me feel like this. I just need some advice. I'll carry on looking but then if I don't find them do I ask to have my locks changed? Am I being a bit dramatic?

316,"Hi guys so I’m after a little advice as I’m at my wits end here sadly 😌

So some background, I’m a married father of three young children, I work twelve hour rotational shifts and I’m the sole bread winner in the household. I’m also autistic, as are my two eldest children to varying degrees hence why my wife doesn’t work as she has to look after the kids.

Over the last few months my sleep has been getting worse, most days/nights I may get 3-5 hours of broken sleep. Rarely I’ll get six at most seven hours of broken sleep. This is causing all sorts of issues ranging from lack of concentration, chronic tiredness, absentmindedness, severe anxiety and anger issues stemming from lack of sleep. Worst of all is the insomnia, I’ll lay in bed for hours unable to sleep or I’ll fall asleep only to wake up again an hour or two later and be fully awake and unable to sleep for hours at a time.

Unfortunately stress is another side effect and it’s having a negative effect on my marriage. My wife and I constantly fight, I have basically no relationship with my children as I never see them and when I do I’m either a zombie due to lack of sleep or so stressed out that I can’t relax.

I’ve tried all sorts of things from reading, exercising (when I’m not feeling lethargic) mood lighting, scented candles etc unfortunately none of these work for me and I’ve gotten to the point where the local doctors won’t prescribe me sleeping tablets anymore as they feel that I should be trying alternative methods.

I’ve tried talking with my boss who essentially told me that because the site is a 24 hour operation we’re required to work rotating shifts. I also don’t want to push the issue unless I have to as I’ve already had an official warning for lateness due to turning up late due to lack of sleep.

Of course I could look for another job but unfortunately I’m essentially unskilled and have neither the financial ability nor the time to learn a trade. Also given financial stresses I can’t just quit to find work in another field as we’d have no income and any job would have to be working distance of public transport as I can’t drive.

I’m really not sure what to do, would WorkSafe be able to help me at all? Or could my doctor deem me medically unfit for shift work? But if that were to happen could I be sacked because I can’t fulfil the job requirements?

I’m sorry if half of this seems disjointed/makes no sense. I’ve slept two-three hours since 9pm last night and it’s 4am now 😌

Any help and/or advice would be greatly appreciated.",15Dec2018,1

322,"I'm a ""new teen"", recently started high school. And frankly, I no longer am comfortable with kissing my dad/being kissed by my dad on the lips.


My theory behind why he dies this is the following; he's only recently been quite involved in my life again. Therefore, he still treats me like a child, as he does not know how to treat me any different. He was involved in my life when I was younger, from being a newborn to about grade 3, so he only (clearly) can remember me as a child.


I have it quite obvious that I am uncomfortable with it, I show that I am hesitant to kiss him, and have straight up told him that I am not comfortable with it. Let's just say his response to that was not the happiest.

In order to achieve these goals, I maintained a strong GPA, balance multiple extracurricular activities, and become a published researcher in my field. Doing this required many, many sacrifices socially and prioritizing school over relationships over the last two years. Now, I am encountering many personal problems/habits that I am worried is it because I burnt myself out or drove myself into depression.

\-no libido 

\-smoke weed everyday to help with stress

\-no motivation to do work (I have to force myself)

\-I feel like I do not have emotions

9am-12pm: classes

327,"I work in Network Operations for a call center. Among other things, we have some 15 minute checks that need to be done to make sure calls are routing accurately and systems are functional.

Last weekend, I incitement the manager of a pattern had been insecticide, which I was no longer able to ignore. There is a coworker who lags far behind on his checks, especially if he works alone and even on dead shifts where there is no excuse.

I was staying after to work on a project and wasn't assigned to monitoring. When I finished up, I noticed he was 3 hours behind and nothing had happened all shift. No excuse.

I took screenshots and called my manager, who requested the screenshots and came online, talked to him, and told me that he needed to get the guy off weekends and was waiting to hire more weekend help. Seemed a bit like a blow off, but not my job. I mentioned the pattern.

Today when I left, I closed out of the Google sheets on purpose, but I figured out that I could make copies of the sheets without opening them.
As it stands today, he is over four hours behind.

I haven't said anything. I did notice that this week they turned on the view tracker - maybe it is being addressed.

I feel weird. Nothing bad has happened but if it dies and he doesn't catch it because of this... We willmlose money by the second. And itbisn't a hard task - it takes 10 seconds every 15 minutes.

One of our department principles is to always assume good intentions. Heh.

I hate this guy slacks off so much and still gets paid. He has a new baby and a wife that wants him off weekends but... He was hired for weekends and you would think the fact that he is a first time father would scare him into compliance.

So, do I trust the process or what? I don't want management to think I have a grudge or whatever. I don't. He is nice but he is a lazy guy. Not someone you want on your payroll.

333,"When I was young my mother and I were very close. The older I got the more I began to realize that some things weren’t right. At the moment I’m not close with either of my parents. My father is lazy, narcissistic, and just kind of a deadbeat. My mother on the other hand loves to put out a great image of herself. Everyone around thinks that she is a fantastic person in every way but they don’t really know her. Since I was little she has used me as her own personal little therapist. Told me EVERYTHING including issues she had with my father and there are some things I just didn’t need to know. She would take me in the car and drive around aimlessly for hours while literally sobbing about her life, how much she hates my father, her childhood issues, and anything else that came to mind. 
She is also incredibly paranoid and controlling. For example, when I was a teenager if she found out that my sister or I had a friend who was the opposite gender she would flip out, take our phones to go through them, search our entire room, and sit us down to have long and honestly insane sounding conversations. She thought that a male friend meant for sure we were fucking them or already pregnant even if all we said was “Hey, Tom and I got a A on our group project!” She was the same with my dad. If he even mentioned a female friend she would threaten divorce and endlessly accuse him of cheating (he never cheated, but ironically, she did). She also insisted that she have 100% control over the finances as well. Due to this and other things my parents fought every single day. 
As time went on her paranoia got worse and she also began developing delusions. She thought everyone was out to get her. She cut ties with most friends and deleted social media because she was sure that they were spies for her job or something like that. This delusion was enforced when she began to hear “the voice of Jesus Christ warning her about it.” Things have only gotten worse. Her mother had schizophrenia and my mother’s paranoia, delusions, and auditory hallucinations started around the same age my grandmother’s did. 
Now to present day, my relationship with her is worse than it ever has been. Her and my dad divorced a few years ago and she tells me that she’s seeing someone new. Turns out that this “great new guy” is an ex-con, neo-nazi, “recovering” heroine addict (who still “accidentally” gets high sometimes) When I met him the first thing I noticed was the massive swastika tattoo on his arm. He’s a white supremacist and more than anything he hates interracial relationships of any kind but especially any minority and a white person. I’m the result of a mixed race relationship. My mom is white and my dad is half Mexican half Guatemalan. She told me I’m close minded and full of hate because I won’t accept him. She also thinks I’m going to hell for judging because “only god can judge!” (I’m an atheist) At this point I was already considering cutting her out but this past weekend really made me want to. My sister called me and said she’s on her way to our moms house and that I need to go over too because she had talked to her and said that something seemed off. My sister got there first and when I got there there were already EMTs. She overdosed on something. She insists that she only smoked some weed but weed doesn’t do that to you and it was fucking terrifying. She’s out of the hospital now and I don’t want to see her. My sister is furious with me because she insists that my mother can do no wrong. 
I don’t know what to do and I feel like a horrible person for wanting to cut her out because she’s my mother but I can’t take this anymore. I know all of this probably sounds crazy, maybe even a little far fetched but please just someone give me some advice. Is cutting her out justified?

TLDR: I got all my vaccines except chicken pox and can't find anyone that has the adult dose of it.

A few years ago while I was pregnant, I was tested to see what I was immune to (a standard test). Come to find out that I'm not immune to the chicken pox and my OBGYN at the time said I would need to get this vaccine after I give birth.

I asked my parents why I got all the other vaccines but not this one. My dad told me, ""well all your siblings had chicken pox when you were born, and your pediatrician said the immunity would pass through the breast milk from your mom so you didn't need the vaccine.""

Apparently that pediatrician was making shit up. Anyway, I was supposed to get it in the hospital right after giving birth--but the nurse messed up and gave me a tetnus shot only. I found this out just before being discharged and couldn't get the vaccine in the hospital anymore.

Fast forward to about six month ago. I ask my new primary care about getting the chicken pox vaccine. She looks surprised, confused, then makes a few calls to see if she can get it. Turns out she can't, gives me a prescription and tells me the pharmacy will have it.

I go to the pharmacy, and they are clueless. They also make a few calls and tell me they can't get their hands on an adult-size dose of the vaccine and to call other pharmacies. I do, and none have it or are able to get it. None are able to tell me where to find a place that can give me the vaccine.

359,"I’m currently in college and I have a friend who is also my next door neighbor in the dorm. I have a hunch that she’s gay and an even smaller hunch that she has a crush on me (I can go into detail about that, it’s not just the photos thing), which is why I think she’s taking photos of me?

Basically, it happened on Snapchat and everyone takes secret photos of other people to send to them, right? It’s just good fun and not meant to be serious, and I don’t mind those. She used to take photos of me on Snapchat and send those to me, which is fine, I didn’t mind those.

However, I have sometimes caught her phone pointed at me like it’s taking a photo of me, but I don’t get Snapchats right afterwards. It always happens when I turn around or look up to look at her, so it’s “secret.” Once I looked up at her and I saw her phone facing me pretty much red-handed and she got really defensive even though I didn’t say anything and just sorta looked at her. It makes me uncomfortable that she’s potentially taking photos of me without me knowing or sending those to me.

For the Snapchat secret pictures that you send to that person, I have already expressed my dislike for those because I feel like that’s how the whole secret photo thing began, so she stopped doing those. However, I feel like I can’t as easily approach her about the secret photo thing because I don’t have any proof that it actually occurs. I can’t just snatch her phone and look through her memories or whatever. She might not even save them. I might even be wrong about all of this and she might just be looking at front view camera (though I highly doubt it because she doesn’t fix her hair or whatever behavior you usually do when you look at front camera) or something. If I confront her, she’ll deny it. But it has happened multiple times and I’m getting a bit uncomfortable and irritated because of it.",15Dec2018,1

365,"My boyfriend and I had a disagreement and he stormed off, refusing to talk to me. He went to his computer and put his headphones on, refusing to acknowledge I was there. I tried to take them off and he grabbed my arm to prevent it. He told me to stop.

It's happened a million times that I ask him to stop touching me, or doing something to me, and he barely ever stops.

So with a normal person I would've stopped but since he'd refused to leave me alone multiple times that day, I kept trying to take the headphones off. He kept grabbing my arms and pulling them away, or twisting them together.

He told me that it wasn't enough that I was insufferable, that I was physically abusive because of what I was doing. I don't understand this. I wasn't doing what I did with any force, I was just moving my hands towards his headphones and trying to grab them. It wasn't any violent jerking motions or anything, just like how you'd take your headphones off if you had them. I was the one with red marks all over from him pushing me away, but I just wanted to talk to him.

He said I was abusive for not leaving him alone, and that I was physically abusive on top of that for trying to take them off. I mentioned how he does this to me all the time, how he has even gotten sexual when I'm telling him to stop, that he doesn't stop. He said ""wooooooow are you fucking kidding me"" and stormed out and refuses to talk to me, says he isn't responding to me for the rest of the day.

Was this physically abusive of me?

This is obviously from my perspective but I did call him an ass and things like that earlier and say that he doesn't care about my feelings and things like that so he thinks I'm emotionally abusive too. What happened is I was upset over something that didn't even relate to him, I've had a rough couple of days and was feeling down and wanted him to console me. He said he wouldn't and that my reasons for being upset were stupid, that he wasn't going to feed into it, and that I needed to grow a thicker skin and that I was weak. Even if he didn't agree with why I was upset, I just wanted him to care, ask me why, try to understand and if he didn't agree then still be a little nicer about it.",15Dec2018,1

370,"**The Issue**

My sister (14) is constantly clashing with my parents. They seem to downright not trust each other anymore. I am a college student, so I am only at the house every once and a while. The fights started last summer when I was here, but I thought my sister was going through some kind of phase. Now that I am back, I can sense the hostility. 

**Context on my sister**

My sister is a popular and smart girl. She has many friends and is often out of the house. She also is involved in an advanced program at school. She seems to be doing quite well in this program despite her initial reluctantness. In fact, she and my parents fought over that during the summer, as they knew she was smart enough to do it but she wanted to do a lower program. Many of the fights between her and my parents seem to start because she expects them to give her rides everywhere and barely tells them where she is going and who she is going with. She seems to switch her mood during, before, and after fights on a whim. Sometimes it will seem like our parents and her are getting along fine, then something will happen and they will be instantly yelling and crying. She also seems to guilt my parents, or at least attempt to constantly. This may be far fetched, but she does posses quite a few traits on the psychopathic checklist.

**The fights**

I haven't witnessed too many fights (all non-violent, usually just yelling matches), but the ones I have witnessed start very fast and without warning. Most of them start as a result of my sister asking unrealistic things of my parents, such as constant driving to friends. My sister also loves being out of the house and routinely ignores our parents and pretends her phone is off if she doesn't want to come home. My parents are not only angry at this, but also the dangers of her not telling them where she is. I don't know if she sneaks out of the house or not, but my parents have installed a motion sensing camera at the front door.

**Where do I stand**

I have a very interesting position in this conflict that makes me believe I may be one of the only people that can fix this. Due to the fact that I am never around, I believe I have both sides of the conflicts trust. My sister has been open to me, but she always paints my parents in a bad light. While my parents trust me, they don't tell me much, as they seem to not want to drag me into this. Despite that my parents have seemed to occasionally cracked and tell me some things. I know I can talk to my sister in private, I just don't know what I should say or if I can even change her mind about our parents. I know they love us and I want them to stop fighting. Is this just a phase? Am I overreacting? If not, what steps can I take to try to stop this fighting?

371,"Ah highschool... work, stress, drugs, dating, and instagram... What a time to be living in. 

I have 4 years ahead of me before I legally am an adult and life seems so boring and plain. My family all says that once I get a bf at age like 20, I'll have all the time in the world to do what I want (along with bills, taxes, jobs, labor, and children ofc). But I feel like so much of that is wishful thinking, how long do I have to continuously convince myself that all this shit I'm doing will guarantee me a life worth living in the future?

I still haven't had any candid moments in my life, nothing to cherish and be able to call ""the good ol' times"". I don't want to look back years from now only remembering how painfully uneventful my life has been.

I feel like at any moment I could just go off the edge so something interesting will happen, dating around, drinking my ass off. Something exciting. Instead of spent my first semester of highschool working, working, and working. I know that's what school is for, but what about my life? I'm the equivalent to a robot spewing out papers over papers of projects and assignments. 

Not to be cold but the people at my school are also boring, at least when I'm with them. I guess it's mostly my fault because I just don't click with anyone. So overall, I have no friends, no hobbies, and no passion to keep me going.

This post is probably going to be as negative and long-winded as my colleague, so I apologize in advance, haha. 

She is negative, super long-winded with even the quickest questions, always saying how hard everything is for her, how busy and stressful the days are (for her, of course) and she always goes on and on about everything. Like for example how things are going in this world isn’t how it should be and how hard that is for her and how it’s affecting her because she had a burn-out. When someone says one word wrong to her, you hear it all day.

Now, please don’t get me wrong. I take burn-outs seriously and I do have sympathy for it but it’s been two years, and how she uses it every time gives me the impression it is because she still gets attention with it (don’t know where, but at work everyone is trying to avoid the negativity) and it gives her the chance to complain again about whatever small thing.

All day it’s things like “pff, sigh, ugh, it is so busy, it was so busy yesterday, because yesterday...etc etc” to let everyone know how hard it is for her. 
I just can’t stand it. I have tried to push the conversations to more positive things but it doesn’t help. She always turns the conversations into something negative and pessimistic. Always with a tone in her voice and body language that it is only difficult for her. I am trying to keep conversations short, but it’s just impossible. She literally keeps talking while you walk away.

He contemplated becoming a history professor in his retirement, but instead decided to buy an ancient farm house in Virginia and renovate it to its full former glory (including researching methods of construction during the 19th century so he could reconstruct it the way they did it).

Since visiting him, he has basically turned his house into a museum. He buys all the oldest cool stuff he can find online: grandfather clock, impressionist and romantic oil paintings, antique furniture from all over the world- he even has a collection of civil war swords and bayonets. He even goes fox hunting (I think because it makes him feel like he is apart of history and the tradition).

He always just wanted tools for birthday, Father’s Day, and Christmas- but one year I got him a book on Winston Churchill and he seemed to really love it and was impressed I thought of it for him. 

My question to you all historians: is there anything semi affordable (under $100) I can get for someone obsessed with everything old, that would be really something special to someone who appreciates history? He’s an amazing dad and I just want to get him more than just”tools” every year.

My dad loves to read (like LOVES to read), so are there any history books or historical accounts you felt were amazing or had amazing photographs? Artifacts that are surprisingly common enough to be affordable for common folk? Little known trinkets that are still made and sold today that have its roots in history?

He really loves learning about European history and any of the wars. He also loves learning about his heritage too (Irish and German). He lives in southern Virginia so he loves everything about the past out there as well. He even researched the family who built his house and knows their life story!

379,"I started my HR career at this place and I work directly with my boss. He is new too, well, a month ahead of me. I've only been here a little over a month. Anyway, I just knew instantly he was very trustworthy. He has years of HR experience and I admire him. He is a great boss. I want to be friends but I know I can't be. I don't know if he feels the same way. My heart is so open right now. I just really care about him. I ask him if he's ok when I go to his office. I just want to make his life easier. We're both always so swamped with work. He told me at one point I could tell him anything. But I don't because I want to be professional. When I see him my heart is just overjoyed. I just want to care about him. He still acts as my manager. Knows when to tell me Im making mistakes and to fix it. 

He tells me when I do a good job and tells me he appreciates it. This isn't about love. This is about friendship. I think about him all the time and I don't know why. I'm engaged IRL and straight, I don't feel like it's romantic. It's something else that I can't pinpoint. Friendship, maybe, like I said.

  
Just the other day I kept asking him we need to chat because I want us to communicate better as work professionals. He kept saying he is busy. Then finally towards the end of the day he comes up to me in person and said he doesn't want me to think that he's blowing me off. It's the CEO flew in and he had to get things done. We will chat on Monday in the afternoon okay? By the way you really improved. I did notice and I appreciate he told me. My heart fluttered and smiled.

I also am sensitive and I care so much about others. I was so happy. Our bond is strong. All I want is to make him happy. What do I do and what is wrong with me?",15Dec2018,1
380,"I'm a teen and my mother is a emotional manipulator. She's been quite mad at me lately for calling her out for being creepy and she's mad because I barely passed my maths paper. 

In our house, we have a CCTV/camera that has motion detection and will immediately send an alert to my mom if something moves. I have been going out to tuition everyday. Yesterday, I went out and took a while to come back since I was having dinner with my sister. I called her out for being creepy since she always asks me where I'm going and why I haven't left the house if I'm late for tuition or hangouts. She Normally doesn't come home a lot and we don't live with out dad since our parents got divorced. So, she scolded me for calling her creepy and she told me to live with my dad if I thought it was creepy.

My mother said that as long as I tried hard in my exams, she said that she won't care about the grades. When she saw that I barely passed my maths paper she got mad and started to guilt me. "" How would she ( an old teacher who cares a lot about me ) react if she found out you barely passed your exam?!"". I felt so bad that I cried, I couldn't tell her the reason why I cried or she would become defensive.

381,"My (23) best friend (19) eloped w/her bf  (20) of 1 year abruptly yesterday. Normally this would be cause for celebration, new hubby is the father of her child (2 months) and they’d been engaged for about 4 months now. However, their relationship hasn’t been gumdrops and sprinkles AT ALL. He was quite honest about the fact that he’s never been faithful in any relationship he’s had ever- my bff figured she could change that I guess? 

There are several things that have happened that have soured their relationship (he has a temper, he’s slipped into quite a few girls’ DM’s but has never actually tried to physically cheat on her, he’s controlling, he hates her family and they hate him, he doesn’t care for their daughter equally and sort of expects her, since she’s the “mom”, to WANT to do everything while he just kind of helps ya know? And then uses his culture as an excuse). my friend is not innocent in this either though- he doesn’t know that she has the password to all of his social media accounts and snoops in his stuff (this is how she knows about the DM stuff), she also does not get along with her family (for various reasons) and sort of gaslights his anger-mostly at her (step)father whom he has already gotten into a physical altercation with but then gets upset when he refuses to make any sort of peace with her mother (she hyped him up to be that way so idk why she expects different?) 

So they both could be better to one another. 

Normally I’d stay out of this-I actually have been lol because I got tired of the back and forth “I love him so much but he always yells at me and treats me horribly blah blah” but then the same night she’ll post about how much she loves him and he’s the best thing ever 🙄 

However, 2 weeks ago she confessed to me, and him, that she was not sure she wanted to be with him anymore...and now they’re married.  I’ve been waffling between supporting her and hyping up her happiness or supporting her but also letting her know that I feel she’s rushing into things and that marriage isn’t gonna fix any of their problems. 🤔

She’s gonna get enough grief from her family when she comes back (they went to another city to elope and won’t be back for a few days) and I really don’t wanna add to that. It’s not my place to tell her how to live her life. 

I don’t wanna poo poo on her decisions because it’s not my life but I also don’t wanna be that friend whose a glorified “yes man” and hypes up a stupid choice just to make her happy🤔",15Dec2018,1

383,"So, there’s multiple levels to this. First off, I had to end my relationship with my gf a while back because we just have extremely different ways of thinking, and plus, I didn’t have the time to spend on a relationship with school and work. Now she doesn’t really like me that much any more and I get it. 

Now for the second part: I went to Thailand a few years ago to try and teach English. That didn’t really work out. But, I did meet a girl when I was over there. We ended up dating and the relationship didn’t end when I got back home to Canada. We ended up dating for about 3 years and survived multiple almost relationship destroying things, which is good. But ultimately after that time, we called it off. Not much we can do with her being over there and me being literally half way across the world. She’s still my friend though and I talk her pretty much every day. 

While I was overseas, I came to love Thailand. The food, the culture, the scenery...just about everything in that place. So, lately I’ve been thinking a lot about her and the country and the fact I could use a vacation. So I went ahead and booked a flight to see her in April. However, I’m a student. So you can pretty much guess that I have limited funds. However, I found a way to book these flights.

When I booked them, my brain put out a red flag and told me it was a bad idea. Plus, if my ex gf from recently catches wind of this, there might be an even bigger problem. But she’s not likely to talk to me, so I guess I’m safe on that account.

I guess what I’m trying to ask is that was all this a good idea?

385,"I've been in a long distance relationship for almost two years now. My bf and I have been discussing marriage of late, his parents do not want him to marry me. They take every opportunity to point out that I will not fit in their family and lifestyle - which is true. 

A few months back, my bf was set up with a girl his family picked out (I'm from India, I hope that explains arranged marriage type stuff). My bf freaked out completely and went into nervous breakdown. Instead of actually telling the girl or her family that he can't marry her because he's in a committed relationship, he goes grovelling to his parents begging them to call the match off. Guess what? They didn't. They knew about me and bluntly told him to break it off with me and marry this other girl because she was perfect for their family and everyone loved her - extended cousins and all. The issue got so bad that finally, I had to call in a favour with one of my friends who let the girl's family know and the match was broken up at the last possible moment. 

Now up till this point, my bf and I never had any major issues. The way he handled this freaked me out. How am I supposed to spend the rest of my life with a guy who's so afraid of society and his family. I can't imagine what would have happened if my friend wasn't involved. I've brought this up with him so many times and every time he says that he's not like me and he can't act like that because his relationship with his family is different from what I have with mine and that if it comes up again, he'll act differently. 

So it's come up again and my boyfriend has been asking me to agree to all of his family's demands just so that they will agree to get us married. I'm just frustrated at this point. I keep telling him that they are just making silly demands just to create issues between us but he refuses to listen. 

I'm hot tempered and I confront nearly everyone in my personal life head on. I'm 28 now and at this point, I'm not sure if the option of breaking up and waiting for someone else is even reasonable. He's a decent guy and he would take care of me if I'm sick or dying but this spineless behaviour when it comes to his family is pissing me off.

386,"I’m M 19 American don’t speak a lick of German and completely alone in Stuttgart Germany for the 4th night in a row. (I traveled alone from the USA) I booked a room in a hostel in the hopes of making some friends along the way but I keep striking out. Most of the people staying in the hostels are traveling in groups mostly for sports teams or some sort of school event and they don’t have time to do very much in the city. Many of these groups speak little to no English as well so that doesn’t help much either. 

* ( I found out that most college age kids from the USA travel to Germany in the summer/spring time when the weather is nicer or at least that’s what  the hostel employees say)

I’ve already gone to all the cool attractions around the town including the Christmas market, Porsche and Mercedes museums and a few of the castles but it’s pretty hard to be social in these environments, Since most people are usually doing there own thing. So my question of advice would be what would you do in my shoes? Go to a club later tonight? Go back to the hostel and watch Netflix? Or stay at the Christmas market?

I hope this post doesn’t make me come off in a bad light and thanks for taking the time to read. I’m having a great time but with it being the holiday season I feel further from home than ever and I wish I had something longer than a 5 min conversation with people.

388,"A few weeks back, my girlfriend of about 4-5 months (but we’ve had a past for about 2-3 years) told me she tried getting diagnosed with ADHD in order to be prescribed adderall because she has trouble studying, and ended up walking out with being diagnosed as depressed. She shrugged it off and we laughed - she’s so full of life, how could she ever be depressed?

The fights between us have been constant. I’m sure there are more than one reason for them, but it’s mostly because of how hotheaded we get. We are nearly identical in personality and sometimes when heated, “who is right” matters more than “what is right”. We’ve been working on this, though.

A couple of nights ago, she confessed a lot of feelings she’s had bottled up inside her that would make me believe she is definitely suffering from some form of depression. We talked about therapy, and she agreed to meet with one. Today, they’ve had numerous calls and at least 3 in-person meetings.

Yet the fights continue. Many times it ends with her telling me that I am not understanding of her feelings, and that makes me feel like I’ve caused the entire argument we are having. Being treated as the villain has been wearing me down, but I love this girl and I’m not sure what I’m doing that makes me seem as villainous as she acts like I am. 

I’ve told her that I’ve felt this way before she was diagnosed, because our fights prior to that usually ended the same way. Is there something I am missing when we speak/argue? Is this something common with those who suffer from depression? I need to be able to understand if I’m doing something wrong and how to do better - she’s the most special person I’ve ever met.

390,"Hi. I'm really confused and don't know how to interpret this. Hopefully some guys on here can give me some insight?

So a few nights ago I (25F) hung out with this new guy(30M) for the second time. We've been texting for a while and went out to see a movie and got ice cream as our first date and I had a great time with him! I met him there and left by myself and he was nice and a gentleman and all of that.

So, second date was a few nights ago. I'm pretty sure he's gonna kiss me, pretty sure we're gonna have sex. And I'm 110% down for it. We go out to dinner, play mini golf, we have a lot of fun, whatever. So he asks if I want to go back to his place to just hang out and chat, etc., that he'll make me coffee or something. I say yes and now I'm suuuppperrr convinced and excited it's gonna happen.

We get to his place and sit and talk for a long time. *He makes no moves besides like reaching out and touching my hand every once in a while. He's sitting as far away from me on the couch as possible.* He decides to put one of his favorite action movies on which I'm down for and I'm like ok here it comes. *He sits....on the recliner....while I'm on the couch......*

At one point he notices I'm getting tired and says that I can sleep there if I want...but the way he said it was weird. I don't know how to explain it. *It felt like he was telling me I could crash on the couch.*

Ok so moral of the story nothing fucking happened and I left after the movie with no kiss no cuddling no sex, nOTHING. And my ego is bruised. I've never really experienced this before.

394,"Sorry for long post.

So I’m a M29, I’ve been living alone in my apartment for almost 5y. This apartment is my property. The building is from 1965.
I’m living on the top floor (5), there are two apartments per floor. So total of 12 apartments.

My previous neighbors directly under mine recently sold her apartment. It was a difficult sell, so I stood empty for almost 6 months or even longer. She also lived there alone, but now she moved in with her bf. 

So I got used to it being very quiet. And I loved it. My previous neighbors was also very quiet, as  am I. So there where never complaints 

Now I have new neighbors, a couple. They have been living here for almost 7 months or longer even. 

But they are much louder. Not by being assholes, but just opening doors, moving stuff, dropping things, ... it’s hard to explain, it’s like they are more living like brutes. 

For some reason I am very sensitive too it. I’m also an over-thinker. So sometimes I imagine all the horrors and keep myself up at night or stresses me out. 

I used to love my apartment, it was my place of rest, my sanctuary. But now it’s getting less, because my new neighbors. 

I talk to them about it, and they are nice people and it got better. But it’s just me being over sensitive to it. I’m also not good at confrontation, so it was a big step for me to talk to them. 

So my question is, what are tips to reduce noises from neighbors and my tips for myself to help me deal with it?

I don't want to hurt people who are close to me. But somehow I end up being too emotional and needy, crying out of a sudden and taking thigs waaay out of hand. And at the end of the day i feel guilty and want to just end the comunication with that certain person, because i don't think it's right for them to be in touch with a toxic human like me. I think my close friends and my boyfriend would be better off without me in their lives. They would be happier if i left because that makes room for someone better, more emotionally stable, grown-up and happier to take place. I can't trust myself. I don't want to hurt the people I love, but...I always end up saying or doing something that's giving a negative vibe to the relationship. 
My best friend told me she thinks i am not happy for her successes. She said that from all of her friends I am the hardest to arrange a meeting with. She lives in an other country at the moemnt and when she comes back to her hometown for the hollidays' she says everybody else make time for her, leave all their plans or find a productive way to push them aside.

I had an exam yesterday and today she had things to do. And instead of making plans what to do, where to go with, when to see her. I am crying and being an asshole, saying stupid things on the phone and then telling her that she needs to not talk to me anymore because i am toxic.  And after all that stupidity i feel guilty.

396,I am 22 years old and I am on my 3rd academic suspension from a community college. I am a failure. It is not because I don’t understand the material but it is because I have horrible horrible time management and am a procrastinator. The first time I went on suspension I was only kicked out a semester. The 2nd time was for two semesters and I had learned my lesson or so I thought. I was getting good grades in my classes and really motivated to do well. I even changed my major so I was on the right path to graduate soon and then this semester happened. I only took 2 classes. One was accounting and I failed which sent me into my 3rd suspension and now I have to sit out of school for a whole year. My parents dream is for me to finish college and they are still disappointed in me from my last suspension.

I want to be the bigger person and let this go but it still hurts at times and I don’t know how to break the emotional attachment. It feels unresolved but I also know that I am never going to get any answers or clarity on the situation so it’s pointless to dwell on it.

I'm a senior in high school, so is this girl's boyfriend, and the girl herself is a junior. My friend's boyfriend lives up there, and it's really remote, apparently to the point you can't even look it up on Google maps to find it. So one day, her boyfriend tells her he wants to meet up. She hasn't been to his house much/at all because she didn't know how to get there, they'd only been dating for about two months. She really didn't want to hang out, but he wouldn't stop insisting and she agreed finally. He drove and picked her up, and they were alone since he was house-sitting, even moreso with the whole mountain-isolation filled with snow thing.

Things go fast from here, they're watching the LotR movies, and before she knows it his clothes are off. She tells me that she insisted 'no' pretty much the whole time, but he wouldn't listen. She couldn't pack up and leave because he had driven her, and if even he hadn't, the roads up to the mountain are full of hairpin turns which might've been even more dangerous for someone unaccustomed to driving it because of the ice and darkness.

To make things worse, a good chunk of her inner circle of friends are the uptight Christian type. I'm Christian myself, but these kids practically hold it against her that she's had sex before marriage. My friend confided all of this in me about two nights ago and was in tears by the end of it, because she knows she didn't want to, and she feels dirty about it, and is even in that limbo of feeling bad about it herself because 'she should've tried harder to stop it' and 'she's not even sure it was rape'.

My biggest question is, how do I tell her that it was rape, and that she needs to break up with him? Is it possible that I'm overreacting because I'm kind of naive myself, and I don't want to force her to do anything she'll hate more. As it is now, she doesn't even want to break up with him because we are all in a lot of school activities together, and she's worried about the divide. Still, she's scared of him now and doesn't want to hang out with him, especially 1 on 1, and she and I are hanging out today just so she has an excuse to not hang out with him today like he wanted.",15Dec2018,1

I started talking to this girl who was a friend of a friend and then at one moment we started making out. The next day I woke up regretting everything, and I was a little bit embarassed of what happened. I'm not bi, I know I like men, but I think I kissed the other girl because I was sick and tired of all my relationships failing so I said fuck it. Well, I told my best friend about it and now she thinks I like women \*facepalms\*. There's nothing wrong with it, but I just don't simply like girls. I was just having fun that night, know what I mean? So, my best friend started behaving really awkwardly towards it. The other day I went over her house and we were talking about stuff and suddenly I brought up a friend of mine who's gay, and she said, ""Oh, your \*cough\* gay \*cough\* friend"". She did that \*cough\* thing in between, like she thinks I'm gay too. I felt really uncomfortable at that, but we kept talking still. Now she sent me a meme through whatsapp, that said ""we all did it at one point but we never talked about it"" and underneath a photo of a movie scene with two women kissing each other. And I was all like yeah haha we all did it, I'd never do it again though. And she told me ""you should watch the movie, you'll like it"" and a lot of smirky faces. I was like, what? What does she mean? And I told her ""What's up? Now everybody thinks I like women"" and she was like ""No, I don't think that"". Guys I don't know what to do. She's like all obsessed about what I did a drunken night, she can't get it away from her mind?! She keeps on making fun of me! I'm not the one that's talking to her about this. I forgot about what happened because it honestly doesn't matter to me but for my friend, I'm a lesbian!?? I don't know what to do with this.

416,"Please let me know if there is a more appropriate place to post this.

A little back story, this is my sister’s third time in rehab. She’s essentially a pill popping drug addict and waayyy addicted to drugs. Made suicidal attempts, but a lot of it was a cry for help type thing. Not down playing her mental illness, but she’d laugh about it the next day saying she was just drunk and wanted attention. She has NPB and has done some terrible, terrible things. My mother has taken care of her and her kids for the last ten years because she can’t even hold a job. My mom has finally hit her end and is trying to heal and take care of her own mental health. So this last time my sister drank herself into a mess and the police were called, she was sent to a psych hospital and my mother has since sold the house she bought for my sister.

She’s been in rehab 60 days, but it’s never worked in the past. My mom wants her to stay 30 more days, but refuses to pay the 28K they’re asking for. 

Point being, they’re threatening to kick her out on Monday. But my mother doesnt want to speak to my sister for years. She has no job. No car. No clothes other than what’s there. And her kids aren’t allowed to see her. What do we do? My mom doesn’t want her to be homeless, but she also knows how vulnerable she is right now and how much my sister is capable of manipulating her again to try and get what she wants, or will throw a temper tantrum if she doesn’t.

I’m just at a loss here. Anyone know of any sober houses in Texas that could take her in or have any advice on where to direct her next?

It’s been a month my parents have been fighting by everything (not physical). Yesterday they were arguing and my dad told her that she won’t go. In the morning my mom brought my little brother to the doctor, so the trip was delayed (she had the car). They started to arguing again because he’s been sick for 3 days and not until now she attended him.

420,"This happened yesterday and I have had trouble deciding what to do. Some context...

So my best friend - let’s call him Jay- since high school has been married for about 2 years, and as far as I knew, his wife - let’s call her Marcy- is almost like family to me like he is. All this time, there were no warning signs that I noticed, and I could not ask for better friends. 

Yesterday, we all went shopping to hang out, buy presents, and what not. I’ve done this activity with them before, and nothing unusual ever happened until yesterday. After deciding to head back to their place to help set up this new workout machine, Jay had to go pick up his brother from work and this would take at least an hour or so because of the distance. Marcy said that me and her can go back to their house and start setting up the equipment, or whatever we can get done. We have done this before, like me and Jay would go back while Marcy does something, so it wasn’t a weird request either. We decide it’s a good idea and agree to meet up back at Jay’s house. 

So me and Marcy are at their house and I wait like usual. She calls me over upstairs and ask if I can help her bring down some water bottles from their room, so I head up. This is where it gets weird: as I’m taking the water bottles, Marcy begins rubbing my arm and asks if I need help. I tell her no, it’s cool, and next thing I know she is right up against me, looking me in the eyes with her shirt unbuttoned. She didn’t say anything, but her face got so close to mine I was just shocked. I admit, I did look at her chest, so maybe that wasn’t right, but I backed up and asked her what she was doing. Marcy said that it was obvious and said Jay won’t be home for some time, so he won’t find out. 

I honestly did not believe what was happening, so I told her that I was leaving and said this never happened. I didn’t give her a chance to talk, told her to tell Jay I went home, and left their place right away. 

I haven’t heard from either of them since yesterday, and I feel dirty for that happening to me. I’ve gone from deciding to tell my friend about what happened, to being scared because he is legit happy with his life. This might’ve been a long story and I apologize, but I feel like I can’t speak to anyone else I know about this because I don’t want it to leak out. I’ve been a lurker here and thought this was as good a place as any to find advice. ",15Dec2018,1

One of our qualifying exams requires the presentation of a case study.

I was on the committee for this particular exam, along with two other faculty.

I was the only man, and the only white person.

Possible microaggression 1: Mansplaining?

The student was struggling to articulate her rationale for one of her conclusions. It was an important one. So, I chimed in and said, ""Well, I think your rationale makes sense because of x, y, and z... ""

Put another way, I supported her rationale, and I added something to it, and I did that in the moment because I wanted to see her succeed, she seemed nervous about not having fully developed the rationale, and I wanted to help her in that tense moment.

Possible microaggression 2: was I being subtly racist?

The case study was of an interview with a research participant. I happened to have worked with this participant as well, for a very similar study.

The research participant, a female from Asia, seemed to engage with the student in a competitive and disapproving way. The research participant also spoke about wanting to date white men because they seem to her to be more organized and competent in the world.

I stated that I didn't experience the research participant as competitive with or disapproving of me, and wondered aloud if it had something to do with me being white, given her projections about white men.

But I said it in a strange way. I was asked to speak about my experience with the research participant. So, I said, ""Well, I'm white..."" everyone laughed. Then I added, ""And I didn't notice the theme of disapproval..."" and so on.

441,"In order to understand (somewhat) where I am going with this question, I will have to tell a short story. Bare with me. Unless you just want to read the question, then yeah...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!In College, there is a girl in my class that I found cute. Usually my attraction to these kinds of things are superficial with the mind set of her being just someone in class that's attractive and never bother to do anything about it, because... We got our selves introduced because Icebreaker exercise by prof. After that, we got a little bit acquainted and started to talk a little bit more day by day. I started to like her more and more, because I guess I found her really cute and stuff. One day, I saw her in the lobby sitting with a friend and I could not take my eyes or mind off of her. I didn't know why at the time. I mean, not to be rude or anything, she was not the ""hottest"" of any girls I've ever met. She was cute and I felt attracted to her, like I said, I don't know why. In the same week on a different day, we were sitting in the same lobby waiting for class and she was sitting on a table across from me. I was sitting alone and I kind of hoped she would sit beside me. But anyway, a guy in the same class sat beside her his name was ""Migs"". I felt super shitty. My blood rushed away from my head and heart and collapsed down with gravity. I have never felt this bad or sad in any situation involving a girl. During class I was trying to figure out why I felt that way and what that feeling was. I figured it was JEALOUSY . I have never felt so jealous in my life.!&lt;

&gt;!Anyway I really wanted to try and tell the story but its too long and I'll miss a lot of details. The short of it is, I feel like I'm ""in love"" with her. But she has a boyfriend, and it's not Migs (btw, fyi).!&lt;

&gt;!I felt kind of depressed and sad. One day on the way to school, I was listening to music in the bus and the song called ""You're Beautiful"" by James Blunt played. Most of the lyrics really hit me, almost made me cry in the bus. I got teary eyed because of that last lyric "" But it's time to face the truth, I will never be with you.""!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the question at hand, do you know any songs with similar style in lyrics and/or music like that ""You're Beautiful""?

I have already listened to some songs like that:

You're Beautiful - James Blunt

Jealous - Labrinth

Be Alright - Dean Lewis

Sweet Love of Mine - Joy Williams (somewhat)

Water Fountain - Alec Benjamin

I Can't Fall in Love Without You - Zara Larsson (for a line in lyrics)

&amp;#x200B;

Some of these songs I chose because there is a line or two in the lyrics that just hit me real hard and good. Others because of the depressing nature of the song. But all is about relationship and love or is related.

443,"I hate being depressed so much. I have been dealing with this since i was roughly 12, so i know the drill. After having the most horrific emotional experience in high school, it took me YEARS but i finally figured out how to handle my depression and anxiety. I am honestly very stable and i credit myself for that considering i was as emotional wreck as it gets during my teen years. 

I’m 20 now and i just finished up finals and i came home for the holidays. Usually i’m ecstatic when i come home because it’s nice to get away from the whole college scene. However, this time i wasn’t ready to go home. In fact i wanted to stay. 

I just became an official “thing” with this guy i have been trying to win over all semester (yay) and things were going amazing. Things still are going amazing, he’s just super busy with work and i haven’t seen him since Tuesday. I’m not upset or anything because i’m extremely understanding. I guess i just miss him. We planned to meet up this week and i’m excited because like i said, i miss spending time with him and i miss being around him. 

I think part of me wanted to stay because of him, but i’m not entirely sure. I love my friends there. I just didn’t want to leave at all.

Now, mind you i am a party girl. I love going out and drinking. I am always the one that’s completely down to go out, however like any other human being i have weekends where i’m just not feeling it and i stay in and watch movies. Tbh i love doing that more sometimes. 

When i got home last Tuesday i instantly went to bed. It was 9pm. I usually stay up past midnight but for whatever reason my body was tired. I ending up sleeping for 14 hours. The next few days i didn’t do anything at all considering i start work on Monday. But i continued to sleep for at least 10 hours everyday leading up to today. I have had absolutely no desire to do anything productive expect lay in bed. My body and my mind are exhausted and i haven’t had any desire to talk to anyone or see anyone. 

On Thursday my friend was texting about going out. My group consists of two other girls and they’ve been my friends since high school. It’s always been us three but considering they went to the same grammar school and i didn’t, they’re a lot closer to one another. They usually hangout one-on-one more, always go out together whether i’m there or not, leave without me. They also have this system where they split a bucket and Vegas bombs (for those who don’t know, these are just shots) and they never include me in them. This leads me to having to pay for all of that by myself. I’m used to it by now, but it hurts my feelings sometimes. 

So on Thursday Ashley (one of my friends) mentioned going out. I said i would happily go out with her, and instantly she asked “Colleen can you go?” (Colleen is my other friend in our trio). Colleen said she wouldn’t be home until super late and said she probably wouldn’t make it out. This led to Ashley being conflicted if she even wanted to go. She kept saying she would rather all of us go out... 

I told her it was fine then and we didn’t have to. She was more than okay with that. I ended up doing nothing that night and going to sleep early. Again, sleeping around 11 hours. 

I woke up the next morning on Friday and already they were talking about going out. I wasn’t feeling well to begin with so i didn’t answer the group message right away. Around 5 o’clock my stomach hurt really bad and i just wasn’t in the mood to go out at all. I told them i didn’t feel good and i probably wouldn’t go out. They didn’t answer, and this morning i saw they went out. 

Now i’m not pouting that they went out without me. I’m not going to hold them back because i didn’t want to go out. But it just bothers me that they were okay going out without me but when Colleen couldn’t, ashley didn’t want to at all. Idk. Maybe i’m just being unreasonable. 

I was supposed to go to a concert tonight to see one of my favorite bands, but i cancelled on my friend Dan saying something came up and i wouldn’t be able to make it. This is so weird of me because i love this band and i love going to concerts. I was so excited all week to see them and then i just cancel on my friend. The reasoning for it is because i’m too tired and not mentally prepared to see a band. Like my body and mind physically cannot be at a concert tonight. And i love concerts. 

Idk what’s wrong with me. I don’t understand. Part of me doesn’t even want to go out tonight either. I just want to lay in bed and watch tv. I have been super agitated too. I keep snapping at my family and telling them to “get out” when they come in my room to talk to me. I’m just overall emotionless. Every laugh and smile is fake. I just don’t get it. I think i’m becoming depressed but it’s never been like this before.

447,"My mom had a heart attack at 42 and was put in the ICU. I called off a day of work to watch my baby brother, and my co worker was trying to get me fired in the process of it. 

You see, my co worker doesn't like when people call off and is usually a tyrant when it happens. Usually, I've noticed that when I call off she has a bigger reaction to me than anyone else. She tries to talk bad about me and begs the supervisor to fire me. Another coworker(shit stirrer) Brad came up to me with the question ""why is Anne acting like that?"" And I yelled loudly that my mom was in the ICU and if they didn't like it they could shut the fuck up. My managers know that my mom is ill and that I might need a day dedicated to that. Anne purposely avoided me on the 15 minute break and didn't go until I finished my smoke. I see her walk in 15 minutes later with one of the managers by her side. Of course she snitched, probably about the ""points"" I have on my attendance to try to get me fired. 

So now here's my dilemma, Anne likes to say some racist things during smoke break when we used to go together. It's been bothering me to snitch about it pretty much up until now. Should I go in right away Monday and make a report, or should I wait until they try to get me on my attendance and bring up the situation in its entirety?

I graduated from a Canadian college with an Advanced diploma in Business Administration last year and struggled to find a decent job so i volunteered at non-profits for a little bit, fast forward 7-8 months my elderly father who lives back in Africa had a bad fall and I flew out to help him with his business and take care of him till he recovers which he has mostly done since I've been here for 3 months now.

This has given me some time to think about whats next, and the way I see it I can either go back to school and upgrade to university or try to find work.

The only problem is I'm already 23 and was in a very unhealthy lifestyle (smoking weed everyday and not studying/games) while i was completing my diploma, and finished with disgraceful 64% GPA and need a 70% GPA to get into the program i have my eyes on. I truly feel that if I had another chance I'd take it more seriously since I've quit all my bad habits and matured.

If if do get accepted into the program (Business Management) I will be entering into the 3rd year and complete my degree in 2 years, so I'd be 25 when i graduate which I know is really late.

Should I bother going back to college to retake a few classes to increase my gpa 6% and peruse a bachelor degree? or accept it for what it is and keep trying to find a job.",15Dec2018,1

452,"I’m 21m and am in a pretty happy relationship. I love the girl I’m with as much as I’ve ever loved someone and she’s my best friend. She’s attractive to me so that’s not an issue. But I’m young and I haven’t been with many people and if I’m being honest I feel like everybody has a right to explore. 

Neither of us are religious or marriage people and we’re pretty open with pretty much every subject. We’ve discussed threesomes etc but even though she’s into the idea I feel like maybe she wouldn’t be into it once there’s another girl having sexual relations with her boyfriend in front of her. We’ve been together and lived together for over 2 years and even though we have arguments I haven’t really had much doubt in the relationship and I’d say I’m mostly happy but I do want to have sex with other people. 

I don’t really believe in monogamy and I don’t think she does either I just think jealousy would play a factor. I would love to find some way that could work for both of us as I’m not a hypocrite who would try prevent her from doing the same. I would just like there to be a “us” before anybody else mentality as we would still be a couple. Safety and communication would also be important.

456,"The past couple days my Grandma hasn't been treated well at the care facility she's at. 

* They've yelled at her and one nurse has thrown some of her pain medication in the garbage. 

* They also are not properly administering it on schedule as the doctor has ordered. They are streaching it out and she is clearly in a lot of pain to the point of calling us late at night crying.

* They have ignored her needs to go to the bathroom for over an hour at times as they chat with each other. My Grandma has a bladder infection and is allergic to the anti-biotics used to treat those, making matters even worse.

This is all after a very major back surgury that had some complications. It's the only place nearby that accepts her insurance so moving her isn't a real option. 

My family has spoken to everyone we can think of at the facility and we have absolutely no faith in some kind of an internal process solving this as other patients and families have come forward to my dad while he was there.

I live in Connecticut. After doing some research I've found out that in person conversations only require the consent of 1 party to record (phone conversations require all parties to be informed). I'm buying a digital recorder that will go into her jacket pocket so I can have solid evidence to bring forward to anyone I can show it to.

457,"I’m 18 and a freshman in college. I found out I was conceived through IVF (donor eggs) about a month ago, and I took an ancestry test to see my heritage and find any potential family. With help from a second cousin that I matched with, I just found my biological mom.  

She lives only an hour from where I grew up, she went to college in the same city as me. She was a nurse at the hospital where I was conceived. I was really excited to know who she was, I was imagining meeting her and stuff. 

Now I found her Facebook, and turns out she has ELEVEN biological kids with her first husband (some are older than me, some younger). I also matched with a half brother on ancestry, I think there are probably more half siblings from egg donation out there. Furthermore, my bio mom has been in prison numerous times (mainly for alcohol charges) and I found some articles about her getting lost while drunk and police using dogs to track her down. 

So now I’m torn on what to do. The half siblings are really overwhelming, and my mom doesn’t sound like a great person (do I even want to meet her?). I don’t think I would form a relationship with them so should I even bother reaching out? It’s all I can think about though, 

I’m not sure what to do. I have a twin brother (full siblings with me) and he doesn’t seem very interested in all this, but it’s driving me crazy. My parents refuse to talk about it.

She did mention that we should hang out again but like then why hasn’t she said anything. I was thinking of just waiting until tomorrow to ask her to hangout again and depending on that I’ll just kind of make up my mind about her.

475,"I'm working two part time jobs right now. Started full time at company A, moved on to get a part time job with company B and changed to part time with company A. Job with company A is temporary now until they can fill the full time position. 

I just got an interview for company C, which is next week, and if I got the job it would replace company A job. However, I also applied to a new position with company A that is 4 days a week. I'll likely hear back about that next week at some point. 

I'm wondering which job I should take if I were offered both. Company A is local, company B is a 42 minute drive by highway, company C is a bit over an hour drive by highway. So my options are:

1. Have two part time jobs equating to full time hours, earning a potential estimated 63k before taxes, but spend roughly 10 hours driving every week with greater gas bills
2. Take the 0.8 fte with company A and make possibly 9k less than the other option (I don't know the exact hourly figure but my manager told me in previous conversations that the rate for this position matches that of the rate paid with company C) but cut my commute in half and my gas bill by at least half every month

I can't move closer to the part time jobs as they are in opposite directions of each other, I like both companies A and B, company C is hard to get into if external. I'm currently living with my parents with plans of moving out next year at some point with my boyfriend so I don't currently have too many bills to worry about. 

**Tl;dr** is a possibly 9k increase in salary worth a 10 hour weekly commute vs taking a job that's less pay with a company I already work for and with half the commute time?

478,"My mother has been on a diet pill for the last year or so. She is a nurse and so is my mother’s friend, who when I cried about my abusive mother to suggested my mom may be on some drug. 

I was with my husband for six months overseas and have come back with our newborn to sort out my Visa. I must stay with my parents. When I returned I realized how manic she sounded. My mother absolutely can NOT stop talking when she knows there are ears around. When asked if she’s taking drugs, she laughed it off. Said she’s always hyper. 

After some digging, came to find out she’s been on this diet pill for at least a year. Her symptoms seem like those of stimulants (restlessness, light/little sleep, continuous talking, taking on several projects at once, agitation, easily irritated, small appetite) 

My father and I live like abused people. We are constantly walking on eggshells. Avoiding going out/seeing people, memorizing every complaint of hers to see that we don’t make the same mistake, sometimes going to some really outrageous ends to keep her on a low simmer rather than full steaming boil. 

I’ve only been home three weeks and I’m quickly reaching my breaking point. She wants to obsess over my daughter until she’s angry, then she’s practically throwing her at me. I don’t dare keep my baby from her for fear of the screaming and hostile environment my household will surely turn into (as it usually is but not now because baby is here). 

I’m emotionally exhausted and praying time to pass quickly. How the fuck do I get her off this shit? Do I just keep my head down and my mouth shut?

Me and my other friend were a bit concerned and questioned that, to which the friend who said it tried to play it off as a joke. This has worried me (it has happened multiple times) but I’ve never mentioned it to anyone else. 

Today, we were talking about liking older men (jokingly) and the friend who I am concerned for started to debate why you can’t date younger children. This concerned me and one of the things that stuck out to me was that she said people break other laws, after we had told her that dating minors is illegal. She gave up eventually but she never said she was wrong.

My main issue is that I have OCD and one of the things my brain likes to latch onto is that I have an intense fear of being a paedo, being accused of it, or being around someone who is a paedo. This started when one of my teachers, whom I had trusted greatly, was exposed as a paedophile. This greatly disturbed me and ever since then I have worried excessively about it since you could never know who is like that and who isn’t. I go to great lengths to avoid children and to avoid the topic as a whole. 

Her joking about it and suggesting that she may be like that is honestly so triggering. 

What really got me is that one of my other friends DMed me (right after we had debated about it being illegal with the friend who I am concerned for). They raised similar concerns and told me that this friend had also said similar things to them about attraction. This friend is also worried. I am scared that they have validated some sort of intrusion and that these thoughts about my friend are terrible and that I shouldn’t doubt them, but my brain is still going ‘what if’?

481,"Hey, so there's this girl at my school I really like as the usual story goes....

Now the pickle begins in the 1st year, when I asked her out, and fucked up lotta things... Long story short, my posture,

non verbal communication, even verbal communication and overall the approach in the conversation was rather

''incorrect''.. I've made a bad impression on the girl overall I guess.. Not to mention I was quite annoying on messenger.. Anyway I didn't really get dumped, she just refused to go outside the next time cuz she said she had smth to do, there I decided not to text her anymore..

&amp;#x200B;

Well, now 3 years later in the 4th final grade I found out she's single.. In the meantime she had 3 boyfriends, the last relationship was rather long-term (1 year) and it ended up with them splitting up, cause apparently the guy said he had no time for her... Well, so I've approached her and did just a lil small talk, like how she's doing and tht I haven't seen her for a long time... At the end of the convo I asked her if it'd be okay if we went ouside, and I'd ''interrogate'' her (used the word for fun), she said alright... So the next day I text her, but she doesn't respond cuz she's far away and busy, in the evening she replies I was gone sry blah blah.. I said it's ok, we can go some other time.. Anyway, as I remembered from my last 1st grade 1st try I sucked pretty much on-chat, so I've approached her at school and made a bit of small talk, with my overall approach (verbal and non-verbal convo) leaving quite a nice impact, since after the 3 years I got some experience and knowledge if it comes to this stuff and could see the flaws I made in the 1st grade... Anyway, I asked her out again, said I'd text her next week, she agreed. Now I got a lil bug in my head.. My question is, should I kiss her at the first ''date'', or meeting or whatever should I call it? I mean I'd talk with her a lot, and my plan is to ask her a deep question like : what do you want to do before you die? .... She'd answer, and then she'd ask me : What about you? and I would ask : Do you really want to know? She : Yes! Me : \*Kissess her\* ...

My friend is depressed, suicidal, somewhat anorexic, and I suspect he has insomnia. We’ve been friends online for over a year and we live about 1,000 miles apart, him in Texas and me in New York. He is 19 and I am 16, so we can’t really do much to see eachother...

483,"**Before I post this, I’m not sure whether this belongs in r/FriendshipAdvice or here but I’ll post it here since it’s more active haha**

Hey, just to warn you all, this is going to be a fairly long post, hope nobody minds!

Hi, my names Grace, not really sure where I should start with this haha. Anyway, I’m a 14 year old girl from England. I go to an all-girls grammar school and after taking the MBTI test got the ESFP personality type. I’m a fairly outgoing girl who easily makes friends, most people enjoy my humor/say I’m kind. 

So, now there’s some background information, why am I on here? To be fair, I didn’t know anywhere else to go about this so this sub is my best choice, I’m sorry if this is going to be long but please listen to what I have to say!

To cut to the chase, I’m really lonely. Like, I have loads of friends and would even call myself popular but no close friends except for one. I’ll talk to them all during the day but when school’s over the most we’ll do is send a snapchat message/photo to each other or like each other’s posts on Instagram, I’m not in any groupchats or anything.

This is just the start of my loneliness though. About half a year ago I started to think about my friends from primary school a lot more. I was really close with them all (they were all boys) and we used to ride our bikes around our local park and play Xbox when we all got home. However, when we went our separate ways we just kinda stopped talking.

They’re on my mind a lot. Whenever I’m lying in bed at night, I’ll think about all the good times we had together and how much I miss them. A lot of the time I’ll end up crying myself to sleep thinking about them, I can’t get them off my mind, I miss my old friends so much.

Along with that there’s the fact that I want to go out with my friends and get closer with them but I’m actually kind of scared about them saying no. Most people wouldn’t really like to go shopping with basically the class clown, would they?

Earlier on I mentioned my one close friend, but she belongs to a crowd that I don’t want to get involved with. I love her as a friend and am really grateful for her, but we’re only 14 and she’s done some... pretty adult things. I love parties, don’t get me wrong, but I wouldn’t really like to go to one where much older teenagers are blazing it and getting drunk out of their mind, y’know?

I’ve said most of what I wanted to say now. I have a happy family and two siblings at least, and have no physical/mental illnesses which is good. I’m just a normal school girl who wants to fit in, and I really hope my less-than-serious tomboy personality doesn’t change that.

Hey, this might come up as a question but the reason why I can’t tell anybody about this is because, this is kind of embarrassing, but I lied about having friends outside of school. When people asked me who I hang out with outside of school, I said the names of my old friends from primary school, and that’s why I can’t tell anyone. If they find out they’ll lose trust in me and the thought just scares me, and if I told the truth they’d probably think I’m a loner or something.

I’m really stuck as for what to do now haha, I know that I could easily message my old primary school friends on Instagram and we could go back to each other but it would be pretty weird if one of your old best friends started messaging you after such a long time, huh?

And as for my new friends, I want to get closer to everyone but it’s been two years at my school. If I get closer now they might think I’m trying to barge into their friendship group. 

It’s not like me to worry so much, I’m usually quite confident but I don’t want to look back on what’s meant to be some of the best years of my life and see myself alone and crying myself to sleep most nights. Coming home and playing video games all night gets boring after a few years too..

Anyway, that’s all I have to say. Thanks for reading so far, by the way! If you could help me out I’d really appreciate it :)

**TL,DR:** I have quite a lot of friends but not many close ones and feel very lonely, what should I do?",15Dec2018,1
484,"There were posters up for this lost dog, an aussie or something, really beautiful dog. The posters asked to call their number if she was found.

I was walking my dog in the park nearby and she kept on pulling towards something in the ravine. When I got closed I realized it was a mutilated dog, probably a long time dead. It was really painful to see actually, I'm not going to lie i'm in shock and i'm devastated. I don't know if was coyotes, if someone hit her with a car and dumped her somewhere, if she got lost and starved to death and was then picked on by scavengers .. I don't know. I'm not alright.

It was definitely the same dog, same build and from what I could see, fur colour and size. 

Do I call them and let them know? Do I just leave it? Please help. Also how do I make sure this doesn't fully traumatize me? I love dogs and it was disturbing to see her lying there. God what she must have been through. ",15Dec2018,1
485,"Ok. I really don’t want to say this wrong. My friends are 17; I am 16. We were talking about preference and she mentioned younger boys. Me and my other friend were a bit concerned and questioned that, to which the friend who said it tried to play it off as a joke. This has worried me (it has happened multiple times) but I’ve never mentioned it to anyone else. 

Today, we were talking about liking older men (jokingly) and the friend who I am concerned for started to debate why you can’t date younger children. This concerned me and one of the things that stuck out to me was that she said people break other laws, after we had told her that dating minors is illegal. She gave up eventually but she never said she was wrong.

My main issue is that I have OCD and one of the things my brain likes to latch onto is that I have an intense fear of being a paedo, being accused of it, or being around someone who is a paedo. This started when one of my teachers, whom I had trusted greatly, was exposed as a paedophile. This greatly disturbed me and ever since then I have worried excessively about it since you could never know who is like that and who isn’t. I go to great lengths to avoid children and to avoid the topic as a whole. 

Her joking about it and suggesting that she may be like that is honestly so triggering. 

What really got me is that one of my other friends DMed me (right after we had debated about it being illegal with the friend who I am concerned for). They raised similar concerns and told me that this friend had also said similar things to them about attraction. This friend is also worried. I am scared that they have validated some sort of intrusion and that these thoughts about my friend are terrible and that I shouldn’t doubt them, but my brain is still going ‘what if’? 

Please, can anyone give their thoughts, or advice on how I should proceed ?",15Dec2018,1
486,"I have been thinking for a long time what to do with this laptop that had cost around 1200.00 to buy. My counselor said it could help my life getting a laptop and playing online games. I did so and found out that I do not really enjoy the computer games and I did not need to buy such a high power computer for what I do with the computer. I RARELY use it. 

I can't return it. I don't need this much power. It's an HP Omen. I don't even exactly like the interface usage. ( if that makes sense. )

I thought about cutting my loses and selling it for around 800 dollars?? And getting a cheap 200 laptop or just go to the library if I need a computer. I actually own another laptop that I gave to my brother. It is a cheap old toshiba but it is still a very good laptop.  I also wanted to buy a ps4 so I could play the new Red Dead Redemption game and my old favorite games like Spyro the dragon.

Should I cut my loses and sell this laptop that I don't need and lose over $400 dollars because I didn't need this much power? Should I keep it for the hell of it and just save up for the ps4? I still even want a simpler laptop even though I have this one. I just can't possibly use it how it was made to be used. I don't like the interface is another huge thing..

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on the fence about selling it for $800 bucks or just keeping the good laptop and learning to work with it. 

Any advice would be helpful. I would hate to lose that money just because I don't like this laptop, even though it's a great laptop for other people, it's not for me..",15Dec2018,1

488,"I'm so sorry if this doesn't belong here also I'm on mobile.

My ex had a little crash yesterday in work, so he was off today.
He went out with his friends and called me drunk.
He was telling me how sorry he was for everything, how he misses me, calling me his gorgeous nugget and baby girl.
He says we can't be together right now because we don't parent well together.
Which is absolute bull as our child is healthy and happy always, she always comes first.
He's also asked me not to go on any dates, essentially asking me not to move on.
He loves our daughter more than anything.
But why would he call me drunk saying all this?
How do I deal with it?
Is he just trying to hurt me?
I'm sorry I just really need some advice as we have a child together and I need to deal with it the best way possible.
We've only been apart for two weeks.",15Dec2018,1
489,"My buddy is 17 almost 18 and I'm 16 going on 17, over the past couple years we've gotten into modding cars and racing mountain bikes. In order to fund the expensive hobbys we partake in I work almost everyday for 8 hours or more (banquet server). My friend on the other hand worked for a week and got fired. ever since has had everything given to him by his mother. He is failing all of his classes and is guaranteed to fail highschool. I work my ass off to afford what he gets handed to him. How can I handle this without losing my marbles due to envy. (I know the solution could be stop buying shit I Don't need) but I truly love what I do.",15Dec2018,1
491,"21M, I'm a FedEx delivery man at the moment, I make about $2000 take home monthly. I aspire someday to have a 3 bed 2 bath house on 10 acres of land a shop and a motocross track, here in Montana or Wyoming . I look around at all of the places I deliver to and I honestly wonder how people afford the things they do?? How do you do It? I have an insane work ethic, i work 80+ hours a week for basically $6/hr. I've worked oilfield, retail, mechanic, alllll sorts of jobs. None of which have every really amounted to very much money..I know that my work ethic, enthusiasm and willingness can take me many places but how the hell am I going to accomplish my dreams making this shit wage?????  I've never made more than $32,000 yearly, and I've had 4 jobs since I've been out of HS all of which were for about a year,  I can hardly afford anything after paying necessities which add up to about $1600 a month. Then the rest goes to gas and food. I'm wondering how the hell I can break this cycle and be able to provide for my soon to be wife and I (granted she will be a teacher in 2 more years). I want and need very few things but it's a struggle to provide them at the moment. I want to be comfortable, I've tried and tried and tried to look for jobs that pay more, but they want people with experience. How the hell are you supposed to get that experience if no one will hire someone with no experience...anyway rant over. But anyone in here make a comfortable living and want to shed some light? Thanks
