4,"I posted a month ago about my newborn son's social security card being stolen from our mailbox. Please don't ask questions about this, they are all answered in that post. 

I sent in all the required documents to the three credit bureaus to try to obtain his credit report (if one had been created due to fraud). I also asked that in the case that one had not been created, that they create one for him and then place a freeze on it. Two weeks after sending in these documents they mailed me letters back requesting more documents. I had to also resend all the documents I already sent. 

Now it has been 4 weeks since this incident happened and I still have no information as to whether his social security number has been used. They wouldn't give me any information in the letters they sent as they wanted more documents. I am preparing myself for the possibility that the letters they send me next time will once again say that I have sent the incorrect documents. I don't want to do this again as I feel that every minute that his SSN is in the wrong hands is another minute that someone is committing fraud with it. 

In the case that I get more letters back requesting more documents, I feel that I need to have a professional take over. I don't know who this would be, but maybe a lawyer? What kind of lawyer would I use to request this information? Am I correct that an identity theft lawyer would not be suitable as I do not even know if there has been any yet?

Thank you!",24Mar2018,1
5,"Hello, reddit. Please, I need a piece of advice cause seems like I cannot come up with something good by myself.
A dear friend of mine (F 22 years old), goes on a trip to Italy for a couple weeks, so I want to give her something small, maybe useful, something she could take from time to time and think of me.
I'll be glad to hear any ideas. Thanks!

9,"Hi y'all!

My lack of motivation and sense of loss are caused by numerous stresses, but it's affecting my capabilities as a student. I am a Biology major, more like a sophomore than a junior. I spent my sophomore year studying abroad, and those electives would only go towards a minor in Japanese. I understand that I made the choice to not focus on my major by deciding to study abroad. Anyways, I recently applied to various REU programs for Biology, and have been getting rejected one by one. I sat down with a mentor who suggested to go back to my old interests, aka ""the earth"". One of the many things that makes me extremely fulfilled is being surrounded by nature, and it angers me to see our planet suffering. I am also interested in marine biology and ecology, but... the classes I'm taking so far are mainly general major requirements, such as Chemistry and Calculus. I really don't care much for the material. I picked Biology because it's more broad than Environmental Science (my original choice), but I'm just feeling bleh about school in general.

This may be a negative perspective, but I've been realizing how fucked up the college system can be. I'm gonna have to spend an extra year to complete all of my requirements for Biology, despite having 103~ credits already. Of course I took a year off for study abroad, and I completed most of my general ed requirements but the thought of spending an extra year and then being shipped off to graduate school irks me. I'm just not content with accepting the fact that I'm not 100% positive if I would want to do a career related to something I may end up hating... They say it's normal to not know what you're doing in college, but I don't want to waste anymore time.

I also commute 1.5-2 hours by train to school 4x a week, and my schedule is fucked up this semester (early morning classes with night classes). The main reason why I do this is because I am part of the honors program and 2/3rds of my tuition is covered by the school. My parents are already in a tight spot regarding finances, so transferring to a closer school and losing my scholarship will place a strain on them. I also love some of the communities I'm part of over there. It's impossible for me to move over there, unless I became a RA at the dorm (which only holds a number of 19 students). According to a friend, however, the cycling of shifts between RAs may interfere with jobs and other obligations. I don't particularly like this. Living at home is tough though, especially with family issues...

My options include: keep applying to programs/internships for the summer, determine if I should change my major or stick with it, transfer, or drop out. I may meet up with a career counselor. I mentioned all of this to my honors director before.

P.S. Hobbies that I want to continue working on or pursue: making art, exercising, learning a musical instrument, guitar. I am interested in pursuing other careers or gaining different experience in different fields...

10,"So I made a big mistake. Last night I had unprotected sex after drinking heavily. I wasn't too worried until I talked to a friend and found out she refuses to use the pill because she doesn't like the side effects? So I messaged her and asked if she would take the morning after pill, and she said no.

I know it's the night after and all, but is there a male equivalent I can take which would lower the odds of pregnancy? I'm a little desperate here. Should I just take a regular morning after pill and hope for the best? I'm a little freaked out.",24Mar2018,0

13,"Ok so the job I left last week (previous posts detail the situation) I made a couple of friends.  One in my office, one downstairs and one in the maintenance department. The maintenance guy turned in his notice and was fired for supposedly texting the boss and calling him a ""Stupid MF""... The office gossip, ""Bek"" started a rumor that he probably beat his wife if he was angry like that. My friend ""Al"" fell right in line and I said I'd never seen him angry so I had a hard time believing it.
Al and I had been tight.  She complained to me about Bek and I to her.  We both had been at the pointy end of Beks rage and needed a place to vent. (The boss dismissed our complaints). She and I so dealt with infertility. She talked to me alot about it since I'd already been there.
Al went on vacation a couple days before my last day and I friended her on FB and we talked about us getting together with our hubby's to hang out after I started my new job. 
I logged on to see how her vacation went, and she'd unfriended me.
I'd been concerned just before I left that some of what I'd talked to her about had been repeated, but I figured Bek was very obnoxious when asking for info and she probably weaseled it out of her. 
Now I'm thinking I had been had. It is totally irrelevant now, and I'm a grown woman, but my feelings are hurt that it would seem she wasn't my friend after all, or (also likely) Bek started some rumor like she does with everyone she hates who leaves.  Not a big deal except my dad still does business in that town and because of Bek everyone knew I was quitting before the end of the first day after my notice. People not even in our company mentioned it.  The damn job was posted two days later, but we'd already had resumes brought in.
I'm glad to be out of that hornets nest. But I still feel betrayed and I already have trust issues. 
I love my new job already. I'm pleased with it and hope it continues to be great.  
I guess I shouldn't give two hoots about what the office gossip Bek thinks, but I feel so betrayed by Al. I really thought we were friends. 
THAT bugs me. 
Any thoughts?

15,"So I am 14 and will be turning 15 this July I am 5 foot 7 inches 120lbs i am also pretty fast and am thinking about playing football I just don’t know what position to play the positions I am considering are Safety,cornerback,wide receiver, running back, and quarter back. Ok to start my hands are decent but won’t amaze anyone so I am not 100% sure on wide receiver and if I were to play quarterback I would be an option qb because I have an ok arm but I would trust my legs more than my arm.  The two positions I am favoring are safety and running back. As a safety I could sit back take in what’s going on and react to make the play but as a corner I have to cover someone the whole time and also be aware of what else is going on which I think my lack of experience will hurt me there. For running back I could be quick but I don’t necessarily know if I could take all the hits and be able to hold on to the ball but I’m not to sure but I think running back could be interesting. Also any tips for getting better for football and any pointers that could improve my chance of making the team would help a lot .

22,"So basically I don't see my GF as much as I would like to. She's my first girlfriend so I don't really know what it means to be in a relationship. I met her last  August in my community college's anime club, and we've been dating since November. She's 23 and I'm 21.

Early on in our relationship I saw her quite a bit because of school. I saw her twice a week inbetween our classes, in addition to that I also saw her at the weekly anime club meeting. So I saw her quite often. I didn't her much outside of school but I wasn't really paying attention. Truthfully the first couple months in the relationship I was just esctatic a girl was going out with me. Quite frankly I used to get really down on myself because I used to genuinely believe I would never get a girl my entire life, much less get married which is something I want to do in life. So early on I was high on the fact I was in a relationship.

I have a great time with this girl every time I see her. I have no doubts about her except how distant she is. We started dating in school, but I don't go to school anymore due to financial issues at the time. So since then, I see her about twice a month. I don't really feel like I'm in a relationship really. I don't know what to expect, but since I don't see her in school anymore, it doesn't feel I have a girlfriend. Feels like I have a friend that we agree to go on a date every here and there. 

When I don't see her for awhile, I start thinking about breaking up with her. However, she always manages to come out of the woodwork before I get to a point where I'm going to actually break up with her. Then after I see her, I have a great time and all thoughts of breaking up are done for. I cycle between two thoughts.

The first thought is that I'm expecting too much from her. She's a college student so she's busy, and I'm well aware that her parents are strict as hell. So maybe I'm expecting way to much from her. I do geniunely like her and enjoy her company when it's there.

The second thought is that I need to break up with her and find someone that has an equal passion for me as I do for her. When my friends are dating someone, they seem to be together 24/7, I know I shouldn't base my relationship off of my friends', but I feel like twice a month is a little rediculous.

Me and her do talk inbetween seeing her. We seem to have a decent coversation about every other day or so through messaging. I have brought up this issue to her about a month ago. I asked her if she even wants to be in a relationship with me and she said yes. I told her that not seeing as much as I would like makes me feel unwanted then she said sorry and said she would be less distant. But a month later nothing's changed.

What should I do? Am I demanding too much or do I need to go?",24Mar2018,1
23,"I have got myself into a situation. Usually on the month of my birthday my life will hit a wall. I don’t really want to get into it too much but just recently it’s taken a turn.

Recently I’ve I’ve been counting every penny just to make sure I’m an adult and don’t mess up. About when I was at the peek of my stress, I got off work early and started my usual two hour drive home. While on the drive I had a headache but was fine, and I was singing along to music. About a mile away from my house I remember sing and the waking up to my car telling me that I have just been in and accidents. My car had ended up in the river. Me being in shock, I climb out of my car and see that it’s only in a couple inches of water, so I start walking home. I get to my house and call my father and tell him what happened.

29,"Hello. I just made this account because I don't know where else to go right now, and I don't really know where to start this, but I'm going to give it a go.

I have a friend who I've known since middle school, and we're now seniors in high school, about to go to off to college. We've been very close, and have been through a lot together. I care about him deeply, but I've seen him go down a dark path that I don't know how to get him off of.

I noticed depressive behaviors early on, but was too young to understand it. He seemed to be a bit disillusioned with his life in general. I know he's had loads of problems at home with his family, and has been in near constant trouble in every school he's been to, with the police having to get involved on a few occasions. He had told me early on that he really had no sense of direction or belonging, but, at that point, who did? I didn't think anything of it. I feel so bad now for not doing anything then.

He always had somewhat radical views. He had a brief stint as a communist, but quickly gave that up. This was before we met though, and he didn't tell me about that until later on. He had also been quite violent, which had been the main cause of the trouble he would get into.

I don't mean to paint him in such a negative light, because I know there's good in him. He cares so deeply about the people in his life, and I think that care is what caused his turn, but, I'm not a psychologist.

He's been doing better, he gave up his violent tendencies, but now that pent up anger seems to come out in his words. Absolutely vicious rants, and the way he tears into people who anger him, it's very scary, especially since in every other situation he is sweet and docile. Maybe that's hard to believe, and I know I'm probably doing an awful job at articulating what I'm trying to say here, and I'm sorry for that.

As far as I can see, he is a full blown fascist now. But he no longer calls himself one. From what he tells me, he had a pretty explosive falling out with some fascist organization, God knows which one, and now he's going his own way, and it's driving him insane. He has a website where he types out all of his ravings, which he runs entirely on his own. He always goes on to me about how he has no allies and how everything is working against him. He looks at the world and sees some kind of long game conspiracy to destroy society or something that he happened to get caught in the crossfire of, and he sees himself as the only one who knows what's going on, and the only one who can fix it.

I think that, internally, he sees what he's doing as an effort to protect the people he cares about. I don't want to get into details, because I feel pretty uncomfortable about putting out people's stories in public, even if I don't say names, but I'll give one example. There's someone who he met, who he now obsesses over. He says that this person had his life ruined when his school administrators stigmatized him for his mental illness, treating him like a criminal over fear of him doing something drastic. His parents ended up winning a lawsuit against the school, but he had lost his passion, and now lives in poverty, with no job, and no educational aspirations. Now, my friend takes this story, and what he sees is a leftist conspiracy in the educational system to oppress ""young white boys"". And he does this for EVERYTHING. Every single thing that goes wrong in people's lives is part of some nonsense conspiracy, he somehow manages to connect everything together, and it's just insane.

I just don't know what to do about this. Another one of the things that I fear is that the thing that drove him to this point was some kind of traumatic heartbreak, but, I can't verify this, so I won't go into detail. I only have what I know about the situation, which is very little, because immediately after it happened he secluded himself for a very long time. When he came back, he had changed, and it just got worse from there. He had clung on the the Trump campaign, and from there he met some alt-right people, and it just spiraled out of control very quickly. (I'm not trying to equate liking Trump to fascism, please don't think that's what I'm doing, I'm just saying it because I think it's worth mentioning this behavioral impulse where he just found something to identify with and started obsessing over it. In fact, he hates Trump now.)

So, yeah, I could keep going but, this post is long enough as is. I probably could've done a much better job of keeping things concise and explaining things better, but it was a spontaneous decision to come and post this here, and I don't usually make posts like this. So, if anyone has any ideas, please share them. I haven't confronted him about this yet, and I'm one of the few people who he trusts, so I have to make the most of that. Thank you.",24Mar2018,1

42,"So someone I had met a few months back seems to have lost interest in having any sort of meaningful conversation and has become distant. I feel like i'm the only one to initiate a conversation now. They take a long time to reply back (18+hrs sometimes) often their replies are curt or they just drop out of the conversation and stop replying. Anytime I try to take an interest in their current activity they don't respond at all, or the response is one worded. Three times I've made suggestions to meet up and each time it's been met with a ""no"" or a change in topic. I've taken the hint that they're no longer interested in talking anymore, or hanging out which as much as it sucks that's a choice they're allowed to make and I can't force them to talk to me.

So I haven't spoken to them since they left me on read 3 days ago. They've sent me messages today on two different platforms, nothing that seems particularly substantive. Am I being petty if I start taking a ""tit for tat"" apporch to this?

So I recently moved into a new apartment. I came from a neighborhood that wasn’t very good so very excited about the change. During the process I dropped my application off to the building manager instead of the landlord because she was busy. The manager seemed nice enough, and mentioned we would be neighbors if I got the place. The first weekend was great. I really needed to find a quieter neighborhood and I really thought I had. Over the next week I noticed some things about my neighbors. Now a little about the complex. I share a stair case with two other apartments. If you were to make a right when leaving my apartment, you would be at the door of the building manager. So over the next week I noticed that they pretty much always have their door open. No big deal, if they weren’t constantly yelling. They have two kids and on a daily basis I hear them yelling. If the door was closed, it wouldn’t be such a big deal. The second weekend is when I finally confronted them. They had family over and one of the kids left his bike immediately in front of my door so I couldn’t open it without dragging the bike. I got the attention of the building manager and told her of my issues. I left the complex and didn’t get back home until about 9. When I go to walk up the stairs, her husband must have been waiting for me because he opened his door and stopped me so we could talk. Now he’s an intimidating dude, but we had a civil talk. I told him that I thought a lot of the issues would be resolved if they would just shut their door. I even apologized for confronting his wife during their party. Things got better for a few days, but then went back to normal. Theres been one night where I stepped out of my apartment and asked if I could shut their door because I couldn’t focus on the movie I was watching. He agreed, but didn’t look happy. 

So here’s where I need advise. How do I go about addressing this? Is my landlord really going to listen to this if it has to do with the building manager? Should I just let it go? I should make it clear that everything else about the apartment is great. I have a few videos of their noise so I am documenting this.

The place : Nearby a school , close to the city center , on a highly populated street. Suitable for 20-25 computers and 5-7 consoles. 

Including the reconstrucion of this place and also adding the equipment cost, it would easily hit 40k€ of investment.

The change in careers is because my roommate left me high and dry on bills to live with his new found girlfriend and after calculating how to survive I would not make anything to put back really by myself. One morning, a friend called me who works for a contacting company and asked if I was needed something that paid more (almost an extra paycheck every pay period), I said yes and now I have the position after I put in my two weeks. After speaking to the hiring manager for the new business she said she wants to hire me because of my resume and will give me an extra two weeks if needed because of my position at my current job. The only issue is my current boss doesn't take people leaving well. I went to part time once years ago and he violently exploded at me, while throwing objects around me. I'm afraid in this position, especially now that I'm higher up the same situation will arise but worse; does anyone know of any legal action I should take if it gets out of hand? He's very smart the physical violence he shows is around me and not towards me, which a lot of Human Resources tend to look over when it comes down to the actual act.

49,"This might be a bit long but bear with me. Just want to make sure I share as much details of this unique situation as possible so there's no confusion.


So I've always had bad luck with relationships in the past so at a certain point I said screw it and became extremely against them. I would only pursue FWB and if something would arise from that fine but in my mind it was highly unlikely so I always projected my disinterest of relationships. I enjoyed this lifestyle for about 8 years no problems at all until the past year or two when I started noticing all friends and people I talk to are all in relationships/having kids and are super busy in their own lives which is leading to me being more and more lonely over the years because no one has time for a single person. I get that so I don't blame them.


Just over a year ago I met this girl(let's call her sally) on tinder and originally just agreed to be FWB because she just got out of a relationship and didn't want to get back in one since she was busy with school/work. About a few months in she decided she wanted to try having a relationship again and start seeing some guy she met which I was supportive and alright with because I knew I wasn't even close to interested in a relationship at the time. Gave her advice all the way through a month of them seeing each other which resulted in me shining light on how he was being sketchy and turns out he was already in a relationship but over in the states.. (I'm from Canada btw)


Me being the nice guy I am always willing to help someone in need, I continued to give her advice and be her crying shoulder/person to talk about issues to. Which she claims helped a lot and was done with relationships for a while. So eventually things went back to normal. If anything started to seem like she was more committed to our situation or even possibly started to like me even more than that. So that continued for a good 8 or more months of stuff going really good, hanging out multiple times a week, some weeks it was every day and actually became really close, sharing/talking about stuff I normally wouldn't tell others. She was always nice, supportive and non judgemental which I always really needed.


For the past 2 months she's been really busy with school so I was supportive and let her know school came first so I wasn't worried. Well 2 weeks ago when we finally hung out she mentioned that an old friend started talking to her, telling her how he always liked her and put a bunch of effort in to show it and wanted to know if he could have a chance with her. Sally being the sweet/caring person she is, made the decision to start seeing him to see if things would even work but also stated he is a very nice/sweet guy. She told me it was a really difficult choice because she was really happy and enjoying what we had going but she also wanted to give this guy a chance because she wants to think of her future of having an actual relationship.


This time around I really wasn't that supportive. Kinda shrugged it off and felt abandoned because I know I wouldn't be able to see her with another guy because I have grown some what attached. Over the past year, numerous times I have considered bringing up trying to date or being more than FWB because I haven't been this happy in along time let alone enjoy being around someone so much (I'm kinda anti social because of anxiety)


I have been really grumpy/depressed thinking I may have missed out on my only chance to be truly happy because I never been that happy in so many years. Also being around her made me into a better person.


Sally noticed that I was being grumpy and less talkative so I decided to tell her what was wrong. She was a bit surprised because she knew my stance on relationships(at least how I acted towards the idea of them). She was also kind of hurt/confused because I never once brought it up. She admitted that she definitely had feelings for me over the past year and also thought of a relationship but knowing my stance on it she decided not to bring it up.


I feel like I screwed up on an astronomical level. I realized I took her for granted thinking she would be around/interested in me for much longer. Me having a bad habit of procrastinating, shouldn't have put off telling her how I feel for this long. Now I feel completely lost and hopeless. Sally still wants to be best friends but I don't think I can stomach seeing her with another guy.


Any suggestions on what I should do next? I'm open to all ideas and advice I can get. Should I try to fight for her heart by putting more effort in than this other guy? Would it be better to wait it out? Or should I just cut my losses and hope to find happiness down the line?


**tl;dr**  Brief summary: i originally wasn't interested in a relationship so me(26M) and Sally(24F) agreed on FWB. She expressed generally how she eventually wanted to find a relationship, I always showed no interest in relationships. Over a year we've become really close, I gained strong feelings for her and became attached. I waited too long to mention those feelings because I told her about them after she mentioned she started seeing someone. Sally had feelings for me as well over the past year but didn't think I was interested since I'm not good at expressing myself/knew my stance on relationships.. what do I do?",24Mar2018,3

54,"WARNING: LONG POST TL;DR below, sorry but I'm extremely frustrated and unsure of what to do.



I have been in college for a couple years now, but only until recently I have decided to go from a degree in the arts to one in the sciences. I'm still weighing my options on what my undergraduate degree will be, but since I am considering medical school I needed to start with biology. I've been taking my GE credits at a community college near me, and so far I have been doing really well, even in subjects I have struggled with in the past.

So this semester I took my first Biology course probably since high school. I knew it would be difficult but I was prepared to dive into it; I needed this course and I still need it. However what I didn't expect was this instructor. 

At first, I thought she was just a hard teacher, which is okay and really isn't anything to worry about if you read the material and pay attention. But over the past few weeks (I've been in this course for over a month and a half now), she's gotten a lot worse.

She gives quizzes every week along with a lab report due on the same day. The quiz and the lab are worth 5 points each. This makes sense with the quiz because there's only 10 questions plus any extra credit she feels like handing out that weeks. The lab report, however, can have as much as 20-30 questions and even graphs.

On my first lab report I turned in, she docked an entire point --*20% of my lab grade* -- because I didn't connect the points on my graph. The actual data was good and the answers were written out correctly--no spelling errors or grammar misuse, it was just the graph. On my third lab report, there was another graph and this time she only marked off a half-point because the axises weren't labeled the way she wanted (note: we had done this graph together as a class and everyone wrote what *she* put on the board. She docked the same points off my classmates' reports as well.)

In addition to very inconsistent grading criteria, during lecture when she asks the class a question and doesn't get an answer within the breath you take before speaking, she starts degrading people for not knowing the answer (if you call out the answer, she cuts you off and says that 'it doesn't matter at this point'). It's as if her goal is to make herself feel like the smartest person in the room and constantly reminds her students how much we don't know.

The last thing she did (after our class drop date passed) was during lecture, at the very last slide, she started spouting her own beliefs about the subject on the slide. She didn't teach us what it was or even read the information from the slide (none of what she was saying was in the book, of course), just her own gut beliefs against the scientific community. If anyone with a differing opinion even tried to speak she just talked louder over you until you gave up. 

The subject was genetically modified organisms, the evidence for which--including the stuff in the very book she required for our class--disagrees with her. Yet there she was soap-boxing, zealously, her own opinion that GMO's are dangerous to an entire class of barely 20-somethings, not even mentioning what is in the book. 

She had done this once before with vaccines. She made it clear during a discussion about the recent flu deaths that she was an anti-vaxxer, and preceded to silence people with pro-vax statements with things like, ""There are definitely *alternatives*. I use them myself, and with my kids.""

*What*??

Since then I still debated on whether or not I should drop the class and retake it with another instructor (I did, after asking her to go over her grading criteria, she couldn’t even explain her own grading rubric or how she determines what things are worth). I looked her up on Rate My Professor and I am definitely not the first and only student who has had issues with her teaching.

I'm just confused as to how a person who isn't equipped to teach biology got that position, but I don't know how to bring it to someone's attention.


TL;DR Biology teacher is anti-vax and unclear grading rubric, dropping class but unsure of what to do. How should I bring it to the attention of the school?

55,"First time posting here, desperately need advice and I am hoping the way I have typed this isn't off putting. Please just read it for what it is, and I am not good at typing up a well put together story with good explanation in one setting. I sincerely apologize!

So I live with my husband's mom, her long term fiancé and husband's much younger brother (my husband, daughter and I included).

As the title states, out of the blue he cornered me and tried to do things to me for 4 hours while I kept giving him a gridlock ""No"" but he wouldn't stop trying. Saying the creepiest of things. 

He is a very well respected, quiet with a Mensa IQ score and very loyal. A fucking M.Night Shamylan twist sort of thing as he had me fooled as well as anyone else and still does. I am the one who saw into his soul. I had no idea he would ever do this, he stands behind his morals and values no matter the cost. 

So I told my husband and begged him to not say a word because his mother would go on a killing spree, me the target. It's been near a month now and we have all acted like it never happened for the sake of survival. He went back carrying on his day to day work, video gaming and sleep routine. 

Until tonight. He is always home by 5:30 at the latest no matter the hold up. Tonight he came home at 7:30 (not in the 8 years of me knowing him has he done that) after my mother in law calling and hoping to god he didn't get home only to leave immediately because there was no dinner. She is always at the 74 year old lady neighbor's house and today she had thought she had missed him. When she called and she asked him if he was hungry and if he left to get food he responded with ""No I'm not hungry, no I haven't ate and I'm not off work yet and I'll need a hot shower and to go to bed.""

He gets home, blood-flushed face, acting drunk but not giving it away and just acting very off.(mother in law does not notice even the most noticeable things if they are not told to her)

Again, very unlike him. He has never ever had a shower in the afternoon or evening. Morning shower guy here. So right when he gets home he needs to shower for the first time in the existence of us knowing him and it not be a need to wash off some sort of sin? 

The night he came onto me he mentioned several times, ""I havent had sex in so long it is now purely animal"". Of course I had turned him down left unfulfilled and I am wondering if this sounds like a red flag or a bad day? I've seen his bad days and this doesn't quite fit in that category. I would really like some sort of feedback. 

Again, sorry if this is a horribly written post. I am not good at getting out what's in my head turned into words where they make much sense, but I truly tried!",24Mar2018,1
56,"Hello.

A while ago, an older married couple that are regular customers at my place of work gave me their number and invited me out to go to a bar with them. I wasn't sure if I should text them at first, but I eventually did, partially because I'm always open to making new friends and partially because I was feeling particularly lonely when they offered. They're not people who I would usually hang out with, but they were really kind. Though the bar thing didn't pan out, we still text occasionally. We're not close or anything, but they're always nice when they come by my workplace, and they've invited me out a few more times, none of which I was able to attend.

However, this week a coworker of mine was harassed into giving over her contact information. It was a big mess, and in response, my boss told us that she didn't want us to establish or maintain relationships with customers, or see them in public. My friends hadn't texted me in a while, so I didn't think to officially break it off, but today they texted me asking me to hang out. I told them I had plans for night (which is true), but now I'm debating whether I should cut things off permanently.

Should I end this relationship? If so, how do I do so kindly, so as not to hurt their feelings and considering that I have to see them regularly at work? I've never broken up with anyone, romantically or otherwise, so this is all new to me.

Thanks.",24Mar2018,1
57,"Here is my situation:  I have found myself rather disconnected from any sort of female social circle.  All my friends are single guys.  I quit drinking, so I'd rather not go to the bar to try to meet women.

And here is the situation at hand:  There is this girl who works at the car wash near my house.  Ive been there a few times and had a few chats with her.  Its not the same as asking a server for example, because her job isn't a customer service heavy job, so she shouldn't feel too obligated to be overly-nice if she doesn't want to be.

Would it be 100% wrong to ask this girl to hang out?  What can I do to make it as non-creepy as possible?  Should I be straight forward or be non-chalant about it?  Any advice on what to say or how to create a scenario that would work for me?  Paying attention to her facial expression and body language when I have seen her I think she could have an idea that I am interested in her.

62,"My Sister met her boyfriend back in June 2012(6 Years if I am correct) and her boyfriend has crossed the fucking line. 

Backstory:
 earlier today I was getting out for my spring break as usual and my little brother ( In 6 Grade) Called me telling me that our sister's boyfriend stole from the College Box. The College Box is a Box my family made for me and my little brother to help pay for college, there was $2,000 in that box. My brother said he spent it on 5 monster energy drinks and three bags of McDonald's that he ate by himself. When He told me this I never rode my bike so damn fast in my life ( Bicycle). When I got home and unlocked the lock on the box, the money was gone. I confronted him about it and he said that he would blame ME for it. He did tell my parents that I stole out of the box and he had put the McDonalds bags in my room, I'm grounded for two months now. However, they do not know of my second laptop ( I am using it now to write this). 

The Problem: 
I didn't do this and I can't believe my parents didn't even take a second to hear my story. This is really frustrating considering that they usually let me tell my side. Hell, even my brother TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED and they STILL DIDN'T BELIEVE IT!!!. In all honesty, I tried to tell my sister and she said "" I know he didn't do that! You just jealous that your single and you were caught in the act dumbass"". I don't ever care about women at this point anymore so jealousy is out of the question. My Step Father is pissed at me still, he even took my Xbox and Playstation out of my room and told me to ""Bring the money back and I'll give them back to you"". At this point, I am seriously going to kill my sister's boyfriend for real. He has always annoyed me from the start. He has stolen a lot and I mean A LOT of money from me and my little brother when we were younger. The only reason why I let him do it is that I knew I was weak and he was stronger. But now all I really do need to do is go to my stepfather's room and load his gun, then fire it into his skull.

69,"About a month ago I bought a motorcycle. It was being stored at a used car dealership where the previous owner works but being sold on craigslist as the previous owner's motorcycle as a private seller. When purchasing the bike the previous owner told me that the bikes title was being held in a safe and he was unable to open it so he would have to mail me the title. Now, it being Saturday made this not hard to believe as he just works as a shop-hand and there was no one else in the office. Also, he just seemed like a nice guy so I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

The problem here is that the previous owner said that he mailed the title but it never came. I told him about it and he said that he would apply for a lost title to get a new one. Now, for whatever reason, he is claiming that the new title still hasn't come. I went to the DMV near me and found out that it only takes a week to get a new title. This is was almost a month ago. He should have the new title by now if he was telling the truth about getting a new one. This is also assuming that he even had a title in the first place. 

Now I don't want to hear about how I shouldn't have bought a bike without the title in hand. I've already gotten enough of that and I know better now. I don't know if this is the place to ask, but I was hoping that maybe someone who knows more than me can give me some advice on what my options are now. I have the guy's workplace address and name. I also have a signed bill of sale from him as well. I can easily find the bikes vin number as I have possession of the motorcycle currently. I'm just missing the title.

70,"My mom is 47 years old, I know menopause isn’t really supposed to hit women until they reach their 50s but lately my mom has become extremely irritable. ANYTHING can literally set her off into a bad mood and her attitude becomes explosive, she screams, her arguments don’t even make sense sometimes and I honestly do not know what to do. Her health has also been affected, she has gone to the doctor and they have told her that she is extremely stressed and have given her muscle relaxers because her back is suffering due to her muscles becoming so tense. 

For example. Today I was on my way home and while i was driving my mother called me, she asked me if i had left work and I answered yes, she the proceeded to ask me if could go with her to a store so i could use my employee discount, I then told her “i was going to go home then to the gym” (as usual) but before I could even continue my sentence and ask her what store she wanted to go to ( I receive discounts at multiple stores)  she  exploded and cursed me out over the phone and hung up on me. I was going to ask her what store she wanted to go to but before i got to ask as soon as she heard i had other plans (which i did not mind postponing till later in the day) she popped off on me.

Her attitude has become more and more stubborn, about 8 months ago i could sit down with her and try and explain things to her from a different point of view  and she was pretty open minded about anything we would talk about but suddenly her attitude has make a very strong 180. Only what she says is what’s right (even if it isn’t), she isn’t open to hear about others opinions as much and she just simply has become very irratable to the point where I don’t even wanna have a conversation with her because i feel like she will just pop off about anything that bothers her. 

What do I do? I don’t know how to try and associate with her sometimes because i just don’t want to spark an argument. Her marriage is perfect and there isn’t anything wrong at home that could be affecting her. It just seems to be her, continuously stressed and very irritable about anything. Sometimes she expresses so much anger i feel like she doesn’t want to be around me or anyone sometimes. I’ve tried to tell her to stretch every morning and practice some meditation but she won’t ever pull through with it, she’ll do it like once a week and she won’t even stretch properly but i can’t even show her how to stretch because she wants to be left alone &amp; she thinks she’s doing it right (she isn’t).

71,"I am looking for advice on how to handle a situation tactfully to help save my reputation as a mechanic. 

TL; DR Friend brings me her car to fix and cheap out on the parts and blasts me indirectly on her Instagram 7 months after I fixed her car. What to do? 

Whole story: About 7 months ago I had a local club member and friend approach me about doing some work on her car. There's only a few of us in the area who specialize in this type of car and know what they're doing. She offered me $1,000 to replace the head on her car because someone fucked it up trying to helicoil it and it wad causing loss of compression. At least that's what she was told. I obliged and took the job. 

The job requires the engine to be removed and is time and labor intensive, hence the cost. I removed the engine and started doing an inspection on related systems that should be checked when doing this repair. I found the clutch was very worn promptly to its last millimeter before the rivets would catch the flywheel and I promptly let her know. Her rear main seal was also leaking. I insisted she purchase a OE clutch and flywheel from the dealer but she was short on cash and brought me an AutoZone clutch kit and wanted to reuse the flywheel, which I warned her she might have issues down the road because they cannot properly handle the power she is pushing and the flywheel at a minimum would have to be surfaced. There were a few other gaskets and seals that I told her she needed to replace. She upped the ante to $1,500 because I had to purchase new valves because her loss of compression was due to burned exhaust valves. I finished the job, car went back together, she was happy to have her car back making full power, no issues. 

Three months go by and guess what? She starts having clutch issues to the point where it won't disengage the clutch. She also developed an oil leak that seemed to only happen at or near wide open throttle. She takes it to a specialty shop 150 miles away, whom I trust, because she was already in the area for a dyno tune to support the mods she had already installed. The shop tells her she needs a new clutch and a bunch of other stuff. They basically told her I used inferior parts and should have never reused the flywheel. To fix everything I told her she needed to have done would cost her about $3k. Suddenly she has the money after getting a promotion to pay this shop $3k. A few days ago, she posted a pic of her car on social media saying she is sad she can't drive her car. When one of her friends asks why, she tells them that she took it to a trusted mechanic friend and the shop where the car is has to fix all the things I did wrong. She doesn't mention me or my business by name, but she has posts in the past that says who fixed her car and how happy she was to have it back.

I've been really depressed lately about someone that I can't get off my mind and on top of that I can't figure out what I want to do with my life. I'll be graduating college by the end of the summer with a degree in statistics, but I've realized I don't really enjoy doing math anymore. It's become far too difficult for me to understand and I barely (sometimes not) pass my classes. I've been looking at intro data analyst jobs in the Boston area, but I don't meet requirements and I dread sitting at another desk all day doing something I don't like. It's even gotten to the point that I've looked at fishing jobs in Alaska.. anyways, I love sports (baseball the most), weather, geography, the environment, cars, and skiing (if any of that helps). Any advice on how to get out of this funk would be awesome.

76,"I graduated High School last year in June, then went to Basic Training for the Navy in July. Spent 3 months there busy failing my PFA 15 times and I got kicked out in October. Since then I haven't really done anything with my life and I'm very unsure with what to do with my life. I seem to have two choices to decide from.

I was accepted into Oakland University last week, but I don't know what I would want to major in. I feel like going to school would help me figure out what I want to do with my life, but the student loans that I would have to take out worry me a lot. My dad has said that if I go to college he wouldn't be able to help me out very much in paying for school, so loans and the off chance of scholarships are the only ways I can pay it off.

I can get a waiver from my old Navy Recruiter and go back into the Navy, pending I can pass my PFA. While the Navy gives me job security and would also pay for my college after I get out, my time that I spent in Basic made me feel like that maybe the military isn't the right choice either. The 6 year commitment I had on my contract worried me that I'd be stuck doing a job that I might hate with no way of getting out of it.

78,"I want to keep this brief but it might be hard and also im not sure if this is the right place for it so please let me know if its not! :) 

About me: 16 years old and living in a house share in a new city with 3 older guys (21,24,27)

When i first moved in it was two (lovely) student girls and the student guy, then as time went on things changed unfortunately and the two new guys moved in. Its a two story house and basically here are some of my problems. 

GUY A: is 21, living here when i first moved in, is foreign and speaks awful English, i cant understand a word he says and he cant understand me, and tbh he creeps me the hell out. Always coming downstairs whenever my (unfortunately creaky) door opens to try and catch me or whatever. One time my boyfriend was over and he came running down the stairs as my boyfriend was going to the toilet and went straight back up when he saw it was my boyfriend and not me! Before the two girls moved out he was as quiet as a mouse!! Now.. he games, shouts, bangs, rages, and what gets me the most, he does what i can only describe sounding like furniture being dragged around up there ALL NIGHT AND DAY, i cannot understand what he is doing but it disturbs my sleep/work so badly and stresses me out to the point where i get migraines. I have left over 6 notes in the kitchen asking him to be more considerate (all very polite as i hate confrontation) and he ignores them, ive text my landlord who text him about it and he ignores it. One time he replied to my note and wrote on the back, asking me not to speak to my boyfriend in my room as he didnt like to hear “mumblings” which is an absolute joke considering how loud he is. LASTLY i went home over Christmas and he stayed and i came back way earlier than expected as i left a note estimating when i was coming back, and he cornered me saying he had been into my room iver christmas and taken a pillow from me! Because he apparently had a friend over who slept on the sofa, but there are literal pillows already on there. I didn’t get my pillow back for almost a week and it wasn’t even washed. Im guessing the only reason he told me was because he was planning on never saying but i came back while he still had it. 

On to my second problem 
Guy B: he is 24 and recently moved in, he is also foreign and speaks hardly any English and again, cant understand him at all, all three guys are upstairs and have their own bathroom. Yet this guy insists on using the one i use downstairs, and sure, im not an unreasonable person, it means two using upstairs and two downstairs. But he is AWFUL. Leaves it so disgusting and never EVER buys toilet paper. Whenever i put a new roll/rolls in there he STEALS them and takes them upstairs. Again, ive left notes asking him to stop and he ignores it. I was one time using the bathroom, and heard him come home, so ran the tap to be modest. Then the bathroom door handle goes (its dark and the light is on so i am obviously in there plus the tap running) and the door is locked so doesnt open, he then proceeded to try to force the door open. I let the landlord know and he installed a safer lock on the bathroom and my door. Also on ariving home from my boyfriends one day i found the lock unscrewed and taken off the bathroom door. Next, He literally sits in the kitchen area in the PITCH BLACK, all the time, and so many times i walk through to use the bathroom and all i hear is “hello “my name” from the shadows. (Sounds funny but its creepy as hell) As I mentioned earlier im 16, i came back from a family event with a friend (a little tipsy) but it was adult supervised and on their property ( i wouldn’t disrespect my landlord by drinking on his property underage) and my friend kept going into the kitchen acting quite drunk so i text this guy to explain im sorry my friend is a bit drunk, and he pressures and pressures (in the worst english ive ever read) to buy us more drink and drink with us, after i say no about 5/6 times. Bearing in mind my friend and i are 16 which he knows and he is 24 years old. 

Ive probably left a few things out but this is already so long. I just want advice really. I cant move out as im on a agreed let etc until june, and while its not that long it feels like an enternity to me. My boyfriend wont even come to my house anymore as he finds them too weird. If anyone has any stories or helpful tips on this i would appreciate it so so sooo much, please feel free to message me also! 

Also, the 3rd guy is also foreign and speaks little English but he is never an issue or loud and keeps himself to himself.

80,"I’m currently a junior in high school and this past year has been rough. This is an extremely condensed version of why. At the beginning of 2017, I had two amazing best friends, a nice boy that I was starting to like, and an okay relationship with my family. Unfortunately, one boyfriend (and my own stupidity) ruined all of that for me. In spring of 2017, I got into a relationship with a boy, we’ll call him Cody. He was not the boy I previously mentioned, but another one who reached out to me. We started talking and I liked his personality a lot. He was incredibly sweet, caring, and we had the same sense of humor. We would chat everyday for a couple of months before he asked me on a date, which turned into two and then three. We started our relationship soon after, which is when so many red flags started to appear. 

He was incredibly jealous, he would make things up about me and my past, and then get mad at me for them no matter how much I tried to tell him he was imagining it all. A few more months into the relationship and he was escalating very quickly. He would call me names like bitch and slut, sometimes meaning it, and other times just to get a reaction out of me. His excuse often times was that he “wanted to see if I actually cared about him and what he said to me”.  Anyways, you guys get the point. He was a jerk. Back to the jealousy. My two best friends, we’ll call them Lizzy and Leo. Cody absolutely hated the fact that I had friends, and would take every opportunity to push us apart. Unfortunately, it worked and I no longer have them or any other friends really. 

My sister found out about the way Cody was because of Leo. He warned her and my sister looked into it and found everything out. Her and my other sister had a talk with me, telling me that it was over and me and Cody could no longer date. I was relieved of course, but part of me realized that I had no one to turn to besides family. I went to school the next day expecting to never talk to Cody again, but he came up to me asking for an explanation. I gave him one and tried to go about my day alone. He followed me around as if nothing ever happened. During lunch, he spent his time trying to convince me that I had no one but him and that my family only does this because they don’t want me happy. It all sounds very stupid, I know, but my weak self fell for it. Over, and over, and over.

Months pass, and I’m hiding this horrible relationship from my family in fear that without him I would be alone. Each day is worse than the last, and he would push me to the point of tears almost everyday. He found ways to blame me for my sister finding out about him. Towards the end of the relationship, he escalated to making threats instead of just name calling. He would push me in front of everyone in between classes. He spit on me on more than one occasion, treating me worse than he would treat an animal, and generally just broke down the self esteem that I managed to build up over time. One day I broke down in front of my mom and finally told her everything. She took me to the school office and they helped me to finally leave him. 

Now, for the issue I need advice on.

Since that visit to the office, I’ve been feeling strange. I find myself wanting to cry many times throughout some days, and other days I feel (describing to the best of my ability) nothing. I have many moments that are happy, like when I’m with my nieces or when I see my dogs, but when I’m laying down in bed, or in the shower, or even just walking around school I feel a sadness that is sort of hard to describe. I’ve also noticed that my sleeping patterns are completely off, partially due to the time change, but not completely. I sleep fairly early each night (11:00) and wake up pretty late compared to others (7:00) in the mornings. However, I am exhausted in classes, which is affecting my grades as well. I can’t focus as well as I used to be able to. I get panic attacks some mornings (still pretty rarely), but I thought I had left those in the past. But the thing bothering me most of all is just the overwhelming sense of emptiness that I feel. I don’t know how else to explain it besides empty with some added mood swings every now and then.

I just want things to go back to the way they were. I don’t know how to fix any of this. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",24Mar2018,3
81,"Hey guys long story short.  I had a friend for about 6 months, stop being friends with him, due to him being really weird and making me uncomfortable. My friend goes ballistic, and I cut ties with him, anyways about 6 months later he finds my snapchat, and starts texting me. I thought I would see how he is doing and wish him the best and move on, but he starts telling me things that I wished I would have never heared. 

He basically says that once I stopped being friends with him, he ran off and started selling meth and shit, and he worked with some cartel members, and what not. He basically said that some of the cartel members he knew wanted to kill me( I guess he talked shit about me to them, and they wanted to kill me because they respect my friend. Which makes no sense I've only hung out with him a few time over the period of 6 months; it's not like I was best friends with him.) Anyways he says this in a a certain way, as if I'm supposed to be impressed that he did me a favor by not letting his cartel friends kill me. And now I'm really nervous because the last thing he said was ""I want you alive right now, but sometimes I want you dead. If I wear to kill you I wouldn't just kill you right away, I would want to make sure you wish you were dead before I kill you"" 

I don't know what's going on guys, I'm terrified for my life. I'm still a young guy and only knew this guy for a few months, I just want him out of my life, but he says he thinks about me everyday . I want to cut ties with him like before but I don't want him to go crazy and try to kill me. Please let me know what I should do thanks. 

Also some of you might say he is lying about the cartel, but i know he is telling the truth. and some might be saying ""shouldve have never been friends with some one like that"" but the thing is he was never a drug dealer/user when I hung out with him, he was normal and did normal things.",24Mar2018,1

83,"Freshman year of college I had a real friend group- we made plans together all the time, hung out, and had a ""squad"" group chat. As a sophomore, we've all moved to different places on campus and are no longer neighbors. I'm still close with a few of them, but the rest have kind of become friendly acquaintances. A bunch of them ended up living together and they formed a new friend group with other people they live with. A few kind of became secluded and just don't go out in general. And then there's me and my roommates- I'd be happy if we could at least call ourselves a solid friend group, but we can't. One of my roommates made a bunch of new friends from a club she's in and she hangs out with them all the time (and never invites us to join). Another one always just does her own thing. The last one is my best friend, and we're super close (which I'm totally grateful for) but I really miss having that solid friend group. I miss having people I can count on to hang out with. I miss not having to only depend on one person (my best friend) to do stuff with me. I've tried maintaining connections with some of them and asking people to hang out, but they're always busy with their new friend groups. At this point, I'm not really sure what to do. I'm trying to make new friends, but everybody seems to have a friend group they do stuff with so it's actually pretty hard. My best friend isn't interested in making new friends, and I'm really sick of not having anyone to do stuff with when she's busy.

92,"Hey guys.

So I am a sophomore that is currently in HS and is currently on spring break and it just ended for me essentially today. I have just been chilling and playing fortnite and listening to music. I have also been in contact with some of my friends of the group we have this past spring break.

But today I was talking to one of the people in the group who is overseas at the moment and I told him that I was did nothing this whole spring break and he asked me if I hung out with anybody in the group at all this break. I told him that I didn't and that if they did, they didn't tell me. He proceeds to tell me that they did activites such as bowling and that they even had a list planned out for the break that they showed my friend (but obviously he went overseas so he couldn't go anyway) and I felt utterly pissed. Not one of them told me about the multiple things that they did over this week long break.

Now you may say: ""OP, this was a one time thing."""" 

It wasn't. This has happened many, many times. And they have bullshitted and lied about plans they have made and done.

They have talked about their plans in front of my face and when it happens later they ask me why I couldn't go when they know damn well I could've been invited.

I feel as if I am the second choice in the group and the black sheep in the group among all of my friends. I don't think I repel anyone because of things I do. I think of myself as an extremely respectful and nice person. To everybody.

But I think this is where this adds on to multiple things, because the connection between me and the rest of the group have been in a jiffy ever since I was a freshman.

For example: There are two main people in the group that I would like to talk about that stand out pretty well to me (in a bad way). Let's call them Person A and Person B.

Person A: I have known Person A ever since we were third graders. At one point, we were really good friends. But when freshman year came, it all changed.

Person A is essentially what you would think of the center of the group, a very egotistical, egocentric and narcissitic person, the person that everybody in the group LOVES and never ever can talk bad about them, or else they get insulted on by everybody else in the group. Person A is essentially the person that is being ""dickridden"" . They all want to talk to him and make plans with him and when I want to talk to them, they ignore me especially and all they want to talk about sometimes is Person A.

Person A and me had a good friendship until freshman year. When I mentioned to him that everybody in the group (that he was becoming friends with that same year) was essentially ""dickriding"" him, all he said was ""Yea man. I got fans.""      That really gave me a strange feeling, that Person A was being narcisstic. And over time, with the majority of the people in the group and him calling me names and essentially witchhunting me with insults, especially to impress Person A, who again they all think is the center of the group. Person A texted me and we got into some long arguement which essentially was him insulting me, calling me ""soft"", and saying that ""I'm too sensitive"" and that ""I can't take a joke""; the endless taunting was going on for about 5-6 months or so. Long story short, I cut them all off (especially Person A and Person B) towards the end of the school year and throughout the summer I was basically playing with people online and making other friends.

At one point, he texted me and basically poured out his feelings saying that ""You're my brother and nothing will ever change that, we have been good friends since we were little and nothing will ever come in between that""; He essentially was apologizing. I figured it was a load of bullshit and just said ""Okay. Cool. Whatever."" . 

Here's the backstory on Person B:

So Person B I knew since I was in the seventh grade. Barely even talked to him, just the occasional ""hi"" and ""bye"" now and then. But then came freshman year, and we got a little bit closer as friends.

There was this girl that liked me and Person B liked the same girl in the past. Long story short, Person B had a crush on the girl in the past and the girl basically wasn't interested in Person B, leaving him all mad and stuff. As soon as Person B found that that the same girl liked me, he essentially stabbed me in the back. How?

Essentially, long story short: I told him a couple of things that were meant to be kept secret that were pertaining to my relationship with the girl, and he had a class with the girl that liked me and he told her all of the things I told him (which was a mistake to do) and made up lies to try and give me a bad impression. The girl got mad at me, and she almost called it off with me, but I told her how I felt about her then and there and the rest is history..... He essentially backstabbed me, and at the moment, since the girl and me started to date, I blowed the whole situation off of my mind until after the relationship between me and this girl was done. After that, I realized the severity of the situation.

Person B also has a narcissitic and egocentric personality, and likes to down others a majority of the time. He likes to talk crap about some of our friends behind their backs, and mine as well. Person B is also my next door neighbor. After all that stuff that happened freshman year, I never really talked to Person B a whole lot. In the summer after freshman year where I cut everybody off, he called me and essentially kind of apologized to me. He told me ""No hard feelings"".

After the summer, inclduing this school year (sophomore year) , there are still instances were Person B and Person A have trashed on me (verbally) with other people in the group and they have made plans and many things involving a majority of people in this group of friends....other than me.

The thing about Person A. We were close at one point. But I realized something. He rarely texts me anymore (he does to everybody else though) and if he does, it's to sell me something or ask me for something. When we have conversation, it is very awkward and there is barely any conversation at all. I say that because after what happened freshman year and me falling out with the group, it all felt different after that incident, especially after he somewhat apologized to me. We aren't very as close anymore, he has gotten closer to Person B and basically everybody else, other than me. When I was say that, I mean that everybody in the group know whats going on in the group and what the plans are. Except me. Only like 2 or 3 people from the group actively talk to me and want to make plans with me and actually seem to care about me. 

The last thing about Person A. I realized that he treats me as a second choice. When noone else is availabile to hang out, he asks me to hang out, or when there is nobody to text, he texts me. When there is nobody to play with on Fortnite or PUBG, I'm the last person he calls. It seems like he doesn't care, there have been instances where he has said some insults and uncertain things in front of other people in the group, but not in front of me. Person A always tells me that ""When I talk bad about you, I tell it straight to your face."" Now, I know that is a load of shit.

So, in the end, Person A has become encumbered in the majority of the group ""dickriding"" him, and has become a person who barely talks to me, who was a good friend to (I always respected him), and threw me to the side and Person B feels as if he is a top head in the group as well, also, he has backstabbed me and treated me like shit sometimes.

How should I feel and what should I do?

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm sorry for the long entry, but this has been going on for a long time and I wanted to hear the advice from the fellow redditors on this sub. I want some advice I can heed so I can put an end to this.

Again, **I appreciate everybody who took the time to read my dilemma.**

Thank you so much guys.

94,"When I was growing up, my parents went through a really bad divorce. My dad cheated on my mom with another man and my mom used me and my siblings as emotional weapons against him. They would have screaming matches in front of us or talk shit about each other when the other wasn’t around or try to get info out of us that they could use to blackmail the other one. This was around ten years ago.

Because of this, My older sister turned rebellious against my parents and I sort of just “checked out” of life. I was existing but not making any real effort to live. I was diagnosed with severe depression in middle and high school and about eight months ago I reached rock bottom and tried to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge.

Recently someone has come into my life that’s helped me a lot with my depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies. This person was my only friend when I hit the bottom and I feel like they’re slowly helping me live again.

I still deal with anxiety and panic attacks  and some days I’ll just be checked out like before but it’s getting better. I have lots of trouble speaking to people and opening up now though.

What I need advice for though is myself and my relationship with my parents. Whenever I’m around my mom, I’ll just be silent and (very occasionally) give one-word responses whenever she says something to me. When I’m around my dad, I’ll do the same thing to a lesser extent. I just get really anxious being around them and I don’t know why.

How can I fix this? I tried therapy years ago but the therapist wouldn’t listen to what I was saying. They just gave me a multiple choice test and told me to take some happy pills. I’m lost and I don’t know how to fix myself.",24Mar2018,1

98,"Ok, so my dad and I have had a very strained relationship for most of my life, but it got worse when he and my mom divorced. My siblings have never really wanted to go with him when his visitation time rolled around, and I being the oldest and the peacemaker, was always expected by him to force them to want to come with him. This has stressed me out for years.

His idea of parenting is just being physically present. That’s about it. I call him an emotional deadbeat, because he came to track meets, used his visitation, etc. but I never felt a connection with him. He never really talked to us about our goals, hobbies, things we liked, what was going on in our lives. He’d usually just talk about himself, his job, and other stuff going on his life. Also, his visitation almost always consisted of us just sitting around watching tv. He’s also a scrooge when it comes to money. He’s constantly lying about not having any money, even though he has a very well-paying job. He’s refused to help us pay for college, and just about anything else we’ve asked him to help us with. 

His top priorities are work and women. They always have been. He’s constantly winning awards at work for being a top salesman (another reason I don’t believe him when he tells me he’d be hungry for weeks if he helped me with tuition) because that’s almost all he ever does. Work. He’s taken it to the extreme. He also always has a girlfriend, and she’s always the most important. He spends huge amounts of money helping them with home renovations and other stuff, he takes them on vacations and lies to us about them (even though his gf tags him in the photos she posts to facebook). He’s never taken us on those kinds of vacations, by the way. He works extra hard to make sure their kids love him and think he’s the coolest, but then puts no effort into his relationship with us, and expects us to respect and adore him anyway.

Lately, though, he’s gotten even worse. About a year ago, he chose to move to a different state because his work offered him a higher paying position, and he says he’s even busier with work now, so we hardly ever see him or hear from him anymore. His visitation with my youngest sister is supposed to be the last weekend of every month, but he only comes around about once every 3-4 months. 

About 2 months ago, he gave us 2 days’ notice that he’d be coming to town, and that he wanted to hang out with us. My siblings and I had work, plans with friends, homework, etc. and couldn’t drop everything to spend the whole weekend with him. This made him really mad, and he sent us a really long text telling us how disappointed he was in his jaded, disrespectful children, and accused us of only wanting him around for his money and for christmas presents, and that we didn’t even put forth enough effort to deserve either. (We had recently asked him for help paying our tuition, and still hadn’t received the christmas presents he told us all about, despite it being the end of January, but we hadn’t really made an issue of it) He lectured us about how relationships are 2 way and he’s done putting in all the effort. He told us that if we want a relationship, it’s on us now. 

This text struck a huge nerve, because none of what he said was true. I’ve been working my ass off my entire life to have a good relationship with him, but he can’t see past himself and just walks all over me. He can’t see the harm he’s done and continues to do to our family, and he blames everything on us. We don’t want to see him because he continues to hurt us, but he can’t see that. He accuses my mom of brainwashing us to hate him, he accuses us of being hardened, jaded assholes. But he can’t seem to see any fault in himself.

Anyways, I haven’t spoken to him since. I haven’t responded to calls, texts, or anything because I’m so tired of the emotional toll his presence has taken on me. I don’t know what to do. Part of me wants him to be a part of my life, because he’s my dad and I still love him despite everything. The other part of me, though, which is becoming the dominant part, just wants to remove him from my life entirely. It’s keeping me up at night. Sometimes I stay up all night thinking about all the ways I wish I could tell him off. Other nights I stay up feeling guilty for not wanting him to be a part of my life. I’m so confused, and every time he calls or sends a message or anything, all of the negative feelings come flooding back.

This is a really long post, but if you read this far, I’d really love some advice on how to deal with my father.

99,"So five-ish years ago I went on an international service trip and was there for 8 months or so. I met a bunch of people there and this guy was just one of them. We were never close. In fact we probably only talked a few times. I remember thinking he was a cool guy, but like, that's it. When we got home, I saw him one other time when a lot of us who went on the trip got together. After that, he continually asked me to come and see him (I lived a state away... about 4 hours drive) but I was dating my now husband and had no interest so I just stopped answering. He got married a little while later... maybe 2 years ago?

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I've been happily married for 2 years, and I got a personal reply to my snapchat story from creepy guy, which was just the words ""Hot hot hot"" with a bunch of fire emojis. My snapchat story was just a selfie. I don't like... know him well enough for that to be a joke? So I told my husband and he was like, wow well, I mean don't block him automatically just in case he meant to send it to his wife or just something. Idk. Benefit of the doubt, people. So I let it go. I did think it was weird though, especially because from what I have seen his wife is SUPER cute and seems like a really good person. Anyways. So today I got another snapchat reply to my story from him... and it said ""This is a really good look for you"" with more fire emojis. It was another selfie of mine he was commenting on. So... I immediately took a picture of the snap, not a screenshot because I didn't want him to know, and I sent it to my husband. Now it's pretty clearly not an accident and my husband is pissed. My husband sent me a text to type out (which was actually pretty polite) and I sent it to the creepy guy as a reply. I am waiting for him to open it before I block him on Snapchat.

The dilemma I am having is whether or not I should tell his wife. I would do it in a really nice way, but if I was in her position and my husband were calling other girls hot multiple times on Snapchat, I would DEFINITELY want to know and it would really hurt me. I know there is something to the whole ""ignorance is bliss"" thing, but if this guy is sending things to me and we barely know each other, there is no way I'm the only one.

Should I tell her?

TLDR: Creepy married guy is sending me flirty things. I'm also married. My husband told him off, but I am wondering if I should tell his wife?

PS- If I did tell his wife, this is something similar to what I might say: ""Hi , My name is juliaakatrinaa and I know your husband from XYZ trip we took a long time ago. I have debated sending you this, and I know it isn't something you want to hear, but I got a snapchat from him a while ago that said _ and today I got another one that said ___. I have never replied to any of these things or asked for them, and I am happily married also. I just wanted you to know because you seem like a really sweet person and if it was my husband, I would want to know.""

PPS- If anyone is interested, I have screenshots as well.",24Mar2018,2

101,"So I’m 20 and way too old to have never even worked a crappy retail job. I’m in my second year of college so at least I’m doing school and not a total NEET yet, but I’m really starting to panic. I’ve applied for dozens of jobs, only had two actual interviews, and have never gotten any farther than that. I will try to explain the circumstances that led me to this but I figure it would be more useful to list the very few things I could place on a resume, all of which are either “odd jobs,” volunteering, or freelance work, all of it pretty inconsistent with large gaps:

* Volunteering at my old town’s animal shelter for a couple of years, probably too many years ago to be worth anything

* Pet sitting for neighbors throughout 2015-2016 up until I moved away for college

* Freelance photography and digital photo editing throughout Fall 2017. Probably fewer than a dozen jobs total. Would like to do more of this work in the future but no clue how to advertise myself.

* Volunteer photographer for a local charity (three major events so far), Fall 2017-present

If you don’t care to read the entire backstory and could help me better by suggesting how to work this into a resume, this is a good place to stop reading because it’s going to get long and drawn-out. TL;DR is lack of transportation/no drivers license, on-and-off mental health struggles, and school commitments.

As for why I have these gaps, the biggest reason is because I didn’t and still do not have a car. Driving gives me terrible anxiety and I don’t trust myself behind the wheel or the people around me. I have Aspergers and am fairly well-adjusted otherwise to the point where you probably couldn’t even tell if you met me, but that’s the one area where I know I’m still several years behind the curve. I don’t see myself getting my license anytime in the near future. I am unable to even afford a car and continued gas/maintenance on my own right now even with assistance from family (which I do not want at this point in time due to already feeling like I depend on them way too much at my age financially to begin with and due to having a strained relationship to the family member who would most likely be providing the car). In high school this was a huge issue because I lived in a rural town where you had to drive 15+ miles to even get to most of the fast food restaurants and convenience stores where most people got their first jobs. I also had a very stressful family life at the time (bad enough to cause me to have panic attacks, which I had not experienced before or any time since) as well as a heavy course load, and may not have been able to healthily commit to much else even with transportation.

My first year of college started, and I fucked up and chose my college for all the wrong reasons. It was expensive, bad for my choice of major, location that was hard to travel back and forth from, and had tens of thousands of students which ironically became very isolating. My mental health suffered a lot here because I struggled to keep consistent friendships. I tried applying for on-campus jobs occasionally when they opened up, but never heard back from anywhere. There was a public transportation system that was very affordable for students that in hindsight I should have taken advantage of more often, but I was too afraid that it would be too inconsistent to get me to where I needed to go on time and had zero experience with public transportation to begin with. Honestly, besides focusing all of my energy into making good grades and making a tiny handful of close friendships that I still have today, this period of time was uneventful at best and hurt me more than it helped because now I have a huge gap where I may as well have watched TV with my hand down my pants for a year straight as far as resumes are concerned. I leave this school with plans to transfer to a smaller one the next year, go home for the summer, and still do not get a job because the parent I live with has their own work schedule that makes driving me to a job non-doable.

My second year of college starts. Overall, my situation is healthier if for no other reason than that I feel happy more days than I don’t, something I haven’t gotten to have in a while by this point. I am at a smaller school (small enough that most/all of the faculty in your major will know you by name) and have found a consistent friend group. I have changed majors to a field that is in the same ballpark as my first choice but with significantly better job prospects. I have gotten loosely involved with a volunteer community and help out at events from time to time. Best of all, I have gotten to move in with my long-distance SO of 4+ years. We live in a condo owned by the family member who is providing me financial assistance...here’s where it gets stressful though. We are meant to be paying rent, and the family member has been more than lenient knowing that I am not employed. My SO pays the utilities and still also relies on family to help pay rent, but he is employed and will likely be able to start contributing his full share very soon. He also drives me around most of the time (he does commission-based work and his schedule is flexible enough that he can pick his working hours; in the very rare case that he can’t take me somewhere, I get a rideshare). I feel immensely guilty that I have not been able to contribute in the same way. I do about 80% of the chores and contribute to buying groceries, household items, and gas for his vehicle when I am able to to try to make up for this, but the small amount of money in my bank account is running out and only seldom increases.

I have been applying to retail/restaurant jobs since September to no avail. Now, my school schedule is pretty busy as of this semester. Seven hours of classes Tues/Thurs often with late afternoon/evening lectures, often having to come in for several hours on Mon/Wednesday to work on projects/lab days, and the other three days often spent on outside-of-class projects, editing, studying, and taking care of outside responsibilities. I could probably rework my schedule if I really needed to, but it would give me two consistently completely free working days at most. Also for some reason (bad sleep habits? growingly convinced that this is a mental health and/or medical issue?) I feel completely drained after full class days, even though its collectively less time than I’ve been in classes at any other point in my life. This is really worrying to me, but class days would be out as far as working because I often collapse into a three hour nap after I get home. This, combined with the disheartening dozens of ghosted applications, has slowed the job search to where I’ve only applied for a couple in the past month or so. I have looked into online work but most of what I have found seems fishy at best and not worth the time/upstart investment.

I want to put an end to this. It is not socially acceptable to not have a job at my age. I feel that some of my peers secretly judge me heavily, especially since most work retail of similar and still manage to get everything done somehow. I’m tired of family members asking how the job search is going...if it were going well they probably would have heard by now. I’m tired of the disappointed tones and the occasional job listing sent as a well-meaning gesture that ends up feeling like a kick in the teeth. I’m tired of not contributing in living expenses and sharing the load. My SO has been nothing but supportive and caring while I try to work everything out and focus on school, but I worry that he’ll wake up out of the blue and grow tired of it at some point. I’m tired of not being able to have/do many of the things I wanted to at least be within my reach by this point in my life. I’m tired of not even having enough experience or value to be worth a damn interview at Chilis because who wants to teach a 20-year-old how to wait tables right? I feel ashamed because I know many people would read this and see a bunch of lazy excuses, but this is the only time I’ve put down the full story anywhere instead of hiding behind even shallower excuses so here it is. I just want to have it all together so badly, whether I pick myself back up by the bootstraps and keep job hunting, invest farther into the freelance work, or hold out until the summer when I’ll only have one class to take care of. This whole issue is crippling my self-esteem and I need a solution.",24Mar2018,6

107,"Hi, Reddit. I'm fifteen years old and a male. In September 2016, I began dating a... ""promiscuous"" girl. When my parents found out that I was dating her, they told me not to see her anymore because they had heard stories about her from other parents. Me, being a dumbass, continued to date her. In November of the same year, I was busted by my parents. They found extremely explicit text messages between me and her outlining ""things"" that we planned to do in the future.

For nine months, my phone was taken away. For seven of those months, my internet access was extremely limited to certain websites. My parents also pulled me out of the middle school I was going to after they learned I was doing this, since they didn't want me doing anything stupid while I was there.

The things that I was saying basically went straight against what my parents considered morally acceptable. Even though I still consider my punishment fairly drastic, I understand that they were just trying to protect me. However, I thought everything would be over after my punishment ended. It didn't.

My parents still do not trust me. They said that they will not be buying me a car and they are constantly keeping tabs on me. They also don't want me hanging out with girls, even in groups. I haven't done anything ""morally"" wrong since then, but they still continue to not trust me.

I really have learned from my mistakes and don't think I will ever do anything like that ever again. I've told them this but they don't seem to believe me, saying that they still believe I have poor judgement. Is there any way I am able to gain their trust back?

109,"I've been really close friends with a person for many years. One day, she offered to drive me to a mutual friend's house so we could hang out. During the time there, she didn't seem to have a lot of fun, and when she drove me back to my apartment, she suddenly got very angry and said I always took her for granted. She said she felt that everyone was always so dependent on her for money, car rides, and taking her time. However, I definitely feel it was wrong for her to accuse me of these things. 
It's true that she drives me around often, but I don't always ask her to drive. In reality, more often than not, she is the one that offers me rides without me asking, and last night she was really upset when I asked her to bring me back to my dorm. After all, if you're offering to drive someone to a place, then shouldn't you be willing to drive the person back as well? 
The money thing is the next issue. Her parents give her free reign to do as she pleases most of the time, which is quite contradictory to how my parents are. Coming from a very strict Indian household, my parents don't let me get a license because of driving insurance, and I only work in the summer since I am expected to be a diligent student during the school year, I only have so much spending money, while my friend foregoes college to work full time. Therefore, when we buy food for hangouts or celebrations,  she will lavishly spend more money than I can afford, so she always contributes more. This also explains why she gets upset when I tell her I can’t always afford to eat at restaurants that cost $15 dollars per meal since I have under $750 in spending money for everything during my entire college year.
During the car ride, I told her that I was sorry for making her feel like she was being taken for granted, and apologized profusely. I then tried as politely as possible to explain to her that if you’re always offering me car rides without me needing to ask consistently for many years, then it would be expected that you would drive me back to my home afterwards and that I can’t help but assume that you don’t mind doing it, since you’ve never voiced how it was inconvenient. I also explained that I can’t afford to contribute as much during hangouts because her income is over 10 times more than mine. I told her that I didn’t want to accidentally hurt her feelings anymore, so if she felt pressured to drive me, then next time she shouldn’t offer it at all. 
Then she kicked me out of her car and I walked back to my apartment.
She’s had a long history of drug abuse, an irresponsible mother, and overall just a lack of discipline throughout her life. She also suffers from a very mild form of mental retardation, so not all logic is applicable to her.
Reddit, I understand where her anger was coming from but was it unjustified of her, and where my points valid? I really value this friend and want a way to get her back without further hurting her feelings.

110,"This is a long ass story so I'm won't go into every detail but basically... I was with a group of friends, we got into the conversation about sex and losing our virginities. I was the only one that was still a virgin. I explain to them my reasonings and they told me that my reasons are dumb and that I should get it over with and have sex because I'm going to regret never explore other partners, I am never going to find a guy that is a virgin or is willing to wait until marriage, I will get a divorced and I will always be slut-shamed because I'm a girl. I cried my fuckin eyes out when I got home and now I'm left confused and hopeless. If you're curious to know what I told them, here's the story:

I grew up in a somewhat religious and conservative household but I don't consider myself religious. I'm somewhat both liberal and conservative. My reasons for saving my V-card is 1. I don't see sex as something that is a extremely important in a relationship. I would want a relationship/marriage to be more of a emotional bond and loving and accepting each other no matter our flaws. I see it as ""Hey, no matter how good or bad our sex skills are, I still love you and we can work it out together."" I wouldn't say I'm asexual, in fact I have a pretty average to high sex drive, but I'm not the type of person that has causal hook-ups or one night stands. I legitimately am looking for a serious relationship. 2. I had somewhat of a ""traumatic"" sexual experience that I have encountered. I should say that I have autism and suffer from depression and anxiety, it may not be a good excuse for my actions but I thought I should point that out. I won't go into detail but basically I've been taken advantage of a few times by a couple of guys in the past because I kept believe that they liked me or that I would try to change their mind, knowing that they were trying to take advantage of me. I have done some sexual stuff with them but I never done oral or anal sex with them. After the last guy, my friend called me out for not being pure and calling me a slut after I would brag about the experience to make me look cool or try to own up to it, but he wasn't buying it. I felt like shit after what he said. I literally felt no guy would want me and that I was only ever good as a sex object.

I don't know what to do now or how I even feel at this point. Are they right? Should I just face reality and realize my reasonings are unrealistic? Or should I still hold to my believe on remaining a virgin until marriage?",24Mar2018,19
112,"Hey guys. My girlfriends in a bit of a predicament with a puppy she just got nearly over 2 days ago. The puppy is cute, fun and playful and all but the main problem here is with her older dog.

Her older dog does not like the new puppy one bit, I told her that this is expected because you're bringing a new puppy into another dogs domain, their territory. I told her to take them for walks and go to a park so they can get a feel for each other. I also told her that puppies don't really know what they're doing and that it takes time for them to finally get a feel for each other but my girlfriend told me that her older dog is getting upset, is depressed and stressed out and from what she's told me, her dog HATES the puppy.

I don't know really what else to do but tell her to take them out for walks and give them both time but I don't know the whole mental aspect with dogs finding out a new puppy being brought home. Her older dog is 1 year old and this puppy is around i'd say 1-2 months old.

She told me she's considering giving it away and I told her not to but she said that her older dog just genuinely doesn't like the puppy and would prefer the pup to be given away but I reckon her older dog is being a little bit of a whinge.

How can i help her resolve the matter? (obviously given that she gives time).

I've done some research and some of it added up, with some of the behavior of the old dog I suppose the older dog is trying to ""correct"" the puppy's behavior but I don't really know.",24Mar2018,8

This is all while I see my friends get drunk and party at university, seemingly being completely happy and content with their lives. I’m not into drinking or smoking weed which I feel dooms me as far as being social and I have a hard time relaxing and just having fun. 


I have no girlfriend/ haven’t been kissed which worries me because I feel like the older I get the weirder this will become and I’ll just die a virgin.

I don’t really have many hobbies and interests outside of video games and music so I’m not interesting either. I feel as if these thoughts have gotten significantly worse recently and I feel as if my motivation I once had before is going away along with my sleep.

116,"15 years ago (when I was 14), I tried to convince my 3 year old sister to fellate me. 

We had been alone in a bathroom, and all I can remember of my motives is that I had wanted to know how it felt. I hadn’t followed through, but only because she’d turned her head away from...”me”...at the last second, and that had made me realize that I was  forcing her to do something against her will, and I hadn’t liked it (consent or not, I’m still a piece of shit for trying). 

I could live with myself if I’d stopped sooner, completely on my own. I didn’t know I could hurt her; I didn’t know how sick what I was doing was. I don’t remember how aware I was of the consequences...I just remember thinking that if no one found out, it wouldn’t matter. I was wrong; it did eventually matter...to me; I was 18 when the memory “resurfaced” and started haunting me, I can’t even describe the repulsion and horror; I couldn’t believe what I’d tried to do; even though I’d always had the memory, it just suddenly mattered to me...so fucking much. 

I couldn’t take it, and confessed to my mother when I was 19 that when I was 14, I’d tried to do something “very inappropriate” with my sister. She hadn’t asked for details; she said to just let it go since my sister didn’t remember and I’d only been a kid, but I couldn’t, and have never been able to. I told my mother that when my sister turned 18, I would tell my sister what I’d tried to do, and let her decide what I should do, or rather, what should be done with me; my mother told me that wasn’t necessary, but I was adamant. 

My sister turned 18 four days ago; it’s time. I’ve been careful to not get involved in any serious relationships thus far, and have grad school finished, so there’s nothing stopping me from coming forward except my mother.

I leave work at 4:20PM and get home around 6:10PM. then I run off to my dad's workplace to help him with his computer and some paperwork. Long story short, I get home around 7:30 and after dinner and all, I get to my bedroom around 8:30. 

I also help my dad full day on Saturday and on Sunday, I do some of the other chores and shopping and some religious things. 

Now the problem is that I don't have any time to do additional code because at the end of the day, I am exhausted from running and doing shit I don't enjoy. Is there something that I am doing incorrectly or something that I should be looking out for?

**Me** (Dec 23, 2017): Sure, I'll send it this week. 

---

[I send rent for January, it goes through fine. Now comes time to send February rent.] 

---

**Me** (Feb 1, 2018): There was an issue with sending the rent today. The post saw me put the money in the Einschreiben and refused to send it. They said that money must be sent via a secure Express mailing for 11,90€ and there is a 500€ per day limit. Therefore I sent 500€ today this way. I see three options going forward: 1. I can send (585-500-11.90(2))= 61,20 EUR tomorrow and repeat this each month hereafter. 2. I can send 500 tomorrow and (585(2)-500(2)-11.90(3)) = 134.3 EUR next time, and alternate this schedule every other month. (Takes 3 Express posts instead of 4.) 3. We can figure out some other way. For example, I could perhaps send 500 EUR by Express and then (585-500-11.90)= 73.1 EUR through bank transfer. What do you think?

**Him** (Feb 1, 2018): i would not over-formalize these issues. Why don ´t you just send the money without that see it:) The problem is that the insurance covers a 500€ max, however, Einschreiben is very safe. If a letter would hence not arrive, the would only reimburse 500€ and i can take the risk for the rest. Does that work for you?

**Me** (Feb 4, 2018): OK. I will send the remainder as well as next month's rent (total 655 EUR) via Einschreiben tomorrow. 

**Him** (Feb 16, 2018): what did you send in the latest letter? It seems that i got lost, you wer sending the reigning 85€?

**Me** (Feb 16, 2018): Yes, I sent the remaining 85 EUR + next month's rent early so that I would save one trip. I hope that's OK. The next time I will send is April 1. (...assuming I got the amount right? I meant to send 585*2-500 - costs of sending. If I got the calculation wrong, please tell me!) 

**Him** (Feb 16, 2018): shit, it seems that this letter has been lost.
Could you give me the tracking number please? I received a letter to pick that letter up but it has not been stored correctly at the post office, they can not find it. Also, now I understood that if you do the Einschreiben for + 1,8€, you can send until 500 € at once, that’s what you explained me last time i think. 

**Me** (Feb 16, 2018): Oh, that's not good. The number is (redacted). The Einschreiben does not guarantee ANY money. There is a different secure post that costs 11,90 EUR which secures up to 500 EUR. 

**Him** (Feb 16, 2018): and i thought that’s what you are sending now, i said i take the risk for the remaining money (if it is over 500€).  

**Him** (Feb 19, 2018): This is a problem indeed. And i thought we agreed that you send the letter that insurances until 500€ (as you did last time), i said i will take the remming risk for the 85€. I just checked the letter you sent now, normal Einschreiben, has only an insurance until 100€.

**Me** (Feb 19, 2018): This was not my understanding. My email to you explained that the Einschreiben I tried to send was refused because it contained money. I explained that Einschreiben does not secure money, and that secure Express mailing must be used to send money. I asked you whether I should send the money using secure Express mailing, and you said that I should send Einschreiben anyway ""without them seeing"" because ""Einschreiben is very safe"" and that you would take the risk for it. I sent you an email confirming my specific understanding afterwards. 

**Me** (Mar 1, 2018): I have called the post. They said they tried to deliver it to your apartment and no one received it, so they left a slip, and no one picked it up from the post. They asked what the contents of the package were. I told them it contains money and they asked how much. I told them 670 EUR. They repeated that money is not allowed to be sent by Einschreiben. They are starting an investigation. 

**Him** (Mar 1): I looked though our mails again, there seem to be 2 principal missundertsanndings: 1- you wrote me that only the “express form” cover insurance until max 500€, and i said i will take the risk for everything above, i.e. the 85€. I wanted to say that i will pay this more expensive letter form of course and that we should do it from now on, instead of the normal “einschreiben"", this is clear from our email conversation. (this is also new, before you could send whatever you want, but the einschreiben insurance became more expensive). 2. i am also wondering why you sent the rent in advance for march, you wanted to save costs? Or why did you send it advance? Lets hope it works out.

**Me** (Mar 1, 2018): You did not say that. You said to not ""over-formalize"" the issue and to use Einschreiben without letting them see the money after I clearly explained that Einschreiben does not allow money to be sent. You told me that Einschreiben does come with some money guarantee and that you would take the risk for the excess. I wrote back confirming my understanding---that I would send the remainder plus next month's rent using Einschreiben, not secure post---and gave you 24 hours notice before I took action. 

**Him** (Mar 8, 2018): just as un update: i received a letter from Deutsche Post, where i had to confirm that the letter never arrived.

**Him** (Mar 23, 2018): If we assume the worst case, the bette mis stolen and nothing is refunded, what would be your suggestion to manage this situation? 

**Me** (Mar 24, 2018): If the investigation gives back any money, then I will of course send it to you. Otherwise, I don't think there's more that I can do. While it is really a shame if the money is lost, I do not see that I am at fault for it. 

**Him** (Mar 24, 2018): Please look at it from a legal point: the contract  tells you to pay rent from the 1st of the month, not in advance. I wrote that i take risks for everything above 500€, that is, the remaining 85€ and for sure it was a miss-understanding which service to use. Hence, I would find it fair to share the costs as we both obviously have contributed (In the letter you sent were 670€, right?).

I don't know my rights here, and I don't know if I should stay firm or just pay half of 670 EUR (not a small amount of money, but not devastating) to make this situation go away. What should I do? ",24Mar2018,1
124,"I am stuck in a situation. My parents want to hold an 18th birthday for me later this year, but there is of course a problem. Being the only 18th of my life time, i want to invite the many people that made an impact on my life. There's quite a load of people... roughly 16 possible friends. I know them quite well and we used to have great times together. But a load of things have happened and friendships have broke apart. I as one don't really care about the drama, but being apart of the two groups, i want celebrate equally amongst both parties. Now. Roughly 14 of them is okay of seeing each other, but i'm sure that the 15th and 16th are not. Lets call the 15th as person ""a"" and 16th as person ""b"". 

Person ""A"" disconnected from our group because apparently person ""b"" was talking smack about person ""A"". Person b didn't know that something little could have triggered person ""a"" and is hurtful of the mean comments person ""a"" himself has been spreading about person ""b"" after he left (i think he is still continuing or hasn't truly given up although he said so to me). Neither person knows the other side well and the others perspective better than me.  

Person ""B"" says that if i was to invite person ""A"", he wouldn't want to go because that would just ruin the mood of the party.
Person ""A"" would go no doubt just for me and only for me. 
Thing is, the other 14 people of the group are still curious as of why person ""A"" left the group. Im sure if person ""A"" had to talk about his perspective, it would only be filled with his biased opinions of person ""b"" and i myself can't tolerate anymore drama especially on my birthday. 

I have many options:

-Don't invite both of them (This could result in a butt hurt person ""a"" as his friend is also coming to the party)

-Invite the two (Awkward a bunch)

-Invite person b only (Person ""a"" would be even more butt hurt as if im siding with person ""b"")

-Invite person a (The party would still be slightly weird and feel off, and i feel sad for neglecting person ""B"")

I feel more connected to person ""b"" than person ""a"" only because due to persons ""a's"" ways of doing things is very selfish. And i can't relate myself with his ways. I don't like persons ""A's"" guts. And person ""A"" isn't aware of my thoughts. ",24Mar2018,2

128,"Hey people.

So I'm a 25 year old male. Something weird just happened, and I know what to make of what I did or what I should do next. 

I was sitting in a cafe when a guy approached me (I'm guessing 20-25 years old). He asked if he could sit down at my table, and I said go ahead. He blurted out ""I'm looking for friends"". That took me off guard, so I continued talking with him. I asked if he had any interest, was studying or working. He liked music but he has no education or work.


He said that he had no place to live or take showers. I was dumb founded. So he asked if he could borrow some of my clothes and take a shower at my home. I said that I would rather buy him some clothes, and he became so happy. We went and bought some clothes for 130 USD. Afterwards I gave him some change for showers. 


We talked some more, and I asked about his family, friends and where he grew up. He said that he had no contact with his family or friends. I asked if he had social media, but he said that he deleted it as he didn't like it. So we exchanged phone numbers, to which he said he could give me his name. But he didn't want to give his full name because that reminds him of his father. He said that he needed a job so he didn't have to ask people for money, and I said that I could perhaps hook him up with a job at my workplace (it's manual labor work that anyone could do).


Finally I agreed to meet him tomorrow and drink a beer with him at a bar. 


I'm feeling a bit uneasy about this, as I have never done anything like this and I don't know why I did all of this. What is your advice? ",24Mar2018,3

131,"Backstory : I've known this girl for over a year and a half , but we've never really talked until last Christmas break , we had few friends in common and we got to know each other during a party , we fooled around for most of the night (given we were both pretty drunk , we didn't do anything..""innapropriate"" lets say it like that).

I told myself the other day the I would invite her on a date , because recently we started talking more and I really enjoy spending time with her , that day I didn't managed to invite her , I wanted to do it in person but was so nervous.

The next day , I messaged her directly on Facebook to invite her to a place she mentioned she'd like to go (I tough that messaging her directly would imply the ""date"" type of hangout). We usually go out with a bunch of friends , and I dont know if she understood that it wasn't what I had in mind. She's too busy with school this week so , I told her , lets talk about it in two week and she agreed.

Now , I'm not sure how I should get back to her , she hasn't mention our friends in her replies so I really dont know what to think of it. I dont know how to ask if she understood what I had in mind. Without making it awkward if that makes sens.

132,"Me and some of my closest friends were heading out to a party last night with some others that one of my friends knew. When we got there we started playing this drinking game and the next thing you know I’m in this girls room with no clothes on.

I know nothing about this girl because this was only the second time I’ve ever seen here. I kind of went with it (it was hard not to because I’m a lightweight and I get drunk very easily) and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m not the type of guy to sleep with random women but the worst thing about all of this is that I found out later that night that this girl has been head over heals about me ever since we met the first time. 

I don’t think I like her like that and it’s crushing me that I might have to break her heart.  I don’t know how to handle this situation because I’ve never been in it before. It’s all fucked and I wish it didn’t happen the way it did. I’m going to see her tomorrow (Sunday) and I don’t know what I’m going to say. I need answers because this is killing me.

135,"Before dating my GF I wasn't a very social outgoing person. I was mostly a house guy playing games and going out with male friends eat to eat only then just to go back home again to play games. Im not a party person i dislike those stuff nor like drinking every Saturday night with the boys. So now that im dating we're almost nearing our 1 year anniversary (both 19) I done my best as going to bowling together, eating a nice dinner together. Having double dates with our friends and so on. But after a great night when we both done our date we crash at my place. Sit some hours at me and that's the end of our day. We try to see each other every weekend once or two.  

My GF complains that this has become very repetitive. Doing step 1 and 2 rinse repeat which she got bored of. I suggest why don't we hit up a cafe after a dinner?  She object's that im not hungry don't want to eat more. So no to that. Let's go to the movies I say and she objects again I don't like American movies they look boring. She's not good with English but the theater is nice to offer subtitles. But if it's a girls night oh boy she do all the above mentioned without any problems. But I can kinda understand it's her best friends and girls night. It's special for her

Anyway im just out of ideas to do. It's March but still freezing here in Sweden. If summer is here I have plenty more ideas to do but at this time of day its cold and freezing a nice walk outside is not possible. What can I do to spice up my date?

136,"6 months ago i dated a guy who i fell for pretty hard. to cut a long, dreadful story short, he raped me. it wasn’t the terrible, violent, back street alley kind. but it completely fucked up my trust, he betrayed me and my love for him and that hurt me in ways that are unexplainable.

i came to terms with it but ever since then, i’ve been extremely cynical. i’m the kind of girl who puts on an attitude that nothing hurts me, i’m completely unaffected by everyone and everything, and that i’m a soulless badass. a couple months back i started talking to a guy who does, and is the same. he figured me out fast, said he sees right through me; and from what i heard, he does. i have really fallen for him.

the thing is, our relationship started based on lust; not anything soft or easygoing. it started with lust and is sort of HEADING in the softer direction after we discovered this could be more than sex but... 
from what we’ve been doing, i actually discovered i may not be ready for sex again. 

basically i can’t get it out of my head, i feel like i have a huge burden and if i tell my so, he won’t think of me the same at all. we’re both pretty kinky people too, and i worry he might think im weird for liking that after going through a rape (even though i did beforehand) and things like that. i haven’t had sex since ‘the incident’ and i always envisioned that out of self care and self respect, i would let the guy know what had happened to me and ask it to be slow and careful for my first time again. but now i feel like i’m in so deep, the two of us sleeping together is going to happen any day now; and our relationship is JUST starting out, so i feel like this is too much too tell him so soon. i just don’t know what to do. someone please help..

139,"I work for a international electronics manufacturer as a technician testing and repairing electronics.

As part of this process I fill out documentation which is sent overseas to the corporate headquarters, and from my understanding part of the revenue of my facility is derived from this reporting of testing and repair, though the actual billing etc has nothing to do with me.  I simply maintain the documentation which is sent overseas weekly.  


Recently because of corporate pressure a lot of things changed regarding this documentation and how I fill it out.

  Effectively my job hinges on ""accurately reporting repair processes to the home office"" but after getting in trouble several times for doing a factual reporting of work, which I has been doing in the same fashion for months, I am now in a position where  I effectively misrepresent my work (essentially saying good products are not only bad, but received repairs) very frequently, with some entire days spent doing false work.

I do not know if this was designed intentionally by management, though I do not think so, so our facility gets paid for work it has not done, or is more an accidental result of rapidly redesigning processes to make corporate happy, either way it bothers me to lie so much during my work day.

I have a few coworkers that do the same job as me and have questioned them about this, even warned them, because if corporate comes for an inspection they will notice this.   To no avail.

I am thinking about going higher up the food chain with this but it will almost undoubtedly cost me my job and small reputation in the company.  What should I do?

I am currently on thin ice with management already for my ""mistakes"" (accurately reporting repairs and tests as trained by corporate) as I believe they shine a negative light on our overall process.",24Mar2018,2

We visit him most days and call him everyday, but when we don't he goes to bed at 8pm because he is bored and it's making my mum feel awful. So we're desperately trying to think of ways to keep him happy and busy, particularly by introducing him to his iPad.

He is not exactly technology savvy, when I was 10 my grandparents took a PC class at a public library and found it far too confusing to every try again, but they have an old iPad. We're setting him up with Skype so he can call us, and I've already wrote for him a brief explanation of how to use Google, but beyond that I want to know what other suggestions any of you guys have to keep a 80 year old man busy and entertained. I'd love some good podcast suggestions I can subscribe him to, good YouTube channels, even suggestions of other apps or things that will get him out and about.

For more context: He's a retired Accountant, former Accounting lecturer and was previously in the RAF. He's interested in history, particularly Scottish history. He likes older music, but always said my grandma was more the music one and he just listened because she did. He's a very intelligent man, and we've already been getting him some puzzles to do. I've also been thinking about books and audio books. He says he has no interest in TV anymore, but I think it's just because the shows aren't what he likes. He spent the last year caring for my grandma and I think he's a little lost without her. I'm concerned anything too technological is going to get him lost and put off, but I'm going to see him this evening so we'll see how he copes with the basics of YouTube tonight.

Thank you for your time! Any suggestions of apps/specific podcasts/specific YouTubers/anything is appreciated.

The vast majority of my close friends who I've all known for a couple of years now rarely ask me to hangout anymore. I know they don't actively dislike me because we sometimes get together when I ask, but I'm the friend that never gets invited to anything. I'll get snapchats of them all hanging out or see photos of them together on social media. I only have one actual friend but he lives in Queensland (forgot to mention that I'm Australian).

I don't lack in social skills and I'm well groomed/dress fairly well. I just feel like I'm being forgotten about. I've tried confronting them about it but they brush me off and act like I'm just trying to start an argument. I'm not. I just want my friends to care about me as much as I care about them.

150,"I've had minor episodes of insomnia in the past, but difficulty sleeping and what I'm experiencing now are two entirely different demons. So, about six months ago I started having issues sleeping. It stopped after about 2 months, but it's started again. Basically I wake up every ~90 minutes drenched in sweat, like an ungodly amount, where I can't even believe my body contained that much water. This means every 90 minutes I wake up, soak up as much sweat as I can with a towel, and change sheets/blankets. I'm literally washing 4 bed sets every day and my apartment oozes BO. I come home exhausted, go straight to bed and repeat.   
   
It's exhausting, but seeing a professional is almost completely out of the option. Besides being unaffordable, my peers/superiors would know I visited a professional, and while I wouldn't be required to tell them why, it creates a really bad situation for me whether I do or not.    
    
From the googling I've done, the causes range from stress to cancer, and everything in between. If it's something that may pass in the short term, seeing someone about it could be more reasonable in the long term, but just the volume and frequency of the... Issue had me a little worried.

151,"Not sure how well I’m going to do in my A-level exams, but my post-sixth form plan is to attend the local college and get a new A-level relevant to what I want to do.

The course I want to take at the college only wants certain GCSE results, which I have already achieved. However, the application form requires all achieved and expected grades.

I feel like dropping out of sixth form and leaving it off the form so they have my GCSEs and nothing else. Would this be okay, or would they show special interest to someone with advanced education (albeit not good grades in that advanced education)? 

Many people drop out of sixth form to take a new A-level there, but none this close to exams. ",24Mar2018,3
152,"So there is this girl I like, and, starting in early December, we talked basically every day, first in person, then on text. I actually asked her out without actually doing it, by asking her to see Jumanji with me, but not saying it was a date. Her parents are very protective, however, so she said she couldn't, and I verified the story with her friends. Then, on Valentine's day, I didn't get her any chocolates (actually, I did, but her friends were there so I was too scared to give it to her). The next friday, she texts me that she doesn't want to text me anymore, and I take it as saying she doesn't like me. we ignore each other for a good 3 weeks, but we glance at each other every so often. Then, last week, she flirts with me on monday and tuesday. When I try to talk to her Wednesday and Thursday, she doesn't respond, and seems generally angry. I'm worried, not just for me, but for her.

Option A: 55k a year job with a telecommunication company. Very much an office job with some field work. 

Pros

Lots of money = stability...
Potential for upward mobility...
Learning new thing and getting challenged...
Can relocate in any of the 50 states after a year...
Professional growth...

Cons

Have to be in a place that I hate longer...
Cubicle farm life sounds like hell to me...

 Option B: moving to new state with family and going to school

Pros

Putting away money for future and school...
New place, new experiences, new people...
Getting out of state I'm in that I hate faster...
Live rent free for a while...
Time to think about next move...

Cons

Moving back in with family feels like step backwards...

157,"Hey all! I am in absolute anxious mental turmoil by my ex right now. He accidentally responded to a text I sent when like super drunk and I honestly was fine with him not responding. We broke up 2mo ago, almost 3 now, and he didn't ever try to contact me or anything, starting dating really quick after, yadda yadda. 

Well cue his accidentally text and talking to me for two days after. Simultaneously cue the worst panic attack days of my whole life. Like shaking, incapable or eating or going to class or sleeping, or spending an hour without just suddenly crying because I had nothing to do with my anxiety. Working out didn't work either like it normally does. I've started drinking just to sleep. 

I've got a date tonight and I'm looking forward to meeting this guy, but I can't stop feeling anxious or like I'm betraying something. I mean it's obvious the ex doesn't care that he's been causing me intense pain (he knows about my anxiety). So why can't I stop being angry or sad about it? I don't want to have to drink myself to sleep anymore worrying about maybe just maybe he will respond to how he has made me feel.

I mean this was a guy I thought I was going to marry and have a family with. But the break down in communication before I broke up with him just made it hard to even think we would have a future where I didn't feel alone and wholly responsible for the whole household.

158,"I recently connected with a girl I went to high school with.  We weren't really friends back then, just knew of each other.  So far I've only communicated with her via Snapchat.  I found out she smoked weed and tried to get her to buy some for me.  I later asked her if she ever ended up getting any and she told me she moved on to something stronger.  She was hesitant to tell me that it was ""ice"", she did not want me to ""judge tf"" out of her.  So I began asking here some questions about how she got into it.  Trying to understand the severity of the situation.  I think this just started, she was tricked into thinking it was coke and snorted it.  Since then she's also smoked it.  I don't want it to get out of hand, but with meth, it does not take much for it to get out of hand.  

I found all of this out last night.  I tried to set up a meeting so I can talk to her in person about this.  But she just kind of ignores my attempts to meet up.  

It would break my heart to see her go down a road like that and never come back.  I want to do something to help her, but I want to go about doing it the right way.  I don't want her to get defensive and spiral out of control.  I thought about informing her mom and letting her deal with it, but I don't think that will work either.

I was nearing my limit and planning to leave when she got arrested for minor possession.

The second day she was in jail she called and told me she hated me and everything was my fault and she wanted me gone when she got out. Then the third day she called and demands that I pay her bail and get her out (she also called her mom and father demanding the same thing, and she has been treating them terrible for over a year). I can't afford to pay her bail (5,000 total) and even if I got a bail-bondsmen and only paid 10% she has a history of not going to court dates, or court mandated things like anger management.

Then she calls yesterday and apologized for all the horrible stuff she has been saying to me and everyone and swears she will never do meth or any drugs ever again and begged me not to leave and to please come bring her home.

179,"Me, my mother and my stepdad live together in a small town in Norway. I become eighteen in June, and I go to a school a few minutes away; I plan to move out of town next summer for further education. My parents have been divorced since 2005, and I started living fulltime with my mom after we bought a new house with my stepdad. We can call him Marcus, for the sake of anonymity. 

We moved together in early 2016, and a few months later Marcus’ then 26-year-old son, Sam (again, made up name) moved in with us temporarily, because of financial issues. He and his girlfriend had just split, and he had to save up money for a lawyer because of right issues surrounding their newborn daughter. I only met Sam’s girlfriend a few times, but I know she had some mental problems and that she was exaggerating things and lying about Sam being incapable of taking care of their daughter.

Sam stayed with us in a small guest room and was incredibly inconsiderate during the time he spent here. He would come and go whenever he liked, without ever saying where he was going. Often, he would stay in his room for ten hours, then walk out of the door when everyone else was getting ready for bed, say goodbye, and take his car to God knows where. He also often ate dinner in his room by himself; I know my mom felt like she was hosting a hotel (he didn’t pay rent or anything similar, as far as I’m aware.)

Then, one glorious day, he moved out and bought himself an apartment. He was supposed to stay with us only till somewhere around Christmas 2016, but he ended up moving out sometime during the summer of 2017 instead. Since then I haven’t really paid much attention to Sam, but now, all of the sudden, he seems to be moving back. I think he has sorted the legal stuff about his daughter because they often come to visit. I genuinely don’t know why he is moving back this time, though, I'd guess it is because of not being able to afford the rent.

I have overheard my mom and Marcus discuss Sam moving back in, and I know she is against it. She has said it to me and to Marcus. She thinks Sam is a grown man who shouldn’t move in with his parents whenever there is a problem. Plus, here in Norway, we have some system (I’m not old enough to know much details) that helps you out if you’re in financial problems, so you don’t have to move back in with your parents whenever you're in trouble. Despite these arguments and objections, it still seems like Sam is moving in. He visited us a few hours ago to plan out his new room, that Marcus is going to build for him, right next to mine. It seems like a big project, “put up a wall here” and “paint the staircase like this”, etc.

I am afraid my mom is scared to put her foot down, because of Marcus’ attempts to move out in the past. He is a typical handy manly-man who doesn’t talk much about his feelings, so when it finallly happens it usually ends up being dramatic. The reasons for why he has wanted to move out are not really related, but they have been minor from what I understand. I often talk to my mom about these sorts of things. I try to help her if she needs someone to talk to, be supportive and all that.

I am not completely sure if Sam is moving in because my mom is not being clear enough, or if it’s that Marcus is ignoring her. It’s clear he knows she doesn’t support it, at least.

I also want to add that Marcus is a very nice, fun person that I don’t want my mother to lose. They are a great couple, they just need some coordination, I guess.

I don’t care that much if Sam moves back in, to be honest. But I don’t want him to move in if it makes my mom unhappy, what should I do? What should my mom do?

181,"So there's a coworker I've had a crush one for quite some time now. Recently she started talking to me when she'd see me, so I started talking to her and even managed to get her to hang out with me. When we hung out yesterday, I took us to one of my favorite places, it's a nice little area not far from the city that I can get away from everyone at. We both like anime so I put anime on my tablet and we were just watching anime in my truck. My truck is a rather old truck being a 1956, so it has a bench seat in it. While I had anime on I tried to sneak over slowly but surely close to her. When I finally got to her I put my arm around her and she immediately reciprocated by putting her arm around me. We kept this position until the episode ended. Then before I could put on another episode, she started making out with me, put her tounge in my mouth, and started to take her shirt off.

When she started taking her shirt off, I stopped her there. I knew what was trying to happen but I was soft as could be and I knew I wasn't going to get it up if I hadn't by this point. her initial response was ""WTF is your problem"". However she calmed down as soon as I told her I'm a virgin. She asked me why I tried to get close if I didn't want sex, I then explained I wanted her to be my girlfriend and that I did want to lose my virginity to her, I just wasn't expecting it so soon and the shock made me nervous. To that she said she wanted to date me as well, and that she would take my virginity in a better setting. We cuddled the rest of the time we were together and kissed more as I dropped her off.

Why was I scared? A lot of it was the shock of not expecting that like I said to her. I've only dated one girl in my entire life before, and during that 6 months I was with her we never even made out let alone have sex. So her making a move like that the first time we see eachother outside of work was a bit much for me process. THat part I think I'll be better with next time.

However I was really scared about my performance too. All I have to base any sexual knowlege on is what other people have to say and porn. Since I'm on a throwaway I can admit I've used pornagraphy in the past. There's two things that terrify me. the first is size. I look at the size of mine and the size of dudes in those porn videos I used to watch and notice how mine looks like a baby in comparison. I had a legitimate fear she was going to laugh at me if I dropped my pants, mines like 6 inches at the very best. I've also been in some ackward conversations with some of my guy friends, they all claim to have dicks of 10 inches or longer, so I worry if my size is up to par. I also worry if I'll last long enough. You see those porn videos which are 20 minutes+ and when I would jerk to it I would last 5 minutes at best. So i'm scared I'm going to dissapoint her and then she wont like me anymore. I know its rediculous cause I know she will be dissapointed if I don't sleep wither her at all.

Now that she's not here for a couple of days, I'm really seeing how my life would be without her. I'm 26 and currently unemployed. I have a couple of friends I could ring to and have a chat with, but I don't really feel to talk with anybody.

I live in London, but I'm actually from Italy, so my entire family is not here either. I feel so lonely and I don't know what to do. I'm also really introverted and for me it's hard to make real friends.

I also live in an apartment with my girlfriend, so since she's not here right now, there's really no one I can talk to around the house. I've went to Hyde Park just to have a walk, stay outside and play with the squirrels but that didn't help that much.

I honestly have no idea what career to go into that would make me a decent amount of money (Im not expecting to be a millionaire, im not that naive) and not make me hate my life at the same time. I live in Michigan and would prefer not to go out of state for any colleges (Prices are horrible oml). 
My problem? I'm the type of person who really needs stuff planned out/researched before I jump into it. I'm graduating next year and will soon be an adult. And yet I know nothing of the real world. I know nothing about living. Not surviving, *living*. I have no idea how to talk to people. What am I supposed to do at parties? Should I even go? I'm hoping to get a job soon and dont know what to expect. How would I handle my disease in that environment? Would it be a negative thing that I may have to take breaks in order to not die? How many hours can a 16 year old homeschooled girl work? Can I work 2 jobs in the summer? What about financials? I dont want to make stupid decisions early and suffer the rest of my life. I only have one life and dont want to spend it drowning in debt. 
So I guess what I'm really doing is reaching out to you, stranger, for stuff you would have wanted to know when you were my age. Things you wished you would have realized. Do I wait a few years for college or dive in? University or community? Do people really care about my acne? Please, just anything you can think of. And if you can give my advice on my current living, so be it. I'd rather have cold, cruel advice than silence. 
Thank you so much for your time, I sincerely hope I didn't waste it &lt;3",24Mar2018,2
199,"Okay, first of all, my boyfriend is an incredibly supportive and wonderful human being. He has supported me through the worst times of my life, encouraged me to apply and go to college, and continues to root for me in whatever I do. He encourages me to go to therapy for past traumas and does everything he can to make sure I'm a happy, well-adjusted person. 

Last night, we kind of had a small issue. He came over after going out drinking with some friends. He made a couple advances and I brushed them off and told him no, I wasn't in the mood and I didn't want to tonight. Usually I like it when he's persistent and rough but I really just wasn't feeling it. He kept kissing my neck and tugging on my underwear and eventually it led to me bent over my bed and he fucked me until he finished. 

It felt good and I physically enjoyed it, but I just really didn't want to. I think afterwards he could tell something was wrong and pried and pried because he was scared. The next four hours, we spent the whole time talking about what I didn't like and how it had made me feel. I think the majority of it, I was comforting him because he was terrified he had ruined our relationship by being a little too aggressive. 

The big thing here is that I have been sexually assaulted in the past so I think I was just very sensitive to the fact that I wasn't really in the mood. Something just felt off and I think I started projecting feelings I've had with abusers before onto him. 

It's the next day and I really don't know how to feel. I keep thinking about it over and over. I love him more than anything and I genuinely believe he'd do anything for me. I really think he just fucked up last night. There has been no other moment, EVER, in our relationship that I have felt my feelings were ignored or taken advantage of. I think we have an incredibly healthy relationship. I'm scared I'm going to ruin it because I'm drudging up past experiences and seeing him in a way that I shouldn't. He's just my safe space and he has been for a long time now. I feel like last night really freaked me out. I want to forget it happened and move on in our relationship.

I'm not really sure what advice I'm asking for. I just don't know what to do right now. We talked about it for hours and hours last night. It was so productive and he knows what the issue was and he feels guilty and in pain and just wants to make it up to me in any way possible. He's so scared that we won't be normal and I'm really scared of that too. 

I don't know. I just need help. ",24Mar2018,2
200,"I’m in a serious relationship with someone of a different religion, and while we both consider ourselves Christians, our religions are very different, even partly contradictory. This is the only real hitch in our relationship. We haven’t had any arguments about it yet, but there have been serious discussions. Neither of us plan on attending church very regularly in the future, but I’m worried about how having different beliefs will affect our relationship (and possible marriage).

201,"So, last night I got really drunk with some co-workers. I get pretty awkward and anxious, so sometimes I find I drink alot more than I should, quicker than I should, because I can't do socialising well. Couple that with stupid pig-headed macho projection that I can mix drinks and go from whisky to cider to beer to whisky, and you have a drunken dude.

Anyway, I eventually got drunk enough to become chatty, but the way I decided to chat was drag and talk shit about people, in the office i work in and outside it.

Nobody called me out for it there - they all laughed, some were talking shit too - but I feel real guilty about what I had said. I talked shit about people who are really, for the most part, decent people. 

I don't want to be doing that. What's worst is that this feels less like a sudden occurrence and more like a gradual decline.

I've been under pressure in work and have had a shit time this past year; getting dumped, my father dying, general unhappiness with myself - I feel very alone.

  My brother has a drinking problem since my dad passed and I haven't been able to move out of home due to me being the bulk of the financial support in the house. I have to deal with drama a lot at home; it really feels like I'm taking it out unfairly on people, in the way mentioned above.

I don't really know if the feeling is mutual and anyway, I don't really care as I don't think I'll ever act on it. The thing is that I keep having sex dreams about him when he's around and it's extremely disturbing. I literally can't think of anything else and it's annoying as f*ck. 

On top of that, even if I actually want to be intimate with somebody, I feel like I'll never be able to do it in real life because of how insecure I am about my body. I actually feel disgusting and I even struggle to watch me in the mirror when I dress lol. 
I don't really know what to do. Maybe I should just buy a sex toy ?! haha

204,"Hi reddit. I'm posting here because I don't really want to talk about this with anyone close to me in my life. 

I'm a 24-year-old female. I feel like as I go through my 20s, my self-esteem just gets worse and worse, despite meeting ""goals"" that I have set. It's really exhausting. I'm in a competitive professional program which I really enjoy. But it's a lot of work, and it somewhat consumes a large part of my identity. I've gone through years of being a raging perfectionist and I began to slowly overcome that, but I really can't shake the feeling of not being good enough. 

I have a decent social network, but sometimes I feel like an outsider. I'm an introvert and I've been told that I can come off as aloof, but the reality is i'm just more of an observer and I'm better in intimate conversations than in group settings. I casually date, but I stop myself from getting involved in anything deeper than shallow, exciting bouts of infatuation. I do eventually want to get married. However, I wonder if I will ever be able to ""let someone in"" and get in a real relationship beyond something that is purely sexual. 

I feel tired, sensitive, undeserving, self-critical and guilty. I care too much about what people think and I compare myself to others a little too frequently. I don't know how to get past this, but I know I need to start working on this before it becomes too destructive. ",24Mar2018,2
208,"So about 8 weeks back hooked up with this girl from my new work after a night out. She was cool, we had a good time. &amp; slept together. Few weeks later I hit her up to see it she’d be down to bang again. She’s keen, but due to us both going on holidays etc it took us a good few weeks to pin down a date. 

So yesterday was the day, we meet for a drink its going well &amp; then we head back to mine to do the deed. Problem is she has to leave at 7 sharp so we kinda flirt in bed a bit then about 6ish we get down to it. I wasn’t feeling super horny that day but didn’t think much of it. I had an erection during foreplay then went for a wee a few mins in &amp; when I came back I just couldn’t get it going again. I was mortified, tried most things but I was really stressing about the clock. In the end it just didn’t happen. I did my best to satisfy her but I just feel bad tbh. 

She was cool about it, said we could hookup again soon for another bout &amp; that it was no biggy but its really eating away at me.

216,"For most of my life I didn't have a lot of friends, despite wanting them so badly. When I did make friends and got close to people they usually left and never spoke to me again. I was single and unemployed so I had all the time in the world for friends, but nobody to make time for. It used to make me feel really lonely and depressed so I learned to become independent and enjoy my ""me time"" so to speak.


Now I'm 24 with an amazing girlfriend who makes me really happy, a job that has me working 5 nights a week and plenty of interests and hobbies to keep me busy in my downtime but it seems like people want way more of my attention now. I'll be enjoying myself or talking to my girlfriend (we are long distance and only get to text and talk on the phone at the moment) and then someone else starts talking to me and I get really anxious and overwhelmed. I've never been a ""texter"", despite my long distance relationship I've never been the kind of person who likes maintaining friendships over the phone or the internet. I've also never been the kind of friend who needs or wants to talk every day.

217,"My Uncle, who is more like a father to me, lost kidney function due to a botched surgery for an aneurism. Nobody else in the family stepped up, even his own children. I offered with no hesitation. I am not scared of surgery and as far as I have ever known, we can get by just fine with one kidney. That was his attitude as well. And then I started doing some research and am starting to have some doubts. It is apparently very common to suffer chronic fatigue due to slight damage to the adrenal gland. The vein to the adrenal gland has to be cut in order to remove the kidney. They also cut 2 abdominal muscles and abdominal hernias are common. Higher b/p is another somewhat common occurence. Also having donated a kidney is considered a pre existing condition to insurance companies. I know one ladie who had to go without insurance for a couple of years until she got hired with a really great company who offered her insurance. Argh! I feel like the translant team advocate and even in some ways my uncle werent fully forthcoming about the risks involved. Add that to the fact that I am only 42 and he is 75. And I have two children under 11 and I would like to see my grandchildren grow up. 
So you would think my mind would be made up, but no. Even with all of these issues, I still feel incredibly obligated morally to do this. My morals say that if you can save the life of someone you love, you do it! He is very active and healthy at 75. Now he is on dialysis and cant travel. He told me that his Dr told him that dialysis was killing him and I wonder if that is true. I knwo he is terrified to die, I would be scared to die too. I hope someone would give me a kidney if I needed it. However, I really dont think I would allow my children to donate to me. I know you all can't tell me what to decide, but I would appreciate any insight on how to consider all of this information. Also should add that I am 8 months sober, and want to continue my sobriety the rest of my life. Not sure if this would be a risk.",24Mar2018,4
218,"Reaally long post here, but bear with me!

I have a close friend that I have known for ten years now who is a serial cheater. Nearly every boyfriend she has had in this span she has cheated on. Additionally, the men she has cheated on her ex's with often times end up becoming her next boyfriends (happened in three cases so far). This most recent incident really irked me.

Her last boyfriend was as sweet as can be and became friends with the rest of our ""friend circle."" He has also known my boyfriend since they were 16 (they are now 28). The guy she cheated with is pretentious and cold. On top of that, the first time I met him was at an arcade when it was supposed to be ladies night. She brought this guy without asking and introduced him as her ""friend"". We didn't see them the rest of the night and they were in her car for almost an hour. Once I found out she had been cheating on her boyfriend with this guy for months, I felt icky for lack of better word. I felt like I was a buffer so her boyfriend wouldn't know she was with this guy. Sure I haven't given this new guy a chance, but frankly, due to the uncomfortable circumstances, I am uninterested in getting to know him nor being around him at all. 

I have told her all of this and expressed how I feel about the whole thing, even down to the time at the arcade, but she didn't seem to see why I don't wish to be in his presence. She voiced she was upset me that I couldn't be happy for her for being with someone who ""treats her like a queen"". She then told me that she feels we all would rather be friends with her ex than her, and that it is incredibly wrong for us to hang out with him behind her back and she wishes we had ""asked for her permission."" For the record, I am never the one who initiates contact with him.

 While I care a lot about her at the end of the day, I feel like my boundaries are being tested and I am being guilted. Because we both have a lot of mutual friends, I am having a difficult time distancing myself from her. I don't want to spend less time with other friends just to avoid her. I also do not want to walk around egg shells around her. Everyone feels the same way as I do,  but I am the only one that has been honest with her.

Reddit, how do I go about distancing myself form her without it being a whole ""you can't sit with us"" ordeal? I feel like I am in high school all over again. I don't want to ostracize her from our other mutual friends, nor talk about her behind her back. At the same time, I wish for my other friends to be transparent with her. They stated they are afraid they will throw her over the edge since her emotions have always been incredibly delicate, often turning to self destructive behaviors. 



TLDR; a close friend is a serial cheater and she is in a relationship with the guy she cheated on her ex with. She does not understand why I want nothing to do with him and has been pulling a lot of guilt trips. I want to distance myself from her but don't know how since she is mentally unstable and we have a lot of mutual friends.",24Mar2018,5

221,"Hello Redditverse!

MY MOM is one of those people who have been dealt the sh*ttiest of life cards.

She is also one of those people who have been practicing and persistent for years at one single thing, and has pretty much mastered it.

This amazing lady has an EXTENSIVE library of high-quality, self-made wildlife photography photos. And it's collecting dust on external hard drives.

She also has an invisible disability. She is allergic to everything that is synthetic, aka Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS). She practically lives in a bubble. She cannot work in offices, go anywhere public, or even to family functions, fearing someone might be wearing hairspray that could send her into anaphylactic reaction. So her escape from these difficulties has been to pour herself into nature photography.

Being on disability means an income that is below the poverty line. It also means that if she made any money, she would be taken off disability. I am not in a position to offer her financial help, but I can offer her my time. I can also claim some extra income, and give her cash...

I am writing to you, Redditors, to see if anyone has ideas on viable ways to sell her collection (or part thereof). Do you have experience with this kind of selling of photos? Do you have connections to people that may need some wildlife photos? I'm talking about 10 years of macros of frogs, shots of snowy owls in flight, squirrels mating, ducks preening, almost anything you could think of.

I am determined to make this happen one way or another. I'm sure that there's a way to sell this huge collection of ""raw goods"" in order to contribute to the quality of life of someone who has had it very, very hard.

I’m in college and I don’t want to feel regret again in 4 years about not having done much in collage

I currently ""play"" guitar, but I am a little slow to learn.

I am just so stressed about HOW I will achieve goals that it interferes with actually DOING them.

I worry about my living situation a lot. I just moved to California (Bay Area) and I live with my girlfriend’s family. I am not able to stay in her house forever so I frequently look for jobs (I just got a job but doesn’t pay enough to live comfortably here), places to live, looking on craigslist for vans to sleep in since the rent is too crazy.

I moved here because I want to go to school for Recording/Audio Production/Engineering. There were no schools with this program in the state that I previously lived in. The closest school where I previously lived is in Chicago (Columbia College) but I am not sure I would be accepted into it as a student, although I believe it is possible to be able to take some classes and not be a student. My parents live in the Chicago suburbs as well so I wouldn’t have to worry about rent.

Illinois sucks though. It is depressing and all my friends left so it wouldn't be the same. I love the outdoors and California is basically an outdoorsman's wet dream. Being stuck indoors in the Midwestern winter really gets my anxiety and depression going.

But I moved to California to become a resident and get the cheaper instate tuition here, as Columbia is much more expensive even as a resident of Illinois.

And there are three schools in California I can go to:  Diablo Valley College (Bay Area), American River College (Sacramento), and Fullerton College (Orange County).

I am 22 years old… I am not too sure how instate tuition works. It seems at age 24 I am eligible for grants and…? Not sure how instate works and I need to be 24 to receive it? Do I receive it upon moving at 24?

Ideally I would:

•	Like my own space for instruments--where making noise wouldn’t be an issue, I could decorate it as I please

•	Have money for equipment

•	Have time and less worry to learn stuff

Vaginas just don't attract me that much. I probably wouldn't want to touch one. I wouldn't want to touch an ass or do anal either, no thank you.

So you might be thinking by now; well, it's obvious you're asexual. Well, uh, no, therein lies the problem because I am attracted to exactly one kind of sex - receiving oral sex.

It is the only kind of sex that I am attracted to. None of the other kinds.


Mmh. So, what do I say?

What attracts me about girls? I don't really know. Uh, I guess they're attractive physically, but when it comes to sex, I'm not into that. Except for oral.

You can't find a partner and only ever have oral sex with them. I'm not even attractive. It'll be a tough sell.

I've gone through me entire life wondering when I'll feel full physical attraction towards the opposite gender. Unfortunately, it's now when I'm starting to think it might never happen. It's not even lack of attraction, but nearing repulsion even, at certain times.

Anyone have any idea what's going on with me?",24Mar2018,2
235,"Hello 14f here so sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, if it is please lead me to a better one! I am wondering If I would be able to become a psychologist if I need one myself? I believe I have schizophrenia and am currently gathering up the courage to tell my parents and request perfesional help and get a diagnosis or see if I am overreacting/have something else. On the outside I am normal, nobody knows what I experience. People say I am nice,kind,helpful,and easy to talk to. But I know Im not normal. The voices,the hallucinations,the self harm and much more. Part of me wants to tell no one. I am completely functional, have high grades, and again no one can tell. Im afraid that once I get the diagnosis everyone will know and I will be judged. Schizophrenia is a serious, highly misunderstood condition. Won't colleges and employers know? My future is important to me and I am really conflicted on what I should do.

Another co-worker who is a vegetarian was overhearing us and chimed in to say, ""Make sure you use vegan marshmallows!"" She then joked about ""do you know how they make gelatin?"" 

She's not aggressive in her vegetarianism and she doesn't try to convert people, though she often will make statements about limited options for her when the firm provides food.

I think I can get vegan marshmallows at the Whole Foods near me. They are def more expensive, and I'd need two bags, though the price is not a big deal. I'm sure they make a fine rice krispie treat, but they may taste a bit different. This cowrker is the only vegetarian among the 13 of us.

Would it be inappropriate to use the conventional marshmallows? Is this being passive aggressive? I didn't exactly agree to use vegan marshmallows when she popped into the conversation to make her request known.",24Mar2018,2
241,"Hey all, I know this might sound ridiculous because your first reaction when reading this might be “you got an A, deal with it.” For the college I’m at it counts as a 3.7 and I was relying on the 4.0 from the regular A because it’s a pre-requisite for my major and I don’t want it affecting my chances of graduate school later on.

My professor’s syllabus explicitly states that our final grade in the class will never be lower than the grade we got on our final. Going into the final, I had about an 72% in the class due to a ridiculously tough grader as my TA. However, I ridiculously studied hard and requested that my test be graded by the head TA. I ended up getting a 94% which is an A on the professor’s grading scale. When I went to check my final grade for the class I had gotten an A- rather than an A.

247,"Long story short, I'm half Black half Asian. My dad was a curly haired Asian and my mom had kinky curly hair, so I have a pretty weird texture. I have worn hijab all of my life and neglected my hair pretty hard when I grew up enough for my parents to stop doing it for me - just leaving it in braids forever, straightening it a lot at one point on the recommendation of my aunt, and just generally being ashamed to remove my headscarf in front of anyone, family included.

(For people familiar with hijab, you can take it off in front of family including uncles, dads, moms, siblings, all women, and basically everyone except men unrelated to you. Some people take this absolute crazy approach and force girls to wear it constantly, but that never happened to me. I just was ashamed to let my straight haired friends and family members see me with my bushy afro.)

So basically, about a year ago I decided it was time to start taking care of my hair. Aggressively detangled it, bought new hair products, washed it, let it air dry, and examined it. To my surprise, my hair has some nice curls coming in - a lot looser and nicer than I thought. Still some wacky, multiracial things going on where my hair can't decide what DNA it wants, but still - not bad. When it dries without product, however, it is brittle, crunchy, tangled, and just looks terrible. I'm thinking that all my years of neglect, keeping it under my scarf at all times even sleeping with a sleeping scarf, and ripping it apart on washday has severely damaged my hair. 

I watched a YouTube video talking about a big chop, and then was inundated with waves of media and videos showing people completely buzzing their hair off very short. I want to eventually grow my hair waist-length someday, but think that I want to shave it all off and try and reconnect with my hair. I confided this in my mom. She doesn't want me to at all.

Here's the problem. I live at home with my parents. Despite them getting on my nerves, I adore my mom most of all and know she'll be hurt if I do. So that aside, I do want to shave my hair. No one else will know because I basically don't take off my scarf. My father will probably be furious because Asians (at least where he is from) put a lot of emphasis on hair = femininity for girls. I figure it will take me a year or two to move out, and I wanted to start the process now. 

I'm so sorry for getting caught up and just rambling on and on, but basically I don't know what to do. I know I could just buy a shaver and just be ""Surprise, I'm bald!"" but I don't want anyone to have a heart attack, lol. Does anyone have any advice for this situation? ",24Mar2018,2

259,"I work at a local ice cream store that doesn't have a whole lot of workers, so the staff here is all pretty close and we (generally) get along. Great boss - great hours - and hell yeah, nothing beats free ice cream.


One of my co-workers (who is a bit older than me) has a sister my age that is becoming increasingly overbearing. She shows up pretty much every time I work, lingers for*ever* and sort of just rubs me the wrong way. The other day, I got on my shift, and she was already at the store and kept asking me to hang out with her after work (we close at 10 so there was no way I wanted to go out with her that late). I sort of hid in the back after a while. In our office, we have a security camera that lets us see the whole store so I watched her to see what she did while I was gone. She just stood there and waited until I came back. I eventually asked her if she needed something because I had a lot of work to do (that's a lie - it's fucking cold here, no one wants ice cream) and after a bit, she took a hint and left.


But *wait* there's more. 


When I was taking out the trash, I thought I saw her car parked back in the alley behind our store . . . well, I couldn't really tell, that is, until I closed up shop and left, and that car followed me to the edge of my neighborhood. When I turned in, I drove around the block a few times until ""she"" stopped following me and then went into the house hoping I lost her.


I asked my co-worker about it, but I guess he doesn't spend too much time at home anymore so he doesn't talk to her either.

First I thought I go with a movie or maybe some interesting book. But I really wasn't sure what I should give her, so I decided to just buy a bouquet of roses and write a small love poem. Nothing too serious though, I thought that'd be cheesy and she would get the joke.

So she basically took it the wrong way apparently and thought I was serious. She confessed to me and I thought she would get it if I just laugh at her, since I was thinking she would just get along with the joke.

I was wrong, she started crying, insulted me and slapped me in the face. She said she will never talk with me again, now I don't really mind so much but I didn't plan to make her angry. I tried apologizing but she won't listen to me, even threatening me sometimes. What do I do?

263,"Hi everyone! 
I'm really hoping to get some advice on my little situation. 

Here's a bit of context to start off with. I (23, single) currently live at my parents house, and i'm ready to move out on my own. We live on the east most border of Toronto. I currently work about 42km (35 minutes) east of my house; and because traffic flows west into the city, i avoid it completely. I go into downtown Toronto every weekend for social activities which is 42km west of my house, but there is always traffic. 

I'm thinking of moving closer to work; about 10 mins away from work, and because it's the suburbs i can get a decent townhouse, or maybe even a small detached home for the price of a condo in the city. The downside is that getting into the city to hang out with my friends (And getting home) would be awful. Those 2am ubers would be really costly (there's no transit out east). And i completely understand that's such a small concern in the grand scheme of things.

My other option is to move a bit closer to the city and get a condo. It would make my drive to work a bit longer, probably close to 45min-1hr, but there would still be no traffic. Plus, public transit is readily available to get me wherever at any time. 

First question, what would be a better move? Obviously, if i move closer to work, it cuts down on the price of gas, maintenance, and i get more time in the day. But, i'll be father away from my social life. In contrast, if my drive is 35 mins already, what's another 15?. I know the value of condo's isn't as good as a townhouse in terms of growth and resale, so i've taken that into consideration too. 

Second question, i've got enough saved up for a down payment now. Should i jump the gun on buying a place? or should i maybe rent for a bit and test out how i like living elsewhere? I'm thinking of renting with a friend for a few years until we grow out of the 'party downtown everyday' phase, then moving to somewhere practical. I know renting may be considered a waste of money to some, but it's short term-ish.

Anyway, being practical, my parents think i should move closer to work. And, i kind of agree with that. i'll get a larger property, it will save time everyday, and i won't be burning through cars/gas. I'm in no real rush to move out, and they're not kicking me out, i'm just exploring my options to see what makes the most sense.

Thanks for all your help! Looking forward to some solid advice. Feel free to look up toronto on google maps to feel my pain, ahah.

You may be like ""wtf is this bullshit? just because she asks how you are?"". I don't really know, it just makes me uncomfortable like everytime I enter, she does that. The unusual thing is she only does it to me and not to other students, if she did it to other students then it wouldn't really be creepy. 

For some reason, while I'm working alone on the assignment and my friends are at other tables talking to eachother, she always comes up to me and asks really personal questions. I kind of get uncomfortable so I either ask to go to the bathroom or just walk away talk to my friends just so I can avoid the awkwardness. 

Also her laugh is pretty creepy as well, everything I say seems to make her laugh. But this is where it got really damn creepy, it was the last day of school before spring break, and she kept asking questions like ""oh how will you spend your spring break?"", ""what will you do?"", ""where will you go?"", ""got any plans?"", ""gonna travel?"", ""hangout with friends?"" and I would just answer ""Yea, mhm, yeah"" just to move on. Also gives me that ""I want you inside me"" look everytime I speak to her.

I get the vibe that she wants to sleep with me, and here's the thing sex is a big taboo in my country and I really feel awkward whenever I think about what could happen. Like I would feel very weird if I were to actually sleep with her but at the same time I kind of want it, she's pretty hot honestly not gonna lie. I guess around low 30s or late 20s, she's married as well.

I think he’s still mad at me about the situation and I feel really guilty. Should I bring it up again? I don’t know whether to bring up my bullshit excuses because he probably won’t want to hear them. I just don’t want to lose this friendship over a dumb mistake I’ve made.",24Mar2018,1
273,"I’m sorry if this is not the right thread, but I’m not sure where else to lost it. 

I’m 17 years old and until a few months ago I was really into girls. I really wanted a girlfriend and everything that came with it.

Then a few months ago I kissed a girl an it didn’t work out. And now I’m just not attracted to girls anymore. What’s happening to me? Please help.

Btw, it wasn’t my first kiss, so it wasn’t a revelation about how horrible girls actually are and that nonsense. ",24Mar2018,1
275,"I work in the cash office of a supermarket. Our office team is tiny, just myself, my boss - the office manager -, and one other person. Early yesterday morning while spot checking our safe, I noticed money was missing from some of the change trays that we have set out to dish out to the registers. Long story short, $1500 had disappeared from the safe, despite the computer record indicating that the last safe count had been fine. I messaged my boss asking where the money was (assuming everything was totally innocent at this stage) and, again long story short, he admitted he had taken the money himself and had tried to hide it.

I already knew that he was taking things a bit rough - he had a clear alcohol problem that he was open about and a lot of mental demons too. I also know he has know family in this state, as he had moved here by himself a few years ago. He told me he was in massive financial trouble and that the anti-depressants that he is on had driven him to do crazy things to try and cover himself lately. He said he wouldn’t blame me if I told our store manager, but he asked me not to and said that he would try to pay it back.

I ended up revealing everything to the store manager, who then told me that he had suspected the office manager had been stealing for a while, and that he was also suspected at his last store. 

I know I probably did the right thing by revealing everything, but I also know now that I have effed over a mentally ill and desperate person. Is this a gray area, or would others have done the same thing? ",24Mar2018,3
276,Yeah it’s all in the title. How would you approach this. I don’t want to come off as accusatory because I have no evidence. It’s one friends word against everything I’ve seen. I just don’t know why somebody would accuse a friend of mine for something like this. ,24Mar2018,2

279,"My gf's friend (Lets call him Jeff) was being very controlling of my girlfriend. He was mad because my girlfriend hung out with another friend(Lets call *her* Lyra) at an event they were all at.  My girlfriend and Jeff already had plans to hang out after the event, but he canceled because my gf was with her other friend. I was aware of this and was completely okay with them hanging out.

I talked to Lyra (We both know each other) and we both think Jeff treats her poorly and is quite manipulative, so (since I have no contact with him) Lyra told him what I thought about it. In response he ignored my girlfriend, saying that ""It's best if I don't talk to you."" And is also ignoring Lyra.

My girlfriend is very hurt and she does NOT know that it I was me that made Jeff upset. What should I do to make things right between me and my girlfriend after I tell her that I caused this? (At least I believe I caused it)",24Mar2018,3
280,"So I’m in the process of moving home to Tx right now, from california. I currently live with a roommate who is a nightmare. She has almost nothing of her own, so she just uses my stuff without asking. She also brings random guys home and even gave her boyfriend a key once without bothering to ask. The final straw was an hour or so ago, when I walked out and found that she had torn open my packed box of drinking glasses to use one. I lost it. I took every single thing of hers (not much, basically a computer and bathroom items. Plus a lot of files for work.) and put them on the kitchen counter. She had all of this on my dining room table and my living room coffee table, which I have to move anyway, so it was basically a “fuck you, get your own shit” that was coming sooner or later anyway. My question is, can I do anything else? I don’t have anywhere else to store boxes and I’m worried she’s just going to keep opening them to get whatever she wants or needs, and I really can’t afford to buy extra boxes to keep repacking them. I told her to stop but I don’t think she will, she has an almost complete inability to realize when her actions are out of line. ",24Mar2018,2

The problem is that I'm still very deeply in love with her and that I am basically the sole provider for bills and rent. I'm still pretty lost in all of this and there are a heap of other details that I can't add here due to her browsing reddit as well.
