1,"At about this time every year, I become lazy. My mind is absent of ideas to keep busy. In contrast, during the summer I'm very active. I golf, play softball, hike, kayak, bike, concerts,  etc.

Now until April, I am at a loss for activities. Especially during the weeknights. Specifically I'm home from work by 5-530 each day. Most nights I come home and cook dinner then sit and watch TV, movies, surf the net.

Is there something I can be doing to keep me somewhat active/feeling like I accomplished something? It's literally a 180 degree turn from being busy to bored for half the year. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!",27Nov2018,1

4,"I recently made a post-grad move after turning 24. I was looking at jobs in New York and LA and got offered one in LA, accepted it, and then got offered one in NYC two days later and retracted my acceptance to the LA job to move to NYC. I’ve had a dream of living in New York since I was little, but now....

I hate it. I hate everything about the city. Usually I am good about being alone and finding things to do but everything here is a hassle and expensive and when I go out to a museum or a park or something I just wind up more anxious and upset than before. Everything I thought I would like about the city I hate (the subway, the seasons, the density). 

On top of this, the LA job was a much much better job - about the same salary but I’m sure it goes further in LA, and more in line with what I want to do (modern architecture). I got starry eyed about the prospect of NYC so much that I thought it would be worth the trade off and now it’s not. Been here a few months and it’s only gotten worse.

I’m honestly at the point of emailing the firm in LA and being direct and honest about my situation, but I’m sure people might advise against that, and that they wouldn’t even bother to entertain the idea. No one in my life is being very helpful and they’re just saying to tough it out but I can’t help but feel like I passed up a great opportunity for a fantasy that is not panning out.

Gimme something, anything! Even if it’s just telling me to suck it up! ",27Nov2018,1
5,"I'm 23M. I have a full time job, good pay, roof over my head, all kind of stuff. I'm good with all that 

Sorry for the grammar issues lol. 

Ever since this one relationship, in which during that time, I was going through first time true anxiety and stress at this job because I just came home from school, couldn't go back due to financial issues. anyway, a little about the job, it was mainly the supervisor, she was a cunt to be blunt. didnt know how to take it. so i took it mentally hard. My relationship during that time, which I think about a lot more than i should, ended mainly because due to the stress and anxiety i was dealing with at work and all I did was want to be alone and get high but I made up excuses. this was 3 years ago. 

Now. like I said I got a job, car, etc.  Now. when I get home from work and on the weekends, I mainly just want to get high and be in my comfort zone and play video games. it's been like this for a while. Idk if its my anxiety. Although I think it's bad tbh. I overthink, i barely go  anywhere, even when I'm asked to do things. it's like I want to experience the world but it's like I just can't. I want to be able go out and socialize with girls and possibly get laid(been awhile). I dont know how to talk to girls in person. I'm on always tinder and I struggle real hard with that. Idk. I have self confidence issues. 

Being able to talk to girls first is my thing first. If someone kinda showed me the way or help me, that would be cool.

6,"I will try to make this as short as possible. My husband has been with his current company for over 10 years. He is currently in sales position. About a year ago, one of his co-workers got him in trouble: the co-worker found a mistake in my husband's performance and called all managers to let them know what my husband did and how big of a a mess he made (my husband had a dying account on his route, and his coworker found some outdated product and made a mountain out of a molehill). My husband got written up over it. A few days after, my husband went to find this co-worker and basically asked him why he did this to him, and why couldn't he have called my husband instead and pulled the product out of the market himself. The co-worker was just muttering and trying to defend his actions (nothing to defend FROM because my husband hates confrontation and would never approach anyone in an aggressive way). Since management got involved, they removed this guy away from my husband, and assigned him to a different sales person. 

Since that happened my husband has been closely  observed by all managers, and everyone started micromanaging him. He has been under huge amount of stress and almost quit 700 times. He made a few official harassment complaints to HR, but nothing changed. Meanwhile, the co-worker that got him in trouble in the first place had another one of his co-workers fired (by constantly complaining about his performance, too), and has become known as a major A-hole. 

He somehow ended up doing my husband's route again about 10 days ago, and since he couldn't find anything wrong, he took his time and made a mess in the account, then call my husband's manager and pointed out all that was wrong with the account accusing my husband of that. He almost got my husband in trouble again. 

Now my husband is sick and tired of dealing with the non-responsive HR, and the fact that nobody wants to even try to stop this guy (the A-hole is obviously after a higher position and is too stupid and lazy to earn it, and is just trying to get people fired so he can climb the ladder).

What to do? I really want a revenge, and I am well aware that two wrongs don't make a right, but I have watched my husband fall into depression, fluctuate in weight, get physically and mentally sick because of his work, had huge mood swings, and get gray hair over this A-hole. I don't know what to do anymore to make this guy stop and get off my husband's back! Please give me some advice. My husband is the breadwinner and we can't afford him losing his job. ",27Nov2018,1
7,"Sup reddit. I'm a sophomore in a highly competitive high school that brings a lot of stress. Recently, I have been trying my hardest to make good grades in top level classes yet am consistently scoring low B's and a few B+'s (with two A-'s so that's good =D). Anyways, my grades have dropped substantially despite trying my hardest in a few classes since the beginning of the year (now scoring 70-85 on all my tests.) The feeling of working your hardest but only getting a 75 sucks. I know everyone says ""just do your best that's all we can ask"" but I feel like I can improve somehow. Dropping down classes is not an option. Maybe someone can provide me with new advice that I haven't thought of to bring my grades up by one letter by the end of the year.

I move to close the window but it suddenly moves, as if someone clicked on it before I did. I look up at the camera, the light is on (I only use that camera for Skype and haven't opened it in millennia), and immediately I know someone was using my computer without my permission. I close the lid, and plug out my computer (the battery doesn't work so this essentially forced shut it off).

13,"Hi so basically as above, I (22m) am at a crossroads with what i want to do for my career. I have studied a bachelors degree in finance and accounting which has pretty much only geared me up for a job that is desk bound to a computer. I currently work part time as intern for a small and local accounting firm. the work i do here is mostly administrative but can involve going to clients maybe twice a month (this is the only part of the job i actually find interesting). during my degree i have made the dean's list for high achievement pretty consistently, which made my parents very happy and probably would have dropped out if i hadnt got the awards.

I feel now that i dont want to work at a desk for my whole life as i would probably go insane.. or does it get better? i have worked carpentry/construction jobs through summers and stuff which i have always found to be really fun and good at, but the idea of doing that work for 15+ years straight sounds very taxing. but then the idea of sitting at a desk every day watching a screen for 15+ years sounds even worse?

I have a pretty tight back from a previous injury which means my back hurts when i am sitting still in an office chair ( i have to constantly be aware of my posture).

I feel like i am the living version of the film ""Office Space"".

I would make more money working in accounting or what ever, but i feel like nothing i am doing actually provides any value other than ticking boxes.. so it leads to serious lack of job satisfaction, which means i actually spend more money on useless crap to feel happy... so the extra income may not even be worth it.

What i have learnt from studying commerce has been invaluable to me as it taught me how to use my brain properly (i scored like 28% at high school so i couldnt graduate)

to give some incite to myself as a person, i am very lazy and unmotivated to get out of bed in the morning to go to work... but when i worked construction, it wasnt so hard.. does this mean that is what i need to do?

I only know these two things, i know nothing in between.. would any one be able to reccomend a job that maybe combines aspects of both? quantity surveying??? i CBF taking another qualification

Will it be a good decision to follow my gut here or am i just having anxiety about the thought of starting my 'real life'?

19,"Hi all,

I'm an MSW student on my final year and I've had a pretty rocky time at my internship placement. I'm an unpaid intern and my placement isn't providing me with supervision and overall has very high expectations of my performance. There were a lot of politics during the first few weeks of my placement in terms of not telling me about my poor performance and complaining to my school behind my back, but I don't want to get into all of that. Things have improved and they've seem to be happier with me over the past few weeks, but overall it's a very toxic environment to work in. I am extremely anxious and nervous every time I go there and it results in my underperforming even though I'm more than capable of doing well. This nervousness and anxiety are new to me and I've never exhibited these traits to this extreme in any other professional setting. After discussing it with my school they decided that ultimately my internship's expectations are too high and they are not abiding by the rules of my program and that I should switch placements. I got a new internship, so tomorrow I have to put in my two weeks notice at my current placement. I feel terrible and like it will not go well. I feel that they will be annoyed that they spent time trying to take Train me and increase my performance just for me to leave. Any advice?",27Nov2018,1
20,"Hi Reddit,
 
I am a mom in desperate need of some help! I have a 17 year old beautiful son, that has lost his way, and I don’t have the tools to help him find his way back! My son has been raised in a house filled with love. He is hugged, supported, talked to, praised, and surrounded with what I thought were positive influences! He is popular at school, athletic, and is looked up to by all his peers, teachers, and coaches. He is the kid that waits with his friends until they are picked up. He literally gives the shirt off his back to anyone in need. He has a heart of gold and is the person that everyone counts on to make their day brighter! He is Jewish by birth but has been taught the spiritual path of universal love, living in gratitude, and acceptance for all living things! He is a typical teenager, pushing the envelope with getting what he wants, and telling little lies along the way to get it! Nothing out of the norm. This all changed and halted abruptly. He came to me thankfully and shared a story that I ask for you to look at with an open mind keeping all I just shared about him in your thoughts before making a judgement! 
 
The other day he had plans to go to a friend’s house to sleep over.  As he was leaving I noticed he had a very large duffle bag, and my Spidey senses were alerted. In the bag was his backpack of clothes, that he quickly moved out of my way, and a full paintball body armored suit he had borrowed earlier in the week from a friend telling him he was going to use this for protection when going dirt bike riding. When he shared this with me, the reason he didn’t initially tell me this was because he didn’t want me to say no to going dirt bike riding, so that’s why he didn’t tell me the truth to start. I was upset with the lie but let him go and spend the night at another friend’s house with repercussions to follow. When he came home the next day the energy was heavy, and he knew I was upset. He asked to speak to me, and this is where my world has been turned upside down. I went to his room, and he asked me to open my hand. I did, and he placed two bullets into my palm. My reaction was shocked, confused, and I asked “what is this”? He then shared that in his back pack were two locked pistols, and bags of bullets. I stayed quiet and let him tell his story. He had been planning this for weeks. After the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, he became quietly enraged. We talk very openly about shootings, and this one, like all of them, stung my family, myself included, deeply. He shared that a Holocaust survivor being gunned down in her place of worship, after everything she overcame, made him feel hopeless and he needed to do something. He no longer saw that anyone, or anything would ever stop the violence, and he convinced himself that he was put here, on this earth to do just that.
 
My father has guns locked up in storage. He had made plans with my dad earlier in the week to go to his storage because he wanted a jacket that he said was in there. This was obviously not the case. He had planned all along to distract my dad while finding the guns and putting them in his backpack which is indeed what took place.  My son and Dad went to dinner and discussed all sorts of things that at the time seemed normal, but now all the signs were there. My dad was an army medic, and my son wanted to know how to patch up wounds, and how to remove a bullet from flesh. When my son got home, he realized that my dad (being the responsible gun owner he is and the universe protecting my family from irreversible devastation) had locked the guns!  This is when he made plans to stop by the other friend’s house (not where he got the paintball armor) to ask that friend to pick the locks. This is where he was headed when I saw the duffle bag, and why he moved the backpack away from me. As I said, I let him go, not having any clue there were guns inside. When he got to his friend’s house, he waited till the family was asleep, and shared his plan. He wanted his friend to unlock the guns, and he had a bus schedule to a known Neo Nazi facility that he had looked up on the internet. He was going to wear the paintball armor (thinking this would protect him against gunshots coming his way; delusional to say the least) and had a bag of lighters that he was going to make into some sort of mini explosive to distract them, and then take the “bad guys” out. To note, the 2 guns he took from my father were guns from the old days.  Like a 1930’s pistol, no clip, single shooter and weigh like 15 pounds. He would have been lucky if he got one shot off before being taken out.  His motive of what he wanted to do was clear in his head, but the way about doing it and the means he planned to do so were naïve at best. 
 
In his head, he believed he was first going to travel to the venue where they were at and try to talk them out of the things they do.  And if that didn’t work, he felt he would have no other way to deal with it other than taking them out.  He truly thinks he would have gotten away with it. He said he was going to come home after, put the guns back, and was hoping to start some sort of revolution that the Jewish people were no longer afraid, and were going to start to fight back anyone looking to murder the Jewish people. He is struggling to see what the effects of his plan would have had on his family, and friends. When he played it out in his head, he said he thought he would get away with it, but if not he was planning on calling me with his last breath to say I’m sorry, and that he loves me, and appreciates all I have done. 
 
This I know is delusional thinking. My heart breaks that he felt so helpless, so much so, that he didn’t share when it was just a thought, he kept it in, and drew on his anger to give him the strength to almost go through with it. Reddit, my son is good, he is love, he was put here to do great things! He is just so lost in all the hatred, and the darkness of the world, that he is struggling to see the other side can eventually win and make a difference without involving violence. We know he needs long term professional help and are open to medication options. Please help me help my baby! We love him so much, and appreciate any help with similar situations, or Dr.’s, hospitals, anything!! Live in Los Angeles, but are open to taking him anywhere if appropriate. Fortunately have good insurance and the means to pay for any kind of care beyond that so long as it's the *right* kind of care.
 
Thank you for taking the time to read my story! I wrap each, and every one of you in love!",27Nov2018,1
22,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 months now, and I’ve known him for 6 years. We were friends but he was very reserved. Only now have I found out more about him, but I am still completely lost on what to give him. He is my first serious relationship and I am new at this. 

We are both 18, and he’s shy, and a bit reserved still. He continually ask me what I am getting him for Christmas. I’m pretty sure he knows that I’m struggling because he jokes that I haven’t gotten him anything yet. So far I know that he loves anime, he even sent me two anime he has on his amazon list I believe after I ask him what he wanted other than that he doesn’t know what he wants. I would get them but I am certain his brother might get it for him. 

The little stuff I do know he likes are anime, action movies, and chicken. He’s an intellectual individual, likes techy stuff. May seem very serious but is one of the most humorous guys I met.

What should I get him? How do I get him to tell me what he really wants? Sorry this is absolutely wrong for no reason.

24,"Hi. I’m a high school sophomore, almost 16.
I’m not allowed to drive, don’t have a permit, never leave the house without parent permission ever, I do not have any social media aside from Instagram and Reddit, and my Instagram is closely monitored by my parents who follow me.  I only have one to keep in touch with old friends since I’ve changed schools a few times.
I’m a good kid, imo. I get good grades (95+), i play the clarinet in band and I’m working towards becoming a good child. Anytime I have time I try to help my mom out with chores, I keep my room clean, I eat whatever food she gives me and I don’t throw a fuss. Basically, I give her no reason to not trust me.
But my mom always randomly demands to see my phone, and proceeds to do a few things.
She will look at all my messages, laugh at the things my friends and I talk about, laugh at my pictures (screenshots) and laugh at my Instagram posts that I have. She then shows them to my sister and my sister mocks me. She will then stay on my phone for an hour or more, draining all the battery, and she won’t charge my phone either. She’s not laughing because my posts were meant to be funny, but it feels like she laughs because she thinks I’m pathetic. 
If I tell her “please stop laughing about what’s on my phone,” she asks me “so you have something to hide huh? What are you hiding on your phone?? What sneaky stuff are you doing? Talking to boys?” She then always bothers me while I am working on schoolwork or practicing “why do you have this picture on your phone?” When it’s simply a meme she doesn’t understand or a screenshot of a text conversation with a friend. It’s nothing bad that I’m doing she just doesn’t understand the content I have on my phone. But it is clear to her that the content isn’t bad. Is she doing this just to hurt my feelings and bother me? She always questions my text conversations and why I talked to a boy in my English class.
But if she were to go through the actual messages themselves before jumping to conclusions, she would see that most if not all of my conversations are related to school work, complaining about said school work, and asking when exam dates are. I don’t do anything bad on my phone, nor do I spend an ungodly amount of time on it. I’ve been told by so many people that I’m a good kid, but my parents don’t trust me and it really hurts me. I’ve done all I can and I’m honestly frustrated with them. 
What does my mom think she will get out of bothering me and wasting my time? 
I’m perfectly fine if she goes through my phone without telling me, without making it obvious and leaves my phone to charge. I don’t like knowing she goes through it because it’s not like I have anything bad obviously. I just feel really uncomfortable and it hurts me a lot that she still finds reason to not trust me.
By the way, I can’t say that ^ to her because I live in a strict Asian family and my parents will think I’m being disrespectful if I tell her what to do. Please help or give advice. I can’t go to my parents for support and don’t feel comfortable telling my friends my mom reads our conversations because then they’ll stop texting me and talking to me.",27Nov2018,1
25,"Hi all, I'm 17/F. My boyfriend is 19/M. He's a really sweet guy, and I know long distance relationships can be tricky, especially since we haven't actually met in person yet, but I really like him and think we have something. We've been talking, skyping, for a little over a year now and I feel like I've gotten to know him pretty well, and understand that he may be different in person. He lives in the next state over, and we're planning on meeting in person this upcoming summer, once I turn 18(In February). 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I'm pretty anxious about this because of my body. I'm 5'9 1/2 in height, but weigh a whopping 280 lbs. because I've been dealing with depression(I just started therapy). I know that's really big, and I want to lose weight, but for right now I'm just focusing on maintaining my weight until I'm able to gain a little more control over my diet, since right now I can only eat what we have at home(Mostly tv dinners, or things filled with empty calories and carbs. Lots of junk food as well, which I try to avoid).

&amp;#x200B;

I've talked to my boyfriend before about how I feel about this, and he's been super supportive, and tells me he's seen my body in pictures and he likes it. He's been awesome about everything. But I sort of feel as if he's underestimating my size, or as if I'm just somehow hiding my weight very well in pictures(I've gotten a lot of comments from my parents about how if I could just lose 20-30 lbs, I could look like a model. Body image just sucks in general tbh)

&amp;#x200B;

The more I worry about this though, the worse I feel about myself. I've been fat my entire life, and I did manage to lose 20 lbs in high school, but I've graduated and having so much free time leaves me with very little to do. I've been aiming to get a job, or go to community college, but I wanted to deal with my mental health first and get better before I added onto the list.

34,"So I'm a service manager, new to the position, but have been with the company for years. One employee got an attitude with me and began yelling and arguing with me in front of other employees. I threatened to write her up.

An hour later I had an issue with a different employee. Direct insubordination. But they were not connected events, however I feel there is a direct correlation between the events. In essence the second employee saw the first one speaking to me like that and figured it would fly, this person has been very timid and a good worker up to this point.

Now original employee went around telling people I was on drugs and that's why I got into it with two employees. This girl is already on thin ice but she went to my co-manager and claimed it was about her calling out the night before, which is patently not true. I did not file the write-up but now I'm not sure what to do. Do I file it? How can I defend myself? It would be an insubordination form but she did not defy orders, she just talk back and argued with me in front of other employees. I'm writing the report right now. Please help

43,"So I’m from a Western country that make a big deal out of age. People are very critical of anyone who changes career. I’m 28 and the age I should have started my current job was 24 (having completed the necessary college course of 5 years straight out of high school). I’ve worked in a role related to my job and undertook a year of specialised study. Around 50% of people at this stage in my career are under 25 and the rest are over 25. The ideal age to start is 23 but some colleges (the good ones let me point out!) have an extra year. Despite this I’ve had the following comments: 

When I explained what stage I’m at to a secretary ‘oh you’re a bit green aren’t you’.

A peer on a work night out (friend of someone at work in the same type of job) said ‘oh great we got the milf to come out with us’. 

An external trainer at work after the training said she was sorry she was staring at me but I looked like her friend and then randomly said ‘but you’re much older than everyone else’. Completely out of context to the conversation.

A more junior colleague told me she didn’t want to be my age in my current role. 

Another more junior colleague kept on asking me lots of questions on what I had done since college and wouldn’t let it go.

While volunteering for work one of the organisers made a comment that I was very old for my current role. 

I know of a woman who had a PHD and worked in research and started the role at 33 but she’s still looked down upon even though her research role was really good?!

I know I’m going to face a lot more comments like these so does anyone have any suggestions on how to respond to them? 

I’m worried i won’t be promoted in the future because people presume there’s something wrong with me for starting so late and I feel like my work is always doubted. 

I have worked in another country where it was more acceptable to change career or be a few years behind. Guess I’ll just have to move back there once I get enough experience! 

Side note - I also can’t believe there’s that much of a difference looks wise that some people are ‘aghast’ that I could have this job. I’m really bad at telling ages and can’t tell the difference between 23 and 26!

There’s not much diversity in terms of race in this field as well of that helps shed any light. 

TLDR: facing a lot of critical comments for being 5 years older than the average age in my career and want advice on how to handle these comments.

44,"Backstory: I’m studying abroad in England and I’ve met this beautiful and nerdy Italian girl which I love in ways I never knew where possible. She lives in the same accommodation house as me and I see her every day. She makes me feel loved and has boosted my self esteem a lot. I’ve never even liked my body until she started borderline fangirling about me. Of course, I’m kind of fangirling over her as well. She’s cute, funny, makes childish jokes and sometimes just makes random cute sounds. Her reactions, her breathing, her pouting, anything she does is so cute and I can’t help but love her. 

I’ve never felt like this and I don’t want it to end.

But it will
In three weeks, the first term of our English course will end and she’ll go home to Italy. I’m staying for  another term after that.

We’ve already agreed on not trying to make long distance work as the next time I’ll see her will be next summer, which is too long for us considering we’ve been spoiled by the amazing experiences we’ve had these past few months. 
We’ll still be in contact online as we both own some video games we play regularly which enable online play. Texting will also happen as she sends memes occasionally. 

I will miss her so much. I don’t know how much as I’ve never really experienced someone in my life who I love so much leave. My self image will probably be negative again after she leaves and I don’t know how to cope with not seeing her for so long.

I cry every time I think about her leaving. I’m even crying right now.

47,"So a bit of background info. which would help you all understand the situation. I'm a 20 year old guy that's on a gap year, and I'm starting university next September.

A few months back when I finished my last set of pre-med exams I was thinking about working for the year off, my friend who didn't know got told about a great opportunity to work from home and do research and thought I'd be perfect for the job. I took the offer and it went really well, I was getting paid to do research, getting introduced (online) to many professionals and maybe even opening a few doors irl for me to make use of later when I started med school.

I did really well and made my employer proud, I got raises, my work got expanded ( I now held other roles at the company) and it was going great. This is where thinks go south. 

Recently I just don't want to do it anymore, I literally force myself to sit down and do most of the work ( I still enjoy parts of it but I feel as if this applies to the majority). I was never a person to waste time or procrastinate  but now every time I'm going to do work I'm hit by a wave of sadness, my chest tightens and I end up wasting so much time which makes me feel even worse. The more challenging tasks are great and I enjoy them and feel accomplished but the others, I literally auto pilot through while feeling terrible. I don't know if I've grown accustomed or it's not stimulating enough or doesn't challenge me, all I know is it causes a great deal of sadness. It's been like this for a month or two. Because of all this I really don't put my 100% into it, I just can't.

Truth be told I'd rather a physical job, where I can be away from home, where there are other people around me and all that good work stuff. Maybe I should go to the library or starbucks and work from there with my laptop every now and then, but who knows it it'll help.

The reason I stayed until now was because my parents and I thought it could benefit me in the future, or could help me get employed after university and maybe provide some great opportunities for me in the future because of the nature of it, it's undoubtedly a good opportunity. But I'm questioning if it'll do any of that (deep down).  


I told myself I'd stick it through and see where it goes but I had thoughts of leaving for a week or so. Right now I'm not sure what I really want. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",27Nov2018,1
48,"TL;DR: I'm 26 guy that has recently started to question my sexuality and I don't know what to do from here.

Ok, so this will come off as a stream of consciousness rant, and that's because I still don't have all my thoughts collected quite yet.

Background info: as I said, I'm a 26 year old guy. I've been single and alone for the past 2 years. 

So, I like looking at furry porn. Normally it's MF or sometimes solo F porn. Well, over the past month I've seen a few gay pics and not been turned off by them. Then, last night, I went out of my way to look at gay porn comics and enjoyed the whole experience same as I would with straight porn. It's got me thinking I may be bi.

But the issue is, I see a lot of other things that could be at work here. As I said, I haven't been with anyone for 2 years.. maybe this is just my mind being overly horny and willing to get off to anything. But to counter that, I could totally see myself having sex with a guy (maybe). But then, I'm not really attracted to guys; I don't see myself cuddling or kissing them, but the idea of giving a blowjob gets me going just a little.

There's the thought that maybe it's just towards furry porn. But, again, I kind of like the thought of giving a blowjob.. but it's a very hazzy idea and not well formed on my mind.

So, at the end of the day, I don't know what to do or where I stand. I don't really have any friends that I would feel comfortable talking to about this, I can't afford to see a counselor, and I have no answers for myself... Any help on what I should do in dealing with this would be appreciated..",27Nov2018,1

The girl said ""stop, please stop, your hurting me, please"" the video kind of stop and they were in a different position. The girl, throw out the video seem out of it, like she was drunk and would only realize what was happening once in a while. Near the end she say like "" finish already"" like she can't get away and want it to end. This really choked me up and broke my heart. I don't think she knew him and maybe he picked her up at a bar.

Bill goes to my family’s house all the time, and has been there when no one was home probably multiple times. He has also asked to borrow my brother’s truck, and tried to get his keys from other people. He also calls my brother his “brother” and my mom his “momma”.

56,"Hi all,

I’m currently in my second year at college, and I’m majoring in history with the intent of becoming a secondary history teacher. Or at least that used to be the intention.

Now I’m not exactly sure what I want to do. I am very interested in history, but I no longer want to become a teacher anymore. However, most people have told me that if you aren’t teaching history, there isn’t much you can do with your history degree.

I’ve seen and heard many different people say that if you just straight up get a degree in history and don’t study anything else, then you will have trouble finding a job related to your history degree. 

I’m worried because I want to study history because that is what I’m most interested in, but I don’t know if that is the best idea due to, at least what people have told me and what I’ve heard online, that there isn’t many jobs available for history degree holders.

I’ve thought about straight up switching my major, but I have no idea what I would want to switch it to. Some people have also told me to not switch my major but to also minor in something, which I’ve also considered, but I don’t know what to minor in that would be a good mix with a history major, (someone told me to minor in business, but I don’t know if that’s a good mix with a history major.)

Overall, at the current moment in time, I’ve just very confused and stressed out over this whole situation, and I don’t know what to do.

So I have a bit of an interesting scenario. I want my jacket back from this girl I was seeing but let me explain first...

Me and this girl were seeing each other for two months when I finally asked to see what we were doing she said she wanted to remain casual which I was fine with.

However, after some thought and time it felt weird to me that’d she be with other guys and we would still share time together if that makes sense. That’s not how I like to do things etc.  

So about a week or two after we had that conversation I called her to meet up to study, she said great you can join me and my friend to which I said okay cool just let me know when you’re heading over there so I can leave.

7 hours later I text her like “ so are we studying or?” and I got this lame response which basically implied “ come if you want but I don’t care either way”. It was at that point I said fuck this I’m out.

I didn’t respond to her text or 6 snaps that followed because they felt like bullshit, plain and simple.
I called her today to see if I could come grab it, no pickup which is fine. I sent a text explaining why I called and got back a “ lol”. I replied with “ is that a yes or?”, haven’t gotten a response yet but she’s seen the text.

She’s a very independent person who liked things on her terms and that was cool but it led to me just feeling like I was like a second option and never truly wanted.
SOOOO with all that, am I ever seeing this jacket again? Lol

When we don't interact often, I start to worry. I worry that they are tired of me. That me, being an ""older"" friend and having newer friends that my time as being a close friend has ended and replaced. 
I've asked several times if we're good, and they get upset, like really upset. I've made big conflicts about my friendship with this person so I understand why they get mad when asked about the subject, but at the same time, by them getting mad, it scares me even more. I feel like I can't ask them if we're still friends and that worry is constantly on me. 

Lately, we've not spoken basically at all. We'd have a lot of conversations in the past and because schedules have changed, we've not had a conversation. In forever. 

The pressure got to me and I told them that we should go our separate ways. I didn't think about them nor the consequences at the time. It just felt good lifting that stress off my shoulders. 
I know I shouldn't have said it but I did and now they are really really mad at me (understandably). I hurt them...again. 

My reasoning is lately, while I know they can't talk to me much, I still try to tell them that I love them. I PMed them saying ""I miss you :( "" and got no response regarding it and they just talked about something else. 
But the next day, another friend PMed them saying the same thing, and they were so happy and I was sad. 

So with what's been said, am I a bad friend? ",27Nov2018,1

73,"Hey all,

On mobile so sorry for formatting and throwaway because I’m paranoid. TL:DR at the bottom. For background i’m 18 and I’ve worked at this Chinese restaurant for about two years. First I was doing deliveries for them (paid under the table) and for the past 6 months I’ve been doing waitressing after work at my full time job. I absolutely love working here. The owners are a Chinese couple who cook all the food in the back. They are an absolute delight and I make pretty good tips. They are also really lax about my hours because they know I work my ass off at my other job. I planned on staying here until next year when I leave for university. 

I never really noticed anything wrong with the place when I was doing deliveries because I only came in the store to pick up food and get paid but now that i’m here almost everyday for three or four hours at a time I’ve noticed some things. I am a bit of a neat freak (thanks mom) so I notice everything that’s even the slightest bit dirty but it is a whole new level of gross in here. Carpet is stained and the checkered floors are almost unrecognizable. The floor underneath the buffet table is literally black from never being washed. The walls are gross and dingy and have food splashed on them.

The thing that gets me the most is the kitchen. The first time I walked back there it was a huge shock. It looks like it’s never been cleaned once. And they clean the meat and chicken in the sink that they do dishes and I can almost guarantee it they don’t clean the sink after. I just don’t know what to do or say. I told my boyfriend that I’ve considered calling the health department on them but I know that it could possibly put them out of business and me out of one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. I’ve pointed out a couple things like saying “I think the carpets are due for a cleaning soon” but it feels like she just brushes me off. I love this restaurant and the food is incredibly but I know the customers probably think the same as me. Nobody really eats inside the restaurant, most people order take out or delivery and quite honestly I can see why. 

Anyways, I guess what i’m trying to ask is, is there a nice way for me to tell my bosses that the restaurant is disgusting or what should I do? I love them like my second family and want to see their business thrive but I feel stuck as to how to help them. 

TL;DR: The restaurant I work for is extremely gross and I don’t know how to tell them that they need to do something. ",27Nov2018,1

81,"A single mom I know (Aisha) is at wits end trying to get support from her ex, the dad. When I heard her situation, I got her permission to post here for advice. 

The ex, who I'll refer to as DBD (deadbeat dad) is currently $8,000 in arrears. My friend signed up for county enforcement but DBD is self employed which is making getting paid difficult. 

According to Aisha, DBD just bought a 300k house last year, buncv oug new vehicles for his business, 100+ acres of land, etc. Aisha is hoping she doesn't have to spend several thousand more to get nothing in the end (spent $4000 on a lawyer this year). She's been fully supporting their child for years and is getting little or no support from DBD. Aisha also says she does not qualify for a pro bono lawyer. 

Some more detailed info based on some questions I asked Aisha. It's a long wall of text, sorry. I edited/shortened some of her responses for length and privacy reasons:

**Was there an outcome of the legal action you took this summer?**

*I filed a motion for child support in March. Finally able to see a judge in June after mediation in May. Mediation was not successful as he tried to say the only support he agreed on was one third of what it shows he should be paying. At court, he did not show up. It was me, my attorney, and his attorney. His attorney called him several times but he did not answer. The judge waited 20 mins and then went on with it. He took the case and said ""I will let you know after the hearing"". He is allowed 90 days. And took all of that. There was a lot of info since he is self employed and hides assets, etc. 
So, from the decision in Sept and I wad given a 6 month review opportunity. That is most important issue: how can I get him to pay without going back to an attorney again? I wish I could get a pro bono lawyer as it gets crazy expensive.* 

*In the decision we were told to use 3rd party communication (he has not followed this. He failed to set up an acct), and a change in the visitation-he gets her more in the summer. Previously, I had her 4 of 7 days and now it is 50-50. Also now I have to drive her to his residence which is about 70 miles one way. When we originally divorced in 2013 I reserved child support and he was to do the transportation of my daughter to and from my house to where he was living. I was only given $60 per month (which was for half her health insurance) at that time with him doing transport. We had equal wages and he should have paid a lot more but I only asked for minimal knowing I could go back and to prevent ruffle at the time. There was some back pay that could have been collected from the $60/ mo but I chose just to go forward and get a number set from the motion forward. The judge ruled support and back pay to March. I went with the county (unfortunately takes 2 percent of my support) as my attorney and I decided it would be best since they can do enforcement, particularly with his history of not paying. I feel it is unfair that I am paying medical, child care, clothing, sports fees, food, etc for my daughter and she receives nothing from her dad. Now I am driving her up to her dad's which increases my expense. He is responsible for bringing her back. Top it off that it is a stressful drive that gives me one hour to get from his place to mine during rush hour I can't leave any earlier because she is in school. I feel I have lost all around while he gets to smirk as he is now paying nothing and I am having to foot half the transport.*

**Has your ex responded to the court with any reason for nonpayment?** 

*No. He also has not responded to the county who will be serving him papers again on December 5th, which will inform him that the credit bureaus will be notified *and that he is set to lose his drivers license due to arrears.* However, they give a month notice, then 90 days and then he can apply for a 90 day extension. He also can just say he doesn't have money and try and weasel out.*

**Has he texted/emailed you anything saying he can't pay, or can pay but won't?** 

*DBD is the one that requested 3rd party communication because his girlfriend (now ex g.f.) didn't trust him due to his infidelity. He tried talking to me several times and I said I would not talk to him after he made sure to keep sending emails and texts that I was the problem and I was not to talk to him. I am done with that game and think he now realizes I will call the police on him after he threatened me regarding calling the police. Needless to say, the officer made him leave my property.*

*As a business owner, he makes false receipts and hides cash. He writes off things like buying his girlfriend roses and taking snowmobile trips as business expenses. He falsified his income a ton this past year as he filed taxes right after being served child support docs. Guess what, 2017 was less than half (almost one third) of the income of previous years. But he always zeros out to owing nothing in taxes despite a 6 figure salary due to his write offs. But he also just bought 80 acres of land and home in Aug of 2017 ($350k) plus owns the adjoining 80 acres. He has 2 new trucks a semi, 3 skidsteers (one was 80k), an it (30k for hunting but wrote off as business). He has bags of cash and hides money everywhere. My daughter has even brought that up.*

*So the gist is he has plenty of money, more than I make, just doesn't want to pay. My main hope was to find someone who has been through problems with an ex who owned a small business and failed to pay support. I would like to know how effective county enforcement is. Obviously he has to pay food, utilities, house payment, etc. On top of what he has for business and play. So he has money.*

*I would like to hear from someone about what to expect during the 6 month review. I feel like he is not following the court order. But yet also I've read that judges likely don't change anything based on the review. It would take filing a motion, which costs money and would probably need to be done through an attorney. It's a huge can of worms and hope to find some leads. I tried to answer what I thought was relevant.*

I appreciate any and all help from anyone. Thanks!",27Nov2018,1
82,"Hi everyone. TL;DR below.

Recently I've realized more and more than I am fairly intrigued by ""bad"" or ""tragic"" or ""sad"" events; I don't know the best word to use, because they're not **always** really bad, so I'll try to explain.

First, a disclaimer: tragic events, such as shootings or war or things like 9/11 are, of course, horrible tragedies and when I think of these events I do feel really awful and I feel for the people and families involved. **I am NOT saying that I am ignoring effects on human life; I am still very much empathetic and emotionally impacted when I hear of these events, and I understand how horrible they can be. And OF COURSE I would NEVER think of doing anything so incredibly horrible and shitty as any of the things I talk about below, I'm not insane.**

That being said, I find myself intrigued by and interested in some of these types of events. I once watched a 45 minute 9/11 documentary, a chronological timeline of the entire day and aftermath, and while of course it made me very upset, the video was just so... interesting. Like, what were people who were involved in any way feeling, thinking, and doing? How exactly did the hijackers do it and how did they fly the planes? What was the mobilization of emergency services like, the grounding of air traffic? What did people around the world think of it? And I feel somewhat ashamed of saying this, but while actually seeing with my own eyes the planes hitting the towers and them collapsing, I couldn't help but think of the physics and chemistry and architecture involved while also feeling totally down and depressed about it.

Just earlier today I saw a video (the trigger for this post) about the Dec. 16, 2001 cleveland browns vs. jacksonville jaguars NFL game, where the officiating was completely bonkers and fans threw tons of glass bottles onto the field, hurting players and security and the referees. Yes, I know that was a horrible and unfair situation, but seeing what happened and seeing the fans so angry also intrigued me. Why did the refs do that? What was it like getting pelted with glass bottles? How did the players feel? Was anyone punished for it? etc, etc.

And I feel even worse for talking about shootings, but since we've had so many recently, its hard not to. Whenever I hear or read about the most recent one, tons of questions that I want answers for go through my head: what was it like inside? how did people get out? how many people will die? why are the injury/death counts usually so low? what did people do to help save others? what was the psychological condition of the shooter(s)? what were the triggers for this event? has anyone posted footage of it actually happening? what does it feel like to be shot? what would I do in an active shooter situation? what if one happened at my university? 

And god, as I write more I feel even worse, but when a shooting, or any other tragic event for that matter, is on the news, I feel glued to it, wanting to know as many details as possible.

If these are warning signs for me going crazy, I certainly want to stop it in its tracks. I feel normal, and like I said I would NEVER do anything like these things, but... it also feels wrong for me to be so invested in tragedies like 9/11 or shootings or even just events like a riot at an NFL game.

Please help. Is this normal? Do I need to fix this? How do I fix this? Thanks.

**TL;DR:** when a tragic event occurs or I find out about an event in the past that was pretty bad overall, I find myself to be really interested in it, while also feeling very sad and angry about it happening (9/11, shootings, riots, etc). I can't help but want to know more, I can't just stop at accepting it as a tragedy and being sad about it. Is this normal? How do I stop doing it?",27Nov2018,1

89,"So essentially my (ex) boyfriend and I broke up last month. There was another guy (who was just a friend at the time) who asked me out a week later. So this guy is so fucking sweet and makes me so happy and I said yes to him. My first mistake. Everything went so fucking well. My ex began to hate me then soon a few weeks later we made up and I snuck out to his house two days in a row and shit happened. I told my boyfriend about everything and he forgave me. So my ex did things to piss me off (I'll leave those details out) so we went on hating each other for almost two weeks. One Friday I had to go to the hospital and my ex knew and Tuesday I found out something that somewhat involved him. So that Tuesday I was pissed at him for blocking me on snap (stupid I know) and texted him so later that day we were talking and we actually made up then he felt really bad about what the doctors had said and offered to do anything. So he snuck over to my house that night to comfort me. The next day (Wednesday) my bf came over and we hung out and had a nice time and we actually hooked up (i don't really regret but I wish it was later) Then Thursday (Thanksgiving) comes along and my ex and I decide to hang out that night. So I went over to his house. And we fucking hooked up. Yes, I regret it. Yes, I feel horrible and disgusting. So anyways my ex and I have been on pretty good terms.

93,"It all started at their rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding a few months ago, that our mom had been excited to plan and she was given the okay by both my brother and the bride.  However, during dress shopping she was told by the bride and her mother that it’s already been taken care of. Then a month before the wedding our mom had been visiting them and the bride just mentions the plans for the rehearsal and then just turns to my mom asks/states “you’re paying for it, right?” All she can do is turn to my brother and ask “am I?”. All my bother says in return is “yes please”.

Fast forward to the night of the rehearsal dinner and after everyone has eaten and most people had left and there was still a ton of food left and my mom just absentmindedly asks one of the brides moms friend about what to do with all the food as no one ever told her any sort of plan.
In comes the brides mom just laying into my mom yelling and screaming at her that she doesn’t need to be talking about her behind her back and that they had plans for the food to be served at the gift opening on Sunday brunch(which our mom had just been invited to last minute and I had not been told about it until that day) along with my personal favorite of “you’re trying to ruin this wedding”. Now she does this in front of the bride and our oldest brother and his wife. My brother later tells me that they had been told by the bride “maybe you both should leave”. I’m told about this the next day of the wedding which thankfully had gone well and no hiccups and our mom had pushed what had happened to the back of her mind and danced and mingled and played with her grandchildren the whole night with a genuine smile on her face.

Cut to a week later, my newly married brother has screamed at our mom and accused her of not having fun at the wedding and that she wasn’t being supportive enough and then just stopped answering her calls and will only respond to some of her texts with I’m busy.

Cut to last Friday and my now fiancée and the the bride have coffee as she’s in town. During coffee they have (I’m told) a brief discussion of that night and they bride basically said that my mom was overreacting and then as of Sunday told my brother that his side of the family have been talking shit about her (we weren’t). My brother in response has been yelling at our mom, saying that she has been treating the bride like shit since the wedding and that he is also super upset with our eldest brother and his wife. However, we aren’t given reason for the anger at them, but it’s apparently enough to say that they won’t attend any Christmas celebration with them and their kids included.

I’m at the end of my rope, my mom is close to breaking down at this point and I don’t know what to do with them.

Any advice would be appreciated.

94,"Not sure where to turn for this issue, but here I go.

So, I studied abroad last year as a high school student. Never used social media before, but they insisted I get facebook for my program. Right away people add me, mostly Japanese people, and I would check to see mutual friends and shit before adding them. Got tons of random requests, declining all of them.

One day I get a message from someone who I assumed was part of my program. We had some mutual friends and he had studied abroad before too. He asks me questions about me and my hobbies and such, no red flags. I feel absolutely dumb as fucking shit for talking to this guy, but honestly I've never had creepy encounters irl or otherwise before this.

At some point he talks about meeting up, and I say sure not taking it seriously. He keeps bringing it up, I maybe talked with him 5 times total all shallow conversations that didn't last long. I was having issues with my host family at the same time so I didn't think about it much. 

After he mentions meeting up I actually checked his profile and he wasn't related at all to my program, although his pictures showed girls from I assume other programs, he mentioned AFS. Eventually I tell him I'm busy, have a strict host family, had to leave Japan pretty soon, and refused to meet him. I was rude but not too rude to the point where he might become dangerous. He mentioned something about writing a song to explain how he feels. That's when I blocked him.

No issues for a couple of months. A couple of weeks ago he turned up in my instagram searches as recommended, figured it was the facebook/instagram algorithm

Flash foward to today. I get a message from an actual older member of my program early in the morning, just a hello and how are you doing. The conversation went weird pretty quick, I want to talk to you more, lets meet up, etc. Then the real kicker ""ttyl"". The creeper used this and considering that god forbid someone still use that phrase it put me on high alert. I left for school and my paranoia grew throughout the day.

I want to mention that this older member I hardly knew. He's messaged me before, but his tone wasn't as… friendly? I'm pretty awkward so he just seemed more business like, these messages made it seem like he was nervous. He went on outings with us exchange students and treated me like the rest of the exchange students, honestly I wasn't super liked by the group so I hadn't talked to the older members as much as the other exchange students.

I get back home and he starts messaging me soon after, it's morning in Japan then. I immediately try to verify it's him. Ask him if he's contacted other students- no. Ask him if he's going on the big trip in March this year which is the highlight of the program. He says yes, he's going on Eurotour. We sure as hell don't go to Europe, I ask him if he knows what I'm talking about, he says he was confused by my question. I lie and say I don't remember the name of the place, he says ""Like Kyoto?"", which is the correct place of the trip, a super popular tourist area in Japan.
I want to highlight that this guy went on the big Kyoto trip with me and literally everyone in the program knows about it. 
Ask one last question, get a generic yes I guess answer. Tried giving no hints to what I'm talking about as if it was him, I felt he should've known automatically. Said bye and he sent some corny sticker- I can't imagine this member doing this.

I've been super stressed lately which might cloud my thinking, but am I being way too paranoid? I get this gut feeling that the older program member isn't the one messaging me, our short conversation reminded me way too much of the creeper before. Is it unreasonable to think he somehow hacked the guy's account?

I changed all my privacy settings and have limited my info on the internet, my name is rare and easy to look up. Any help with this is appreciated.",27Nov2018,1
95,"I’ve always been a pretty paranoid person, but I think shootings have been a fear that feels more and more real to me than anything. It’s gotten to a point where I dislike/avoid any public areas like movies, malls, or any party without people that I know. I have started sitting near exits or places to hide whenever I end up going to those places. Anytime that I think I’m finally enjoying myself, my mind ends up tracing off and I start having thoughts like “what’ll I do if something actually happens “ or “who around me looks suspicious.”  I think it’s causing people to think I’m a massive downer or that I’m awkward. I feel conflicted because I’m wondering I’m just acting crazy or being safe. I wanna abandon these thoughts sometimes but I feel like the moment I think “it can’t happen to me,” then I’ll just be the least prepared.

96,"Long story short. 
For years I've had unfair treatment at work . It all started when I stood up for my self and since then , at times it has been hell . The last few months have had a few changes and it was prevalent that they were advancing others and denying me of the same opportunities  . They have taken jobs and away, and stopped me for duties that I am capable of , given clearance by my GO, lied about multiple things , bitched about me to my back, bullied me to change my roster , despite having outside commitments that they were aware of before my employment etc etc .
There's too much of what they've done to me, but hopefully you get that they made my life uncomfortable enough for me to leave .
So I quit . I resigned last night amicably and asked for my cease of employment to begin immediately.  Boss was okay with it .
The last time I quit, my depression became so bad that I spend the year in bed . Depressed ,hating life and wanting to die . I got a job within that year and quit after a few days, I couldn't handle it .

99,"i'm super superrrr into music, but instead of engaging in that stuff with me, i get called pretentious by one of my friends sometimes. occasionally they call my music weird or don't even respond when i say something about music. like one time my friend was playing a song by Bastille on the aux, so i simply stated that it was my favorite song by them, and neither one of my friends even acknowledge it

it's hard already having close friends that aren't into what i'm passionate about, but i deal with it. i never really have anyone to talk about music with except my brother, and our music taste does not align at all.

i just wish they would respect what i'm into, and *especially* not call me pretentious just because i have an actual music taste. they're the types of people that just listen to music whenever and throw on the same stuff, including a lot of pop. they don't branch out into different genres or much past the top 40 unless someone else tells them about it. they don't really listen to full albums at all, just singles and whatever the most popular songs from albums are.

i'm not sure whether to just stop talking about music with them or just deal with it or try to find people i can connect better with. it makes me feel at a disconnect with them sometimes because i can't jam to the music i truly love with them in the car, or anyone for that matter, i have to do it alone. and i really really need people in my life that i have music in common with, since it's my biggest passion

102,"This will be long so I apologize. My wife and I do not have a healthy relationship. We have been married for less than a year,and have only know each other for a total of 2 years, only dated for a few months before getting engaged. All of the engagement and first few months of marriage were us dealing with health issues. She was not healthy and functioning and I was the only one that chose to take care of her.  She has been getting better but our relationship has not in my eyes. She has several issues that affect her mentally that really take a toll on my mental health as well. She will have episodes where she almost loses herself and will say and do anything to emotionally hurt me. At the end of it all, we say we will do better and work it out but it isn’t happening. We are currently going to couples counseling but I cannot say how I feel without fear of the fallout. 

About 7 weeks ago, I had to take a last minute trip to help my brother. He tried to commit suicide. My family and I went to where he goes to college to support him through it. She became angry on a phone call I made to her and basically said that she doesn’t understand why we had to be there for him. Now we had a trip planned with her friends, that she still got to go on. She was angry that I chose helping my brother over a vacation with her friends. During that call, she randomly says that she thinks she’s pregnant and hangs up. A week later we both get back into town. She’s angry with me as soon as she walks in the door. Starts crying and yelling at me because I opened the garage door for her but I didn’t stand and wait for her to pull in. She then proceeds to tell me that we either have to have kids or she is going to look at pursuing her career away from where we live. That was the options: we have kids or she leaves. I told her I do not want kids because it is just not responsible for us to do so. She then tells me she’s pregnant and starts yelling that she is going to get an abortion (something we both are against personally). She walks in our backyard and screams it. I leave the house and stay with family who lives close by. We talk in the morning and I say we get counseling or I am done. Fast forward a week, she wakes up in the middle of the night and says she had a miscarriage. Not pregnant anymore according to her. We have unprotected sex twice after in the following week. 

Fast forward to last week, we are heading into the marriage counselors office. We go to the bathroom before. I’m waiting for her to come out and she comes out with a pregnancy test. It’s positive. I’m in shock. Don’t have time process it. We go into counseling. We both know the right answers to say so we say them instead of being honest. 

Now we are about to go home from a vacation with her family, and I love them. I love being away from home. I love spending time with her family. But I just do not want to go home. I don’t want to spend time with her. I want to be single and start over and move somewhere new. I’m going crazy I think. I just don’t care about anything anymore.

103,"So ever since i was in highschool i have been of short stature and as a male its not a fun time, especially when it comes to dating. So i decided my senior year of highschool to give up on dating women because i dont want to go through bullshit. Giving up has actually made me very happy and i feel very strong mentally. Being short doesnt make me feel scared of others, i dont fear anyone at any height. But girls certainly percieve short staure with being less manly and less dominant. Im in my mid twenties now as a kissless virgin but it really doesnt bother me because i have carried the ""fuck other people and what they think"" attitude forever. I just need some advice on if im making a good decision by having given up on women. Am i being too critical of myself? I just have a hard time believing anything good can happen if i open myself up to the dating world.

Another big reason why i dont want to date is because i dont want to fall in love and have a child. Especially if that child is a boy. I dont want someone i love to have to deal with the pain of being a short man like i have. ",27Nov2018,1

On the way back I felt sort of nauseous so I stopped to go to the bathroom but halfway through the door everything went black. I woke up propping open the door with my body. I felt faint and my vision was blurry and I couldn’t stand up. I felt an immense a urge to puke and so I crawled through the door of the bathroom and bent over the toilet but nothing would come out.

I enjoy her company, she’s nice and she makes me laugh!

She’s a little messy but doesn’t spend much time here, she’s usually at her boyfriend’s. If I ever had a problem with her I’ve told her and she’s been respectful (ie leaving light in kitchen on and it lights up my room at night, walking around kitchen in heels, putting her dishes away... you know small stuff that’s not a big deal. Always says sorry and then makes an effort not to do whatever thing, she’s not a bad roommate or anything basically).

This is just my example for today. I do this more frequently for some reason with her, but it’s with other things. Its like I become riddled with anxiety or depression about something and then do the thing and I feel back to my normal self or something.

125,"I'm not really looking for advice on the assault itself but I'll summarize it for the purpose of my post. 

The assault:

My guy friend from work and I were being very flirty towards each other. We've been out drinking several times and have made out a few times before this night. On the night of the assault he went too far and got aggressive. He pushed his hand down my pants and I couldn't move it. I asked him to stop, told him repeatedly that I didnt want him to do what he was doing. This is a very summarized account of the evening but you get the idea. 

I've forgiven him for the most part. We're friendly at work, it's hard to explain but that's for another post. But I still think about it all the time and its changed my opinion on sexual assault and obviously him. I can't help but resent him, and everytime he talks about a woman or partying all I can think about are other women hes must of done this to. 

Where I need advice:

I'm on the management team and I have a say in the promotion process for the new position. I'm concerned for a lot of reasons. I'm worried about my personal feelings and bias affecting my ability to evaluate his skills in the workplace. Either decision I make can come back negatively if this comes out in the future. 

I guess what I'm feeling my options are is talking to my boss and letting him know I can't be a part of the hiring process. He'll want a reason and I wonder how forthcoming I should be. Worried about the stigma, about others finding out, worried about losing my job even. I went out drinking with this guy. I could get fired for having a ""relationship"" with him. 

Or do I just go through with the hiring process, try to make the best decision for my company and suppress my feelings. Like I said earlier, I have forgiven him so I dont want this to be a big deal but I can't help the fact that I have these feelings and could potentially work side by side with this man. I'm more emotionally hurt than physically worried about him. Hurt that a friend did this to me and now I'm in this position and mad at myself for putting myself in this position as well. 

I love my company and I just want to do what's best.

127,"So there's this girl at my workplace, she's ...... fat, like really fat, and I'm cool with fat people, I'd sweet love to a fat chick if I see that she's working on it and has self esteem low enough (joke), but she's one of those ""fat pride"" feminists, I work out and practice boxing and BJJ so I'm pretty fit. Now at a work party she came onto me, I tried to be polite and told her no, when she began showing signs of being offended I signaled a friend (that ""yo I need a hand here"" sign) and he called me over, so I told her ""thanks tho! I'm flattered."" and left to hang with my friends.

The is, now she's trying to make my life miserable at the office, not much effect, but it's getting annoying, whenever I'm grabing a cup of tea or smoking and she's there with other people, she changes the subject to relationships and always ends up involving me with a ""Well but people like Kyle can only get stuff paying for it"" or something around the lines that I cannot get laid, I usually laugh it off with some self-deprecating jokes in good sport.

I have my fair shair of women so I'm not worried about it, but she keeps making these jokes around everyone and it's starting to get out of hand, people are starting to come to me and tell me to put her in her place, but it honestly seems like it'll do more harm than not and I don't want to upset her even more, she seems to have pretty low self esteem.

Anyone got any advice on this?",27Nov2018,1
128,"A little back story: my fiancé’s grandma is in her late 70s. Her husband (fiancé’s grandpa) passed in June. Married 60 years! Since then she hasn’t left the house, tried talking to anyone except her daughters (fiancé’s mom and aunt) who have to do everything for her because of a bunch of medical problems. 

She’s clearly depressed. Took anti depression meds one time and said she didn’t like the side effects. Literally one pill. She’s stubborn and won’t listen to anyone. 

The big problem is she won’t sleep alone at night so my fiancé’s mom or aunt has to stay with her every night which has really taken a mental and physical toll on them. I️ saw it over thanksgiving. They are dead behind the eyes. 


How can I️ help? What do I️ do? They are on a fast track to heart disease right now not eating anything besides burgers because they have no time between work and caring for their checked out mother. It’s like the day my fiancé’s grandpa died so did his grandma. 

There’s a lot to this story but I’m willing to fill in details where needed. ",27Nov2018,1
129,"I'm a guy in university. I met a girl sort of indirectly through a cultural event on campus back in Spring and got her number and we texted a bit and I was interested in pursuing her, but she had a boyfriend. We texted a bit here and there and I'd chat briefly with her if I ran into her in person but we didn't chat really past Spring.

Fast forward to Fall and I text her to get back in touch. We text a bit and she eventually mentions still having a boyfriend. We text a little bit about a professional organization on campus that I'm part of and she was considering joining. I give her info on that. Something like a week or two later, I briefly run into her at a football game and we say hey. Once the game was over and people were leaving, I noticed her walking out with a friend and looking back at me in a way like she was trying to avoid me, just didn't seem positive. I texted a little bit later saying sorry if I weirded her out or something and she responded and indicated things were okay. 

Sometime after that(can't remember how long), I text her about the first meeting of the professional organization and I later see her at it and chat a little bit afterward about being glad she came and what she's been up to lately but not for very long since I could discern that she wasn't overly interested in chatting. Sometime within a week or two later, I ran into her on campus randomly and said hey. I think it was just a day or two later that I got a voicemail from a campus police officer about wanting to talk. I called him and he said I didn't do anything criminal or even remotely criminal but that the girl came to the police and doesn't want me contacting her or approaching her. I said it was insulting or something and expressed disbelief about someone going to the police about that kind of thing and he said he tends to agree with me and it's unfortunate that he had to be a mediator.

That was probably close to two months ago. I've had a few instances of being around her because of an organization meeting or something like that, but haven't wanted to actually interact.

Tonight, there was a fundraiser event for the organization at a dessert shop and I went and noticed her there and ended up getting a drink, leaving but then going back instead because I wanted to get a receipt to show the organization and then leaving and drinking the drink on a curb nearby since I didn't want to be in there. It just bothers me to see her because it was insulting how she went to the police just for me being persistent in talking to her and I just felt uncomfortable being in the shop.

I drank the drink while standing on a nearby curb and just thought about it and felt angry. I eventually went over and stood by my car, in a parking lot, and leaned on it and just got lost in my thoughts. I just felt really bothered by remembering what had happened. Eventually, I noticed her and a friend of hers walking over to the parking lot and I then got in my car and left since they saw me and I felt like she'd be weirded out just by me being there. I ended up feeling concerned that she would freak out and contact the police just because I was there. Especially considering how surprised I was that she went to the police months back for talking to her, how much might she freak out by seeing me in a parking lot at night, even if it is decently-lit? It just bothers me. 

I'm just sick of this situation. I will point out that I'm around 6'1"" tall and over 300lb and she's noticeably attractive (would probably be described as hot), so I have concern that it's the kind of situation where she would easily play a victim over nothing.

131,"I know it sounds like clickbait 
I’m also not certain if 100% of students actually go to college

tl;dr at bottom

I’m 15M, sophomore, and go to a very prestigious high school, one of the top high schools in the US (top 100 IIRC.) Almost everyone at the school seems to have a plan for college including me (to a certain extent, mainly the plan is just “apply to here, here, and here,” where each location is of a certain difficulty to enter.) So getting into a college itself isn’t the main problem, I have a 3.8 GPA and I can take tons of AP courses (taking 2 right now.) 

The main problem is motivation. I know and understand that I’m a moody teen and hormones and etc etc. However I look at the grand scheme of things and it just doesn’t seem very reasonable. Spend 9 years learning basic courses then spend 3 years taking courses that you will only ever use if you pursue a certain career path and even then you end up not using the other two thirds. Then finally you spend 4-8 years studying multiple courses in college where everything is over priced and then leaves you in debt for years. Also, in high school, they don’t even teach you how to adult. They don’t teach me how to do taxes, invest in any sort of market, or even cooking to feed myself.

Also, school is boring. Like astronomically, record-breaking boring. Out of the 8 classes I take now, I only enjoy 2. Those being physics and English. And mainly because the teachers are chill, I get to hang out with my friends, and because I get to sound smart every now and then in conversations. In almost every class, if it weren’t for my friends, it would be a better use of my time to sleep. 

My 9th grade engineering teacher once said to me: “knowledge is information without use. Wisdom is information you put to use”
Basically “knowledge is knowing that tomatoes are fruits but wisdom is not putting a tomato in a fruit salad”

It seems like I would be better off just finishing high school, teaching myself all these life skills, teach myself how to code at my own pace, then find a job in the coding(?) field

I could go on for ages about I don’t think school is worth it and how the education system (at least in America) is completely broken and not up to standards but I’m gonna stop it here

tl;dr I think high school and beyond isn’t worth it as it doesn’t teach me practical skills and is a major waste of time. I’m not motivated to go to college as I believe I could live a good life by not going and teaching myself a few skills that I can use to find a good job and live comfortably 

Anyone else ever experience this? How did you get over it?

Note: I don’t know if r/advice is the best place for this. If there’s a better place please tell me and I will post it there.",27Nov2018,1
132,"A girl who I used to go to school with was known for hitting up guys who she knew were taken and would send them unsolicited nude photos and try to get them to hook up with her. I was dating a guy at the time who she liked to talk to. I didn’t tell him not to talk to her because I trusted him but I asked him if he would ever date her and he promised he would never because she constantly cheats on her own boyfriends and tries to get other guys to cheat on their girlfriends. A few days after I broke up with him (after two years of being together)  he hooked up with her because he knew she would have sex with him. I’m sure she was sending him pictures while we were dating now because of how quick they got together. 

Today, this girl texted my current boyfriend out of the blue trying to ask how he’s doing and what he’s up to. She hasn’t seen or spoken to him for almost a year but she has texted me telling me that she thought me and my boyfriend were a cute couple, so she is fully aware we are dating. She has not said anything flirty to him but I know she will because it’s what she always does.

Would it be okay for me to text her and ask her respectfully to leave him alone? She has tried to flirt with him in the past and doesn’t put up with it but she doesn’t care. I usually don’t get jealous or possessive but it is different because of how she has been in the past.  I told my boyfriend if he wanted to talk to her he totally could but he knows what happened and he wants nothing to do with her. He supports me telling her to kindly fuck off but I don’t want to be an asshole even through she’s been awful to me and a lot of other people. 

Sorry, I know this is long but I just don’t know what to do and I tried to explain as well as I could. I trust my boyfriend but I don’t trust her whatsoever and I want her to know I don’t want her anywhere near my current boyfriend.  Should I say something or keep to myself?",27Nov2018,1
133,"So I currently live in NYC and have been living here for about 2 years now. I'm 25 years old and have quickly moved up the latter at my company, making good money.

However, lately I've been having thoughts of moving to LA in the next 6-12 months. Having grown up on the east coast, this would be a really big move for me.

I think the main reason I want to move to LA is for a change of pace while still working in a major market. I'm generally a really driven person and work really really hard but I'm beginning to experience some burn out in NYC. Secondly, the weather plays a really big factor in my overall happiness so LA would be a nice bump from NYC.

134,"I’m currently a consultant here in Myanmar, my girlfriend and I was hanging out Saturday night just drinking and watching Netflix. We overheard loud screaming and someone stumbling into the neighbors house, my girlfriend reassured me it’s probably nothing.

10 minutes go by, and we heard some loud shattering through our walls and extremely loud yelling and thumping. We could only hear the voice of the husband, none from the wife or little girl. Eventually we texted for advice from the locals we know, they said that it’s common and people don’t usually intervene in domestic affairs.

After 30 minutes, we decided to go to our front door balcony and turned on the lights and waited. We saw the wife in tears running out and the husband violently grabbing her by the arm and dragging her back inside. 
My girlfriend yelled “stop! What are you doing to her?!?”
The wife smiled. The husband said “Sorry sorry, no problem”
My girlfriend hid behind the door in tears, I impulsively yelled at the husband “what the fuck are you doing man, that’s not right! You don’t do that!”

He looked high, and he had a smirk while saying “no problem ok?! No problem, go!” And eventually went inside.

After the altercation there was yelling for about 1 minute and what seemed to be someone cleaning.

The next day, we passed by the wife and try to acknowledge her by saying Hello several times. Several of the other neighbors visited their home what seemed like they’re helping her with the clean up.

My girlfriend and I have been struggling on what to do. I contacted several NGOs for women’s aid but never received a response and the police won’t do anything.

Does anyone have any advice at all who is familiar with Myanmar Culture? I really want to help the wife and child.

135,"Dear Reddit. I dug myself a grave and I know it, just wanting to know if there's any way out of it. Here's the story....

I moved to a new city for work and started dating a girl I met there, since we were both looking for a place to stay we decided to rent one for ourselves. We had dated for 3 months before we moved in and eventually I lost feelings for her, I didn't love anyone, but before we even moved in, our constant arguments drove me away from her, but since the money and security was already paid, I decided to move in as there was no where else to go.

We talk but not so much. She's said that she will find a different place for her and when she does, she'll move out. Currently I'm in a relationship with my best friend and the fact that I still live with my ex, bothers her and the fact that I'm dating someone else, bothers my ex.

How do I get myself out of this situation? Everytime me and my ex argue she threatens about filing an official complaint in the company against me for 'ruining her life' I don't want that to happen. I don't want my professional life to suffer because of my personal. I didn't 'ruin' her life in anyway. 

Also, my ex constantly argues about having guys over to her room and I don't approve of it because it is a house and I don't want unknown people walking in and out after one night stands..

I'd really appreciate if there was something that can be done in this situation...sorry for the long post! ",27Nov2018,1
136,"My 14 year old step-daughter is out of control! We just found out as of last night. That she has had sex twice. My fiancé just so happened to get up and went to lay on the couch because he couldn't sleep and heard some whispering in her room and found a boy in her room at 4:30am. He was rightfully dragged out of our apartment.  We then confronted her and found out she is sexually active.

Not even two weeks ago she was caught smoking weed inside our house. She proceeded to deny this until we bought a at home drug test that same night. She confessed before the test was taken (the whole house reeked of weed- I would know I smoke for my anxiety) We have tried taking away her lap top and phone but then that causes her to freak out and say ""I can't do this anymore, I want to kill myself, my life is over"" 

When she gets In trouble and her things get taken away she plays the ""victim"" and threatens to take her life or tries to take OTC pills to almost shove it in our faces. Her latest freak out was the weed day and she actually picked up a knife and then after that was taken away proceeded to try and get in the cabinet to get the OTC pills. 

The police were called but nothing was actually done, they said the couldn't ""force"" her go to talk with a therapist because she was under the influence and thought taking her by force would only lead to more issues. This has been the third time the cops have been called. 

I'm looking for advice and help, I honestly don't know what else I can do- she has seen a family therapist as well as individual therapy. I don't know what else I can do.

My biggest goal with doing this is going to a city that actually has a good music scene and getting my foot in the door with that since it’s my passion (I’ve been playing guitar for 14 years). I want to do anything related, business, production, performing, anything.

139,"Heyo - post-college failure here. I'm 25, two years after finishing my degree in Biochemistry - statistics and organic/analytical chemistry being the only things I was ever particularly good at past high school. Everyone's hope was that I'd make it to medical school, but I basically gave up on life for a while and ran my prospects into the ground after my father had a stroke; for a constellation of reasons, I ended up walking with a 2.96, which isn't exactly good enough to get through any doors despite an MCAT score of 512. I can't seem to make the cut for any type of professional education and have already blown my shot at my father's legacy; unfortunately, I'm also not networked with anyone in any industry and have almost no contacts at my alma mater, probably because for the first couple of years I just assumed things would go okay.

I would have liked to pursue medical informatics, pharmaceutical manufacture, or even some manner of information technology field that'd allow me to apply some of my knowledge as alternate paths, but not only do I lack networking or a sensible idea of where to begin along either of these avenues, they're also the sorts of things that require specialized education. I don't have the money to go back to school for any non-professional enterprise, and I'm well past the point in time where it makes sense to even consider such a thing. I'm currently living with my parents, both of whom are quite literally dying while they keep the family clinic above water - which requires my full-time employment to do. I'm sending out apps to medical schools every cycle, spending hundreds of dollars that I don't have just to keep people happy that I have prospects, and sitting on a mountain of rejection letters that are leaving me seriously questioning my life choices. I'm running out of time. Any sudden incident or change in health on behalf of anyone will end my life in an instant, as we can scarcely afford the life we're living now even with myriad measures made to cut costs. Realistically, our business won't last for more than another few years, and any of the roads I'm looking down leave me at the age of 32 or 33 with no marketable talents, no experience in any industry, and the mind of a child when it comes to most decisive life matters. The wasted years aren't helping me much, mentally or otherwise. Things didn't really just go okay.

That's really about it. I'm not entirely sure what my question is; in truth I had hoped I would think of it by the time I was through - and trust me, if I had the slightest idea, I'd be asking basically anywhere but here. Where can I find an experienced opinion, or something that will point me in a more positive direction? What do I do when I don't make it into someone's medical school, but my degree doesn't offer any other actual prospects? Do I keep grinding applications and hope to get lucky, or is this the part where I'm supposed to accept defeat - since I'm due to let myself and my family down anyway - and go spend the rest of my life in an unskilled job?",27Nov2018,1

I have been instructed to hand everything over the moment he comes in and “ find something else to do “ but there is nothing else to do, all positions are filled with people who can do the work adequately so I’m essentially been told to go do whatever intill the end of my shift or leave.

She knows that he's with me, that we have a child together, and that we are getting married in March 2019. She begged to go to our wedding and we sent her an invitation because of this reason. 

Today, she told my fiance that she is in love with him. I know that he doesn't like her and I trust him, but it really pissed me off. I feel like she disrespected me by doing that and I want to karate chop her throat endlessly. On the other hand, I also feel that everyone should be able to express their feelings. BUT then again...I think she told him this because she wants him to realize that he's in love with her too or something. 

Also my fiance is being overly nice to her about it all and when I mentioned that he should probably tell her that he's with me and loves me (which, admittedly, I said very sassily because my feelings are hurt), he got mad at me and didn't understand why I was ""acting like this"". 

So, what do I do? Every fiber in my being wants to contact her and let her know how disrespectful I think she's being. I feel like she thinks I am someone that she can walk all over (and that's why she told him). I am not. Do I generally actively avoid confrontation if I'm able to? Yes. Do I put up with disrespect?

144,"Hello fellow Redditors. I’m posting because I need some advice. To get straight to the point I recently separated from my girlfriend of a couple of years. We had an apartment together which is under both of our names. I just wasn’t happy with our relationship. She was always upset and frustrated about everything and I ultimately decided I needed to move forward on my on. I gathered my clothes and left with no plan really. With the apartment in both of our names it kind of put me in a pickle. I was the only person bringing in money as she is a full time student. I felt really bad about just up and leaving although she should have had some feeling with all the problems we had. 

To get to the point I’m homeless now to a point.  She has said to stay with her at the apartment and that she understands it’s over but I don’t think it’s the best course of action. I’ve been staying with friends and family over the last few weeks. I’m not really sure how to go about the housing situation. My housing situation is the least of my worries...

What’s really been bothering me is my life after this relationship. It’s been full of nothingness. I have a job that has afforded me the luxury of lots of time off and great pay so I’ve been driving around town the past few weeks with literally no plan. My life has changed so much since I left home. I have no direct responsibility ( my son lives in Jacksonville which is on the other side of the country ). 

Since being on my own I have found out that I don’t have a life. The highest point of my life is picking where I want to eat. I’m starting to get tired of living. My days are full of nothingness. Im sitting at a bar all alone and just trying to think where I’m gonna sleep tonight. I’ll probably just get a hotel room but I’m so frustrated. It’s only been two weeks and my life is so bland. I have spent the last 12 years of my life in a relationship for the most part. 

What should I do about my housing situation?
Anyone else ever feel this way? What did you do about it?

146,"This is my first time posting to Reddit, so I apologize in advance if I fail to follow any Reddit etiquette.

I live in a small town and (long story short) found out about and got unintentionally indirectly involved in a cover-up/hush-hush situation for a tragic murder-suicide between a professor couple at the local college. I'll refer to the professor couple as Prof1 and Prof2...identifying details of the situation changed for obvious reasons. (They taught in different departments, by the way.) Prof1 and his department head had an affair, and Prof2 eventually found out. Upon Prof2's discovery, Prof1 demanded a divorce, and Prof2 agreed to end their multi-decade old marriage. 

Prof2 did report the relationship to the college, but the institution's administration deemed the situation a ""private matter"" and just moved the department head to a director position in a similar field. (Mind you the department head involved in this has very close ties with the college's upper echelon. Ironically, a similar situation that occurred a few years ago under a different president resulted in the immediate firing of the superior involved in the affair.) 

During the divorce proceedings, Prof1 and his department head (well, now an academic director) started smearing Prof2, making claims that she was unfit for her position and was mentally unstable to take care of the couple's children. A frustrated Prof2 again wrote to the institution as a countermeasure against the smear campaign; she was very worried about losing her job and custody of the kids. (I know for a fact Prof2 was a loving parent through all of this, not to mention she repeatedly received glowing reviews from students annually.) Nothing was done by the college. Eventually, the stress of all of this boiled over and Prof2 killed Prof1 before taking her own life.

There was a meeting at the administration level following the tragedy, but the department head still has her job with no repercussions. The college's administration is hoping to leave this tragedy behind as a deranged soon-to-be ex-wife that sadly killed her husband, because that's how the local paper portrayed it. Ok, I get that what she did was wrong. I don't need someone telling me murder is wrong. But, what about the unprofessionalism of a superior having an affair with a married subordinate in an academic environment and the college president siding with that superior? Why is that not being reported? The college is not going to report this, because it will put administration (especially the president) in a bad light. It will permanently taint the images of both that president and this lady that thought it was appropriate to start an affair with a married man. 

My reason for reaching out to Reddit is to seek advice on how to navigate this. This is not a matter of what-if and uncertainty; I read all relevant records of communication (e.g. emails, texts, etc.) myself. I have not had a sound night of sleep since this happened. My heart breaks for the children first and foremost, and I do not know what the right thing to do is. I am struggling with protecting the privacy of the children and myself not wanting to be a bystander. To be frank, I believe this lady needs to leave town. She played a role in the complete disintegration of a marriage and a family. She has some nerve to keep her job and continue teaching around here. 

I have considered going to the local media, but the political ties around here are ridiculous. Everyone knows everyone, and I honestly do worry about my safety if I were to open my mouth publicly. What do I do, reach out to national media? I am at a loss for the next step. This just is not right. I suppose, ultimately, when the time is right, the kids should know the full story...and the fact that the truth behind the passing of their parents was not covered up. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",27Nov2018,1
147,"Not sure where to turn for this issue, but here I go.

So, I studied abroad last year as a high school student. Never used social media before, but they insisted I get facebook for my program. Right away people add me, mostly Japanese people, and I would check to see mutual friends and shit before adding them. Got tons of random requests, declining all of them.

One day I get a message from someone who I assumed was part of my program. We had some mutual friends and he had studied abroad before too. He asks me questions about me and my hobbies and such, no red flags. I feel absolutely dumb as fucking shit for talking to this guy, but honestly I've never had creepy encounters irl or otherwise before this.

At some point he talks about meeting up, and I say sure not taking it seriously. He keeps bringing it up, I maybe talked with him 5 times total all shallow conversations that didn't last long. I was having issues with my host family at the same time so I didn't think about it much. 

After he mentions meeting up I actually checked his profile and he wasn't related at all to my program, although his pictures showed girls from I assume other programs, he mentioned AFS. Eventually I tell him I'm busy, have a strict host family, had to leave Japan pretty soon, and refused to meet him. I was rude but not too rude to the point where he might become dangerous. He mentioned something about writing a song to explain how he feels. That's when I blocked him.

No issues for a couple of months. A couple of weeks ago he turned up in my instagram searches as recommended, figured it was the facebook/instagram algorithm

Flash foward to today. I get a message from an actual older member of my program early in the morning, just a hello and how are you doing. The conversation went weird pretty quick, I want to talk to you more, lets meet up, etc. Then the real kicker ""ttyl"". The creeper used this and considering that god forbid someone still use that phrase it put me on high alert. I left for school and my paranoia grew throughout the day.

I want to mention that this older member I hardly knew. He's messaged me before, but his tone wasn't as… friendly? I'm pretty awkward so he just seemed more business like, these messages made it seem like he was nervous. He went on outings with us exchange students and treated me like the rest of the exchange students, honestly I wasn't super liked by the group so I hadn't talked to the older members as much as the other exchange students.

I get back home and he starts messaging me soon after, it's morning in Japan then. I immediately try to verify it's him. Ask him if he's contacted other students- no. Ask him if he's going on the big trip in March this year which is the highlight of the program. He says yes, he's going on Eurotour. We sure as hell don't go to Europe, I ask him if he knows what I'm talking about, he says he was confused by my question. I lie and say I don't remember the name of the place, he says ""Like Kyoto?"", which is the correct place of the trip, a super popular tourist area in Japan.
I want to highlight that this guy went on the big Kyoto trip with me and literally everyone in the program knows about it. 

Asked one last question, get a generic yes I guess answer. Tried giving no hints to what I'm talking about, I assumed that if it was really him it should have been known. Said bye and he sent some corny sticker- I can't imagine this member doing this.

I've been super stressed lately which might cloud my thinking, but am I being way too paranoid? I get this gut feeling that the older program member isn't the one messaging me, our short conversation reminded me way too much of the creeper before. Is it unreasonable to think he somehow hacked the guy's account?

I changed all my privacy settings and have limited my info on the internet, my name is rare and easy to look up. Any help with this is appreciated.",27Nov2018,1

155,"My mother suffers from depression and anxiety in the past two years it's gotten worse. My mother constantly worries about everything. Some things I can understand like bills, my siblings, and the car when something goes wrong. Other things however, I'm not sure why she panics to the point where she can't sleep, she overeats, and cries uncontrollably.

157,"I made the account name just recently off of that Benedict Cumberbatch name generator, so sorry if this name is a bit shitty. I just don't want this to reflect my normal account. 

I'm 13 and in my last year of middle school. I don't really wanna self-diagnose myself with anything, but I have very low self esteem and insecurities. I can't post any video on social media because I sound like a five year old failed abortion who developed a meth addiction. My voice makes that squeaker you hear in game chats sound like Morgan Freeman. I play Murder G-mod, and decided I'd use the voice chat for the first time. At first no one really cared about my voice. My school had a break from work, so I had the day off and I decided to play G-Mod. When I said ""Welcome to 7/11"" because we were playing on a map with a 7/11, I heard someone respond along the lines of, ""Why is there a little kid playing?"" I don't know why I didn't have the balls to respond back saying that I'm not a little kid, or why I got so offended but I haven't spoken since then. I'm also a social out cast because I did some autistic shit in the past that I don't really want get too deep into, but basically everyone thinks I'm an autist. No one's a dick to me, just only a few close friends talk to be (although I'm starting to get more friends). I'm also able to get a few laughs out of them when I either insult myself or the kids who are even more unsociable. But sometimes ""incidents"" happen. I've never heard anyone talk shit about me, either cuz I don't exist to them, they see me as someone with not a lot of both good and bad qualities, or they don't mind me (I know this because people will talk shit about other people right in front of them). Basically I was working in the hall  because my science classroom felt like we were in satan's asshole and I decided to sit in these chairs in front of my locker. 3 kids in French class came to work in the hall as well. They decided to to sit in the 3 remaining chairs and because they're in sets of two facing each other, someone had to sit next to me.  I hear from the two people who sat next to me, ""Why do I have to sit next to -My Name-?"" One of these kids was someone I used to hangout with, so maybe he was just trying to mess with me, but for sure the other kid who I've never really been around, so I know she wasn't joking. That made me feel so shitty about myself that I basically didn't talk to anyone for the rest of the day. I'm not repulsive in anyway. I shower daily, I try my best to eat has healthily as I can, and I'm not overweight. The only bad things I can see are I'm 5 foot, underweight, I like dinosaurs (more in a scientific way) and I have 2 cats (which plays a role alongside my shitty past). My friend who's at least 10 times more sociable than me has had probably 4 girlfriends while I just sit here shit posting on reddit, or watching youtube. These are just a few things that happen, there's a much bigger range of events, but honestly, these things just make me feel really shitty. This could be something that happens to everyone, and I'm just over reacting, but keep in mind, I'm just 13, and while some of you may be dealing with depression, relationship problems, etc, my problems are just as personal to me as they are to you. I said I don't want to self diagnose myself, but quite honestly, I think I might have depression (a few things happened that I really don't want to talk about happened recently).

159,"TL;DR at the bottom

Gotta add some backstory to this, so here goes: 

Back in the first year of middle school I was being made fun of for my weight (98th percentile of weight in the entire state) and I ended up doing cyber school due to my parents wanting to help, I also agreed with this decision.

So like any unmotivated teenager I put off schoolwork/played video games all day and I've basically learnt nothing from what you intake via grades 6 - 11, yes I googled all of the answers and I passed. Up until this year, that is. I got held back at 11th and got my parents consent to drop out.

Now, my father has been trying to get me interested in running the family business since I was about 12 years old (18 now), he always babbles on about money like a big depressed fuck. I've expressed several times that I am not interested in the business whatsoever, yet he still pesters me about it. When I was 13, I was babysitting my little sister for the first time and I felt really proud, so I got her to take a nap and rested her on the bed in my parents bedroom to show my father how I could babysit just fine.

It didn't go quite as I expected, what followed was him coming out and confronting me for ""going back to play video games' when in reality I sat back down on the couch in the living room in case the baby started crying again. He basically just called me a ""useless piece of shit"", not only for leaving the baby in his room, but also he mentioned the family business. ""I asked one thing from you"", at this point I felt guilty and started crying, which he replied with calling me a pussy bitch and mocked me because he though I would tell mother, who was out working at the time.

I changed from that point, In order to minimize contact with him I became idle even more, sat in my room for years doing nothing but gaining weight and playing video games. All because I felt guilty around him.

There's not much to explain through the years, as I haven't done anything. I don't have any friends, no social life, nothing.

Which all leads me up to where I am now. Nothing has changed between me and my father, he bats around the house like a grumpy fuck boy and still tries to make me to help him with the family business (Programming, it's boring as fuck to me, I'd rather die). 

I've changed, though. The first day of this month, I just sat down and thought about my life. I thought about what I could do or where I could go. I needed to change.

Difficult but essential, I put down video games for good. Something that had basically been my teenage life, gone. I don't regret it either. In addition to that, I had also started a diet (CICO). I'm on track to lose 10 pounds by the end of this month, I don't plan on stopping either.

Now, my parents are pressuring me to get a GED, which I plan on doing, but I have very basic knowledge of middle/highschool subjects. Although I can logically solve some algebra I've never learnt, the specific things are going to kill me.

Here is my checklist for now:

1. Get fit, I need some confidence before doing anything

2. Study for GED while maintaining task #1; obtain drivers license

3. Sign up for some MMA classes once task #1 is complete

4. Get GED

5. Get decent paying job, truck loading/unloading or physically demanding jobs preferred

6. Get my first vehicle; Buy my own phone (Poco F1, or relevant falgship killer at the time); rent an apartment off of my grandparents with a very reduced price

I personally guarantee that I will meet these goals by early 2020.

I would, however, like some advice on what I should do after the fact. Maybe some of have been in a similar situation as me, and I'd like to know what ideas you all have. I'm not planning to enroll in college, but maybe someone here can change my mind.

Thanks people 

TL;DR: been doing nothing as a teenager due to guilt/depression, made a list of what I am going to accomplish and need advice on what to do after 

Also I'm on mobile sry lol

160,"For reference I'm a 17 yr old M currently in my last year of high school + throwaway account.  I'm making this post so that I can write out and organize what I'm feeling, as well as get some outside input on wtf is going on

So, at my school everyone knows this teacher to be one of the cooler, less tightly wound teachers.  I don't know her definite age, but by her looks she is in her young-mid 20s.  She is very smart, a Yale graduate, and teaches Physics along with some smaller electorates.  Throughout my time at high school I knew who she was, but we never shared more than a few passing words.

I was pretty excited to be in her class, because a few of my friends told me how much fun they had.  So far, her class is a lot of fun, she likes to joke and has a lighthearted classroom environment, and she has a somewhat bubbly personality.  We've shared interesting conversations over these 3 months (time really flies, I feel like the year just started lol).  About 2 weeks ago, she invited me to go to a club that she and an English teacher sponsor together. 

 ---I won't say the name of the club in the very off chance someone I know reads this; I'm ashamed to be writing this---

She tells me what the club is doing the following week; watching a Studio Ghibli movie, going out for dinner, singing karaoke.  Usually I'd be apprehensive, but this sounds like fun to me, so I save the date. 

The day of the meeting rolls around and throughout the day I'm pretty hyped about it.   I come after school and we watch this phenomenal movie (Princess Mononoke, go watch it), we then start splitting people into different cars to go to dinner (This club is essentially made up of me, my friend, a group of people that already know each other and don't know my friend and I that well, and the 2 teachers).  The group goes with the teachers, and I drive my friend there.

We are seated at a long table, and my friend and I place ourselves right across from the teachers at the end of the table.  We talked for probably an hour and a half, but the time flew by.  We had some really fun, and interesting conversations.  I really started to unfilter myself with this teacher and we talked briefly about some taboo, and I didn't realize how much I had opened myself up until after the event.  

Anyways, we went to karaoke and it was a lot of fun, my friend kept on picking every song from Green Day he could find and doing a god-awful, but entertaining impression of the lead singer.  During this part of the night, however, I started to get some.. flirtatious.. vibes from my teacher.  While I was picking out some songs (they had a large book of songs listed on the machine), she would notice and start to look with me, but instead of pulling the book across the table a little towards her (we were sitting at a booth), she would lean in very close next to me and decide with me.  She also made very distinct eye contact when speaking to me or asking questions.

(Maybe this is just instinct from leaning over to help people while in class?  Either way it struck me odd)

Anyways we all share some more conversation while paying and then walking out, and wish each other a happy Thanksgiving, as this was the last day of school before break.  The next morning, she adds me to the Google Classroom for the club and that is that.

Now, here's where I become troubled.  Over the break, I kept catching myself thinking about her, not sexually, not romantically, just running different situations though my head with her.  I really didn't (and still don't) know what to make of it.  I don't catch myself thinking of her as much, but it still is happening commonly.  I am just perplexed as to why.  I do not have physical attraction to her, I contemplated romantic attraction but ultimately found no true interest there either.  It's like I have a 'friend crush'.  It is so strange and kind of distressing to be honest.

If you took the time to read this, I would really appreciate any outside input that I can get because I can't really share this with anyone.  Thank you.

163,"So my dads not trying to be toxic but he is. I grew up in a poor community but I went to a rich school in a nearby suburb because I won the lottery to get into “better schools” my parents fought so hard to get me into. I had math lessons as a kid and despite us not having a lot of money my parents always tried to provide the best they could for me. 
My dad however is extremely manipulative and I don’t know how to deal with it. I dealt with a lot of mental health problems in high school so I bet the hospital bills were pretty high. And I am 100% grateful for my moms good insurance despite not having a lot of money otherwise. My dad however always holds these bills over my head whenever we argue. For example he complained to me that I’m making the family broke blah blah blah when I took a lyft home from my friends house. He said we can’t afford to use lyft. However I pay for my own lyfts as well as my own expenses. I have a job at home and another one when I’m at college. My mom also told my medical bills were paid off a long time ago.  He blames me for him not having a reliable real job and he said it’s because my mental illness took most of his time. I’d believe him, but he hasn’t had a real job since the early 2000s and I only got I’ll in my teens (around2015). Also my I feel like my dad goes out of his way to pick fights with me.

165,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. So 2/5 of my classes this semester are giving me anxiety, and I can't figure out how to tackle them. I have a B in class A (they're both govt classes, so I'm just going to call them B and A), and an A in class B. I want to get As in both classes in the end.

In class A I got a C on the midterm, which brought my grade down from an A to a B. Now the last thing I can do is to get nearly a perfect score on the final, but I don't even know how possible that is for me. I thought I studied and knew what I was doing on the midterm, but I ended up doing badly on that. I don't know what to do differently. It feels hopeless. I really want to go see my teacher during office hours to see if he would give me extra credit or some chance to do better in the class, but I think that's a long shot and I don't know how to approach him with that.

In class B, so far I'm doing well but I've slacked off a TON on the reading (the class is based a bunch on old govt books, Plato, Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, etc.), and this is totally my fault. This past week I've been catching up with audiobooks while working on things that don't take a lot of brainpower, but its going kind of slow. 

This last part might be confusing, so bear with me. We have this group project (in class B) that is like almost half of our grade, and I particularly wanted to do it on one of the books at the end of the course - not necessarily because I wanted to put it off. The prof forms the groups before each reading, and apparently this wasn't the best method because he underestimated how many kids were actually putting off the project until the last few books of the course. He seemed really annoyed by this, and started to put us into groups for the last few books, and put me in the group doing the last book for the semester (the one I wanted). He started to get really disappointed, asking us why we put off the project until the last moment. I felt bad because immediately I was labeled as irresponsible - usually I'm a good student and I wish I could've shown the prof that somehow, especially considering this project is nearly half of our grade. He was worried because we had too many kids for a book that is apparently a short read, so each kid would have shorter presentations than the rest of the class. He told us all this and warned us that we better do really well on this in order to get an A, but the thing is I don't know HOW we could do better than what all the other presenters did. I mean... its a presentation?

Oh and to top it all off, the final is a written exam, which is always a coin toss for me as to whether I'll get an A, or something like a C.

they finally tell me that i’ve been ‘really negative lately’. they didnt really elaborate so i still dont know what i did 

a little while later and they still dont really talk to me. i’ll make an attempt at normal conversation and they don’t even respond. 

i’ve asked my other friends about this and they have told some of my other friends what i did, but didnt tell me. i know they dont want to start drama and i respect that, but i’m a little hurt that my friend didnt just tell me directly.

174,"Tl;dr at bottom. 

My husband just had his 4th and 5th heart surgeries last month at 27. The 4th surgery was supposed to take 3-4 hours but took 7.5 and I was a wreck. Eventually I'm told he's made it to the cv-icu with good vitals. 45 minutes later the hospital is blowing up my phone and I'm blowing up theirs. I'm disabled, can't drive because I faint often (like legally I can't drive), and the surgery was out of town and it all started at 11pm so buses weren't running. I got the ""uh.....you need to come here right now, where are you? This is very serious and you should rush"" phone call. When I called and reached the cv-icu nurses desk asking for his nurse the conversation went from ""This is Aimee at the cardiovascular intensive care unit! How may I direct your call?"" to ""oh hunny....of course of course. Anything dear"" in the softest sensitive voice. I knew why she was being so nice. I got a call from the doctor heading the pulmonary critical unit (or something like that). He didn't introduce himself when I picked up. He just started right off rip with what was going on. He said things like ""no, we can't do an mri to see if this is from a clot, we can't move him. He is the sickest person on this floor, maybe this hospital. Definitely this floor"", ""there is a surgical team standing in his room with three doctors, the pulmonary team and nurses waiting for his vitals to be safe enough to put in an ECMO machine"", ""we have been manually resuscitating him for hours, everytime we put him on the ventilator his oxygen goes down. It doesn't make sense. His xray is very weird. We don't know"" and ""I'm trying to focus on saving his life"". If it weren't for the fact that I knew none of them had his records or knew his history, I would have killed myself that night. It is all I wanted to do. But knowing I could help the odds by providing information kept me going. There was probably 60 calls between me calling the hospital and them calling me over a few days. I didn't sleep for days. He was placed in a coma and paralyzed for 6 days. The day he woke up they had to place a pacemaker because of an unrelated complication. He's now home and just like it never happened. The pain is gone, most everything is like before.  Yet I'm horrified by everything. I can't stand him going to the corner store alone. I sit up all night listening to his new heart valve click (mechanical) holding my breath on every pause. I want to talk about it but i know it's messed up to do. So f'n what? I got some bad phone calls and was scared. I'm not the one who almost died. I'm not the one who was told this was the last chance yet is still in heart failure. Yet I'm complaining to him?? We've grown up together. We were 16 when we got together. I tell him everything. Every problem we go on about together. But this time it's wrong to do. I told my pcp I needed a counselor or something. They sent me to one who said literally nothing. I rambled and then told to see them the next week but my husband ended up having an appointment so i rescheduled. I do not know how to handle it. I hope for it to get better in my mind and it pass but it's all I think about. He tells me it's fine. But it's really not. 

Tl;dr- my husband almost died after open heart surgery last month. I can't handle it and keep talking about it and acting crazy. It's not fair to him. He never ever complains and says he doesn't mind but I know it's not okay. I don't know how to handle it without doing that to him. That's how we handle problems. Rant to one another.

183,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I work part time at a sandwich shop to pay for my college. I work with this really great girl, and we seem to have a lot of chemistry. In the past I've made her laugh really hard, had good conversation with her, etc. We'll call her Jenna.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, we had this department meeting to go to, so I wrote a note saying ""To: Jenna (open me)"" and on the inside it said:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Will you be my date to this department meeting? Don't wanna show up solo like a loser.

&amp;#x200B;

(x) Yes (checked it for you)

() No

\-anonymous

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So later on, she comes up to me and goes ""I got your note!"" all smiley. I teased her about not knowing what she meant, until finally I asked her ""what did you check?"" and she said ""it was checked for me!"" so I asked ""what would you have put anyways?"" and she smiled and said yes.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, we worked together for a few more shifts after that and had some good laughs and conversation. She even asked me ""when do you work next?"" Then she went on and on about how fun it is to work at her second job (a burger place) because everyone there is fun like me, and how the atmosphere is way more lax to the point where they all swear in front of the customers. She goes ""I'm gonna sign you up to work with me!"" ""I'm filling out an application for you I'm serious!""

&amp;#x200B;

Everything is great up to this point, but this is where I'm not sure if I went too far. After she had left that day (the day she asked when I work next) she had to go to her second job. I call the place from the work phone (me calling from the work phone isn't an issue, I knew I wouldn't get caught) and ask if she's there, to which they say ""no..but she should be!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Me and her had a conversation that day about how she always gets away with showing up HOURS late to that job. So anyways, I told the person on the phone to take a message for me, said message being an inside joke that Jenna and I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't scheduled to work with her for two weeks after that day. 

&amp;#x200B;

One week goes by. I leave another note for her, this time saying ""To: Jenna (don't open me) (even if you're Jenna) (even if you really really want to)"" and on the inside it said:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Since you didn't take my advice, you are now going to reincarnate as a piece of green leaf blend. At least that makes you the good stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

PS

Have a good shift

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This was based off of another inside joke. One time I held up a piece of everyone's favorite lettuce that we use and told her she'd reincarnate as it, and she had laughed and was like ""nooo I wanna reincarnate as something better than that!""

&amp;#x200B;

So anyways, all this time goes by and finally we work together again. She seems super tired, but jokes ""here to cause trouble?"" to which I just said ""yeah!"" and she laughed a bit. She then goes ""I got your note by the way! I don't remember what it said but I remember it said I'd reincarnate as something I didn't wanna reincarnate as!"" So I was like ""I think that was a good note...don't even lie, that made your whole week!"" and she goes ""yeah, it made my morning cuz I always have to come in so early!"" (she usually comes in at like 5:30am). I brought up how I called her other job and she wasn't there, and she talked about how she was a little too late that day and they almost fired her for it. Anyways, the rest of that shift was uneventful, besides her saying how excited she was to go home and nap and how she has insomnia and whatever. At one point she got all excited and goes ""Hey we're matching!!!"" ...we coincidentally wear the same color shirt to work almost every time we work together, unplanned. So I reply, ""You always copy my style!"" and she goes ""no I came in before you today!"" and at this point her shift was ending, so she headed out.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if I went too far or if I'm just in my own head. What bugs me is that we didn't seem to have the same level of banter as normal, but she was also exhausted from 2 hours of sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need to get some outsider perspective here...am I in my own head? Is there a chance that she likes me back? Did I go too far with the second note/calling her second job, or was it all in good fun?

Even before we started dating we would sleep in a call and it'd help me fall asleep at night. I would constantly wake up at night. Sometimes once ever 30mins or so. Sleeping in a call wouldnt fix it but it would help me to stay asleep and not wake up as much. Any ideas to help me sleep better now that it's over?,27Nov2018,1
205,"I’m F/20 and I’ve had my twitter account since 2013. It is the only social media where I truly feel comfortable being myself and as dumb as this sounds, Twitter is like my outlet and how I express myself. It’s actually my favorite social media site. Well for whatever reason my mom decided to make a Twitter and she tried to follow me. Honestly I do not feel comfortable letting my mom follow me because Twitter is private to me and I only let my friends follow me because I post my real thoughts on Twitter. It’s stuff that I don’t feel comfortable having my mom know about. My mom and I are friends on Facebook and I thought that was a good compromise but she’s PISSED that I won’t let her follow me on Twitter. My mom is also super conservative and Christian and a lot of the things I’ve tweeted/retweeted go against that stuff and she would not like it. Anyways now she’s really suspicious that I’m hiding stuff or that I’m posting bad stuff on Twitter, and I’m not it’s just it would probably be considered bad to her. I’m 20 years old I feel that I should have some privacy and independence from my mom but she tries to control everything in my life. Now she refuses to talk to me at home until I accept her follow request on twitter. Like she came home from work today and I said hi and tried to give her a hug and she pushed me off of her and said “nope since you won’t be my friend on Twitter, i won’t be your friend in real life” and she’s giving me the silent treatment now. I think it’s completely ridiculous. It’s MY twitter account I should be allowed to control who I let follow me. I already don’t have any freedom in real life because of my mom, Twitter was the one place I felt like I had some freedom as dumb as that sounds but now I have to deal with this shit. What do I do?",27Nov2018,1
206,"Thanks for taking the time to read this! 
The title explains it. Was going out one night with my group of friends and one of the guys told me he wants to screw my girlfriend (whom I am in a serious relationship with). Didn’t seem out of his character but he was probably somewhat drunk. I didn’t give it much thought at the time but I brought it up with my 
girlfriend couple days ago (and she laughed and joked about it). Now l, i know my girlfriend is very loyal and she would never do something like that but I can’t help feeling a bit bothered. 

So I have 2 questions (1 curious question):
1) Is it normal as a guy to feel a tad bit insecure? 
2) what would you have done at the scene in my shoes? ",27Nov2018,1
207,"I'll make this briefly as possible:

I've started unschooling the first year of highschool, dropped out with the staff talking behind my back.

The truth is the place where I live in places an urgent priority on schooling, I've been distant from my friends and people in general. I've wondered why I'm so desperate for interaction which then I realized it: I'm depressed.

Has anyone unschooled? It's extremely hard the fact that there's no friends I can relate to or talk to. Depression slowly seeps in and out but I'm slowly following a schedule while forcing myself to mature faster. 

I've been tracking my finances and budget, buying groccies, going out myself (this is a huge step for me since I'm very sheltered)

My biggest problem is the fact that I can't relax with my friends, I feel like I always have to put on an act and frankly I feel drained after talking to them. Other than that? I very frequently lose motivation.

Please do not suggest me to go back to school, I really want to make this work. I'm already planning to get a job before college so it's a huge pressure on me.

I'm feeling stuck and hopeless, please give me advice.",27Nov2018,1
208,"Recently, I’ve been very happy. However, I’m finding it difficult to be cheerful and nice to my four closest friends. My first instincts are to be condescending and rude. I am conscious of it, but in the moment it’s extremely difficult to overcome. 

I should add that it seems when I am happiest inside, I’m rude on the outside. When I am sad on the inside, I’m happy and cheerful on the outside. I have no idea why this is, but it’s been a trend during the last 5-ish years of my life (I’m 21). 

I’m not entirely sure how to go about fixing my situation, but I am open to any advice or words of wisdom. Even if nobody reads this, it feels good to just get it off of my chest. ",27Nov2018,1
209,"A while back, I was curious to see who my boyfriend follows on Instagram. And this is the first time I do this. I look and see two account of girls that post mostly nude pics of themselves (covering their nipples and such so it wont get deleted i guess) and i see in the comments (because it shows who you follow what they comment sometimes) him kinda complimenting them and saying what he would do to get a day to spend with them and just kinda flirting. I dont know what to do. Help. My head hurts. ",27Nov2018,1
210,"So in the past i've been pretty antisocial and wasted literally like 12-13 hours a day playing league of legends.I had stopped now for a while,and now i am back at it.I am not playing more than maybe 2-3-4 games,but i just think it is too much of a waste of time.I uninstall it and redownload it.I just..i like playing and everything,but i know how bad it affects me,the toxicity in particular.

Am I addicted?Should I take this more seriously?",27Nov2018,1
211,"Warning: This story is looong and frustrating. Please read it till the end to see what my problem is. Also English is not my mother tongue so please ignore small hiccups.

I met my boyfriend 2 and a half years ago (let’s call him Mike) back when I was still in University. My brother and Mike are business partners so he introduced us at a dinner party and it was mildly shocking at the time since he was only 20 years old, same as me. The reason it was shocking was because my brother usually deals with high profile people and they’re usually much older. We hit it off instantly and throughout the night we were secluded  from others talking with each other about movies and tv shows. He was chill, funny and intelligent but not cocky he seemed great so we exchanged numbers. I wish I never talked with him that night, It is my only regret in life.

After texting for 2 months I jokingly asked if he ever was gonna ask me out on a date, and he did it instantly. I thought he was bit naive at the time since he couldn’t pick up on any clues and he seemed to have no experience when it comes to women, turns out I was right. When I talked with my brother that night he said to me that Mike never dates anyone and when I told him that he asked me out on a date he just asked me “why?”, I didn’t expect that reaction so I said because I told him to. My brother then said “why would you do such a thing?” When I asked him what was wrong with me doing that he just said nothing, its just because they are business partners that’s all but my alarm bells were ringing and when I asked again if there was anything wrong with what I did he just said no, don’t cancel .

Still, we went on a date even though I was considering cancelling but all my suspiciouns went away the moment I figured out what the date was. He set up a projector and white screen at a park and there was even drinks and popcorn. I have no idea how much all of it cost but I was overjoyed. There was even an older woman there serving snacks and drink to us. I never had such a date before. He seemed so inexperienced with women but he prepared the best date I could ever ask.  We watched Monty Python And The Holy Grail and I never laughed like that before. He too was laughing like a madman and he had such a dorky laugh that I felt like kissing him. So I did, on his cheek. I fell in love for the first time that night.

Date was amazing and he didn’t even try to initiate anything when he dropped me home. Since he never could pick up any clues I leave for him, I decided to be direct. I asked for another date, and another, and another, then I invited him to my place and we had sex for the first time. Well, it wasn’t the best. He couldn’t get an erection and he seemed lost. So I guided him to best of my abilities (I didn’t have much experience either, I been with only 3 guys prior to him). After some time though he started to get better and better. He started to try a lot of new things and taking all the control. I was ecstatic. We stopped going to dates altogether and would just meet at my place, eat pizza, watch some stuff for an hour before having sex till we fall asleep. Not just with sex but with the relationship in general, he took all the control. After 6 months of dating, he asked me to live with him and I accepted.

Here is where the problem begins, I realized that I never been to his place before, seriously, not even once. I realized that right then that our relationship was in a bubble. When he first showed me his house I was disappointed because I was expecting something bigger. It was like 200 square feet apartment and yes while the house was clean, and new looking it was still too small! There was no decorations, nothing. But I still decided to move in thinking that I’ll change things up. There was only one problem, all this time I was thinking that he must be rich since he’s working with my brother, but now I was questioning if he even had enough money to support me at all. His house looked so empty. When he saw me not looking happy he asked me if anything was wrong, he seemed so sad. But I decided to be direct and told him that house is too small and empty. He told me that I can decorate it however I want and the reason it’s empty is because he spends most of his time at the office and uses this place just to sleep and keep his stuff. I asked him if he had enough money for me to live with him, he said that we’ll share the bills and rent just like I am doing with my roomate but he’ll give me 800$ to make this place be something I like. I asked again if he had money, he just gave me this weird look and said “why are you asking me that question” and asked “can you afford to move in with me?”. I was bit embarassed and angry so  I answered yes a little too loud. He then asked if I was expecting him to pay for everything, I said of course not. I lied, I was expecting him to pay for everything but dropped the subject thinking that maybe he’s having financial problems these days. I thought to myself that I would bring this up at a later date and that was it. He didn’t even helped me move but he sent someone to help me, which I had to pay for. I bought new curtains, nice big carpet and few cushions for the couch. I framed 2 pictures of us and hung it over the couch and the bedroom. It was somewhat nice looking now. We lived together in peace for 3 months before he started to freak me out.

After work I went out to have some drinks with my girlfriends and we were talking about our boyfriends. They asked me to tell them about him, so I did. It was then I realized, I don’t really know this guy. All I know is he has an export company, he has no siblings nor a father and when he was a kid he used to live at a village. I remembered that whenever we talked, we would talk about me and when I tried to ask about his childhood or his life, he would change the topic or say that he’s tired. I don’t know when I stopped asking about him, maybe it happened sunconsciously.  When I went back home he was at his desk looking at some papers, I decided to have a sit down with him and ask about his life. He told me that he didn’t know what to say. When I pushed him harder he went to bed saying “I am sorry, it’s hard for me.” I joined him in bed and said that I want to meet your friends. He agreed.

To be perfectly honest, if I didn’t go to work with him that day, never pushed him to tell me things about himself, I would still be with him. No doubt. I wouldn’t ever imagine him being a psycopath.

When I went to his place of work (Which was a huge place in the heart of most expensive district in Istanbul) I was angry, he clearly had money yet he didn’t want to spend money for me but still, I thought maybe he had debt that he is trying to pay. He introduced me to his employees and my fucking god, they are all bunch of sycophants. They literally worship him and lick his ass whenever he says anything. They were smiling and acting nice and all, but I could see it in their eyes that they were mocking me, like their shit doesn’t smell. Worst of all was Mike! He was a completely different person around other people. He was not reserved and chill when he was talking with his employees. He acted like a scum! Loud, obnoxious, bossy and cliche and he had such an irritating laugh. After chatting with his coworkers we went to his office and it was fucking gorgeous. Everything was antique and expensive looking. He literally had a fucking metal statue of 2 lions at the entrance of his office. Yet he gives me only 800$ to decorate. He sat down and explained some of the things he does and how he created this company. Apparently the guys I met were the first people he hired and back then he struggled to even pay them minimum wage. But now he said things are good, they all make good money and because they started from the bottom and had to work together to make this company what it is, so they became like a family. I asked him how much money they make, he said “it doesn’t matter”. Fuck yes it does. Then he had meetings so I had to sit at the couch while he was talking with them. He was speaking chinese, fucking chinese. I had no idea he could speak chinese, who the fuck is this guy. Then throughout the day he kept meeting people and talking at the phone. He is a fucking chameleon, he was talking like a frat boy with some of them, completely calm and proffesional with others. He was even flirting with a woman! In front of me! After that woman left I asked him if he was flirting with him. He just said it’s business, and that they joke around like that. After that point I decided to learn everything about him and also make sure to watch him with other people. It became an obsession of mine and I spent good 6 months doing it. That’s when I learned that he is a psychopath.

I started keeping notes about him, things he does differently than other people. I stopped talking about myself and my day and solely focused on him whenever we could spend time together. I learned that he dropped out of highschool because he had to work to make money, his dad left. I learned that ever since he was a child he had interest in languages so he was learning all his life. He speaks 7 fucking languages, who does that? I learned that his mother lives in a rural place and he visits every other month. I can’t believe I never asked were he was going all this time. I learned that he used to be overweight as a teenager and he started dieting and running after his father left. He even showed me pictures, I thought he was joking with me since he looked nothing like that photo. I also learned that EVERYONE. FUCKING. LOVES. HIM. It’s not natural. He can talk with everyone. He has this racist as hell customer who he talks with often, and he actually talks like him even though I know he is not racist. He changes his personality to match whoever he is talking, that’s not normal at all. Oh btw, he is filthy rich. I friended his coworker and she and I became really close suprsingly even though at first I thought she was a bitch. When I went to her house I was freaking out because it was huge and fancy. I asked her if she only works at my bf’s company and she said yes looking confused. I said “I asked because he seems like he doesn’t make much money but you do.” She just laughed! And asked if I was being serious or not. After I said yes and explained myself she understoof what I was trying to say and told me that Mike doesn’t like spending money on useless things. WHAT ABOUT THE FUCKING LION STATUE? Apparently that was to give good impression on customers. Yeah, right. I didn’t buy it.

My obsession started to affect my daily life as well. I stopped talking with my friends, and had a huge fight with my family about my spendings. I called them nasty things even though I know I shouldn’t have so they stopped sending me money. Even my brother stopped talking with me. I started to gain weight because I kept seeing him talking to women and they were flirting with him, so I started to overeat. We had our first huge fight when I couldn’t pay half of the rent and bills and the fact that I didn’t look after my health or doing any chores. Who the HELL is he to tell me that. He told me that he’ll kick me out if I don’t go back to my old self and start working to pay for my part. He said he’ll cover the 2 months, after that I had to start paying. Things were okay after that…for few months. After crying that day and telling him the fight I had with my family and the problems I was having with our relationship, he seemed understanding and sad. He said that he loves me for the first time and told me that I am the only one he ever truly loved. He said that he likes talking with me because I teach him new things every day. I honestly didn’t know what I taught him but it made me decide to get my shit together. So I started going to the gym like he does twice everyday, started eating healthy. Until certain things started to bug me. Because I was still trying to learn about him while also trying to get closer to him, I decided to share some of my hobbies with him. He has no interest in videp games while I do so I showed him games like Portal 2 and Fallout 4. Stuff he might like and sure enough, he did. He started playing lot of games and even jokingly blamed me for not being able to do enough work. Relationship was great again. We were playing games together, going to concerts, he bought a beefy gaming pc and opened a steam account and told me to buy games he and I might like, so I bought tons of games.  It was great. For a while.

I decided to drop out of University because I didn’t like what I was majoring in anymore and decided in the future I would start my own business like him. Since I was not going to school anymore I started to work full time instead of part-time. The job he found me was pretty great so I had extra cash for me to buy things for myself. I bought a guitar and started getting online lessons to learn it. Turns out he plays guitar! Of fucking course he does. He gave me some pointers to get good at it which turned me off from guitar altogether. I wanted my own thing. Then I started playing CSGO all the time and wanted to be really good at it like, pro level. I knew he never played counter strike and I have been playing the game ever since my brother first showed me how to when I was 7. I was great at it but never really perfect. One day he came back from work and saw me playing the game. He watched me for a while before asking me what game it was. He asked if we could play it together, I told him that because my rank is high we couldn’t.

I mean I could’ve just used my smurf but I really didn’t want to play with him. He said okay, bought the game and started playing. You must understand this guy didn’t even know WASD movement keys up until few months ago. He started playing obsessively, I would wake up in the middle of the night seeing the light of the computer. He would play at work, at every free moments of his life. If he didn’t have acces to a computer he would watch Youtube videos for tips and tricks. I would watch him play and he was improving more and more everyday. And after a month, we were at the same rank. I just couldn’t stomach him anymore. Everything he does, he does it great. I used to be proud that I could speak english, he speaks it better than me and more. I used to be proud that I had a good body and the fact that I was pretty and now I see women much more cultured and beautiful than me everyday hitting on him. Everything comes easy to him while I was not that lucky. I felt like shit because I dropped out of University, and even if I didn’t, I would never make as much money as him. I felt like a failure and became terrified of him. He was not natural, not at all. We had been dating for almost 2 years now, and time and time again he made me feel like shit. He always complimented me and told me that I was special but I didn’t believe him. I watched him lie to so many people, I know how he makes people feel special, and talks to them in a way that they do everything he asks. I was convinced that he was a psycopath. And soon, I would have proof.

He took me to meet his mother at our 2 year anniversary because I told him that I felt like we were growing apart. We drove around 9 hours listening to music he selected. They were parody music, like stuff from Richard Cheese, he was trying to cheer me up and it worked. I was having so much fun with him again. He bought snacks I liked for the road and was cracking jokes making me laugh. We found a nice spot while the sun was going down and he took pictures of me in front of the orange sky. They looked amazing. He pulled me close to him and kissed me and saying how beautiful I am. We had sex in a long time and oh how I missed it. I forgot about all my worries and thought that everything is perfect. We reached her mom’s place which was a fucking villa. It was gorgeous and had a privarte beach. Also it was the first time seeing her mother and she looked so sweet. She cooked so much food for us and kept asking me questions about my life. She knew so much already which shocked me. After spending a good amount talking, eating and playing board games she went to sleep. We were tired but decided to walk at the beach. He told me what happened to him, how he used to be. He was a pretty fat kid and he would behave ‘girly’ as his father called him. His father was apparently not a clean man when it comes to his business and personality. He beat him all the time and kept mocking him about his weight. They come home one night after visiting his aunt and find that house is stripped clean, anything electronic, couch, mattress, curtains and even his mother’s wedding gold. He just dissappears taking everything with him. So at age 15 he drops out of college and starts to work at two full time jobs to make a living. When he turned 18 he had enough money to start his own company. He said he never dated anyone until me, because he never had time to. I felt so glad to know all this and was incredibly saddened by his story. I felt like an asshole for being so distant.

Next morning, we had breakfast at the beach and I was feeling kinda different than day before. All the things he said made perfect sense, as in explained everything about his personality. Story was too perfect. Besides, why did he have to work 2 jobs? why didn't his mother work apart from being a little overweight she looked perfectly healthy. How could a guy who dropped out of highschool when he was 15 goes on to create a one of the top companies in Turkey in less than 2 years? His story seemed like fanfiction, to make himself look good. I watched him as he was stuffing his face with bread and omelette like he has no care in the world. Like he didn't share something huge with me. I decided ask his mom why didn't she ever work. She looked shook then said she was too old to work and had bad legs, I didn't buy it. Right around then he started looking at me weird like I'm  doing something I'm not supposed to. So asked if she worked before and she said she got married when she was 16 her ex husband didn't let her work. I just laughed out loud because she never did anything with her life yet now she was living in a paradise. My boyfriend looked absolutely furious for laughing buy I didn't care. All her sweet words and smile the day before was fake, just like all the things his son does. In fact she was worse because she was mocking me by smiling. She thought I was not good enough for her son, I could tell. Who is she to judge me? She never done anything with her life. So I told her that. I told her that ""you never did any work in your life, everyone had to take care of you and now you live great, how lucky"" my boyfriend screamed at me immediately and he kicked the table so hard that it's legs snapped and flew. He was coming toward me with terrifying eyes and I thought he was going to kill me. His mom ran and pulled him away.

I never saw him like that before, he was screaming stuff like whore, how could she and I'm going to kill her while her mother was taking him inside the house. I waited good 15 minutes standing there, while the maid had the most horrified look on her face. I tried to go up to her but she took a step back. When I tried to go in front of her she pulled her face away. She was at the brink of crying I could tell. I started feeling afraid and my hands started shaking. However when he came back he was calm as a hindu cow. Like nothing ever happened. He had the usual half smile on his face and walked up to me and said ""let's go my mom feels tired."" I was terrified so I said no, he just kept smiling and said let's go again. Honestly I was afraid out of my mind because even though he was smiling his eyes were bloodshot. I don't know why but I complied. Whole ride home I was expecting him to beat me so about 2 hours after we started driving I started apologizing profusely. When we passed the place we took the picture I started crying for some reason. When we reached home he shut the car off and told me that ""I forgive you but you will never get to do any more mistakes."" His tone made me start shaking again so I just said yes, I promise.

The next few weeks were quiet. He would barely come up to talk to me but when I wanted to talk to him he kept himself open, meaning he was like how he used to be before all that. Honestly I was kinda getting bored so I reached out to old friends and we went to a party. I drank a little too much to get myself in the mood and it worked. I started to dance and have fun, it was great. I missed that, having fun with my friends. I told them that I broke up with my boyfriend and that I was sad. It was a lie obviously but I didn't want to think about him, so I lied. They called their boyfriends and told them to bring few good friend of theirs thinking it would cheer me up. and of them was eyeing me. I thought fuck it and gave him a handjob at the bathroom. Then I felt bad so I washed my hands quickly, apologized and left. He understood me after I explained the situation and told him not to say anything to the girls. He gave me his number so I could text him whenever I wanted to talked, I said okay.

Next day he sent me a funny message and saying that I tugged him too hard abd stuff like that. He was funny and understanding so I kept talking with for a few days. I decided that I didn't love mike anymore because we are from a different kind of people. I was normal and he was not and this new guy(let's call him Thomas) didn't made me like I'm not enough. I told Thomas that I wanted to have sex and he said sure. I felt wanted again, I went to his place few days later knowing that Mike would be at work till 3am. I went to Thomas's place and jist started undressing as soon as he shut the door. We fucked each other's brains out and drank, fucked and drank again and again. When it was around 2am I left his apartment saying that I will be back tomorrow. However, when I came home, he was at the home, with few guys around him already waiting for me.

As soon as I stepped foot inside the apartment a guy ran towards me and grabbed my phone. Mike was sitting at the couch his legs crossed smiling like usual said something to me. I was freaking out so I said ""what?"" and he said ""I said, hello peanut."" (that's what he calls me usually.) he got up from the couch and came close to me smelling my neck and touching my lips with his fingers. I started tearing up because he knew, he definitely knew but I didn't know how. Without saying anything he grabbed the keys from my hand and told me to sit at the couch and wait for him. When I refused he shouted me to sit down which made me lose my balance and fell on the ground. He laughed like a dork and told me to sit down, this time calmly. He said something in russian to the 2 guys that were there and left with the guy that grabbed my phone saying ""I'll see you soon."" I honestly thought that I would die that day. I waited for him for hours. When he came back the sun was rising.

As soon as he came back the guys that were watching for hours left. Mike locked the door behind them and threw me my phone and told me to start packing. Without wasting a single second I got off the couch and ran to the bedroom stuffing my bag as fast as I could. He stood behind me the whole time. When I was done he came close to me, putting his hands to my neck and kissed me lightly on the cheek. He pulled away the bag I was packing, opened it up and took the necklace he bought for me for our first anniversary. He then threw me the bag. I started walking to the door and tried to open it just to remember he locked it. He came towards me slowly and unlocked the door. Just when I was leaving he told me ""Hayatta Başarılar."" which I guess translates to ""I hope you find success in life""(It's a common farewell in Turkish). I was so relieved to get out alive, I ran down the stairs, got out of the building and didn't stop running until few blocks away.

I was pretty sleepy and hungry so I ate a bagel and called my boss to askfor a day off from work. Then I called Thomas since I had nowhere to sleep. He sounded so weird and just kept telling me ""please never call me again"" over and over. When I tried to call him again I couldn't because he blocked me. I called my brother even though I didn't want to and told him that I needed a place to stay because I had a fight with Mike. He kept asking me what did I do but I said it's something minor and that I was not in the mood to explain it. I went to his house, had a shower and slept like a rock until it was past 8pm. I felt all my worries were finally over and was hopeful that life will start making sense to me again. 

My brother came home an hour later with food and Ice Tea Lemon. I didn't touched the ice tea because that was all mike ever drank. After I ate the food I started talking with my brother and apologized to him for how I behaved. I guess because he saw I was sad he forgave me and told me not to worry about it and that I should also apologize to our parents. Feeling okay, I decided to tell him what happened and as he was listening his face grew more and more worried. Towards the end when I was talking about packing he stopped me and went outside. He came back few minutes later running to the guest room, grabbing my bag and throwing it to the door. He told me to leave and don't call him, I couldn't understand what was going on and I tried to ask him but he kept shutting me up. He told me to never call him until he says so, and told me that never call mom and dad either. I started crying again because I knew Mike did something but my brother kept denying it. I left the his house and tried to call my mom while crying hysterically, she just said ""don't call us, or come here, we will call the police"" and hung up when I tried calling again, I was blocked. I didn't know what was going on, I didn't have enough money on me to go to an Hotel so I called one of my old friends. Thankfully she picked up.

When I went to her place I didn't said anything about Mike since she already thought we broke up. I just said he kicked me out and that I need a place to stay for a few days. I told her that I'll get my paycheck in a week then I'll find a roommate and leave. She was so nice, she said stay as long as you like. Thinking that things are finally okay I fell asleep again, just for a few hours then it was time for work. My boss ran up to me as soon as I entered the cafe and said that I can't work here anymore. When I asked why he just told me that I can't and asked me to leave. When he saw me tearing up he told me to wait and gave me my weekly paycheck even though it was the start of the week. He told me to not tell anyone that he gave me this. I left the place and went to the nearby park and I broke down crying. I didn't deserve this. How can everything go to shit in one day?

Over the next 3 months, I applied for numerous jobs only to get fired few days later for no reason. All my friends kicked me out after letting me stay for a day or two without explanation. I am contemplating suicide everyday and each day I get closer to doing it. He's well connected in the country. Now I realize I never really knew him, not really. I don't know what to do. I cry constantly. If only I never met him, life would be alright. I would've graduated by now, instead I am doing menial daily jobs around construction zones and selling bottled water around farmer's market.I can't even prove if he's doing anything or how he knows where I am at all times or where I live or where I found a job. I hope one day he forgives me. I am thinking of going to where he works and just beg for forgiveness. That's it. That's how I fucked my life. Thanks for reading.",27Nov2018,1
212,"I'll try and keep this short. I'm a part time employee in the service industry, and have worked at my currnet job since June of this year. I'm a fairly consistent worker and seldom miss work and always get my shit done. However, earlier this month I had to take a leave of a week and a half from work due to being extremely sick in the ER multiple times that week and was excused from work with doctor's note authorizing it. This was around the time we also got new supervisors at work. I returned to work last week, and have since been buried in medical bills and have decided to be full time. Today, I asked my new supervisor if I could switch to full time permanently because I need the money. He laughed and told me that my issue was that I call out too much and am inconsistent, despite my doctor's notes excusing me. He then asked if I was even sick and started telling me how he would take a chance on me but to not screw up. This was my second interaction ever with him. I love my job but he made me feel like i'm on thin ice and uncomfortable. I want to take my medical bills and notes to work tomorrow and speak with him telling him that I feel like he has the wrong image of my work ethic and that I don't like that he made me feel like less of a worker than I am. However, another part of me thinks I should just get over it and simply prove him wrong by doing and not saying. Unsure as of what to do.

TLDR: new supervisor has the wrong idea about my work ethic, accusing me of constantly missing work for no good reason despite doctor's notes provided excusing me. unsure if to talk to him regarding my work ethic and present my medical documents, or move on.",27Nov2018,1

215,"For the record, I deeply care about education and I absolutely despise students who violate academic integrity. I take my schoolwork and the academics super seriously and I have never ever let myself cheat or take any given less challenging route unless it’s absolutely necessary for whatever reason. I believe in quality work ethic and the countless number of rewards that follows hard work. I also happen to attend a prestigious, private university where a lot of students feel the same way and in fact almost consider it taboo. And to be fair, that’s attributed to the fact that it’s deeply unfair to the rest of the students like if grading curves are used to calculate final grades, for example, students who cheat cause discrepancies within the curving process and essentially screw everyone else over. There are a few students who unfortunately like their easy way out but they’re usually students who are investing in majors that don’t necessarily entail heavy, rigorous workloads. 

My sister, on the other hand, who goes to a public university will take any opportunity to cheat and find her easy way to a good grade. She finds pride in this. When I got to college our relationship was normal (but she was always toxic and I didn’t realize I was her puppet or that she was doing me dirty until half way through by first year of college. I was always taught that to respect older people, even if they’re wrong. I won’t get into all the fucked up shit she’s done and still continues to do to me). I had already learned to write college leveled and research papers in high school, but not entirely. My first semester i took a writing requirement course required by my college and learned how to cite just about anything. It wasn’t terribly difficult, but it took a few trial-and-errors for me to fully understand and be able to cite just about anything from books, to films, to videos etc. since many of our sources were a variety of different types of sources. My sister still did not know how to properly write out in text citations or a works cited page. She asked me to do them for her once and I essentially taught her how to do it and that if she wasn’t sure, she could just consult Purdue; I was apparently talking to a wall. I did it for her a second time because I felt bad, and told her to pay attention to me. She kept asking me over and over again but it got to a point where I told her she needs to learn to do them herself because she wasn’t busy. She got so angry and started telling my mom that I’m not a good sister and things of that sort. I explained to my mom that she’s only hurting herself by not doing it, I helped her twice and even taught her to do it and that I’m not the one being rewarded with a permanent grade on my transcript. She completely denied it. She’s a toxic person in general. She always and continues to blame everyone around her for her failures. 

Come this past semester, she asks me to do a 3-page paper where I had to read an 11 page article and another 2-page, unscholarly article and write a response paper that I had to make sure was an “A” paper and it was due that same night. I happened to be free and had already planned on how I wanted to
enjoy my free time. I simply refused and told her I would not do it. She starts texting me nonstop and after a half hour of refusing to do any work for her, she offers me money. I still refused until she stupidly offers me a $100 bucks. I still said no, and she proceeds to remind that for a $100, I still wouldn’t do it!?!? Then I said, well, okay I’ll do it for a $100, only because it’s a $100. She then tries to redeem herself by saying she has to study for an exam and that she was busy. I proceed to do her essay and turn my head every once in a while, she’s in excitement engaging in conversation with my brother and doing whatever the fuck she wanted. I didn’t say a word since I would be getting a $100 I thought I’d spend for new shoes. Our living room has two door openings leading from the kitchen. I get up for a snack from the fridge and then remember I need my charger from the front of the living room. I enter the living room from the entrance she has her back to and to my disappointment she’s on Instagram. I didn’t give a duck but this pisses me off for many reasons. She tries to quickly exit away from Instagram and then proceeds to act like she’s studying for her exam (which she does all the fucking time to avoid doing chores). Btw, we both live with our parents and commute to our campuses. I try my best to help around the house because I feel so bad but at the same time I really need all the study time I can get. When I first got to college, I used to study all day, I was taking 16 credits of rigorous science work. My sister told my mom I need to do chores because no one needs that much time to study. My parents know I perform better than my sister, so they understand. Now, she acts like she needs all day to study when she’s failed, withdrew and she’s retaking so many classes she was suppose to have been done with 3 years ago. She’s been in college for 6 years now. Two years ago she was finally able to take chemistry (she couldn’t before because she kept failing and retaking freaking algebra). It really bothers me the way she tries to devalue the hard work I put into my education and tries to avoid doing chores because she’s just a lazy person. I know how fortunate I am to be provided with housing, money and food at the expense of my parents’  hard earned money. She can’t even comprehend that and says my parents are obliged to provide for us. 

Now, I agreed to do two papers for in the past couple of weeks. One was a 9-page research paper and the other was a 3-page response paper. She texted me 15 messages asking me to do her paper on top of her already in my face for an hour begging me to do it for her. She kept offering me money. I kept refusing, until she said she would give me $100. I still refused, but she kept begging in desperation and I thought, heck, she doesn’t even care about developing writing skills and I would get a $100. After I agree, she says a $100 is too much and that $70 should suffice but I should do it for her for free because I’m her sister and if not $25 should be enough. I was clearly fed up and I promised I wouldn’t do it. She begs me again and I told her I wouldn’t even take a look at the prompt unless she hands me a $100. She does and I complete her paper. She has a failing grade in that class and I got her an A+ on that paper. I did work hard completing the paper and it was quite intense (nothing too crazy) because I had to complete it by midnight and it was already 7pm. I had to read an two sources, gather my thoughts and write the paper. Plus on top of that, I don’t particularly like writing papers but they are rewarding to me once I complete a paper I know I worked hard writing as best I can.

A week passes, she asks me to write a 9 page RESEARCH paper within 4 days. I asked her if she is motherfucking crazy because I’ve written multiple research papers and it takes more than 4 days to get a proper research question together, let alone a whole fucking research paper together. I told her that wasn’t possible, but she said she would give me $100 for it. I refused and told her I wouldn’t write a good enough paper within that time period (and to my surprise I did). She didn’t care because she knew she would write a way shittier paper had she done it, so I eventually wrote the paper and I stayed up two full nights writing the paper. 

Now, she’s saying I ripped her off and started tearing saying I’m her sister, I should’ve have done it for her for free. She said she needs money to buy a jacket and fucking clothes and she needs her money back. She said that people who write papers for other people don’t charge that much. I was actually curious so I looked it up, for the pages, hard work I put in within a small time span and the grade she received, SHE ripped me off. Then again, I don’t fucking work and have experience working an unethical job...they’re used to doing that type of shit. I’m not. 

Anyways, I’ll gladly return the money to her if she’s going to bug me and ask my parents for money as a way for her to replace the money she lost if I don’t give it to her (which she said she will do), but if I do I will contact her professor and let her know who actually did the work she’s getting credit for. 

I actually really want to return the money and teach her lesson because she does that kind of shit to everyone around her. The only thing is I’m concerned about getting into any kind of legal trouble. If I file a report, or email her professor and provide proof that I did those two assignments, can I do it without getting into any trouble or even anonymously?

216,"This is my first post on Reddit so sorry if it sucks.

I'm a 15 year old male who's never dated a girl. (partly cause I never wanted to, partly cause my parents are Mormon)

So I lived in California for most of my life and moved back to Tennessee, where I was born, 3 years ago. When we moved to Tennessee there were some girls at school that I would try to get with and things would always seem like they were going well but ultimately fail. My family is building a house so my parents are pretty stressed which stresses out me and my siblings, making us constantly get in arguments with them, especially me. There's other things that I don't really want to talk about that have also made me depressed, but the main things I'd say is what I'm about to tell you.

Alright so I don't believe in Mormonism but my parents make me go anyways. Mormons have youth dances where boys and girls slow dance with each other, but I guess its just to get to know each other. I met this girl who we'll call Daisy, (idk first thing that came to mind) she's one of the kindest, funnest, and most beautiful girls I've ever met. I asked her to dance, she said yes, and we kept up a good little conversation. I'm best friends with her cousin who we'll call Jose. A few days later Jose tells me that Daisy said she thought I was pretty cute. Now they live about 40 mins away from me and go to a Spanish Branch of the Mormon Church, so I didn't really get to see them a whole lot. There was one day that I went to spend the a few days at Jose's house. Sunday came around and Daisy was there, and I eventually asked for her number. We started to text A LOT. A few months would go by and I'd see her every so often but her and I are both really shy so the convos got awkward sometimes. The big fair came around and me, Daisy, Jose and some other friends went. We had a ton of fun and at one point all our other friends wanted to go on a ride, but she didn't want to go and I was ready to throw up from the rides. So it was just her and I so we talked for a while and I bought her a fucking $5 water bottle, can you believe that!? FIVE DOLLARS! Anyways me and Jose went back to his house and Daisy went back to hers. Things seemed to be going well with me and her and they were about to get better.

2 or 3 days later was another dance (Mormons have these a lot). She was there and I asked her to dance. While we were dancing she was super nervous and she had to like fan her self off. Then she just hugged me and I hugged her and we stayed like that till the song ended. After the song she just kinda ran off. There were like 300 people there so it wasn't exactly easy to find her. I eventually did and I told her how I felt and she said she felt the same, so I asked her if she wanted to go on a date sometime and she said yes. Now my parents and many other Mormons believe that teens shouldn't date till their 16 so this was a bit of a problem for me considering I was 14 at the time. (I just recently turned 15) We didn't really know what to do for a date cause neither of us had been on one before. We never did schedule it cause things got very complicated very quickly. Really all of a sudden she just ""lost interest"" even when I asked her if it was something I did she just said no. She said she just wants to be friends right now cause she wants to focus on other things. I still she her a lot due to being best friends with her cousin. I was already depressed before this happened and this just made things worse. She truly did make me happy and I miss what we had. I can't get her out of my head.

Thanks for any advice.",27Nov2018,1
218,"Hi all, I'm new to this sub so thanks in advance, and I'm sorry this is so long and unimportant

I'm a 22 YOM that's in nursing school. I work at a hospital to.

Back in July, a coworker (22 YOF) and I started flirting (we work opposite shifts so i never see her at work).

She invited me to her house for a party, and we basically both flat out stated that we really liked each other and kind of wanted to see what would happen.  she also said she wasn't talking with anyone else and that she wanted to get to know me better to eventually date.  Then a few hours later She got hammered and we made out on her couch until I chose to leave since she was drunk and I wasn't and I didn't want to risk going any further in case it was all alcohol talk (she was sober at first though, when we were having the more serious part of the talk).

Anyway, we start talking and it goes well. I go to another party and we have a bit of a repeat of the first night. 

We talk and get to know each other better, but then she kinda stops texting as much and I see on FB that she literally got a boyfriend, out of the blue. She then texted me, apologizing that she never even told me (5 days had past since we haven't talked and thats when I first saw her status) and I was basically a little upset but was like ""okay"".

I still decided to be friends with her since she also goes to my college and there was no use crying over spilled milk. 

I also lowkey thought I would eventually get another chance with her seeing as her BF seemed like a fuck, but i wasn't holding my breath and started to look elsewhere.

We keep in contact but didn't talk too much- and then out of the blue she invites me to her dorm to drink.

Turns out she had just broken up with her last BF (i was right on the money). We sleep in the same bed (no kissing or sex or anything) and we're basically friends, but also talking and very much heading towards dating. we begin to talk more and agree that we do like each other. 

shes not ready to commit yet, but i'm busy and don't mind. 

Now is also a good time to explain that she is basically a functioning alcoholic (though I'm not too far off) and that we have a lot in common. Similar upbringing, morals, etc- we really do get along great and she seems to like me as much as I like her.

Honestly it seems like we were going to be pretty good for each other- we both had the same goals like weight loss and cutting out the drinking (she drinks wayy more than I do though- almost a case of beer a week). 

Despite some of the shit she's done in the past (ie getting high, then sleeping with some rando, and then having to get tested for chalmydia) I see her as this awesome, really cute, really fun girl. Rose tinted goggles maybe, but I think the good outweighs the bad.

Nov. 10th, she gets trashed with her friends. She has been making side comments about my being a potential bf, and her friends exacerbate this by saying i'm ""her man"".

Basically, everything and everyone is telling me this relationship is about to happen.

She gets hammered the one night and long story short, with the encouragement of HER and her friends, I ask her out and we make it official the next day when she was sober. 

Shes also the first girl I have ever chased and actually gotten- like most girlfriends I have had I did't have a crush on or explicitly want to date- they came to me. So this was a massive victory for me! Out of the friend zone with an attractive woman who I really like.

Things are solid, but then today she tells me that everything ""hit all at once"" and basically that she didnt think it through and thinks she rushed into it.

She said she really values my friendship, but understands if that can't happen. She also acknowledges that she basically did this to me over the summer as well, albeit the circumstances were a bit different.

The thing is, i don't care enough to be devastated, but I don't know how to proceed-

Like, I really like her and a lot of people think we would be good together. 

Do I say ""fuck you"" and just stop talking with her on a level anything other than professional (which is rare) or should I stay friends with her and just not try to date her so I'm not petty?
Or should I keep holding out hope that this will happen?

I'm really trying to look at myself here too- maybe I need to change and I'm just an insufferable fuck. But honestly I just don't know and I'm confused and angry because i feel like I wasted my time and I also told people about this and its not even a thing now.

I'm sorry if this is like, pathetic! I really do appreciate if you read all that though! 

TLDR: So, today a girl I have been seeing for 2 weeks decided that she jumped the gun in going out with me. Thing is, she did something very similar to this back in July, and I don't really know whether or not I should even keep interacting with her as friends, or even hold out hope that she would actually want to try again another time.

Hey guys,

I don’t know how to act upon my feelings for someone I feel romantically attracted to.

It’s hard to sum, but I’ll try lol

We’ve been friends for many years now, and college is coming around the corner, I’ve had my own past relationships, and she’s had crushes but to my knowledge has never had a ‘real’ relationship.

She’s an amazingly beautiful, funny, and wonderful person I truly trust in my life. 

We’ve had ups and downs, like any friends usually do, but I find myself cherishing every moment I’m with her. From a stupid conversation about dumb memes or something, or talking about my favorite games, or hers I always long to continue talking after she or I have to go.

I heavily doubt she’d ever feel the same though, being close to her I can tell if she likes someone, and I don’t think she expects me to feel the way I do, but once more I’m basically 99.9% sure she doesn’t feel the same way.

I lose sleep at night sometimes wondering if I should ever tell her, I worry it’d make the friendship awkward even if it clears soon after, kinda just a thing that never goes away.

But again, we also go to college soon, and other parts of me say I should just do it, what do I have to lose (Not the best description lol)

I’m confident in my feelings for her, and I’ve tried to be somewhat direct at times, or subtle cause I’m honestly just kinda shy when I try to flirt tbh pretty bad at it.

Tl;dr I like a close friend of mine, I don’t think she feels the same, I don’t know whether to let it go, or just go for it.

I recently invited a girl to mine when I was drunk with the intention of evening the odds but I couldn't go through with it and sent her home apologizing for inviting her over.

221,"I’m [18F] in my first semester of college. I was doing pretty well but after a period of staying up late to cram for a project I ruined my sleep schedule and haven’t gotten it back in order in weeks. 

In high school, I used to force myself to fix it because my mom would make sure I got up in the morning, so I would just go to bed early knowing I’m getting up at the same time no matter what. Now, if I go to bed at 10 or 11 I just wake up at 4 am, and even if I go back to bed it’s like the sleep from before that is just cancelled out. I may as well have only gotten a few hours. 

Most nights I just mess around on my phone until I literally can’t keep my eyes open, but it seems like I’m getting some kind of tolerance for it because I stay up later every night that I do this. I just goof off on my phone until I feel “satisfied” enough to go to sleep, I can’t really describe it.

I tried to combat this by taking Advil PM but it makes it impossible to wake up on time, I either sleep through my alarm or I’m so tired that I just turn it off and go back to sleep. I never have any self control when I do this, in that mindset nothing matters more than sleep.

Because of all of this, I’ve been missing class after class, which doesn’t really matter that much now (most don’t take attendance &amp; are the equivalent to APs I got 3s on in high school), but I’m nervous about the habits I’m forming. I failed a test because I kept missing the class and didn’t even know when it was, and I just showed up one day completely unprepared.

In the middle of the night, I woke up to us holding hands. Eventually he ended up rolling over, putting his arm around me and straddling me. Soon after he started making out with me for a short period of time. It didn’t really go any further than that. 

The next day I brought it up to him and he said he didn’t remember anything and he probably just though I was his girlfriend. However, I’m now extremely confused about the nature of our friendship.

228,"I live in United States, Pennsylvania.  
I work nightshift on an airport ramp. After coming in from my weekend I hear rumors of them asking 2 people to volunteer to switch to 4am shift.  
They finally get around to breaking ""the bad news"" to us as a group.  
They said that they are looking for certain qualified people to switch to morning. And said if no one volunteers then the entire nightshift will do a bid based on sinority. No one volunteered.    
  
Next day; they picked out 4 of us, none of which are certified in the needs mentioned yesterday. We asked them for the name of the person who gave them the list. They declined answering who it was, saying they found the note on their desk. We asked why did it change from qualified people, to seemingly random people. They said it was an email, and didn't show us the email. So basically now it changed from bidding the whole shift based on sinority, to bidding between 4 people for 2 to go nightshift. No one volunteered.  
  
3rd day, We get told that it's actually 3 people out of the 4 that have to change to morning. No one volunteered. Then when we came in for the nightshift they called us into their ""office"" individually and told us if you're staying on night or if you're forced to go morning. I was one of those told I'm going morning.  
  
I told them that based on my schedule and transportation that I wont be able to make it in at 4am. They said to talk to our Operations Manager tomorrow at 8am.  
I asked them when is it taking effect, and they said in 3 days.  
So now with only 3 days to attempt to figure it out; after getting lied to and told different stories for 3 days, I would have to try to figure out what to do about this sudden and misinformed schedule change.  
  
I talked with other coworkers and they said I should ""write a statement about the changing stories"" and have other people who were told it, sign and date it. But I'm not sure how to go about doing that.  
I am going to talk to the operations manager tomorrow, and see if we can work something out based on my transportation, schedule, and such little time to prepare.  
And if he cant do anything for me, I plan on going to HR to talk about it.  
  
Can someone please help me keep this as professional, and effective as possible? I dont want to particularly quit the job, but 4am shift wont work on such a short notice.",27Nov2018,1
229,"Alright here’s my situation. I currently live on the second (also the top) floor in an apartment complex. A while back a new neighbor moved in below us, and immediately that day we began to smell weed in our apartment.

I don’t personally smoke, but I also don’t care what other people do. It’s not my place to tell somebody what they should and shouldn’t do and I really don’t care at all about weed, i don’t see a problem with it.

However, it is really getting old smelling it in our apartment every day, multiple times a day. It comes on very strong. My biggest problem with this is that I have begun to smell it on items around the house. I am also in grad school and wear scrubs every day and have begun noticing the smell at school, which obviously isn’t good. 

So what should my next step be? Are there any good ways to get rid of the smell in my own apartment? Or is there an appropriate way to handle this with my neighbor, considering I can’t ask him to not do something in his own place?",27Nov2018,1

Recently, she came for a visit and told my mom she's going to Europe for a week on vacation in December with a friend. We grew up in a very sheltered home. My dad would definitely not approve of her overseas without a family member. She said she could do whatever she wanted and that we couldn't stop her. She said she has tickets but won't give us flight numbers or where she will be staying or how we could stay in contact with her.

231,"As stated in the title, my wife and I are homeowners and received a quarterly water bill (NYC) in the amount of $1,800+ for a period that should have been between $275-$300. Obviously, we vigorously contested this with DEP and informed them that there had to have been some error. There is absolutely no way that we could have consumed this much water, as it represents an amount far in excess of what we would consume in an entire year. We were informed that since we claimed not to have used that much water, it could have been caused by a leak on or within our property which we refuted, as there was no evidence of either. We requested that an inspection be done and one was performed by a third party of their choosing. The inordinate usage reading registered during the middle of the billing cycle over a period of 30 consecutive days, then suddenly self corrected and returned to what would be considered ""normal daily usage"".

The inspector was granted full access to examine anything and everywhere that he wanted to see and, unsurprisingly, found no evidence of leakage, nor any evidence that one had existed or had recently been repaired. There was also no evidence that their water meter had been tampered with in any way. They still will not listen to reason and informed us that they expect this bill to be paid. We informed them that we were more than willing to pay for what we consumed, as that amount is usually very predictable because our routines are fairly consistent. I'd like to add that we have been the homeowners for 17 years, and our water consumption has always been consistent and unremarkable.

After months of back and forth, they are now threatening us with a lien on our home, etc., and we are at our wits end as to how to get them to accept that this was an error on their part. Any advice would be welcome.",27Nov2018,1

235,"Hey everyone,

As the title suggests, I'm a pretty bad procrastinator. As far as I can remember I've always had the terrible habit of putting off work that I didn't want to do. It's stuck with me in grade school, it's followed me into college. However, in grade school and college, there was often substantial leeway for me to procrastinate and get good enough grades - this is no longer the case in university.

This semester I am taking 4 classes. 2 of which I expect to get As in which I pray to god will help balance out my GPA, but the other 2 courses... one I'm struggling to maintain a C in and the other I've accepted that I'm just going to have fail.

The one I'm going to fail is psychology, I took it as a filler course and I thought it would be easy, but I didn't realize there'd be so much writing in the course; throughout the semester we've had to do four smaller 2-page research essays  and one big 5-page research essay at the end of the semester. I did only one out of four of the smaller essays and because I've held off the big essay for so long, I realize I won't be able to finish it in time by the deadline. I have officially screwed over my grade for this course, all I can hope for is a high D to cushion the blow to my GPA.

I am ashamed to admit how easily distracted I am as a young adult, I let stupid insignificant things waste my time like youtube, netflix and video games. I feel powerless sometimes to resist such distractions and so helpless when I finally decide to do work in the fleeting time I have left before the deadline.

I'm starting to resent how much trouble I get myself into. Me procrastinating has already screwed me over to a considerable degree and when I think of the future, I worry about how much my life will be hindered by this bad habit of mine.

But I'm rambling... if anyone was in a similar situation as I am and found effective ways to improve, I would really appreciate some advice. Thanks a lot

ttl;dr - procrastinated all my life, now it's sabotaging my performance in university: where it counts.",27Nov2018,1
236,"Sorry, this is kind of lengthy, but I'm desperate. My girlfriend and I have been living in our 2 bedroom apartment for 5 months now (since July) and are experiencing some noise issues with our current upstairs neighbors.

This is the 2nd set of residents to live above us. The first ones were excellent. We never heard anything from them, not even footsteps (and they had a big dog). They moved out in September. That's when the troubles started.

The family that lives above us now consists of a single mom, her teenage son, and 3 kids (guessing between the ages of 8-12). For a little while, we noticed some thuds and bangs here and there, but we figured they were finishing their move-in. After a few weeks went by, the noises got worse. The kids were always running around and creating loud BOOMS. We get it, kids are being kids and playing, but it would go on for hours. My girlfriend went up and politely asked if they could keep the noise down. They were very apologetic and said they were new to apartment living.

Few days go by and we don't have any issues. Fast forward a week and its back to where it was. Now, we did notice that our patio started filling up with cigarette butts. The lease says you must be 50 ft from the building to smoke. We went down to the management office to report it. Not because we are narcs, but because we don't want to be the ones getting in trouble if management were to walk by our patio (we are on the 1st floor), which they do every month or so for this stuff. 

Management contacted them and let them know smoking is prohibited on patios and they would have to give them a lease violation. This pissed them off and we noticed their footsteps started to have a little more weight to them. Bangs and thuds were more frequent and getting louder. Ones that would make us jump, and rattle the pictures on our walls. I wrote a kindly worded letter to them explaining that we were becoming irritated, were starting to lose sleep, didn't want any bad blood, and that we just wanted to resolve this maturely. I even made copies, so if you really want to see what I wrote, I can probably scan and upload it. They actually quieted for the next week, so we thought maybe we were out of the woods.

Then it again went back to the ridiculous level of noise. We went down to our management again, but they said they couldn't do anything about us filing a noise complaint without a police visit, confirming the noise level. As the weeks went on, the noises continued, and our office visits were frequent. They didn't do anything to help us. Never even reached out to them to ask to quiet down. That is what is EXTREMELY infuriating and gives a feeling of being trapped. But they DID tell us if we wanted to break our lease, it will be a 2 and a half month's rent (~$4000) for a charge.

My girlfriend and I both became incredibly frustrated over time. I eventually snapped and hit the ceiling a few times. They stomped right back and WAY louder. They started stomping intentionally at random points of the day throughout the week, but not frequent enough to were the police would probably catch it if the came out. We would be waken from sleep almost every night. The office again pretty much told me we were SOL unless we had proof/documentation that they are doing this.

Skip ahead to 3 days ago. My girlfriend and I returned around midnight from shopping. We noticed a group of sketchy people standing around a car near our entrance, but didn't think much of it. As we started to walk in, we could smell marijuana coming from their direction. They started yelling stuff towards us like ""Hey, its the milk man!"" and laughing (I was carrying milk haha). As soon as we unlocked the building door, they started walking towards us quickly and yelled ""Hey, we're coming in with you!"" We got in the building fast and closed the door behind us. I wasn't comfortable letting them in. I could tell the weren't residents. Well, the teenage son walked around the corner of the stairs (he was going to be the one to let them in) and saw us lock his friends out. I should mention that we know what they physically look like, and vice-versa. They all 4 went up to the apartment and started stomping everywhere; living room, bedrooms, bathrooms. We left our apartment for a few hours to get away from it.

Everyday now, they stomp with every footstep, slam cupboards, kids running around all the time, random smashes that rattle our apartment VERY frequently in all rooms. We are losing sleep because of it, we can't enjoy watching TV, eating dinner, or anything. We have absolutely no idea what to do now. From talking with one of our side neighbors, who also had noise issues, the police usually shrug off noise as ""apartment sounds."" So with no police proof, our management refuses to help us with the situation. We've tried being nice and friendly, but these people just don't care. It's starting to effect my girlfriend and mine's relationship. We're both irritable, tired, and argue A LOT. Is there ANYTHING we can do?

237,"**TLDR: 2 of my coworkers are very nice to me, while the 3rd keeps drawing attention to the fact that I'm not fluent in Spanish and making fun of me for it. I'm worried that it's making the other 2 coworkers treat me differently, and it's definitely making me feel self conscious. I've tried to talk to my coworker, but she didn't really listen to what I was saying at all. Advice for how to either talk to her more effectively, or somehow prevent how she's acting from changing our other coworkers opinions of me?**  


  
This is maybe a petty problem, but has left me feeling a little rejected and hoping to find ways to connect better with my coworkers who are otherwise very nice people.  


I started at a new job about 2 months ago  
There are 3 other Latina and/or hispanic women in my office. ""C"" and ""K"" have never mentioned it, but ""M"" has started acting weird around me since she found out I'm not fluent in Spanish (although I do read and understand.) She's mentioned it or pointedly tried to draw attention to it like, at least 3 times, and I think it's making our other two coworkers treat me more distantly.  


Again, I realize this is kind of a petty problem, and might have to do with how M feels about herself and less to do with me. People can pretty easily tell I'm Latina by looking, and a lot of times assume I speak Spanish. When customers come in they sometimes mistakenly wait for me specifically to help them because of this. M has fair coloring and blond hair, and people are often surprised that she speaks Spanish, which I'm sure is frustrating for her and probably why she points me out so much for this. I feel like when she talks to me, she goes out of her way to sound ""street"" even though I know that she, like me, grew up in a middle class NJ suburb. I know she doesn't talk this way with other people. She drops stuff into conversation too, like mentioning that her parents are strict, etc. and then going ""it's a Spanish thing, you wouldn't understand."" Once when someone asked my ethnicity in front of her, she cut in before I could answer and said ""oh, she's a fake-o-rican."" A second time that someone else asked me, she cut in again, but this time I'd been downgraded to ""half fake-o-rican"" (Both my parents are Puerto Rican, mom was born in the US, dad came over as a teenager.)   


Anyway, this is getting way too long, the point is, it's annoying, and I did, really gently, try to point it out to her once. I'd like to be able to just...act natural around the office, but I've started censoring myself from using certain slang or saying certain things, so that she doesn't jump down my throat for, like, appropriating my own culture or something. I also didn't bring my pasteles to the holiday pot luck because I started feeling really self conscious about it and wondering if she would nit pick on how I made them or make fun of my cooking.   


So yes, anyway, I'm dragging this on way too long and probably making it sound much worse than it actually is. Again, C and K don't act like this at all to me, but I feel like, when M makes a big fuss like this they do start to treat me less warmly, whether they realize it or not, and I'd like to  


1) head this off before it becomes an actual problem  
2) find a way to mention it to M again and get her to actually listen to what I'm saying  
3) stop letting it get to me and make me feel self conscious

238,"I am a 16 year old female, it is coming to the end of grade 11 for me.

The teacher I'm talking about teaches me and my friends and I am currently achieving As in that subject. I have had a difficult upbringing that included being told that I will never be anything and I will never achieve success, this has led me to have a lack of self confidence and a lot of self doubt.

Going into grade 12 my self doubt is starting to overwhelm me and become more present. The teacher in question is very nice to me one to one help but whenever addressing more than one person can be tough and uses shock tactics. 

Today was the worst, I had previously had an exam and I was feeling good about it. I was talking to my friend (16M) when the teacher came around the corner, I gave him a big smile and waved obviously happy.

My friend said something along the lines of don't question her because I was being a bit weird and this is where things changed.

The teacher replied with ""why would i question her, that would imply she knows things"" and that spiraled into saying things like I know nothing and calling me an ""empty void that can't suck in any knowledge"". The whole time my friend isn't defending me rather he is saying the same things and giving the teacher things to work with. They look like best buddies pressed against the wall staring at me smirking. I quickly retreated after this and walked far away.

I'm obviously hurt by this, I don't know if this was some joke or their way of maybe using reverse therapy to get me to try harder at work but the only effect they've achieved is just my sadness and growing self doubt that i am nothing.

So what do you guys think? Please be honest.",27Nov2018,1
239,"Idk what to call this, but I'll make it super short and sweet.

Basically I've been having a condition that's been getting worse with meds I take for anxiety and depression. The issue is that I have complete  bursts of energy. These can be good or bad, for example one time when I was suicidal I cut up myself and poured white vinegar and then rubbing alcohol on my cuts. The times where it's ""better"" is where I have episodes where I can't even seem to speak English (I speak a different language because I'm trilingual I guess??) and I can run around and have a seizure in a way. It's significantly bad when I'm in bed and trying to go to sleep (like now). It happens in social situations, like once where my legs stopped working and I felt like I was running at the same time and a time where in the middle of class I got up and walked around the classroom for no reason.

240,"Let me put out a few facts: I'm an (recently turned) 18 year old female, I have been sexually active with only my boyfriend for the past two years, my mother is ironically an anti-vaxxer.

So earlier today, I go to my appointment with my mother, usually she schedules these to go with my siblings as well but they were in school and she didn't want to take them out. Typically, she would not be present in the room because of my siblings but this time she said she had the right to know about what the doctor was putting in MY BODY. My mother doesn't know I'm sexually active and doesn't even know I let alone kiss my damn man. I tell her its uncomfortable that shes in here because she might make fun of my weight or give me anxiety with her looking at me do what the doctor wants me to do. My doctor is a very kind woman and knew how wrong the situation was but my mother wouldn't budge. I was suppose to get vaccinated too but my mother said I didn't need it despite suppose to help against STDs regardless if I'm active or not.

I don't know what to do about my mother, I'm under their health insurance but does that really mean she needs to control what the doctor says I need? I didn't want her in the room, she could've just waited. The worse part is, in the car ride home, she went on about how disturbing it is to put dead viruses and diseases in your body.",27Nov2018,1
241,"I live in an apartment where we have the option of buying parking, but it's all tandem. We're assigned to specific spots, along with one parking mate. One of us is always blocking the other in, so you have to move the other person's car in order to leave. Normally we'd just give each other spare keys, but apparently she doesn't have one. At first, I gave her my spare and she just left her key in the car. It worked fine until her car got broken into and she decided she didn't feel comfortable leaving it locked anymore (totally understandable). So now I have to ask her to move it anytime I wanna go anywhere. This is kind of problematic because I like to go places pretty late at night or sometimes just when she's not there. 



Today I got back from class around 11 and had to go grocery shopping. She was blocking me in, so I asked her to move her car. She said at first that one of her roommates could move it, but none of them were home. She told me she'd be back from class at 6 and then she could move it. She didn't end up coming back today, but she was able to have one of her roommates give me her key at about 7:30, so I didn't get to go shopping until 8 and a half hours after I wanted to. I'm paying $100 a month to park here, and this just seems ridiculous.



I asked if she had a spare key, or if she could get one made and I'd pay for it. I figured she could just leave the key for the engine inside (the issue was leaving the door unlocked, not leaving the key inside) and I'd buy two keys for unlocking the door, which are usually pretty cheap. I found out that her car requires a fob to even open the door, so it would be around $75 minimum for a new key. 



I really don't know what to do here. I frequently have to drive my best friend home at like 1-2 AM, and I definitely can't wake this girl up to move her car. I was thinking of just asking her to always park in front of me, seeing as she has a key to my car and can leave whenever she wants, but I'm not sure if she'd be willing since it'd be such a hassle to move my car out and back in when she has to park. It just doesn't seem fair though that we're paying the same amount and she can leave whenever while I have to wait hours just to go shopping. I also don't particularly want to pay $75 for a key (I was thinking a couple normal keys would be under $20).",27Nov2018,1
242,"Hi.
17F and in high school. And there is another guy in my grade, 17M. I’ll hold off on my opinions on him for now. Some context: 
I’ve known him for two years now, but we rarely speak in person. Occasionally, he texts me about classes or about basketball (basketball is co-ed here) but other than that, we don’t talk much. I rarely see him in person and we’ve never really had an actual proper conversation. But for whatever reason, he has something against me and doesn’t like me. I just want to know WHY, not what he doesn’t like about me, just why?? It makes no sense to me.

I joined the basketball team two years ago and obviously I’m a noob because I’m new! But he thinks he’s gonna go pro at basketball, thus acting extremely full of himself. The only reason he’s decent is because he pays for classes, tutoring, and what not...I don’t have the money to do that so I’m learning the good old fashioned way, by practicing and asking others for advice/constructive criticism! 

Today, he was texting my friend (he’s aware we’re friends) and she showed me the conversation. he constantly kept bringing me up. My friend told him that people think he’s really egotistic and rude, and the first thing he asked was if I thought that. He seemed to care a lot about what I think of him. And even pretended to not know how to spell my name, and for the record, my name is about as common as Jessica or Emma and it’s not spelled weird. Just why? If he claims he doesn’t like me why the hell does he care. And why would he go out of his way to talk to me if he didn’t like me? 

I have literally done nothing to this guy. What do you think? 

tldr; guy claims and acts like he hates me. yet I’ve had little to no interaction with him. Huh? What kind of logic is this. What does that even mean. ",27Nov2018,1

246,"Sorry, this is kind of lengthy, but I'm desperate. My girlfriend and I have been living in our 2 bedroom apartment for 5 months now (since July) and are experiencing some noise issues with our current upstairs neighbors.



This is the 2nd set of residents to live above us. The first ones were excellent. We never heard anything from them, not even footsteps (and they had a big dog). They moved out in September. That's when the troubles started.



The family that lives above us now consists of a single mom, her teenage son, and 3 kids (guessing between the ages of 8-12). For a little while, we noticed some thuds and bangs here and there, but we figured they were finishing their move-in. After a few weeks went by, the noises got worse. The kids were always running around and creating loud BOOMS. We get it, kids are being kids and playing, but it would go on for hours. My girlfriend went up and politely asked if they could keep the noise down. They were very apologetic and said they were new to apartment living.



Few days go by and we don't have any issues. Fast forward a week and its back to where it was. Now, we did notice that our patio started filling up with cigarette butts. The lease says you must be 50 ft from the building to smoke. We went down to the management office to report it. Not because we are narcs, but because we don't want to be the ones getting in trouble if management were to walk by our patio (we are on the 1st floor), which they do every month or so for this stuff.



Management contacted them and let them know smoking is prohibited on patios and they would have to give them a lease violation. This pissed them off and we noticed their footsteps started to have a little more weight to them. Bangs and thuds were more frequent and getting louder. Ones that would make us jump, and rattle the pictures on our walls. I wrote a kindly worded letter to them explaining that we were becoming irritated, were starting to lose sleep, didn't want any bad blood, and that we just wanted to resolve this maturely. I even made copies, so if you really want to see what I wrote, I can probably scan and upload it. They actually quieted for the next week, so we thought maybe we were out of the woods.



Then it again went back to the ridiculous level of noise. We went down to our management again, but they said they couldn't do anything about us filing a noise complaint without a police visit, confirming the noise level. As the weeks went on, the noises continued, and our office visits were frequent. They didn't do anything to help us. Never even reached out to them to ask to quiet down. That is what is EXTREMELY infuriating and gives a feeling of being trapped. But they DID tell us if we wanted to break our lease, it will be a 2 and a half month's rent (~$4000) for a charge.



My girlfriend and I both became incredibly frustrated over time. I eventually snapped and hit the ceiling a few times. They stomped right back and WAY louder. They started stomping intentionally at random points of the day throughout the week, but not frequent enough to were the police would probably catch it if the came out. We would be waken from sleep almost every night. The office again pretty much told me we were SOL unless we had proof/documentation that they are doing this.



Skip ahead to 3 days ago. My girlfriend and I returned around midnight from shopping. We noticed a group of sketchy people standing around a car near our entrance, but didn't think much of it. As we started to walk in, we could smell marijuana coming from their direction. They started yelling stuff towards us like ""Hey, its the milk man!"" and laughing (I was carrying milk haha). As soon as we unlocked the building door, they started walking towards us quickly and yelled ""Hey, we're coming in with you!"" We got in the building fast and closed the door behind us. I wasn't comfortable letting them in. I could tell the weren't residents. Well, the teenage son walked around the corner of the stairs (he was going to be the one to let them in) and saw us lock his friends out. I should mention that we know what they physically look like, and vice-versa. They all 4 went up to the apartment and started stomping everywhere; living room, bedrooms, bathrooms. We left our apartment for a few hours to get away from it.



Everyday now, they stomp with every footstep, slam cupboards, kids running around all the time, random smashes that rattle our apartment VERY frequently in all rooms. We are losing sleep because of it, we can't enjoy watching TV, eating dinner, or anything. We have absolutely no idea what to do now. From talking with one of our side neighbors, who also had noise issues, the police usually shrug off noise as ""apartment sounds."" So with no police proof, our management refuses to help us with the situation. We've tried being nice and friendly, but these people just don't care.

Everything was fine, I was having fun, I dyed some of my hair pink, and had cake, then my mum comes knocking on doors saying Snowflake probably had some type of heart attack, I went downstairs and she wasn't moving.

248,"Hello Reddit,

Thank you so much for reading this post. At this moment, I am completely at loss. I am aware that it’s not my responsibility to resolve someone else’s problems, but my best friends are young and intelligent women who deserve a great future. 

Note: Names are going to be changed. 

Let’s start with Sophie [18F]. I met her at college this year, she is studying Economics and will start second year next. When I met her she was working and earning a good salary, but around June she became unemployed. 

I found out that she has not been working because her father won’t allow her. Please be aware that Sophie pays for her own expenses, including college. Without a job she won’t be able to attend college at all. 

She has a car that her father “gave her” , however, he didn’t teach her how to drive and when she finally paid for classes, he didn’t  allow her to get the license. 

Today, she was grounded until further notice. He took her phone and she is unable to communicate with people. This was because she came 15 minutes later than he expected.

Her mom is young, but unemployed. Her siblings are in special and expensive schools, as one has learning disabilities and the other one has health issues. They all depend economically on him, even though they are currently drowning in debt. 

Now, this is what scared me. I told Sophie that she could move in with me, that I could help her start from scratch. I’ve got my own car and my family is extremely supportive. We do not have a lot of funds per se, but as a girl that lived with an abusive father for 17 years, I definitely want to help her family out.

She said that she loved me and appreciates my offer, however, that man is capable of killing either me and my family or her mom. I told her that there was no reason to be scared, I’ve got lawyers and we’ve got the cops. She said that he is a coward and he wouldn’t be doing it himself, but he would definitely send people to kill us or harm us as he is batshit crazy. 

Her mom wants to divorce him, but she is scared. She literally has nothing on her name. 

Sophie was also offered a scholarship a year ago, but she had to refuse as her father didn’t want her to study abroad. 

Now, there’s Kaitlyn. She comes from a wealthy family (new money and most of the family is uneducated)

She is studying Economics as well and even though she was at the same pace as Stephanie, she is now behind. 

When the second semester began, Kaitlyn started losing weight. She is a petite woman and her goal wasn’t to lose weight. 

If she wasn’t working or at college, she spent almost all her free time sleeping. Her “concerned” father prohibited her from going to college until he figured out what was happening with her. He thought that she was probably pregnant and instead of buying a test or something he just allowed time to go by while he was changing his mind constantly. 

She was still able to go to work as she is working in her father’s company. She loves doing the job, but hates working with her father and family. She has already tried to quit and her father won’t let her. She is unable to work somewhere else because she is a foreigner and doesn’t have her paperwork (due to her parents)

Getting her paperwork done costs less than $1,000 which they have, as they are able to afford paying two luxurious cars. 

Due to her father thinking that she was pregnant and her constantly getting sick, she missed a lot of classes and her attendance was affected. Afterwards, her parents just didn’t give college the importance it deserved and used her as a chauffeur or baby sitter. Because of this, she failed 3 classes out of 5 with a slim chance of passing the other. 

A few weeks ago, they were threatened, so for security reasons he took the car she was using. Now she has not being able to go out even though nothing else has happened and they weren’t contacted anymore. 

Her mother is now frightened and wants to go back to her home country where the political and economic situation is worse. If Kaitlyn moves, she won’t able to continue her studies.

If she stays, she would be living with her father only. As she doesn’t want any of that, she asked to study abroad. The parents said that they would think about it, but she wouldn’t be able to attend this semester to college. 

Kaitlyn had the opportunity to study abroad before, but her parents wouldn’t let her. I don’t think this time it will be different. 

How can I help them? What can I tell them? I am 100% there for them and I know that together we can figure stuff out. 

Thanks for the advice! You guys are great persons.",27Nov2018,1

Basically I have a 50% attendance, i still have super good grades and im one of the smartest 5 kids in my year, but i can never get myself to school anymore, it is painfull to wake up in the morning, i feel fine on weekends but i literally cannot force myself to go to school in the morning. The thing is, is that i dont see the point, i feel if i stay at home i will still acomplish more than I would if i went, because i do 90% of what i would do in class, at home. I never feel motivated and I never want to go but at the same time I dont want to have to work a dead end job my whole life just because im too ""lazy"" to go to school. I also feel im not challenged enough, therefore I think of it as a waste of time. 
I dont know what to do anymore, do i go?

251,"Hi guys,

So this is a throw away because my boyfriend uses reddit. 

I recently got a new job making the most I have ever made. I love gift giving and I love making people happy, but I have never (until now) had the money to buy the gifts Ive wanted for people that I love. 

This year, I bought my sister and my boyfriend an iPhone XR. Now, I know these are extravagant gifts for middle class. I also know my boyfriend would never buy this for himself (though he could if he wanted, he has the money) because he is very practical and doesn’t “need it” but he would like one very much. My sister on the other hand has an old iPhone 6s with a broken screen and makes just enough money to get by. Her husband passed last year just after Christmas, and I know that this is something he would have bought her had he still been here. I feel that this may bring a little joy to her on a day that will be difficult as the first Christmas without him. 

My problem is that I’m worried that my boyfriend will get upset that I spent so much. Should I tell him that I got an iPhone  for my sister and see if he would like to contribute to the gift? Either way, I am worried he will be upset when he opens his because of the expense of both. I am also worried that if I return his and get him something else, he will be jealous that I spent so much on my sister and not him. He is notoriously difficult to buy gifts for because he is relatively simple. He would never tell me that he was jealous or act in a way that expressed that, but I have never spent that much on a gift for him or anyone before. 

Should I return his, get him a Nintendo switch and tell him that I got it for my sister, return my sisters and get her something else and give him his, or return both and stop worrying about it? ",27Nov2018,1
252,Hello! This just happened about an hour and half ago. My boyfriend and I were driving and we saw a really bad crash happen so we pulled over ran over and I called the police and we started trying to make sure everyone was okay and safe. One of the women involved kept asking if anybody had insurance and asking who could pay for this and the other man involved was extremely angry and kept yelling and hitting things around him so once the police showed up and started sorting everything out we decided this really wasn’t the kind of thing we need to be hanging around for. However because we witnessed the crash and because I am the one who called 911 i’m starting to feel like we probably should’ve hung around. My boyfriend said after the fact that he saw the woman pouring out a can of something and she kicked it under the car so i’m assuming it was probably beer. If I had know that he thought he saw that i would’ve told him to tell the police right then and there but because it’s after the fact i’m not sure what to do. Should i just wait and see if the police call me? Should i reach out to them? I took pictures of the accident and the police cars (mostly to prove to my mom what was going on so she knew why i broke curfew) but i’m not sure if it’s a good idea to keep those pictures just in case or delete them. This is in Texas btw if that makes a difference. Thank you! :) ,27Nov2018,1

254,"I created this account because I legitimately dont know where else I can go or do. Years ago when I was 15 and into games , I met someone via Facebook who posed to be 24. And he connected with me through my love of games. Quickly I started to develop a crush on him. And our relationship moved from just friends to something more romantic. Little did I know at the time that he was grooming me. By the time I turned 18, I was sending him pics which then turned into exchanging videos into college. He then came clean to me 5 years later that he was in his early 50's. I was dumbfounded. I knew this stuff could happen but I was a smart teen. Insecure, but I thought I knew better. I was so shocked that I attempted to maintain a friendship with him even through meeting my boyfriend. He was still trying to manipulate me when I was starting my new relationship so I asked him to delete any photos and never contact me again....

That was 5 years ago. He has been finding ways to message me ever since then. The messages just say ""hi"" or ""how's it going"" but it scares the living shit out of me. he even got a new number to try and contact me. He knows my family address and I bet you he still has pictures of me. I am afraid to do or say anything because he could ruin my life. He waited until I was of legal age of consent so incan do anything. 

My parents have always considered me to be a smart kid. I can even think of looking my father in the eye and telling him what I did with a man older than him. The only one who knows is my boyfriend.

i began to tell him that i saw no point into talking to him, my emotions took over me. i was very upset. i didn’t realize that i said some wrong things. i then apologized but he was inconsistent with his texting, which i found very odd. later last night, i apologized for being overdramatic &amp; well yeah. he said to forget about it but i just feel like something’s up... is it just me or should i listen to my gut?

258,"I recently started working at this car roof rack store in West Coast Canada and noticed a few things that doesn't seem safe. 

https://imgur.com/a/bWg1apn

First thing I notice is that there's this elevated platform (About 15 feet/4.5 meter drop) that's shaped like an L that stores cargo boxes. Right below that L is an open space for 2 car bays to install stuffs. Concrete flooring. Only way to get there is by a ladder on the right. Ladder is just rested on the platform, no cutout, no guide. When you get to the top, it's pretty much a crawl space, A 5 feet/1.5 meter from platform flooring to the wooden ceiling, with just 2 feet/0.61 meter space to get by from the cargo boxes to the edge of the platform. Ceiling includes beams that you can easily knock your head against. I notice there are foam on them, probably from past incidents. There are no safety railings. There are plywood flooring that are bending, which anyone could trip and fall down. We store and remove cargo boxes in large boxes weighing around 30 - 60 pounds/ 13.6 - 27.2 kilogram by hand, one person on the floor lifting it up and one guy up top to pull and store it. 

Second thing is the storage of spray paints, lube sprays, blowtorch canister, and such. Its in a metal cabinet with no doors. Seems like if there were ever a fire in that specific location of the shop, the cabinet would be just fireworks spraying out. No ventilation of some sort, just a car garage door to let cars in and out. 

Several things as well such as how dusty everything are, no eye wash station, fire extinguisher tag was out of date, only some people know where the first aid kits are located, and such. 

I never mentioned this to the managers, or employees but will probably soon. It seems like a disaster waiting to happen. I will most likely leave soon though. I checked WorkSafeBC's website and clearly my store where I work at doesn't follow safety procedures. 

Thanks in advanced.

259,"Forgive me if I posted this on the wrong subreddit.

I recently had a husky who is now 11 months old and raised him from where he was 10 weeks. He is very friendly and energetic. As I recently got a new job, I haven't had time to take care of him. My parents who are usually home are also old and do not have the energy to keep up with him. So I decided to give him away to my neighbor who lives across the street from me. As much as it pains me of giving him away, my mom lost a ton of weight while watching over my husky so it has contributed to the stress that caused her weight loss. I wanted to put my mother first, so I decided to give my husky away to neighbors who live across the street from me. I wanted to give him away but wanted to be around him as he grows, so I thought that would be a good idea. They have taken care of him before as I went on trips and my neighbors are usually fine with the idea of watching my husky while I am away.

But a couple weeks later the neighbor who lives next door to them; Lisa claims that she hears ""abuse"" coming from their household. She does not see them hitting my dog but she hears them screaming at him if he is misbehaving. Earlier today Lisa said she heard my dog knock some stuff over in their house and heard them screaming at him as if they were trying to kill him. This made me worried about my husky's safety, so I decided to give my neighbor a call to maybe try and convince them to give my husky back without insinuating that they are abusing him as I have no evidence of that. After a few exchanges, my neighbor does not agree with my decision and hung up on me after I tried persuading to have him return my husky.

Lisa and I have thought about calling animal services and getting them involved but I don't know how that will end. If that leads to nowhere, my neighbor will obviously know that we called animal services on them and this would lead to an awkward situation. Lisa claims that she has seen them abuse their other dogs, but that's not enough evidence as it is not recorded as well as the screaming.

I really don't know what to do in my situation. Please help.",27Nov2018,1

I was offered a great position within a renowned and well thought of retailer. I let them know upfront I was available days as well as a single weekend day so long as my days off remain the same as well as the hours stay consistent. No problem they said and gave me an example schedule that I said yes to. I received my first week’s schedule and saw the days shifted a day, but all hours were consistent with the exception of the weekend shift which was off by an hour (no biggie). I haven’t received my 2nd week’s schedule yet; however I just got my 3rd: not one consistent hour day and the hours vary anywhere from 8:45 am to 9pm. My days off were also shifted, the biggest issue being my weekend work day is now same as my kid’s Christmas program.

Im now studying abroad in Germany and i have a german bf. About 2 weeks ago i received a message in my DMs on Instagram and that guy asked if im together with ( name of my bf ). I said yes and asked who he is . He just said doesnt matter and told me that i owed him protection money. I kept asking who he really is and what protection money means but he didnt answer , he was just still replying doesnt matter u owed me money/ protection money. And then he told me he would find me and rape me and called me bitch too. I told him i would give this to the polices and he blocked me. I thought it was a prank of one of my bf’s friends or someone lent my bf money . Because they must know him so that he could ask if im together with him. My bf thought the same and he asked all his friend who possibly could do this and he told me he didnt borrow anyone money and of course not pay back too. The point is there r not many of his friends knowing me or my instagram, just a couple of his cousins and some friends who r living in the same city with me. He asked all of them and they swore they didnt do that thing. My bf told me to forget about this. It’s just some crazy people on instagram, dont think too much about it. I was agreed with him and i did forget about this thing. But yesterday my bf asked me why i unfollowed him on instagram. He uses an app called Stalker ( an app made to analyze things on instagram for examples who follow/unfollow u, how many lost/gain followers u got , etc. ) and i said no i didnt unfl him.  I checked my phone and my account even blocked him. Just him and no one else. And we both think it was that guy again and what he’s trying to do with me or us. Pls if anyone knows how to deal with this just tell me. Im really scared right now cause i know someone is still having eyes on me .

270,"Good day Reddit

After some 4 years i finally look on reddit for advice because i don't know how to stop.

In my teens i got a really bad habbit of playing ill and skipping school every other week, which is really a lot. I already knew that this was not really a good idea. But no one caught me soo i didn't need to change. 

Now i got a job and i really thought i wouldn't do it because it is career suicide and i will become unemployable. I still call in sick nearly every second week, at least twice a month..
When i wake up in the morning i'm another person and i lie to myself so i can continue sleeping and so i call in sick. Even when i stricktly argued against this last evening. 

I am not happy about this and know i fuck up hard. But i'm really bad at changing on my own and since no one else knows from my charade i'm not directly forced to stop..

But i want to because this becomes evermore stupid. I need some advice on how to stop with this awful habit. ",27Nov2018,1

273,"I’m 19 and in college, however I feel like since I was 16 my life has been a turmoil of failures. It all started when I “peaked” by earning a call-up to the US youth national team for soccer. At the week long training camp, I felt terrible and played worse. I left the camp thinking I had closed all doors ahead of me. Still, I was recruited to a top D1 school on scholarship. My senior year I was also picked up by my local MLS club as a youth player to hopefully be signed to a first team contract after college. My year at the MLS club was a dud, I hardly lived up to the hype I received coming in. The same thing occurred in my first college soccer season. I have just met with my coaches after our second season (where I again didn’t play) and they seem to be pushing me to transfer. It makes sense because they don’t see me playing, but if I stay, then they invested (and wasted) 8% of their entire scholarship pool on me. I am scared to hit reset on life, but think it could be for the better. I’ve committed so much to my current academics and hopefully will get into my major this winter. I’ve also created some amazing friendships that I’m afraid to lose. Do I transfer and hit reset? Do I stay and grind it out, presumably gaining important life qualities by “not giving up”?",27Nov2018,1
274,"**THE GIFT:** [**https://imgur.com/a/3wDAuUO**](https://imgur.com/a/3wDAuUO)

Everything is handmade by me from the box and the contents except the *herbarium* (right side preserved flowers) and the two origami (flower and cat) necklaces on the top left. 

The seven domes on the lower left are suppose to be cat figurines made out of clay while wearing kimonos. (The cat heads weren't made yet because that was the time I learned that she already has a boyfriend making me unmotivated to finish the whole thing.)

.

**TLDR version**: Been crushing/in love with this girl for 2 years. Poured my heart and soul out by making art for her in those 2 years. She loves the art and all the hard work and effort I put into it and she knows that she's my inspiration. I'm about to confess my feelings to the girl this December with a customized handmade gift I've been making for 6 months for her. Recently found out that she just had a boyfriend. Currently heartbroken. What should I do?

.

.

**Long version:** Saw this girl working at a local cafe exactly 2 years ago. I was drawing at the cafe as usual because that's what I do when I'm at the cafe. Saw the girl and drew her. Gave the drawing to her and she loved it. Friendship ensues. I was still hesitant to ask her out back then because of social anxiety so what I did was I drew her well. I drew her cats because she love cats. It came to a point that I was able to create a full comic book story with her as the main character. I even went as far as selling the comic book at a convention just to prove that, well... there's nothing to prove. They were drawings... All I'm trying to say is, I made a great friend out of art but... my feelings towards her was never validated.

And that's not because of her. That was because of me hiding behind my drawings. Because she likes my art a lot... Maybe.. she just likes the art itself and never the person who makes it even though that drive and passion was created because of her. I wish I was more human... that way we could've interacted more than just me giving her art/gifts. 

We do have a couple of good (sometimes a bit awkward) conversations. But I, as always never got the chance to ask her out properly out of fear of rejection. 

Today marks the 2nd year that I've known her. She fully appreciates my art and even shows it to everyone... I just.. I just wish I was strong enough before to ask her out like a 'normal human being'. Now it's too late. She already has a boyfriend. And I'm back to being just a wallpaper.

It seems unfair to say that ""Why would she make me feel this way?"" I've devoted all of my creative and artistic abilities to this girl for her to hopefully notice how passionate I am to her. But again.. it's to late. She already has a boyfriend.

I know it's my fault. I should've been more human instead of being just 'that drawing dude that's kinda weird'.

I see her smile when I give her my drawings. It motivates me. It inspires me. Now... I don't know. The comic itself is still suppose to be ongoing but with her having a boyfriend now takes out every piece of motivation I had before.

.

*I wish I was someone else. I wish I had charisma. I wish I never hid behind my drawings to convey what I feel. Now it's too late. She already is in a relationship.*

.

This is a case of the *artist and the muse*. That really old stereotypical story we ALL hear about that always ends up as a sad story for the artist making the art.

Any advice would greatly be appreciated.",27Nov2018,1

Well, the problem is simple but i feel like talking about it in length.
I'm this CS freshman at a university in East Asia. And well, I don't really know why I am doing what I am doing. I got into all of this with the expectation that my interest alone will encourage me to persist, to work hard and all that. But for the past few months that has not been the case.
I only really attend 2-3 lectures a week, and the reason for that is mostly attendance. I'm scoring above average and all but that isn't the point, I can do better and I know it.

When I'm back at my dorm all I really do is just fap and sleep and eat. My expenses are increasing rapidly too since there's a canteen just downstairs. I dont really have much money left, I have no clue what ill do next term and i feel absolutely horrible asking my parents for money.

i thought i had 'passion' for data science, i used to sccour through reddit and look for guidelines on what i should be doing and all that, but I just never do it. i have a coursera account and a kaggle account and all that, i even have access to a gpu cluster somehow but for some reason i still wont actually fucking learn the material and try to implement it.

im getting fatter and im already prediabetic. i feel like no worldly thing can actually make me do anything at all, i hate this stagnation. 

i cant even make friends either, it is just as how it was before i came to this country. i have hundreds of acquaintances and i know enough people to get by but i dont really connect with anyone. there is no friendship here, just ties established on mutual benefits. the people here are all just so... different. of course, im no angel. i have flaws, thousands of them. im arrogant, conceited and all that, so i go ahead and call these people self-centered when they dont help me out on something even when I ask for it. but some of them do, some of them are actually quite kind and im grateful for it. but thats all it is, its kindness, no real friendship to be found there.

Alright, so to start off, I am 16 years old. I had my Year 10 exams recently, in which I failed computer sciences, barely passed in science and maths and overall did pretty average. I also failed my driver's test during this time period. 

My father has made up his mind that I am a complete failure, and has presented me with the choice of either devoting myself to my studies completely or essentially work in a railway my entire life.

I think he described it somewhat like this: 
""You're going to be absolutely useless for the rest of your life. You're going to work in a depressing job and you are going to be surrounded by other useless people like yourself. All your friends will be deadbeats, and no good girl is ever going to marry you."" You know, usual Dad stuff.

The thing is, I don't think studies are the only path for me. I think I have various other talents, mostly artistic. Talents that I can certainly improve if I worked hard on, and I am willing to work hard on them. Although I am afraid to make a leap of faith.

I am scared that, what if my talents don't help me? What if I do become a deadbeat guy? Is there any going back from this one?

We're going to call the guy I like - Noah

Damien and Noah both work with me, I know not ideal to like a co-worker, think of the place I work like McDonalds but with around 30 employees. Damien has hinted before ""why aren't you over there?"" because I'm usually helping Noah out at that particular time (this was a few months ago). Damien is a very observant, he knows when I'm stressed, he knows things he says piss me off, he's not stupid. If he accidentally bumps into me, he will glare at me and roll his eyes or say something like 'you're in the way' etc. As Damien is extremely good at reading people, he only annoys people he knows that can deal with it. Like he has an annoying nickname for me, but not other people we work with. To people, like Noah, he’s just normal, no added annoying behaviour. Noah is more serious and quiet, the responsible type.

After helping Noah for an hour, Damien came up and I couldn't ignore him (like usual), so I had to help him for an hour (at this point Noah has left). Damien asked me something along the lines of ""have any gentleman caught your eye?"" It was some weird gentlemen saying that I didn't know, we had a 10 minute talk about it, but that was basically the gist of it. In my head, I was kind of confused, so I said ""you? A gentlemen?""

""I'm talking about someone very specific."" At that moment I knew he was talking about, so I acted oblivious and confused. ""It's not me,"" he continued.

""He could work here."" I continued to act like I didn't know who he was talking about.

After he worked out I wasn't going to say anything, he said ""you're so clueless.""

I acted super nice to him after that, I normally just ignore him, but if he tells everyone-my best bet is probably to cry haha. I said ""you're the only person who (insert compliment here)"" and he replied saying, ""I thought you were going to say I was the only one who questioned you about your love life.""

Now I know for certain, he knows I like Noah. Also, there's the Christmas Party this weekend and everyone is going to be there.

I feel like Damien is the type to just want gossip and spread it (but I'm not sure), even if Noah found out I doubt he would ask me about it. Noah isn’t really a gossip person nor does he want to make things awkward, he’s the kind of person that would help you if you looked like you needed it.

I have a few questions and I wanted to know your thoughts:

* Do you think Damien will tell anyone? Who?
* Why is Damien questioning me about my ‘love life’? And how does he know?/Am I being obvious? (Is he watching my interactions with Noah? I thought I behave the same with everyone, I make jokes, laugh, playfully tease people etc. or maybe I tone it down when I’m with Noah?)
* What’s his motive? And do you think he will do anything about it at the Christmas Party?
* Why not tell me that Noah doesn’t like me? Wouldn’t that be more entertaining to him, if he just wants a reaction or is he waiting for the perfect opportunity?

What do I do? Continue to act oblivious?

Thank you so much everyone :)",27Nov2018,1

300,"Hey, so i need a little advice,  although its not a big deal. Basically, at school we have a secret Santa thing coming up this week and we buy someone a present between around 10 and 20 dollars. I happened to get a birthday present last weekend from a mate and he gave me a 20 dollar itunes card, but no one in the house has an iphone or mac (samsung is better). So I thought why don't i give it to the person i have for secret santa because he has an iphone and mac so im sure he would appreciate it (I don't ever re-gift things but i actually can't use this so why not make someone else happy). 

My problem here is that basically, that will be the best present in the class because everyone gets lollies and chocolate and funny stuff, this means it will probably get a lot of attention (ik this sounds so stupid im probably making a big deal out of nothing) but 3 of my friends in my class and me are all close with the guy that gave me the itunes card, so i dont want any of them telling the guy (because we all sit together at lunch) that gave it to me because i dont want to seem ungrateful or anything like that.

so moving back there is not really an option for me. i also don't have any friends who can let me stay with them for a little bit while i figure out my next move. i've thought about getting a job and getting the cheapest available housing i can, but i'm not sure that's very realistic. i only have a small amount of savings (few hunded bucks) but i could sell off some of my possessions if i needed to.

TL;DR - friend group consists of mainly a-holes who don’t want me there but won’t tell me, and I want to leave the group but want to maintain friendships with some of them but have no other group to go to and don’t want to feel alone during school. 

So to start this off I’m going to give some backstory to the situation I’m in and on my friend group. We’re currently freshmen in high school and are a group of 9 and me (10 total) we all kind of came together about a year ago at a movie and we were all fine up until around high school. Once we got to high school a 5 of them changed a big deal and became huge assholes (to me, each other, random people) . The other 4 were fine. Slowly they all started to change into assholes but 3 of them remained mostly good. When it was just me and those 3 we were fine and no problems arised. This leads to me being very quiet and I isolated myself from them a lot.

Fast forward to today their behavior remains the same if not slightly worse than before but I’m still chill with 3 of them and don’t really talk to the 4th who isn’t an a-hole.  We were at one of the 3’s birthday parties and were having a good time for the most part and the 3 who I’m still good friends with become a bit more jerk-like because they’re around the others but I can deal with it. They plan to have a sleepover and all can go except for me because I have testing to apply for a private school in the morning. In the morning I wake up to find no messages in our group chat which I don’t find odd cuz they’re all together but after my testing I see 3 messages. One of them sent a post to the group chat but another responded with “wrong chat. Lol” and this happens twice in that day. At this point I’ve realized they’ve made a group chat without me in it. This happened a week on the Friday before thanksgiving. 

Today I realized all but the 3-4 mentioned before don’t want me in the group, and I don’t want to be there either. I have no other friend group to go to and want to keep my friendship with the 3-4 friends. I have no clue on what to do and how to find a positive way out of this without feeling completely alone by the end of it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and would help immensely.

I should note that I am a 20 (almost 21 yr old) female. At the time I just turned 20 seven months before we started dating. He was 23.

This is going to start off as the stereotypical reason for a break off... 

Lack of communication, four-five months wasted, yadda yadda ya. Well I recently found out he got into a relationship about a month right after we broke up. He immediately started posting photos with her and was publicly lovey-dovey. When we were seeing each other, he was unsure what he wanted (after 4-5 months!) was a little mean, secretive, and I was tired of waiting for a solid answer. I broke it off. It was a hard decision because I was head over heels for him by month 3 and it seemed like in the beginning he was too. Anyway, they’ve gone on trips, she took him to a hockey game that I wanted to take him to, yet when we dated, he declined every romantic gesture and interest I’d have for the things he liked. 

I feel so lied to and sad about the whole situation. Everything he didn’t want to do with me, he has done with her. Despite us seeing each other for 4-5 months, they made it official after 2 months. It also doesn’t help he posts pictures of her all the time, and she does of him as well, whereas he never wanted to with me. It was like he was embarrassed/annoyed of us being together. 

I figured I forced it and I’ll admit to being extremely clingy and insecure. When I broke it off with him, he exclaimed through tears, “why can’t you just wait! I don’t know what I want! I want us to stay together though!” After all of that, I left, he returned a few things back to my place, then blocked and deleted me on social media. 

How, HOW do I get over him? I felt that I made the best decision but I’m starting to regret it, even though I have no reason to. He did treat me like shit (but that’s another story.) This was over a year ago and I still cringe/feel guilty for what I’ve done. I don’t want to contact him as he has a new girlfriend. I don’t know how to seek closure. 

I’m sorry that this is kind of long and sounds very naive, but other peoples advice is to “just get over it” which hasn’t helped.

306,"So a while ago my friend brought alcohol to school and thought it was funny to chug half of it himself during lunch (I did not take part cause that's so idiotic). The class after was maths and he basically passed out puked all over the class. I basically saved his life by making up stories to get him out of trouble. my ass was on the line, So I stuck by him answered all the questions the teachers asked which were directed at him which I just divert to be because he was too drunk to speak. They made him call his parents and I basically talked to his mum about what happened again making up stories.

A couple of weeks has passed. He starts making fun of me over a some incident that happened to me. He is like the catalyst of all jokes directed at me within the friend group. Why would you make fun of someone that practically saved your life. He doesn't seem grateful at all about what I did for him, the stakes were so high, he could have been expelled and it would have been on his record. Police might have even gotten invloved. Why is he being such a dick. I could have easily just ratted on him in the first place to rid myself of any trouble but no I stuck by him.

Should I sell him out? Obviously I don't want to because I have decent morals. But he's just being so irritating lately and theres practically no end to his annoyance. It's almost like he's trying to segregate me from my friend group. He has had prior events of cutting someone out of our friend group. Why do people follow what he does and tease me? I am bigger and stronger than him I could easily just fight him to assert dominance but why would I get myself in trouble if I could just sell him out for drinking in school.

308,"I'll do my best to keep this as brief and to the point as I can. Basically, I had a best friend, whom I loved with all my heart. She needed lifts to university up to 3x a week (24km per round trip). I took her even when I wasn't going in that day myself, sometimes leaving at 7am to get her to morning tests. She refused to get a driver's license herself or take Uber or the bus, but whatever, she had a lot going on. I also gave her frequent lifts to her ex's house where the majority of her belongings still were. For some reason she constantly refused to fetch all of it in one go, rather making lots of trips to pick up one or two things at a time, even just visiting, even though she was already living with her new boyfriend (let's call him X). I even gave her lifts to the pharmacy, coffee shop, and grocery store. Whatever, no judgement. She's my friend and she's a sweetheart to me, so I'll just support her, right?

She swears she'll pay me back for every bit of petrol money I spend on her. It ends up being quite a lot, duh. She pays me up to two-thirds, then accuses me of owing HER money and TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HER. Holy \*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*, you should have seen the look on my face. Apparently I had owed them money because I'd forgotten to contribute to some pizza orders or something. Well, I apologised profusely for forgetting, told them they only had to remind me and that I wasn't deliberately not paying them back, and then suggested we just call it even because now we both owe each other money.

She. Flipped. Out. Implied I was stealing from her, not disclosing all the details of our financial agreement, and selfishly taking advantage of her. Then she said she wished she'd suffered instead of asking me to ever help her, and stormed out. NONE OF IT WAS TRUE AT ALL. I sat alone in their lounge until I realised she wasn't coming back, so I drove home in the dark, sobbing all the way.

It's been a few days and I still cannot even remotely fathom how she came to any of the conclusions she did. Well, X just messaged me asking if I was still keen to babysit his cats for like a week (maybe more, not sure), starting in like 2 days, which he hasn't said anything about in like 2 weeks.

Now, I have money that should be used for school, or even housing which was going to be its original purpose. Its NOT a loan, its from a college savings account. Now, they will charge a fee if you dont provide proof that you used the money on school/school related stuff. So its not too serious...i mean im not sure what the fee amount is. 

Well, my best friend is behind on her rent...and you know where this is going.

Im about to be 24 and i still consult with my dad about finances, but i am CONFIDENT that i will be able to make enough money and restore the original amount. I know i can...just im torn because i dont know what the right thing to do is. 

Its in my own account (i say my own, because i had a connected account with my father, which was annoying because he would know what i spent money on and then confront me about it)

I dont want to ask my dad permission to use the money because his answer will be no.

If i do it behind his back, i could potentially be breaking his trust...hes the reason i was able to have this money saved.

Yet, my best friend who is the provider of her house hold, going to school, being a mom, and taking care of her own mom needs help. Shes too prideful to ask of course. 

As stated before i know i can make the money back, i just have to work really hard before tax season. 

And Im pursuing a CDL, i feel like i can do it.

318,"Hi! This is going to bed a long post, I apologise in advance. it's just that this certain person (let's call her K) has been making my life hell for the past year because of her problems. I haven't seen her in person for around 5 months now (because we moved to different cities after high school), but we still communicate in a group chat between us two and our two other friends. Now, she wants to meet up with me and our other friends during the Christmas holiday this year. My friends and I do not want to meet her, and I know that at least one person in our friend group feels *super* uncomfortable around her, so she'd rather never see her again. But we don't know how to stop our friendship with the toxic girl, and how to avoid meeting her during the holidays. We are planning on meeting up on our own (the 3 of us), without telling the other girl, but I feel like that would be a shitty thing to do. Or maybe not? I honestly don't know. I decided to provide a little bit of backstory - maybe it will illuminate the issue. You can skip that entire wall of text if you want to - it's mostly me venting my feelings and everything that has ever bothered me about that ""friend"". I would just like some advice on how to essentially cut out a friend without hurting their feelings that much, and whether it is okay for us not to invite her to a friends gathering that we're planning to do this Christmas. I would appreciate advice on this issue!

&amp;#x200B;

So throughout high school, I've been friends with the same 3 people. We did everything together and are still pretty close, even though we've started uni and moved to different places. K still lives in our home city though. K has been very very toxic to us in the past 1-2 years to the point that at least 2 of us want nothing to do with her anymore. She has been dealing with panic attacks and depression and suicidal thoughts throughout the last 3 years of high school and we had to help her out every time she felt panicky/depressed/suicidal. We tried our best to help - we really didn't mind and wholeheartedly wanted to help her. We've done so for around 2 years now. Every time she felt bad in class, we would skip class in order to sit with her and make sure that she feels better. Every time she felt suicidal or wrote stuff like ""i'm worthless and I should die"" in the group chat, we did our best to tell her that we love her and she's not worthless. We literally did everything we could. Bur problem is, she is by far not the only person who struggles a lot in our friends' group. All four of us have pretty big problems ourselves and I'm 100% sure that we all are depressed to some degree (birds of a feather flock together huh). So even though we helped her out as well as we could, we were constantly battling our own issues. And whereas that girl got everyone's attention and made all the teachers at school force us to take care of her, we received little to no help or support from her or from anyone else. Also, being around her and hearing about her depression and suicidal thoughts made us feel even worse - it's not exactly easy to remain positive when you have someone close to you who is constantly saying depressing things and tells you ""I want to kill myself"" on a daily basis, when you're already going through suicidal ideation yourself. It also doesn't help that we did a highly stressful high school program which required us to be fully focused on school work. 

I personally tolerated all of this for 2 years. I thought that I couldn't blame her because it wasn't her fault - it was her depression that created all of these problems. But now that I look back, I had a lot of problems with her as a person as well. She got butthurt very easily, and from what my friends told me (they had all their classes together with her, I had only 1 class together with her), she would completely ignore them some days because she was butthurt over something small. Worse is that she wouldn't even tell them what the reason was! it could be something as childish as ""you guys haven't mentioned me in the group chat for 2 days even though I haven't written anything for all that time"". All that felt very... attention seeking to me? Like she always wanted everyone to think about her and care about her. But if one of us didn't write stuff for a couple of days because we were going through a tough time, she would n e v e r ask us what was wrong. Also, as I said, she also used to write a lot of messages like ""I am worthless and you guys probably don't like me"" in the group chat a lot, making us reply with things like ""oh no, of course we love you!:)"". That happened quite regularly. At first, I felt really sad for her because ""it must be her insecurity... Poor girl"". But honestly? I am struggling a lot with feeling insecure all the time and wondering if perhaps everyone around me hates me, but I don't write shit like that to my friends and guilt them into telling me that they love me. At some point, I started to tell her that we love her without meaning it. Just to make her calm down. What she did just felt very attention seeking to be honest. And the funny thing is, she would constantly write things in the group chat like ""oh I'm going to the cinema with my **friend** tomorrow"", ""oh i'm hanging out with my **friends** right now and we're having so much fun doing x"", ""hey guys I'm at the store with my **friend** right now and look at what we found"". Like - in so many messages, she mentioned the word ""friend"" without really having to. I felt like she was just trying to emphasise that she has other friends than us, and I believe she wanted us to feel jealous for her or something. And funnily enough, she never made her ""other friends"" deal with her problems. She never made them skip class in order to calm her down (they went to a different school and never saw her at her worst). She never made them discourage her from committing suicide. She never guilt tripped them into telling her that they loved her. But my friends and I had to do all that + we were indirectly hinted by her that she has better friends than us and she has much more fun with them : / Like damn, I have plenty of friends myself, but I don't go to the group chat and post shit like ""ohhhh look at how much fun me and my *friends* are having! :)))"". That's just shitty, I think

ANYWAYS. I tolerated all of her bullshit for a pretty long time. But the last straw was the summer of 2017. Me and my friends planned to meet up in a cafe before the summer vacation started. 1 hour before we were supposed to meet up, K wrote in the group chat ""Also i dont think im joinin yall today so have fun"" (that's the exact message, actually). Didn't give any reason and made us ask her ""why"" like 2 times before she finally replied ""sleep"" (also, I noticed later that this is a part of her personality - write something vague and alarming, and then make us, her friends fish for more information and ask her about what's going on. She will never directly tell us things. ALWAYS makes us ask for it and give her attention). Anyways, after that she stopped replying and basically went to sleep I suppose.  I wouldn't mind this kind of stuff that much, if not for the fact that we almost *never* met up outside of school because we were all so busy, and because it was a tradition for us to hang out on the last day of school before the summer vacation started. And she just ditched us - without even saying sorry! But I'm a pretty chill and understanding person usually, so I let that go and thought that maybe she just needed some time for herself and stuff. Well, my friends and I had a very nice time that day, and actually, I enjoyed the fact that K wasn't there. I realized that day that K and I didn't share any common interests anymore, and the only reason to why I still considered her ""my friend"" was because we've simply known each other for a long time and because I was too afraid of leaving her alone (I feared that if I stopped being friends with her, she would become even more depressed). Anyways, after that cafe visit, days passed and she didn't communicate with us at all. We planned another meetup at my house in July. I asked K if she wanted to come. After not talking to us for like 3 weeks she replied ""nah, just do it without me"". I tried insist that she join us, find another time that would fit her schedule more, but she just kept saying ""just ignore me and do it one the day you guys planned"". Then she stopped talking to us again. My friends and I met up and had a super nice time again"" Actually, we also talked about her and how her negativity and behaviour was destroying the friendship, and that we didn't really want to hang out with her anymore. But we decided to stick with her at least until the end of high school, in order to not make things awkward at school and to ensure that she won't sit alone while at school (she didn't really have any other friends than us there). After that meet-up, a couple more days passed. Still our friend didn't talk to us. We didn't try to talk to her either, but I feel like you can't blame us for not talking to her! I mean, we always had conversations going in the group chat that she could have easily joined if she wanted to. Why should we always take the initiative and talk to her, if she was clearly ignoring us? 

Well, after some more days I got enough and finally messaged her asking what was going on. The first thing she writes ""oh now you care?"" and after I apologised (for no reason really, I'm just the type of person that apologises for everything. Now I regret that I blamed myself, and didn't call her out instead) and asked again what was going on, she replied with ""it took you like 4 weeks to write a message to me?"". She explained that the reason for all of this behaviour was her feeling very depressed. And the fact that we didn't explicitly mention her or try to talk to her in the group chat for the first 1-2 weeks made her super pissed and she decided to ignore us completely. She blamed us for not trying to ask her how she's doing and not being interested in her, despite her apparently counting down days and planning her suicide, and she said that she thought that we didn't care about her anymore. She even told me that this is apparently how all of her friendships ended before - she got butthurt that the other person stopped writing messages to her, so she never initiated conversations again and basically stopped talking to them forever. She said she was afraid that the same thing would happen with our friendship. Well fuck me, am I not right in saying that friendship is a 2-way thing? Like, if you want to remain friends with someone - you have to take the goddamn initiative! Sometimes, people stop messaging each other because they forget or might be too busy. If you never reach out to them again because you're ""butthurt"" and you want to maintain some kind of pride or something, and start to ignore them and eventually never talk to them again, then it's your problem! If you constantly have to initiate conversations with that friend and they never try to keep them going then yes, that's a problem and you should probably let things go and don't try anymore. But it doesn't hurt to initiate the conversation once! I have many friends who I don't talk to regularly, but usually, after I initiate a conversation after not talking for a while, most of them start to write messages to me again on their own, and our friendship keeps living on. 

Anyways, her ""excuse"" really pissed me off for some reason. Basically, after all of this, I completely lost respect for her. I felt like these messages, especially the tone of the messages where she wrote ""oh now you care"" and ""it took you 4 weeks?"", showed her true - spiteful and salty and prideful - nature, and from then on I couldn't look at her the same way I did before. It's like from then on, I got this special ability to see through all her shit. I simply couldn't make myself talk to her anymore. Avoided her at all costs at school, tried to not be left alone with her anymore because I honestly had 0 want to talk to her. Whenever she directly talked to me I would reply out of politeness, but it was never the same ""sincere"" friend talk again. I felt like she became a stranger to me, and I still feel the same way, 1 year later. It's not like I hate her or anything anymore, but I just see no reason to be friends with her. We have nothing in common and everything she does irks me. In the group chat, nothing she writes is interesting and nothing is worth replying to. She eventually just makes the conversation about herself, contributes nothing to the conversation by just writing stuff like ""wow, ""oof"", ""rip"", and ""dfghjkl"", or just posts really bad memes that nobody in the group finds funny (this just shows how removed she is from our interests and humour and this point). If I could, I would never interact with her or reply to her at all. I just do it out of politeness at this point. Another friend of mine stopped talking to her almost completely. I think she wrote something directly aimed at K like *once* after high school ended. Other than that, she never even talks in the group chat anymore because she dislikes K so much (this is the friend who probably suffers the most from mental illness and depression and trauma out of our group, but she had to push all of her problems away in order to help K with her problems. Even though she needed much more help and support than K. Even though she felt suicidal and struggled a lot because of abuse and trauma, she never made everyone else feel down by writing stuff like ""I want to kill myself"" and ""im so worthless"" and seeked attention. Some times she did ask for help, but she also always helped us if we were in a tough place and needed help. This is unlike K, who, even if she ""helped"", would eventually make it about herself). Welp. This is just scratching the surface, and I could go on for hours about all the shit that K has done over these 3 years, but then this post would turn into a 20 page essay. So I think I will stop here. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The TL;DR** is that K has been going through a lot of shit, depression, and other stuff throughout her high school years and we, her friends, always tried our best to support her. But her problems started to make us feel rather shitty and depressed ourselves, and she behaved herself in a way that was very selfish (in my opinion, at least). Her behaviour and the constant negativity that was radiating from her, made us dislike her, and now we want to cut her out of our lives. But she still thinks of us as friends and it's making it very hard for us, because we don't want to hurt her feelings. We want to spend this Christmas vacation without meeting her, and just hang out, the 3 of us without inviting her. But I'm torn about it - all my life I've tried to make the people around me feel good and happy and included, and I feel like a bitch for wanting to exclude her, even though my friends feel the same way. Do you thinking that cutting her our is the best decision? And how should we make it known to her that we don't want to meet up with her? Should we just lie and say that we don't have time? Or should we tell the truth? I would really really appreciate advice!",27Nov2018,1

324,"Hey, i'd appriciate any advice or comment on this topic, i really have noone elee to talk to about this

So, me and lets call him A were best friends since we were 4 (we are both 21 now). But 6 months ago he just randomly stopped taking my calls and always declined my invites.I tought he was just busy but after a week we went out with some mutual friends and i asked him if something was wrong, he responded with saying im an asshole.
So we just stopped hanging out/talking, but a few oppurtunities since we still have the same friends but we never talked directly to eachother.

Fast forward 4 months; i find out at his girlfriends (with who i am still on good terms) birthday party that he wont hang out with me because i was friends with B. And A and B do not like eachother (something about B not liking  A's girlfriend maybe even saying some bad things about her since she is best friends with B's ex). Well i didnt wanna take sides and wanted to stay friends with both which was okay with B but not with A apparently.

Well now B has been a good friend but I havent really hanged out with A for 6 months but he was my best friend and i tortured myself for 4 months  thinking about what i've done that he doesnt want to be friends with me anymore but after finding out ""the reason"" im just mad at him since i dont think its a valid reason to lose your bestfriend over, specialy without telling me why.

But after all this time it still frustrates me, I feel like i am losing my friend circle of before and have no bestfriend. I do not want to be friends with him anymore after what he has done or am I in the false? I dont want to talk to him after all this but should I? Its really bothering me, should it?
Got any advice for me on what to do?
My stand is; i will not talk to him and be his friend unless his apology is really good.

Also; A has done the same thing to a good friend of ours before for no apparent reason at all once, but they are good friends now again

325,"Hey,

So here's the predicament which brings me to this sub: I'm a self-taught freelance UX/UI designer by profession who is an artschool dropout. Just five minutes ago though, I had like a mini identity crisis in which I realized that my ultimate love in life is science; as in, if I could wake up each day and have my working hours be filled with doing things related to the field of science, I'd be one very happy chap. Happier than I am right now when I wake up and have to do design.

I'm that classic case of someone who just wasn't cut out for formal education, and so I am pretty meh-looking on paper in terms of my highschool grades (Bs and Cs) and SAT score (1600ish).

I love the idea of studying/exploring the Universe so much that I'm honestly willing to do kind of anything to be able to have at it in whatever way I can. Even if it is just to be a writer for a science magazine (I write not too shabbily it turns out... have around half a million views on my Quora profile with \~500 followers just by writing whacky shit about existential/spiritual/philosophical topics).

\---------

Since financial independence is the underlying motivator behind any of this, the reason I'm thinking the way that I am is because I feel like since I have a natural passion for science, then it would be wise to connect my passion with something monetary, thus ensuring that the ""money-engine"" becomes self-propelling and so I never have to worry about it ever again. And at the same time I get to feel like I'm leading a meaningful life because I'd be doing work I consider meaningful.

I'm trying to resolve the following, in order of priority:

1) Financial dependence on family

2) Not enjoying what I'm doing

\---------

Miscellaneous Info:

As a human I am totally okay not making excess money, and just enough to sustain a basic living as long as the work I'm doing per 24 hours of my life is something I consider meaningful.

I'm currently at home in India, but I'd prefer to relocate to The Bay Area (I have US citizenship).

As extreme as the idea is, I'm the kind of person who sees nothing ""wrong"" with redoing highschool in order to achieve my goals for example. Though I feel like the time that would take would be too long. Time is definitely a factor for me. I think I could give three years at max in pure preparation for Day 1 of living the life I want to.

My family is quite awesome and well to do, and would not mind paying for some degree or something as long as I could show them how it matters to my future.

As for what I mean by being involved with science? Well... I just want to either use my brain to do the figuring-things-out part or the spreading-the-awesomeness of science to people part. Like heck, I'd love to be the host to a planetarium or something.

\---------

This is all I have for now. I'd absolutely LOVE some help, any help. Even just letting me know of a better/more relevant place to share this query of mine would be swell too.

Thanks &lt;3",27Nov2018,1
326,"There was this girl(17f) in my (17f) past, who I was really close friends with in maybe seventh grade. We were really tight until she moved to a different school district, and we ended up losing our connection over time. This was honestly probably for the best though, because she was an extremely bad influence on me in middle school. I ended up cutting myself very often, drinking in school, and doing a variety of other things I would never have done otherwise. I haven’t talked to her since the eighth grade..

So last night I was a little high and obviously wasn’t thinking straight, as I asked her if she wanted to be friends again, and maybe hang out sometime. I talked to her and found out that she’s been in and out of youth centers and juvenile detentions for truancy and drugs. I woke up today and realized that I do not want a connection with her, as my own mental state is bad enough right now. We already made plans to go to the mall together, since I felt bad about her boyfriend leaving her. I really do not want a relationship with her, NOT because of her past, but because she will end up dragging me down again and I’m really not mentally ready to take on her problems, as well as my own. I just can’t. Maybe that sounds mean but it’s the truth and I know deep down that I only want to use her for her weed, which is fucked up now that I think about it this morning. Any advice would be much appreciated..",27Nov2018,1
327,"Hey,

so me and a friend of mine moved together in our first own flat (21yrs) in a big city quite far away from home. he was always kinda hard to handle, but i endured him in our childhood because i really hate having discussions or generally being mad at each other. now after three and a half months i noticed that the big city was changing me and i learned to focus more about myself and have a healthy amount of egoism inside me. he didnt do shit in the apartment and i got more angry over the last weeks, but never told him because i thought after some time it would change. yesterday i woke up and was just plain angry at him. in the last years he did many things i should not have forgiven him for and after finding my kind of people in the new town i started to notice that he was just simply a dickhead. i knew that if i would confront him he would blow up, but i suddenly had the urge to be mad about him and we had a big discussion, that ended with him not understanding that i ""suddenly"" didnt want to live with him anymore, but did what i already thought he would be doing: he started harrassing and accusing me. im not very good at this discussion stuff so i dont really know what to do now, the only thing i know is that i wanna move out. 

any tips?

328,"So about a month ago my anxiety was pretty bad constantly but I never had an attack. One day I was smoking weed with my friends and we went to play pool. 

Every time I bent over and stood back up after shooting the ball, I would feel pretty light headed and a little dizzy. Then after a few times of doing that, I felt like I was about to have an anxiety attack. 

I felt really light headed, my heart started beating really hard, I started to sweat and it felt like I had to put way more effort in to breath. As this was happening, the lights in the room seemed brighter and my vision was kind of blurred, then my vision became completely impaired and all I could see is what I can best describe as black and dark blue “static”, or like a bunch of dark blobs in my vision. It was like I was blacking out but not losing conciseness. 

I literally couldn’t see anything, at this time I sat down and put my head in my arms and breathed deeply. Over a few minutes I was going from almost not being able to see anything, to seeing super blurring and everything seeming bright. 

I decided to try and walk and go outside and it became better quickly as I walked and got cool air. After it was over, I had a really bad headache in the back of my head, and my neck felt stiff and I still had a cold sweat for awhile and I think I remember feeling kind of sore in general. 

Did I have a panic attack? 

This happened to me one more time a few days after (but not nearly as bad), again while smoking weed. I got up and went into the bathroom and it started to happen when I turned on the bright bathroom light. Also the pool room where we were at when the first one happened had really bright lights in the room. Perhaps I have epilepsy of sorts? I have no idea what to think of this.

332,"I'm the middle child of my family. My elder sister is 17 now, 2 years older than me, and I read her diary 4 days ago.
My elder sis is usually looks tired, angry and lifeless, and she's the second meanest person I've ever met. She talks with sarcasm a lot, she rolls her eyes too often, she always lazes around, she complains too much and she hates almost everything.
My dad of course cannot stand her. He is a good father, or at least to me. He is short-tempered and tends to hit objects when he can't control his angers, but it rarely happens to me.
When I was younger, I really wanted to befriend with my sis but sis shut me down like thousands of times. My parents explained that because she was mean and ugly and jealous of me so that I didn't have to worry about her.
Sometimes I saw my mom crying alone in the room at night. She told me that she was sad because of a film or book, and I should go to sleep.
My sis always grimaced when dad mentioned money. She often disrespected him. Once, after a fight and dad slapped her, she talked about whether people should respect others just because they are older or not in one of her projects at school. When my dad heard it, he immediately knew who she directed to. And it led to a bigger fight.
In the past, I always took my dad's side, but now I'm not so sure after accidentally reading my sis's secret diary. According to it:
- My dad rarely hits me because if he's furious, he'll hurt mom and sis verbally or physically.
- My sis didn't want to be close to me because I take after my dad, and she can't stand him, so she dislikes me as well.
- Mom was crying because of the mean words my dad said about my grandparents, since she wasn't from the big city like dad. She was crying because dad hit her in the public when she refused to give him the money to spend on stock. She was right, he lost all of it and suddenly our family had a huge amount of debts. My sis knows this, because she SAW it, when she was like 8.
- When sis was 3, dad beat her because of a sticker.
- When she was 4, she screamed so loud that she lost her voice in a week because she saw my dad, who was drunk, tried to strangle mom from the beginning.
- When she was 9, dad almost killed sis after smashing her head in the walls, when I and mom went to her hometown.
- When he knew a child in sis's school was bullied by her family, he supported it and blamed the child.
- He mocked at a suicided student, called her crazy because of her depression.
I didn't dare to continue reading. The monster in her diary is nothing like my dad. Everything starts to make more sense, sis's hatred towards dad, mom's silent tears, but apart from the diary, there isn't any evidence else. 
I haven't talked to anyone about this yet, I don't know what to do. My sis hasn't known this yet. I'm scared of knowing the truth, but I don't think I can live a life like this. I can never see people the same anymore. I'm too overwhelmed to think properly now.
What should I do now??? Confront my dad or sis? Or mom???? Write a letter or something????

333,"Sorry if this becomes an essay, but I feel it to be easiest to explain the situation if i just tell a whole story. So it began 4 years ago in high school when I started hanging out with a new group of friends in the marching band, most were 1 year older than me. There was a very attractive girl in the group, I'll call her ""Kay"". So Kay always acted sort of flirty towards me, she laughed a lot and complimented me, we would always do a lot of long hugs, and we usually hang out close together in the group. I wanted pursue something, but she actually had a boyfriend at the time who lived hours away, so being the beta I was I never did anything. So during this time I stopped hanging out with my OG friend group as much and they had no idea where I was. It was sort of a meme trying to guess what I was up to, because they had no idea. One day, being the stupid, 16 year old, hadn't kissed a girl virgin I was, I wanted to see how much I could make my OG friend group believe. I told them that me and Kay had been hooking up. Somehow everyone believed me without question. Kay graduated later that year and we didn't really talk for awhiile. My best friends are from my OG friend group, and they still believe the story even though we barely talk about it. I have never told my friends the truth yet because I have been scared for them to think of me any different. I never usually lie, I was just 16 and horny and wanted to see what I could get away with. I am in college now, and I recently visited the college the Kay goes to. For some reason I am still very enamored with this girl. I can't stop thinking about her. I want to start something with her or message her, but I don't know if she likes me. I don't know if she ever liked me or if I was just like a side-boy in high school, or if I shouldn't even try to pursue her because she was weird with me when she had a boyfriend. I don't know what trouble it would cause if i started dating Kay or how my friends would think of me after keeping up a lie (a crazy one for me) for 4 years.

334,"Hi all,

I am currently living down in England with my fiance from Glasgow who used to briefly model until quitting to becone a dog handler instead on ferries here.  She has toned things down a bit which I have thanked her for and it’s not an issue but when we go to nights out or galas for her friends I sometimes get a bit anxious with her choice of attire.  My fiance is fairly slim but has a 40K chest without any surgery having been done so unless she explicitly hides them it can be a bit much sometimes.

Part of me doesn’t mind and is proud but when some guys recognize her from the Daily Record article she was in or her brief modeling stint back home in Glasgow it can feel awkward.  She can be very bubbly and come across as flirty with the gift of the gab which sometimes adds to things.

347," I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. So 2/5 of my classes this semester are giving me anxiety, and I can't figure out how to tackle them. I have a B in class A (they're both govt classes, so I'm just going to call them B and A), and an A in class B. I want to get As in both classes in the end.

In class A I got a C on the midterm, which brought my grade down from an A to a B. Now the last thing I can do is to get nearly a perfect score on the final, but I don't even know how possible that is for me. I thought I studied and knew what I was doing on the midterm, but I ended up doing badly on that. I don't know what to do differently. It feels hopeless. I really want to go see my teacher during office hours to see if he would give me extra credit or some chance to do better in the class, but I think that's a long shot and I don't know how to approach him with that.

In class B, so far I'm doing well but I've slacked off a TON on the reading (the class is based a bunch on old govt books, Plato, Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, etc.), and this is totally my fault. This past week I've been catching up with audiobooks while working on things that don't take a lot of brainpower, but its going kind of slow.

This last part might be confusing, so bear with me. We have this group project (in class B) that is like almost half of our grade, and I particularly wanted to do it on one of the books at the end of the course - not necessarily because I wanted to put it off. The prof forms the groups before each reading, and apparently this wasn't the best method because he underestimated how many kids were actually putting off the project until the last few books of the course. He seemed really annoyed by this, and started to put us into groups for the last few books, and put me in the group doing the last book for the semester (the one I wanted). He started to get really disappointed, asking us why we put off the project until the last moment. I felt bad because immediately I was labeled as irresponsible - usually I'm a good student and I wish I could've shown the prof that somehow, especially considering this project is nearly half of our grade. He was worried because we had too many kids for a book that is apparently a short read, so each kid would have shorter presentations than the rest of the class. He told us all this and warned us that we better do really well on this in order to get an A, but the thing is I don't know HOW we could do better than what all the other presenters did. I mean... its a presentation? There's not really much more we can do except make the powerpoint look prettier or something lmao, but in all seriousness, I really want to show him effort and earn an A. I just don't get how.

Oh and to top it all off, the final is a written exam, which is always a coin toss for me as to whether I'll get an A, or something like a C.

So yeah, I'm scared. And stressed out. I really want to get straight As this year, especially since I'm considering transferring out of my school, but also just because I'm usually an A student and I'll feel terrible if I don't do well. Sorry if that was a long read/confusing, feel free to ask questions if it'll help.

349,"Good evening or good morning to you all,

Let's jump right in shall we. So I'm a 27-year-old chemistry student right now attending the University of Strasbourg here in France. Basically what is going on is that I'm literally failing every class. Really. I'm bombing big time. I spent the first two months of this semester with a massive amount of anxiety which prevented me from getting it together and studying right from the get-go. By the way, this is only the first year of my chemistry degree. I tried getting into medical school here and France and I failed at doing so miserably. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should save face and stop now and then maybe, a very big maybe, come back in September and try again, or if I should just bite the bullet and stagger through the rest of this first semester and try and pull it together for the second semester. Regardless, I'll have to retake this semester over anyways. But to succeed in the second semester, well, you need to have the basics down from the first. I'm thinking about dropping out and going back to my old shitty job which paid actually decently and, I don't know, seeing a fucking therapist as well. Failure has quite the bitter taste, and I've bitten off more than I can chew.

350,"I'm a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me horribly. All this in a bad way? When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘how did you apply for there then?’ And sometimes we look sup at my hair when Iv got either messy or styled in a wtf type look which hurts my confidence.

Edit: she started saying the ‘awww’ from when I’d get up to leave at the end of every appointment since the time I failed an interview a few months ago for not having enough confidence but I usually would say ‘oh ok thank you’ when I’d get up to leave at the end when she said awww so it could be that idk",27Nov2018,1
351,"Hi,

Was really hoping for some help (I'm not really sure how to structure this, it's kinda like an internal monologue and might be pretty long. Sorry about that). Basically, I'm in college living with a couple of roommates, one of whom is a 'close friend' (let's call him 'A'), but not necessarily one that I'm fond of. Both of us are guys, and the other roommate is irrelevant.

Context: In this town, I have friends in college (we take the same classes, so same friends) and friends who I met elsewhere - these are the ones I'm technically closer to - the 'Social group'. A is friends with me through another college friend. I'm going to change a couple of scenarios here to ones that I think are equivalent and still make my point, so don't bash me if you don't think it's a big deal. My belief is that we are friends mainly due to geographical proximity. It's a little difficult to explain, it's mainly minor issues that make me feel like the friendship is kinda toxic. Bear with me.

On games night, where we order pizza and have friends from our Social group over, I get my PS4 out. (Let's say) A goes to his room and and gets his controllers, but that's about it, he doesn't bother to pair them to my PS4 or anything. He just sits there and eats pizza. I've mentioned it a couple times in front of the group that I'd appreciate some help, and it's always someone else helping me out (incl. sometimes before I mention it) to connect the PS4, turn it on, change the channel etc. A is always just sitting there. He's also false accused me of going against 'housing etiquette' for a minor issue, although he himself does stuff much worse (specifically at least a few times, stinking up the restroom and not allowing for ventilation (e.g. closing the door instead of leaving it open, like it normally is)). And, he believes he's entitled (I can't elaborate more on this without being too specific). A also used to borrow my reusable travel mug and just not clean the cap.

When I make plans with a few of my friends from the Social group, I invite him out as well because it'd be weird not to. He's part of that group as well now, and we live together. He makes plans to study in the library with some of our friends from college - who he's a little closer to. That's his every right. But I don't understand why he can not invite me to the college group plans, but I can't not invite him to our social group plans. It's not that he doesn't remember to, we live together, we even see and speak to each other before, but that's that.

I've had a couple of problems with A in the past. I feel like I'm often left out intentionally when with college friends (e.g. when walking or sitting in the library... when I'm invited), normally by A. It's not the others, I get along just fine with (all but one of) them. I've felt like this in the past, and I try my best to be inclusive, and sometimes another friend will notice and e.g. tell A to make space for me too. Also, A asked whether I wanted to split a buy 1 get 1 free offer, for something we both needed and I agreed. But before that, (without saying anything) he went and bought something similar to use instead, for himself. It's not a big deal though, but you get the idea. Fuck me and the deal right?

I want to know if I can stop inviting him to the social group stuff and how I can go about doing it. It's easy to say 'cut the toxic people out of your life', but what about when they're part of a social group. I have friends with multiple social groups and I think I'd prefer that. I always end up bringing new friends into the same social group, where A has been for a long time.",27Nov2018,1
352,"Hey guys!


I know this probably has been asked or a lot of threads has been made because of this. But I need all of your supports and advices.

Here's my situation. The thing about my mind is that it get depressed or stressed out over a small things. I'm a [25M] and I'm a type of person when I decide to do something or to work on something e.g. My assignments or work related, even workout, I'll be so determined to finished it. But when I know that I tried my best and I couldn't complete what I started, I get very depressed and I keep being negatives on myself.

There was one time that I couldn't make a decision on something regarding current event that could shape my future and I get depressed for a whole week. I didn't go out or talk to anyone. I even think about suicide all the time.

I don't have a lot of friends and most of my friends are far away from where I live. Whenever I try to talk to them, they always compare my life with theirs or someone they knew. I ended up being the one who listened rather than spit out what's in my mind. I don't blame them though.

Also, I feels like every decision I made is against me. I feels like everyone put all the blame on me if something wrong happen. Probably because every time I go out of my house, I put a  smile and wave everyone and they think I'm easy to be targeted.

I noticed that my depression is getting worst day by day. Sure I tried tricking my mind to think something else or make myself busy doing other things just to distract myself. It works for that moment only. I don't know if you can get rid of depression permanently, I don't think that's possible because everyone has it and it's just different style of how they adapt and handle to different kind of situations.

I tried travelling but it just escaping the reality. It doesn't feel genuine. It feels like I'm lying to myself. Sure it was fun for a while. I've never met psychologist. 

Have any of you felt like what I feel? And how do you handle it? How do you live with it? How do I train myself to control that thoughts?

I'm sorry if this has been ask plenty of times. I pray all of you guys to have great days ahead and amazing life. ",27Nov2018,1

369,"TL;DR: met a guy with a girlfriend. Shared a wonderful night with him followed by amazing sex. He said he’d leave his partner for me. I freaked out and ended things. Would it be wrong if me to ask him? Would it be even more wrong of me if I stayed with him if he did?

I met someone through mutual friends, knew he had a girlfriend. He peruses me all night at the club, then at kick ons. He tried kissing me several times and each time I denied. When there was few of us awake me and him went riding on scooters, falling off, laughing. Running around the streets, acting as if we were the only two people in the world. We then walked along the river as the sun rose, talked about his relationship, his time spent away, and how he felt he couldn’t leave his partner after standing by him. We finally went home and that’s when I gave in.  By this point there was an emotional connection I had never felt before, he felt it too. There is no excuse for what happened next, regardless if his relationship was on the rocks. We spent hours having passionate, heated sex, a romantic shower where we fucked some more. We would reach points where the guilt would overcome us and we said it had to stop, but then five minutes later it would happen again. I asked him what now? He said if I wanted him to, he would leave his girlfriend, we just held each other. I couldn’t bring myself to ask that of him and the guilt of hurting this girl even more almost paralysed me. By the time everyone woke up we had stayed up until 2pm. That’s when I couldn’t be around him and left to my bedroom. He came in and hugged me, and told me the decision was mine. I told him to leave. He messaged me later on and I ended things even though I desperately didn’t want to. He lives with her, she stayed with him through a hard time, she doesn’t deserve any of it.

But part of me wants to ask him to leave. How wrong is it to ask someone to leave their partner? How wrong would it be of me to stay with him if he does?

374,"i started off as a great student. in elementary school i was involved in sports, band, etc. and always got straight As in every subject. in 6th grade i was the same. in 7th grade, shortly after i turned 13, my dad was arrested. he was able to live with us until December. as soon as he left for prison, i lost all motivation to try at anything. i still managed to get Cs in every class, but i no longer played sports or was in band. i still felt happy (for the most part) but i just couldn't motivate myself to try in school. every time i would sit down to work on homework, i would end up getting distracted and watching YouTube until 2 am. this continued throughout middle school and freshman year of high school. in freshman year, i became depressed for about 4 months and had Fs in most subjects. luckily, i was able to pull through and pass every class. 

sophomore year came around, and i was doing well in the beginning, but i quickly started not to. i was happy again, but my motivation was still nowhere to be found. i ended up failing both semesters of English and one semester of chemistry. i had taken algebra in 8th grade, so by the end of 10th i was half a credit behind where i needed to be. i didn't take summer school because thought i would have time to make it up.

now im in junior year, and my dad will be home and living with us again within a month. i can't put into words how excited i am and how much i miss him, but im still doing terribly. im failing half my classes, which means ill be 2 credits behind if i can't get them up within the next 3 weeks.

I’ll be making mistakes :( 

My quest begun last week, when a friend of mine sent me a video. It was a recording from a livestream of a horse riding championship, where a guy punished his horse in front of all the cameras and the spectators. The horse was horrified and in pain. This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated, even more when you’re telling your fans that you “love” your horses. 
It’s not even the first time that something like that happens.

So I’ve sent this video to 2 popular Instagram pages, that in the past have been threatened by this same rider and his brainwashed fans... and the video got viral. Many other people started questioning his “horsemanship” and some of his fans even unfollowed him.

The day after, on Sunday, he failed another time (the horse refused to jump) and he kicked the animal very hard with spurs... again abuse. 
He didn’t say anything, until Sunday, when he placed on second place in another competition. 
This time he flooded his Instagram profile with videos and photos and at the same time he deleted all the comments of the people who asked him to show the first video. 

Btw one of the insta pages that “blew the whistle” was contacted buy his alleged “lawyer” and this person claimed to own the viral video and that if he/she will not delete it, the lawyer will file a report... of course this is bullsh*t, they just tried to intimidate all of us. 

Yesterday he continued bragging about his “victory” and deleting all the “nasty” comments. 
Even a horse related blog published an article about all the hate that this poor rider is receiving, calling all of us “cowards” and “bullies”. Again they tried to intimidate us. 

I cannot let it go, really I CANNOT. It’s useless reporting him to FEI etc, but he must face justice in anyway and stop lying to his gullible fans. But it’s so hard doing anything when you’re constantly shut and threatened. 
Those horses deserve a better life. 

Any advice? :(

And on days i dont have class i only eat 2 and usually don’t eat until im full because being full usually makes me feel uncomfortable and for when i have my normal athletics where there is no case where i want to be training or playing on a full stomach, that completely write off having 4 full meals a day.

Do i really need to eat that much just to gain arm mass? Naturally i have that soccer player build with strong legs and thin arms.",27Nov2018,1
382,"I'm madly inlove with a person who I can't have due to IRL stuff.   
I'm trying to avoid him, but we have mutual friends, so everything we do involves one another. I love my friends and I won't leave them, neither will he.

I don't know what to do. I've talked to him about this and he's been incredibly understanding, but says there's no hope for 'us' in the future. 

It's been a few weeks like that now and I haven't been able to get him out of my mind. I've been avoiding sleep as well, cause I dream vividly and he's always there. I know he'll be gone when I wake up, but I can't force myself to wake up so it only hurts more. 

I've been listening to sad songs in hope to let it all out and move on, but I simply can't. 

I'm incredibly close to him, he knows all about me and I know all about him too. It honestly hurts physically. There's pain in my stomach when I think about and talk to him, I get dizzy, I get a headache and even throw up out of saddness/stress. It's been affecting my life badly, I can't concentrate.

He's such a big part of my life and I can't simply forget him. He's helped me with my mental health issues, made sure I'm always okay, took care of me in general.

384,"Okay - sorry in advance for a longer post.

&amp;#x200B;

I dropped my dog off at doggie daycare yesterday at 7:30am.  Sometime between then and 8am they lost her.  She somehow got free with her collar and leash still on.  She was missing all day.  I went to pick her up after work at 5:30 and that is when they told me she was missing.  Essentially all day, during daylight, they knew she was missing and did not tell me because they ""thought they could get her back in time.""  Needless to say I was/am irate.  They increased the risk of injury/harm to my dog all to cover their own asses.

&amp;#x200B;

What ensued was a massive dog hunt hindered by night time.  I had friends, my dog walker and family all out looking for her as well as pictures and posts shared to every social media outlet possible.  By the grace of God my dog ended up about 2 miles away at one of my friend's houses.  She has never met this friend or been to their house so it was truly a lucky event for her to end up there, him to see the facebook post and contact me in time to come get her.  She is not injured or hurt but was very cold, thirsty and hungry.  The search took almost 5 hours and about 2.5 hours into it the daycare owner stopped answering my calls.  They were supposedly out looking for her as well but I am not sure how hard they were trying.

&amp;#x200B;

To top things off, the guy called me this morning to apologize and called my dog by the wrong name.  

&amp;#x200B;

So basically - here is the advice that I need - what should I do?  I am an attorney so it's very easy for me to sue him although I have little to no actual damages.  Naming and shaming them on social media and review sites is another option but I generally do not like the idea of costing people their livelihood.  Dropping it is another option.  Frankly - I do not know what to do and I do not want to overreact out of anger.  Any advice is appreciated.",27Nov2018,1

387,"It was during September 2017, i was in year 11 and I had just got my license so i started taking my friend and his girlfriend to school and her friend (Kirsten) who asked if i could take her to and from school too, so i said okay and for the next year and a half i took them to school every day.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew that Kirsten was going through a rough time at home but i never really paid attention to any of it. We never really hit things off at this stage but the school ball was coming up and i was gonna ask her to be my date but i never did because i guess i was too afraid she would say no and id make a fool of myself, but the night of the ball came along and it turned out we were going to the same pre ball. A When i saw her arrive my heart raced because she looked absolutely stunning, and that whole night at the ball i made it my goal to get to know her more and try to get her interested. The ball ended and she invited me to the after ball she was going to and of course i said yes. I arrived late to it and it was my first time getting drunk, but i got the confidence to put my arm around her and even try on her ear rings (yes i have my ears pierced). night turned into day and we ended up sitting on a swinging chair where she leant on me and eventually fell asleep

&amp;#x200B;

Two months of talking passed and i eventually asked her out and she said yes, she was my first serious relationship, i knew something was wrong though, something externally on the relationship, she told me that her and her mum are moving out of her dads house to live by themselves, they left the home while he was at work so he never knew they had left until he got home later that night. i never asked why, i always told her that its her decision if she wanted to tell me.

&amp;#x200B;

One night Kirsten, her mum and I all went to an engagement party together for a family friend, i was driving and her mum got drunk and started having a yell at kirsten for being so disrespectful because she asked her to leave the room we were in because i had a headache. Kirsten and I head back to her house without the mum because i had enough of her crap,  I sat in her bed with her while she cried and began to tell me why they moved out. They moved out because the dads a drunk who on occasion had hit the mum and kirsten had seen and this happened for 6+ years, the mum also would get drunk sometimes and smack kirsten and this only happened twice, she was 15 when it happened but she would constantly get dreams about it and have anxiety attacks at random times of the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

There were a few times where she had planned to take her own life and i talked her out of it but she didnt want me calling anybody to help and a few times where i would stay up all night with her to stop her from cutting herself

&amp;#x200B;

After a few months of trying to get help for her but her refusing because she felt embarrassed i got into a small argument with my own mum, words were thrown and Kirsten said something a bit too far and my mum and dad hated her after that point and so did my 2 older sisters,  I knew the relationship was coming to a close so i made one final attempt for her to get help and she finally did, shes on anti depressants and seeing a phycologist about it all now, she ended up being diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety and PTSD. Her mum doesnt remember her hitting kirsten but she now goes to her for support instead of me as ive cut ties with her because previously i was her person to vent to but i didnt know how to deal with it and it built up inside me and ive had multiple anxiety attack at school because i was thinking too much about it all. I knew that the relationship wasnt healthy at that point

&amp;#x200B;

I realised I had to end the relationship for multiple reasons,  she didnt get along with my family, and we werent mentally stable to be in a relationship. Its been a month now since we broke up and I just feel really low still, ive had thoughts of suicide but i quickly shake them out of my head because i dont have the guts to do it and it wont really help anyone, im not sure what makes me happy anymore, she changed me as a person but im not sure who i am anymore and i just feel really guilty that i left her when she obviously needed me. Am i being selfish for only thinking about myself and only doing what i think was best for me

&amp;#x200B;

389,"Hi everyone, 

I have a question about how to cope with intellectual insecurity/ imposter syndrome. 

A bit about myself: I’m in my early 30s, and according to the good grades I’ve always managed to get (I also won the prize at university), I am over average intelligence. 

I do, however, frequently find myself forgetting words and terms and sometimes have difficulty being articulate at times. I also sometimes make silly mistakes at work. The bar is set pretty high, admittedly, as I work in law (which notably, as a field, holds some of the brightest individuals). 

The point of this post is that I frequently doubt myself and have a major case of imposter syndrome.

400," 

So  I work in a country that is a liberal democracy in an NGO. We focus on  human rights and refugee rights in a country in Africa that is known for  its brutal regime and severe human rights abuses. People have fled and a  large diaspora population lives in liberal democracies around the  globe. Although being a rather poor country, the regime from said  country has a tight grip on the diaspora community. It uses  intimidation, violence, threats against family members at home, networks  of spies and informers among the diaspora community as well as subtle  forms of pressure and harrassement to crack down any form of opposition  or dissent. That's why many people in the diaspora don't dare to  publicly speak about their experience with human rights abuses or the  political situation in their country of origin. Some governments in  liberal democracies tried to counter and prevent this behavior, but  there is not a lot of political attention and will to really do  something against them (often they also have diplomatic immunity).

In  a few weeks we will organize a big conference (about 300 participants)  with and for people who are \*not\* loyal to the regime. We have kept the  exact place of the conference secret and have invited people via contact  persons we know and trust. People can sign up via these people.  However, we cannot be entirely sure that loyalists to the regime or  their cronies sign up and visit the conference to spy and/or disrupt. In  the past they have tried to do this. They come to events, take the  microphone if the floor is open and talk for long periods of times to  disrupt the meeting or they film participants in order to intimidate  them as they fear for repercussions from the regime in their country of  residence or for their family in their country of origin.  
People  loyal to or working for the regime have also tried to film us outside of  our office and tried to come into our building a few years ago.  Personally, I have not had any experience with them, but I am also  rather new. In other countries secret service staff can also follow you  and try to listen to conversations in public spaces, but this shouldn't  be a problem in the country where we are located. I guess the worst they  have done to us is trying to smear some of our most vocal colleagues on  their propaganda website.

We informed  the police about possible problems at the conference, but told them that  there should not be any major problems given that the place is kept  secret until a day before the conference. (If we didn't keep it secret,  it could well be that the regime tries to send protesters to the  venue/contact the local administration to try and influence them etc.)  Participants only know the area, not the exact venue for the conference.  We have not hired any professional security agency, but are in contact  with the police.

My question: Do you have  any tips or advice for how to make sure the conference will be secure?  How to deal with disruptive behavior for the possible case that  loyalists to the regime participate and try and take pictures or film  participants? We don't want to straight out tell participants beforehand  that filming is prohibited as we don't want to make them worry  beforehand and because we don't want this to be a rigid event with  strict rules, but rather a free gathering with speakers and workshops.

We  will give flyers to all participants with our mobile numbers. We  (Western organizers and volunteers orginally from that country) already  ordered some prepaid sim cards that we will only use for the time of the  conference so that the regime won't get our numbers. Are there any  other simple or necessary measures we can take to make sure everything  runs smoothly? How can we prevent intimidation and disruption during the  conference without causing a big confrontation that loyalists to the  regime can make a scene out of it? How can we handle situations where  people stand up and talk for hours about how we are all getting a wrong  picture of the country (spoiler: that is BS) or disrupt by telling other  blatant lies that don't fit into the context of the conference?  
We  will also have a demonstration on the last day of the conference. Most  participants will sleep in accommodations we organized for them in rooms  with several beds.",27Nov2018,1

I feel like a cornered animal. Now I'm starting to behave like one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Brief background**: I have a career that I hate, in an industry I hate. I feel like I am dying daily. I want more out of life. I'm tied down by responsibility (mortgage; kids; I keep my in-laws alive; I keep my wife's dreams alive). Golden handcuffs. Etc and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a plan to get out of this. It includes a focus on financial independence - save more, spend less, reduce debt, acquire no new debt - and I work daily on my true passion.

&amp;#x200B;

In the most ambitious yet still realistic scenario I can leave my industry and focus full time on my passion in six years. Additionally, given the time I am and have been sinking into creating a place for myself in the world of my passion, I should know before those six years are up if it is a reasonable pursuit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a plan, I am executing to it. I am doing the right things.

&amp;#x200B;

But I am freaking out. I hate my life as it is so much. I have a well of resentment and bitterness that cannot be emptied. Not by weekends. Not by vacations. It fills faster than I can empty it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a point where the hate in me is so super saturated, it takes but the smallest infraction for me to suffer a complete breakdown. In the mornings I wake up swearing. Often, I cry while cooking breakfast. Some weeks I have no voice because I am screaming in my car driving to work. At work I barely keep it together, though sometimes I have to leave my desk and go for a walk around the building to keep myself from immediately negating my career. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should note here that it isn't the company. It isn't the job. It is the culture, behavior, experiences, ethics, morality - the spiritual everything about the industry itself. I am not built for this. That isn't changing. In the same way I wasn't built to be a professional athlete, I was not built to be part of this particular industry (outside of the raw skillset which I am quite good at).

&amp;#x200B;

I exercise regularly and exhaustingly. I meditate. I try and keep my food clean. I do my best not to medicate with alcohol (though I regularly fail). I spend conscious time focusing on gratitude and being thankful for what I have.

&amp;#x200B;

But it isn't working. I count down the days to my freedom on a calendar like an inmate. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I get through the day to day knowing that I have years - at best! - to go before I can reasonably turn my life in the direction I want it to go? Have can I calm the resentment that roils within me and threatens to damage the world around me at any given moment?

&amp;#x200B;

405,"Hi all. I’d really appreciate some life advice from those more experienced on such matters. 

I had applied for a government contracting job over the summer, but got news today that I wasn’t determined fit for it based on my past drug (weed) use. I was given the chance to dispute it last week and say that I won’t ever do it again, so I did, but still wasn’t given the job. This makes me a little angry, to be honest. This government feels very backwards with their attitudes and I hate it. I was really looking forward to that job to to pay off my student loans and pay back my dad for putting me through college. Now I’m wondering why it didn’t work out, when I was told honesty is the best policy and people have gotten clearances doing worse drugs? 

Anyway, that out of the way...I’m feeling so lost. I used to have a sales job, which was my first professional job out of college. I did that for 1.5 years but quit that because it was very stressful. I then took up a barista job but my manager started to sexually harass me and I was uncomfortable so I quit. I’ve been applying to other private sector work for 4 months now but nothing has come up. I’ve been applying to other barista jobs on the meantime but I can’t do that forever; I have a degree in business management and want to pay for it and do work in my field. 

The problem is I have really high rent and live in an expensive area here in the US, with low unemployment apparently but I haven’t gotten anything? I don’t know if it’s my resume, I was told be several recruiters it looks ok and it did help me get my first job. And I have gotten some interest from recruiters, just not a finalized job offer. 

I don’t have family I can live with here in the US so don’t have that safety net. My family lives in the Middle East but I don’t know if i should go back there. While I had a much bette social life, I also have less freedom as a female and have to wear hijab. And the chances of finding an irreligious partner would be practically 0 since no one speaks their true views in real life. And employment against locals, I’m not sure about it. Even my best friends there who aren’t citizens but only residents, haven’t found work. So I thought I could go to Australia for a working holiday visa, but who knows if I’d get employed against locals. Although it seems appealing to me to work there considering the high minimum wage and great working conditions I’ve heard of.  I just don’t know if America is for me. 

What should I do given my circumstances? I’d really appreciate any advice. Apologies if this sounds incoherent, I didn’t expect to hear this news and I’m a bit lost right now. ",27Nov2018,1

I consider my self as a ""*Geek""* i don't go outside a lot, only if i have to. Because i hate going out, I like to spend my free time watching films, series and reading. So, it means i'm an introvert person with a few friends. 

# The Problem:

My mother(55 y.o) doesn't work because she is uneducated. So we spend most of the day sitting with each other. we don't talk alot as i'm not a talkative person. But we still see each other 6+ hours a day. 

She always calls me with a pet name. She loves me more than my siblings. Which made them hate me. Everyday she gives me money even if i don't need. She was the one who bought me a phone, a laptop and a Ps4. She defends me when i argue with anyone. e.g. my brother, sister, father and sister's husband. If anyone asks me a question she answers. she doesn't trust that i can answer it.

Even my dad calls me a spoiled kid. and he talks publicly about it which made me more introvert.

She doesn't let me go outside a lot. And if she does, she calls me more than 5 times. Sometimes i hang out with a friends ( which doesn't happen a lot ) once it passes an hour, the phone starts ringing. and guess who ?.

My relatives think i'm spoiled. but it's not my fault. I always tell her to stop it. and then she start saying that i should not overthinking about spoiling thing.

I want her to treat me as an adult but i don't know how.

411,"Background. I have had diabetes type one since I was a year old. I have stage two kidney disease. My husband knew this and was there when the Dr said don't work full time and get disability. He married me knowing this. I applied for 6 jobs and didn't get them so I got a low playing babysitting job. It's what I could get. I have done everything to get disability I am just waiting to be approved or denyed. I'm on lots of meds that make me tired as do my ilnesses. He sends me this and has decided I just cost too much and I'm worthless.
""I'm going to leave you one day and you're going to act like it was unexpected. I told you to get a job, I told you to try to get disability, and I told you to try to get your mom to help more.

So keep crying, you're digging your own grave."" Oh BTW he has monthly vices that cost anywhere from 100-300 a month. So what do y'all think is going on? And my mom pays my phone bill too.

412,"This year, I lost my best friend of 8 years. He’s still around, but he has cut me out of his life, and I am still struggling to come to terms with this loss and move on. I’ve never had any long term romantic relationships, and I have never been closer to anyone else than I was to this friend. He meant everything to me. When he was still a good friend, he made me happy, and now that he’s gone, I haven’t been able to feel the same way since, and I’m scared I may never feel that way again (even though rationally I know this is unlikely). I loved him so much, and the way in which he made it apparent that he didn’t want to have me in his life anymore wounded me more than I would have thought possible. 

At the end of last year we went on an overnight trip, and I sensed that things weren’t right between us. I chose not to broach the topic as he was never very good at those kinds of conversations. From that point on he distanced himself from me. At first I bought the idea that he was just really busy, had a new girlfriend and so on. But eventually I started asking what was wrong, and when he claimed he didn’t know what I was talking about, I reacted by giving him the cold shoulder for a bit, hoping it would finally elicit a response. Perhaps predictably, it just compounded the problem, and eventually I caved in and tried talking to him. Again, he gave the excuse that he was just too busy. 

It wasn’t busyness, it was that he was choosing to spend his time with other people. He couldn’t even spare a half hour drink every fortnight or month. Clearly he didn’t want me in his life anymore, but he didn’t know how to ‘break up’ with a friend and didn’t have the courage to try. This meant that, over the course of this whole year up until September, I had to slowly piece everything together. I sent him a massive text outlining how I felt, and he finally admitted that he didn’t want to be friends anymore. This hurt a lot, but I had been hurting all year, and I thought that this would give me closure, but it didn’t. 

I thought he would always be there. I was prepared to always be there for him. I had been there when he had gotten sick; when his car had broken down; when his dog needed looking after; when his longterm relationship ended; when his friend and godfather was killed. I had been there through everything. I thought we had some sort of unspoken contract that we would always be there for each other. I thought we would be each others' best man. Now he is gone, I feel so alone. I have other friends, but I’m not close to anybody now. Worse, I find it difficult to show affection to others now. One of my friends hugs me when I greet him, and I find it hard to return this gesture, and I think it hurts him but I can’t help it. 

It’s been over two months since my friend confirmed we were through, but it hasn’t gotten any easier to take. There are so many things that remind me of him, all the time, every day. The hardest part is that he never gave me a good enough explanation and he never apologised or admitted to doing wrong by me. Am I wrong to think that after 8 years of solid friendship, you would owe it to your friend to let them down gently if you decided it was time to move on? How can I move on in the absence of an apology? I am in so much pain, every day, and I don’t know what to do. It is 1:45am right now and I can’t sleep because  I can’t stop thinking about it all. 

Since we shared a large social circle, I have found myself shying away from this group. I feel so isolated. I was at a 21st on the weekend, and my friend was there. He had to pass the small group I was with to get into the event, but he only said hello to us then kept moving, and didn’t give me any more of his attention. As I went home on the tram, I saw two random friends with their arms around each other and I almost broke down in tears. I am now faced with the prospect of leaving the sports team I have been with for 7 years to avoid seeing my friend, and I feel like I need to break away from that social group entirely, even though they comprise so many of my friends.

I’m 26 and I struggle now to make new friends. I feel as though there is an invisible ceiling on how close new friendships can become. I am struggling with the anxiety this provokes. I could keep going on but this is already too long. I’m hoping people with similar experiences can help to shed some light on what might help me and others in the same boat to get through the pain of this kind of loss and to find the courage to seek out new friendships.

TL;DR my best friend of 8 years cut me out of his life, and I have been struggling with this all year and have been unable to move on. Time isn’t doing the job of healing, so what will?

I've been trying ways to get him and the pain off my mind but it been so hard. Some days are definitely better than others but I wish it would go away..

or I wish that he'd maybe snap me a ""hey how have you been doing"" or ""hey we should meet up again soon"" but nothing.. it's eating me up inside. 

I guess we are better off ""not talking to each other"" since we were hanging out and talking behind each other significants backs, almost cheated on my current boyfriend with him.. ( BTW I love my bf to death, he makes me the happiest I can be) and I guess it was toxic for both of us. He was just one of those ppl that I connected with well, I enjoyed his company. His gf then went away to school, and that's when he decided to cut me off totally. Tried asking him why he did what he did, but he just ignores me.. so I've given up. Friends tell me he probably chose his gf over me, and wanted to be 100% into her, even when he admitted he had massive feelings for me, and now she at school 5 hours away.  

It just really hurts and sucks, and I wonder if it hurts for him too? Probably not. I've been thinking of texting him a simple hey and seeing what happens, but I probably shouldn't. Guess were better off away from each other... Any advice on what I should do?

Background: he has a child’s version of bi-polar disorder (cant remember the technical diagnosis). Regularly has fits of mania and anger and loses control of himself multiple times a day. He sees a therapist weekly but they mostly focus on listening and paying attention. 

My thoughts are to separate the kids (the sleep in the same room), remove access to any utensils he may be able to find that could be harmful, have him see a psychiatrist, and look into medication.

423,"I didn't mean to and I don't expect anything to happen. We didn't really like each other because of some misunderstandings.  We got sorta close when we were both in relationships, so I can assure you my intentions were pure. Still are. But over the course of time we both were pretty much dumped and we were each other's rock throughout that time. 

So as you can imagine that only brought us closer together.  He's told me things about himself that nobody else knows, and I did the same in return. He's taken care of me when I was in trouble. He comes to me when he needs comfort or company.
 He's more comfortable befriending girls so maybe there's nothing else to it.. but I still wonder. I've never really had close friends so it's hard for me to judge what is and isn't normal for behavior between friends. 

I don't think I should tell him, because he's used to his female friends liking him-- I don't want him to think I was just trying to date him, because I'm not. I didn't like him based off his looks. He's attractive, but it's more about personality for me.  I don't think he would judge me or look at me any differently if I told him, I'm just scared of being vulnerable. And like I said, I don't expect him to feel the same and I won't care for him any less if that's the case. I just feel dishonest, like I'm hiding something from him.  It feels unfair to him, since he's so open and trusting of me. But I also can't tell if I'm trying to convince myself that it's for him and not my own personal benefit. 
 
I think I was meant to meet him though, even if he's only supposed to be a friend. I don't know what I ever did to deserve someone like him, truthfully. He's had his heart and trust broken countless times and he deserves someone truly special. I want him to find his happiness.

424,"First of all, excuse me for the formatting and possible typos, I'm writing this from phone.

I'm a 19 years old girl, and started college this year. I'm learning how to be a kindergarten teacher. I love kids, so I thought this will be a good job for me. I was wrong.
The more I learn at college, the more I think this job is not for me. Everyone in my class looks motivated, they really wanna finish this uni and work in this job. I'm the only person in the class who can't keep up with whatever we are learning. 

Sadly, I became unmotivated about this whole job, since I realised I don't really want to do this. And some days ago I realised I wanna study something else. 

About my parents, they are a bit mad about the whole situation, since my oldest brother left college like this too. While they supported him, he never went to do any other school, or anything. He just sits at home all day long, not doing anything.

I know for a while now that my parents see my brother in me, and they often tell me that they hope I won't become like my brother. After a while this whole thing drove me insane. I realised if I want to leave college, I need a plan, so unlike my brother I can start learning something new that I might like.

I planned everything correctly, and when today I brought it up to my parents they told me I can't leave college. They told me they don't care if the job doesn't suits me, but I need to finish college. After that i can go and learn whatever I want. 
I have no idea what am I supposed to do. I really don't want to learn this at all, because it just doesn't feel like it's me.

I could need an advice about my life.   
I seem to be stuck in a hole, with no ladder out in my own sight.  


First off some informations about myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 26 and male. As I'm typing this I listen to ""Jonathan Davis - What It Is"" on repeat.

&amp;#x200B;

I work in the fields of work preparation (Is this even the correct term ?), but i feel more like I work as a slave. Everyday at work feels wasted. I have to do everything my boss tells me to, and i have little to none task I can do on my own. Well... I have tasks i can do, and have to do but I cant finish those because I get interrupted all the time. I really hate my job and i know i should quit it. But I don't know what job would suit me best.   


I studied engineering for two years and then quit. Right now i study in the fields of business-psychology. But to attend the evening courses ist just a pain for me... After work im so down and out that I often can't push myself to go and study.  


I decided to break up with my ex about a month ago, because I was unhappy with the relationship and the love faded away. I decided to stay friends with her, with actually kinda worked. But right now I'm interested In a close friend of mine but I think she won't feel the same. So I'm unable to tell her because things might geht weird afterwards. (Yeah I know if our friendship wont survive this, it wasn't even a good friendship) But I'm still scared.  


My family is really supportive and I love them, but I also feel that I might get too disconnected with them. It just feels weird. My dad sometimes asks me to do something fun with him, but i often decline and I'm sad about this. I just can make myself agree to do something.  


Right now im feeling really bitter and lonely and I just don't know what to do.  
Writing this down feels like a small relieve.

428,"So, I am a professional singer for a church choir at a progressive mainline Christian church. I have sung there for over a decade, and five years ago, I actually joined the church. I am close with many people in the choir, and I frequently have holiday dinners with a certain couple in the choir who lives near the church.

At Thanksgiving dinner, the choir director was also a guest and used a very offensive slur for Jewish people that starts with K. I wasn’t in the room when it happened, but I came back in to my (Jewish) girlfriend saying something like, “I’m just having trouble moving on from the fact that you just said the K word.”

He immediately seemed to realize the gravity of the situation and started very quietly apologizing to her and saying he didn’t know why that word slipped out, but he’d watched American History X recently, so maybe it was in the front of his mind. 

The other guests went on as if nothing happened, and I believe later after talking to them that they may have not actually heard what he said. The hosts of the party looked genuinely shocked that he had said that word when I confronted them a few days later and said I wished they had made a bigger deal out of it.

Anyway, I am at a loss on what to do next. I have considered resigning from the church job. It is not an important part of my income and I could likely find a better paying church job closer to home pretty quickly. I have stayed there this long because of the community. I have also considered bringing a formal complaint. There were multiple church employees there, so legally it would be considered a “company” event and his demeanor would rightly be scrutinized under US law. Or should I just have a private conversation with him and hash things out? Am I overreacting, considering he was so remorseful? I am just going to feel weird working with him for a while. Also, I have known this guy for over ten years, have been to his house several times socially and sung with him in different choirs, but he has only been the director here for a couple years.

I don’t know if this belongs here so maybe it gets deleted. I don’t even know why I’m typing this but it must get out of my head and i need to talk with somebody about this. I’m sorry for grammatical mistakes, English isn’t my main language and I don’t know if I’m uploading this shit or just delete it. 
I’m ready to get insulted as a pedo or weirdo. 

My story:

(18 years old) I’m sexual attracted to younger girls , like 12 years and up. I don’t know why but it is how it is. I NEVER watched any kind of porn or pics of childs , because I don’t want the police to bust in my home and arrest me. So you can think what I do in my free time home alone in my imagination. I know that this is some fucked up shit that might bring me in trouble. I once went to a psychiatrist but he basically told me that something is wrong with me and I should stop with this or he may involve the police in this case (wtf?!). Since then I have paranoia and I started to take sleep pills (I don’t know if this is the right word?). I think I’m addicted to them now and I feel that this might kill me in the future if I take them more frequently. I feel like shit after taking them.  

As I mentioned I don’t know what to do and how I can stop this behavior. My friends / family don’t have a clue and I don’t want them to tell this. I also need help with the addiction but I don’t want to tell my psychiatrist because he want to bust me. And it’s very embarrassing to tell anybody. :/

431,"Hi

I'm a student at a university and this semester, I have to work on a huge project (12 Credit Points, aka 360 hours of work) which is even bigger than my bachelor's thesis. The project itself is awesome - but my teammate isn't. Tl;dr at the end.

**Our project**

I hadn't known him before this project started. We just kind of raised hands for the same project and thus were grouped together.  At first, I was really glad - he expressed how he wanted this project to succseed, even surpass what we would have to hand in and he wanted us to solve the project's problem with a game, just like me. Awesome, that's something I can work with (I'm a perfectionist. No, not a humble brag. I really pour heart, soul and time in projects and end up doing twice as much as needed while still never being content with my output. I know about this and try to work on myself. And I know this doesn't extend to other people: People want to have time to work besides going to university, want to have free time. As long as I can see teammates actively working on group projects, whatever they do is fine with me (mostly).) 

But working as a team with him ist just... something that has never happened. 

I opened a Slack with the two of us, since our time schedules aren't really compatible. He was interested and thought the idea was great. There, we could post our research stuff, talk about what we want to do, etc. Just... He never reacts on the stuff I write. At the beginning, I had an idea about a game and posted it: five lines of brainstorming, followed by a short Google Doc File on how to make it work together. I asked him what he thought about it. No answer. A week later, we met again in class and I asked again. He didn't like it, it was too boring for him. Hm. Alright. What did he have in mind? ""Didn't really think about it."" Afterwards, we brainstormed together but couldn't find common ground - I had ideas which he labeled as broing, but didn't come up with anything else, either. 

A day later, we had to present our first research on our topics. He wrote he would be late - but he didn't show up at all. So I did it with the help of a coursmate.

A week later, I was ill and couldn't attend class. Asked him if he could tell me what it was about. He wrote back that he overslept and didn't see the point in being late, so he stayed home. 

Again, a week later, we had to present our first project concepts in a small group. My teammate hadn't shown up when it was our group's time to speak, so I did it on my own and kind of only had my own ideas to present. He snuck into the room while I was wrapping it up; after class, he told me that this was an awesome idea, which he really enjoyed and he would love to learn more about that - he only remembered it being about a \[certain game mechanic\]. But... the thing is, this \[certain game mechanic\] was only one of the first five lines of brainstorming I had sent him. I had never mentioned it again; in fact, even in my google doc, I was using a whole different mechanic alltogether. He hadn't even read it. And still told me my idea was boring.

So, I told him exactly what this first draft was about and how I had worked on it until now (which was all in our Slack and he could have known about it had he just bothered to merely look at it). He told me he was exited to work on it and since I had done so much already, he would step up and get to work. Awesome! Better late than never! He wanted to work on the player character and had the idea to change it from a fighter/hero-character to an \[animal\]. \[Animals\] are cute and would work in the game just as well, so why not? Additionally, he wanted to work on the animations, which is awesome since I'm not a huge fan of doing them myself.

We agreed to do some more research, make a few sketches. Write the story (I volunteered), design the player character (his job), do the animations needed (his job as well) and turn our graphics and ideas into an actual game via Unity (my part). We would both work on the graphics of the world, as well as come up with powers our \[animal\] could use.  

We have four milestone-presentations we have to hold in front of a large group as well as several professors. Tomorrow is our second. He had missed the first one and an hour ago, I got a text message from him how he wouldn't be able to be there tomorrow either, since he mixed up the dates and thought we would have to present today. Afterwards, he sent me a sketch of the \[animal\]. I am at a loss for words. We are both students of design. His animal is not at all what we had talked about in style and design. He ignored all of my input and questions on game mechanics, designs, research, etc over the last week, instead, sent me his very rough draft with the idea of giving the animal a whacky hairdo.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr:** In a team of two, my partner doesn't react on anything I give to him, doesn't contribute anything (apart from a 3-minute-sketch of an animal) by himself, and doesn't show up to presentations or classes.

&amp;#x200B;

**What now?**

I am not going to pretend that this is a group work anymore. 

But I don't really know how to proceed from this realization. 

I guess I have to talk to my professor about it. But how should I handle this with regards to him?

432,"Well my partner ended things a couple of weeks ago and Im still living in the same house as her and her mother....long story.

They said I can stay till after christmas and then find a place to stay(bear in mind I already paid the rent this month). 

But my friend has offered their spare room that I can stay in which could be ready by end of the week.

My ex has said I can stay here and she will sort things out so that I can have more time to myself and that my friend wont really want me their during the christmas period.

Problem is I don't know if I can bear it a month. She has turned my life upside down and I just don't know what to do. I want to stay for my daughter(which custody issues have already been sorted) but mentally my head isn't right.

So pretty much long story short, theres this girl in my friend group, I started to like her when I was 15 and now we are both in the same high school and 16. We always hang out in the same group, because I really don't have other friends. If I tell her about my feelings the whole group will collapse or be extremely awkward for the rest of high school.
I know I should ask /r/relationship_advice but the thing is that I know a relationship between us wouldn't work. Next to that everytime I'm at school with them, I'm not sad or anything. But when I get home I start to get sad, or really angry.
And if she starts to talk to other guys I get pissed off. (I know I shouldn't). I want to stop these feelings, so is a gym membership or anything on that scale going to help?
Please if something comes to your mind, post it in the comments.

437,"I'm 22 and in college. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although my class has split itself into a dozen little groups, I inserted myself in a few of them but ended up sticking with two. One of them being 2 other guys (one of whom can be X), the other being 2 girls (one of whom can be Y). Last year (my freshman year), these groups did not mix, and everything was fine. I would grab a drink with the guys and pick up the girls to go travel somewhere along with some other classmates.

&amp;#x200B;

My problems started early this year, when Y started becoming closer to X. He would play with her in the classroom, stuff like stealing her notebook and putting it in the back row. Or he'd tease her when she was with us with stuff like ""Oh, why are you here again, do you have no friends?"". Eventually I started feeling left out of both groups. We would go to the bar and Y would follow X around and leave me alone. Or me and the 2 guys would be standing while Y was sitting down, and she would turn to me and go ""Hey can ask X what he's waiting for to sit down?"".

&amp;#x200B;

I started wondering whether there was some sort of sexual/romantic interest between them but things didn't match up. Y has a boyfriend who is a pretty cool, chill guy, and their relationship seems pretty stable. Also, she and X are neighbors but they don't come together to school even though their path is the same, and X has to call me to ask where exactly she lives when we set up a dinner. Anyway, there was this constant feeling of ""Hey, what the hell. I've known these people for over a year now, I hang out with them consistently, and I'm still being completely ignored and left behind, thus there's something hugely wrong with me"".

&amp;#x200B;

I actually got into therapy over this. I was constantly not feeling good enough, whether in regards to my personality (not being playful/funny enough), appearance (not being tall/muscular, not being as handsome, etc.), and I'm now 3 sessions in and still facing insecurities about this situation. Then another downward spiral began, when my relationship with both guys started deteriorating as well. Y would constantly tell X ""jokes"" like ""Gee, whenever you laugh it sounds like you are having an asthma attack, are you ok?"", and since she would not react negatively, he started telling me the same type of jokes. I did react negatively. He also started doing other annoying stuff. So I would be talking to a classmate of ours in the hallway and he'd jump in loudly and go ""That's not important"". Usually we'd keep talking anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually these two also kinda broke apart when he told her during a class ""What do you mean you don't understand that? It's pretty obvious, you're just kinda dumb"". For the first time, at least, she reacted. But the following day everything was fine again, even though he never apologized. Anyway this got to a point I'm now totally uncomfortable being around them both. I can't even attempt to tell any type of joke without having X jump in and go ""Meh that was not funny, you gotta try harder"". There's this constant competition.

&amp;#x200B;

This last week I broke and just told both girls what I felt and how angry I was getting around X, as well as how he made me feel around them. They both initially agreed with me, Y even saying ""Even his friend (who came to our last group dinner as a first-time guest) is cooler than him"". But then when we got around X again, everything was exactly the same, which only got me more upset. They invited him to our next house party tomorrow and when I told them I wouldn't go if he went, they got mad at me. I reminded Y what she said about admitting she found his friend cooler, she said she never said that. Told her about how her past behaviors made me feel, she said she doesn't remember that either. She told me I shouldn't let X drive our friendship away, and just do what she does: totally ignore him when he's being annoying, and enjoy him when he's being him funny. She told me to think about it and reach a conclusion and text her after I did.

&amp;#x200B;

My conclusion was that I wanted to break the friendship. I'm clearly more invested in it than she ever will be, and I feel no advantage, no support, no inspiration, no comfort, no safety, having them as friends, and all this drama only served to show me that. Meanwhile I've been neglecting people who actually like to spend time with me. Problem being: these people are from other towns or schools or courses. So right now, without these groups, I have nobody I can spend breaks between classes with. I guess I could meet new people tho, I'm kinda good at that.

  
Ideas? Who is right? Who is wrong? Am I being childish or a drama queen, or simply looking out for my mental well-being? ",27Nov2018,1
438,"So, I'm once again in that phase, but I currently think that I will not end up in a relationship ever. That's not because I don't desire being in one - I have done so in the past - but because I'm simply not fit for one. First, I don't have good looks. My skin is pretty unclean even though I apply a special lotion that's supposed to clean it. My hair is just a mess, it's curling where it's not supposed to and will sometimes just face away from my head completely without good reason. Also, I'm currently in the process of growing long hair, so it looks even worse. But when I had short hair, everything was the same. My nose is too big. The only good thing to say about my face is that I can keep my nonexistent beard in check.
I'm very skinny and underweight even though I eat sweets and generally everything I like, no matter how many calories it has, until I'm full. I'm judt growing in height, and that height has reached a point where I'm slowly becoming too tall. My posture - which I constantly try to fix - won't get any better. To add to all of that, I have almost no strength in any of my muscles. It's enough for daily life, sure, but my muscles are pretty much nonexistent.
My behavior is also useless. I'm very awkward around people, either I don't say anything or I go on about useless stuff way too much. I'm so shy and introverted that it hurts. For example, I'd rather search a store for two hours than ask an employee, even if that employee is just standing around doing nothing. I don't have great people skills in general, but that should summarize it pretty good.
I also behave unusual on my own, I collect everything I can get a hold of (seriously, you name it, I collect it or have collected it at some point). I don't participate in any normal social events. I only have nerdy hobbies like TCGs, childish hobbies like watching cartoons or otherwise unfitting hobbies like listening to metal.

To summarize, there won't be a girl who likea every facade of me so much that she wants to be in a relationship with me. Sure, I have girl friends (and guy friends), but that's something different. And I've tried, but every time I approach a girl, I do something I now cringe at if I think about it. There literally hasn't been a conversation with a girl I have been interested in at that point I can recall where I would say ""yep, that was a good conversation I would like to have again"".

439,"We had been seeing each other for 8 ish months, and dating for 3.5 months in our last year of college. I had been very slow moving with my feelings throughout the whole thing (why we had taken so long to officially start dating) and this is kind of why I ended things a few weeks ago. I expected myself to feel in love by this point, but maybe it's just not the kind of person I am to be completely enamored by someone else. I have always thought that I am an emotionally low-key person, so I'm not sure. Maybe I am expecting too much?

It especially hurts because she is such an amazing girl, we always had fun together, and there was nothing really wrong with our relationship other than the fact that my expectations of feeling love were not fulfilled.

440,"Hey , 
I don’t know if this is the right sub but I’m going to post it here. I want to excuse my grammatical errors, English isn’t my main language. 

I need some advices because I recently realized that I am sexual attracted to younger girls (I’m 18) like 12-13 year olds. I know that this is some weird shit but I can’t help myself. I never watched child porn or some fucked up shit because I don’t want to get problems with the police (we will come to that later in the text).  So you can imagine what I do in my free time home alone in my imagination. I’m definitely not proud of it and it’s disgusting. I’m ashamed of myself. One day I decided to go to a psychiatrist but he basically said that I’m a weird person and if he ever hears again of this he will contact the police (wtf). Since then I’m taking sleeping pills (i don’t know the exact word in English - sorry). I think I’m addicted to this shit know and I can’t stop to take them. I don’t want to ruin my body and health and maybe I’m going to die from a overdose if I can’t stop. I’m in paranoia the whole day just because I don’t want to get jailed and I don’t want anybody (friends/family) to know this. I don’t want to go the psychiatrist, you can think why.

441,"TL;DR at bottom.

I'll be 37 by the end of December. I'm married, have 6 biological children and 2 step children. 2 bio and 2 step live with me. My youngest bio daughter that lives with me has autism. My oldest bio son who does not live with me is severely medically fragile. My wife is a fairly new RN and makes pretty good money for our area. I make about 25% less than her but almost my entire paycheck goes to medical insurance and child support. We both have nice vehicles and we own 2 homes, one of which I'm desperate to sell and will be on the market very soon. I also receive VA disability every month, thankfully. We cannot seem to get ahead and are swimming in credit card debt, lawyer bills, and medical bills. Even though we have a decent bring home every month we keep slipping a little further and further behind. But that's not even what's bothering me. I hate my job.

I was active Army for 5 years. Got out and immediately started working retail selling cellphones. Been doing this for the past 7 years. The jobs not bad nor difficult, just not where I want to be and I feel I can't do anything about it. I have an associates in computer studies and an associates in software development. Coding is a passion of mine and I'd love to be doing that for a living. But I feel I'm stuck for 3 different reasons.

1) Medical insurance. As I said I have two children with pretty serious medical issues, not to mention one of my step daughters has pretty severe hearing loss. One perk of my job is that insurance is relatively inexpensive for everything it covers. We pay roughly $600 a month in premiums and barely have any out of pocket costs for anything. To get similar insurance through my wife's employer is almost double that monthly and is out of the question. And good medical insurance is a definite must. So that's one reason I feel I cannot change my career path this late in my life.

2) Child support obligations. I'm not railing against child support in general. That's a whole other discussion. But I feel trepidation when I think about how switching jobs or starting my own business would affect my cs obligations. I don't even know if I could legally quit my current job to pursue a new career path should I decide that's what I want to do.

3) I feel incompetent as a coder. As I said, I love coding. I love having a problem and figuring out the solution or bringing my imagination to life on the screen. I've been a hobbyist coder for about 5 years. I've got an associates in software development and I learned quite a bit in the process and I know pursuing a bachelor's and further would help me but I really, really struggled to even get my associates. With all my other obligations such as children, wife, trying to sell a home, work without a regular schedule (did I mention I hate retail), dealing with doctor's appointments, etc it's hard to find time to take more college courses especially taking classes that don't seem relevant to what I want to be doing. Plus the thought of adding even more debt to my already huge pile is overwhelming. 

My coding ability, I feel, is a little bit below par. Just barely above beginner level. This is a problem that I know how to fix but I've been in such a demotivational slump lately because of all the aforementioned things that I have a hard time even getting into a hobby project just for fun. I wouldn't mind even getting into an entry level position somewhere to learn the ropes but I can't physically relocate and searches for these types of jobs in my area don't turn up any results that I can find. That on top of these 3 reasons keep me from really trying to pursue my passion of coding. I'd love to eventually start my own development studio but I know that's a long term goal and I'm not sure how to even proceed chasing that dream or if I should just be content with my lot in life? I mean, my kids are happy and don't go without and neither do I nor my wife. 

TL;DR 37 years old. Feels stuck in job I hate due to financial and self competency reasons. Be happy with what I've got and not add any more financial/emotional risks or pursue my dream even though I don't feel I'd be good enough to accomplish them? Can't really save money but feel very unhappy and depressed lately because of my current situation.",27Nov2018,1
442,"Some background info: 
My mental health is kind of tumultuous. I fall into depressive episodes frequently which predominantly make me suicidal, unmotivated, and very hateful. I grew up in a house of manipulators. My dad was very emotionally abusive, and thus very manipulative. I watched him abuse my mom (and myself to a lesser extent). My brother, who is an addict, is also a king of manipulation. I probably shouldn't be pulling excuses out of my ass, but I genuinely think that all of this exposure to manipulative people naturally instilled manipulation into me. I learned the ways of my brother and dad. 

Anyways, as of late I've grown increasingly self aware of how manipulative I am ..but I don't consciously try to be manipulative. I find I almost never think before I speak, and I'm very impulsive, so manipulative language just rolls off my tongue naturally. This has become kind of concerning to me as I don't want to follow the footsteps of my dad and become emotionally abusive. It just happens so naturally. I'll blurt something out and realize, moments or sometimes days later, that I am super fucking good at manipulating people. 

On a final note, I'm kind of ambivalent on how I feel about this trait. On one hand I don't want to hurt the people I love; but on the other hand there aren't many people I really empathise with. I fall into these very recklessly hateful/irritable depressive episodes, which is when the manipulation is at its worst. I also acknowledge that this trait could be useful in certain situations, and sometimes I feel 'proud'. Both of these things scare me. 

My initial thoughts are that I need to learn to think before I speak, but how can I implement this? I've been impulsive my whole life so I'm not really sure where to start. Any other advice on how to combat this trait is welcomed! Tear me apart. Thanks!

443,"Trigger warnings: rape, incest, abuse, animal abuse
Need psychological evaluation.

I do not know where else to ask this, thus why it's here.

I have posted my situation on the r/jnfamily subreddit. Long story short... My only older sibling molested and attempted rape multiple times on me growing up. My family was pretty detached and I have been ex-communicated from them since some other stuff happened in addition to exposing this part of my life. Yes, I have been to therapy.

With that being said, he did other weird behavior growing up. He used to actively talk with one of our cousins about how to break me, in those words. It was a frequent conversation between them, among other things that were scary. I know about it because I eavesdropped their conversations. The two of them were bad for each other and fed each other's anger, obviously.

Among the things they carried out due to their chats about breaking me were: abusing or attempting to abuse my pets. Literally torturing my cat and at another time trying to get one of the house cats to eat my pet fish. He would strip my Barbie dolls and tell me it was to show how perverted I was. He left me in a barn with a hive of swarming bees. Etc. Etc. Etc.

In more recent years he admitted to our mom and his now ex wife that he orchestrated things so she would divorce him. Their home life was nutty with many mind games according to her, as I can well imagine.

My question is, how do you define his behavior psychologically? 

This is important to me because his behavior gets coddled by mom and she just uses the ""boys will be boys"" statement or ""he was just jealous."" If that's all it is, what a world.

447,"So, I’m not sure if this is the best place to post this. If it isn’t, please feel free to direct me to the best place to share my story.

So, here’s the scoop. My (23F) boyfriend (23M) got an apartment with his (28M) coworker last year around this time. This is my boyfriends first time living alone and I had yet to move in. 7 months down the road, he lets me move in because him and his roommate only had a few months left on their lease and after that lease was up, him and I were going to get a place together (just us) because that’s what we both wanted. Well August rolls around and our roommate is in a pretty serious relationship (going on a year) and he was talking about moving in with her once her lease was up (mid July) and begged me and my boyfriend to help him out and stay another year. Well after I moved in, we were splitting 1200 rent 3 ways, but since we were doing him a favor by staying another year, he offered to pay half of the rent and let my boyfriend and I split the other half. Well, it’s only been two months after we resigned the lease and he has broken up with said gf and is now saying he can’t afford to pay half of the rent anymore... he makes $4200 a month (he’s also in the military) and can’t pay $600 for rent because of some personal financial issues (idk but he sure has money to spend every single weekend going to the bar) but of course my boyfriend is understanding and tells me we are back to splitting it 3 ways... I’m a server and I only bring home on average $800, so obviously I’m a little upset because what my boyfriend and I pay together, we could easily afford a one bedroom apartment alone. 

Our roommate isn’t the worst, but he’s a clean freak and bothers us when we occasionally leave rinsed dishes in the sink, and still bothers us even though we are doing him a favor... he will send my boyfriend texts saying “please tell so and so to clean the sink before I have to say something mean” etc and me coming from an essentially abusive background, doesn’t take this well and I don’t feel 100% comfortable in my own home.. he’s also never bought groceries in the whole time he’s been here but feels the need to even go in the kitchen for some reason. I also have noticed that he is a slightly compulsive liar and have caught him lying about different small things (for example me and my boyfriend spot cleaning the house because HE has family coming over) I feel that he is slightly manipulative over my boyfriend but I can see straight through him. I feel it’s slightly putting a strain on me thus putting strain on my relationship and I’m not quite sure how to go about telling my boyfriend that it’s really not fair to us to be harassed about anything when he begged us to stay another year, because that’s how I feel. We also have another 8 months with this roommate. I also don’t want to go back to splitting it 3 ways because that’s not what the agreement was, financial burden or not. 

Am I just being irrational?  Or do I have the right to say “hey I’m paying extra rent” because he is definitely getting the better deal out of this, with my boyfriend and I combined we are paying $ 850. The only reason we even agreed is bc it was supposed to benefit us and help him until he moves in with his gf.",27Nov2018,1

I like my boss and my coworkers for the most part and it seems like I can make decent money if I stick it out for a few years (that being said, turnover here is a problem, and most people only work here for about a year).

452,"For background, I grew up kind of isolated from friends. I didn't make friends for a long time because of social anxiety. In college I would have one or two. I would remember being close to some people I could be my total self with. I remember professors really liking me and people wanting to be friends with me. But sometimes I can't help but feel that they were lying. They were lying because I'm pretty. I discovered weed and my parents freaked out and sent me to rehab for 2 months. There I met Jerry. It was isolating in there and he was the only one my age so I made friends with him. When I got out I kind of realized I wanted to leave my home so I became his roommate. Being his roommate was really hard because I felt like he was a child. I've always felt like he was mentally ill in some way but I chalk it up to his kind of bad up bringing. But then I don't think bad up bringing is an excuse to be 'weird'. 

I lived with him for 2 years. Pretty isolated. Just him and I. We still smoked weed together. I didn't make friends with anyone and I would work from home. His mom paid for his life. In that time I tried to do several things to help me get a job like take classes but I have a hard time getting along with people. Sometimes I chalk that up to being a different social class from the people I was around. I usually get along with another social class (the people I remember being close to). 

Even in isolation with Jerry, I still FELT like I had communication with the outside world because I had this online relationship with an American. I was my total self with him and he always said I wasn't weird. (People from my social class have a lot of Americans). I decided to go back to college. I met more people but I didn't get talk to them much because of social anxiety from being isolated for so long. Lately I've been talking more to them and they seem to really like me. They invite me out all the time. I notice a lot of people are like that with me but I just have social anxiety and am very picky about who I hang out with. I've been working on being picky though because I need more social interaction. I broke it off with the online relationship and a short fling with a person in my city. I didn't want a relationship so I didn't want to meet the guys friends (also due to SA) but the guy told me he thinks I'm great and wants to take things further. Honestly I feel like all these people who like me just like me because I'm pretty. 

He thinks Jerry is weird though. He has hung out with him and smokes with him but I wouldn't say they're friends. They also play online games together sometimes. The guy is just really friendly though. (I miss him sometimes.) 

I tell him yeah he's weird but he's my friend. Jerry drove me crazy as roommate (my head hurts just remembering it right now) but he stuck by me through a tough time in my life. When he was my roommate he went through this psychotic episode. He got medicated for it (still is via injection once a month) and according to his mother it makes him 'calmer'. I've been on anti depressants before and I don't remember it making me 'weird' in any way. (I felt the same so I stopped). She thanked me for being Jerry's friend and sticking by him. She told me that his friends are just there for him because sometimes they felt bad for him? I didn't understand that. I've never been around Jerry and his friends but they seem normal? They were in an acting group and were really close. Did plays together. They still keep in touch through messenger and meeting up sometimes. I've moved out into my own place and things are going well. I still see my friend once a week to catch up and also because we're just really close now. However every week I get so frustrate with how he is that I contemplate breaking our friendship. 

I dated this guy for a while and told him about my frustrations. He advised me I should break off my friendship with Jerry because he is holding me back. He said Jerry does sound weird and gave off a weird 'vibe' when they met briefly. He told me I shouldn't be so shy because I'm fine how I am. We got along pretty well but I broke it off because I didn't want a serious relationship and he wanted one. 

Lately I've just been friends with Jerry but getting to know other people. Looking for other friendships and interacting more. I haven't felt any friendship sparks with anyone lately but I've been craving a good conversation because I don't get it from Jerry. I met this guy and he met Jerry. They've talked for a bit and stuff like that. I met up with the guy and he told me he thought Jerry was weird. And then he hit on me, I said no. 

All of the guys who have hit on me and have met Jerry ask me why I'm friends with him. I tell them we've been through a lot together and we're just close now. He knows me extremely well and I know him. But really.. every time we meet up I think to myself that if we didn't go through anything then I wouldn't be friends with him. 

Now I'm just thinking ""Why do all these people think Jerry is weird?"". He HAS friends and they all seem fine to me. He has had these weird psychotic episodes that were scary sometimes but they're still his friends now. He's pretty normal now to me but I think I just get frustrated talking to him because sometimes he's 'slow' ? I enjoyed dating these guys because that's where I got intelligent conversation. But then again I feel like all these people just like me because I'm pretty. I feel like I have really bad social anxiety sometimes. I'm sorry if I sound mean when talking about Jerry, I'm just trying to be honest from my own perspective.

A little more about Jerry: He's academically fine. I has problems like not finishing things (He successfully learned a new language up to a 6th grade level and quit) but I'm helping him work on that. He's in college now and I encourage him a lot but at the same time tell him about reality. His head can be in the clouds but he's a little more grounded now. I have a hard time having a conversation with him? I get so frustrated a lot. I feel like I'm baby sitting most of the time? But we get along when talking about geeky stuff.

454,"HEY , what is going on guys , im not really sure of the purpose and/or the result i look for by making this post , i guess i wanna get stuff off my chest and get ur guys input , maybe has some insight . 

I'm sorta  in a bad place emotionally especially since we recently moved ( 2 months ago) to a new place after a friendly separation between my mom and my stepfather after 8 years of living together ,  I  also in the last 3 months entered   
 the workforce , which i'm not bitchy about , i fully understand that is a natural course ,  i just feel , to put it bluntly  , fucked , since a high percentage of my income has to go twords upkeep on the new place and  rent  , i don't really feel fucked because i look at other people my age and see they have no such existential problems , i'm smart enough not to compare myself with others , also in the past  months i noticed just how few people i know and how lonely i suddenly became . The other thing that is taking me by storm is the amount of responsibility i suddenly have  , between making absolute sure that i have a steady income and the amount of stuff a ""man"" has to do around the house , i feel my time has been cut from a fucktone of time free to 1-2 hours of alone time in  these 2 months .

I've been trying to find myself a girlfriend because i thought maybe it would help but  that did not help at all , actually it made it immensely worse since i've been fucked a few days ago  in that department too .

I'm not necessarily depressed i just feel depressed at the moment but i'm more then likely gradually slipping twords fully fledged depression and i really dont want that to happen , i admit i have thought of hurting myself but i dont think i would ever do that .",27Nov2018,1

I feel like alcohol/weed have gone from being helpful to being harmful. Not only am I doing it more often, but I am doing more of it each time. It started with ""just one hit"" and now it's an entire bowl. It used to be ""just one glass of wine"" and now it's a half bottle or more.

460,"Hi.

I've been offered an interview for a job a grade above me at another company.

I applied for the job as my fixed term contract is ending in March. Whilst my current place of work keeps telling me it would be made permanent, I've not had anything yet or any information and was getting anxious about job security.

I applied for this job as I barely met the criteria, it was close to home and a small pay rise. I sent my application and thought no more.

I've now been invited to interview. Thinking about this in more depth and looking at the job description there is NO WAY I am ready to do this. I have only been doing this senior role for a year and it would be a step up in a larger budget, team and responsibilities.

I just don't want to go. If I was offered this permanent job where I am I would stay as I am really happy here...

Help!

462,"Keep in mind that I don’t want to come off like I’m being pretentious and I’m not trying to humble brag. I apologize if any of this sounds like it. 

I’ve had this friend for ~10 years now. I’ll call him Ben. We dated briefly back when we were like 13 over the internet and it was nothing special, literally we were just friends who did nothing more than say “I love you” from time to time. We broke up because dating online at 13 was pretty hard back in the day. Fast forward to recently. I’m dating my current boyfriend and have been for a couple of years now. Over the last 3 years Ben and I have gotten to be better friends. I have absolutely no feelings for Ben, and haven’t since we dated when we were 13. Even back then I couldn’t really tell you if I liked him anymore than a really good friend either, since our relationship was pretty much no different from our friendship in my eyes. 

Here’s something I’ve always found kind of strange. Ben has no friends, and when I say no friends, I mean I am the only person he talks to. He has no acquaintances he’s talked to in nearly 6 years, and his only friends are friends of mine. I know some people like their circles small... but correct me if I’m wrong. Absolutely no friends from high school or acquaintances that he checks in on every once in awhile? Even the most anti-social people I know have at least a handful of friends they communicate with on and off. But I am legitimately his ONLY friend, and I mean that. And he goes out of his way to like, make sure he doesn’t have friends. I encourage him to strike up casual conversation with people, and he tells me he literally hates talking to people and has a standoffish attitude towards anyone that isn’t me, even if they’re friendly towards him, he has absolutely no interest no matter who they are. Maybe you can tell me if you think that’s normal, I’d appreciate it. I feel like maybe I’m being too critical but I just think it’s really weird.

I digress, 2 years ago I met Ben in person. His mom offered to fly me out to where he lives for his birthday.  Another one of my friends pointed out how weird his behavior towards me is and how he constantly follows me around like a sick puppy, and everyone I know thinks were secretly dating or something? And we are definitely not. I do not like him more than a friend and I was convinced he felt the same way because we’ve had many conversations about it. I frequently try to make it very clear that I want nothing more than a friendship with him and I’m positive that it will never be any other way, even if I was single. It literally makes me as uncomfortable as thinking about dating my brother. Gross. 

Well, he lied to me. A few months after we met he told me that when I visited his feelings for me got really bad and he really liked me. This made me really uncomfortable and made me not really want to be his friend, but it’s hard because I felt kind of selfish for not least trying to fix things. So I gave him another chance and he backed off. Since then, something similar has happened again. Where he said he has feelings for me but he’s trying to get over them, after convincing me that he was over it after our prior issues. I gave him another try, because again, he swore he doesn’t have feelings for me anymore. At this point I feel like I’m leading him on inadvertently or something, even though I make it very clear I do not (and will not) see him as anything more than a friend, ever. But he keeps begging me to be his friend after these slip ups, and swears he doesn’t like me more than a friend, but these random slip ups of him professing his feelings for me after he supposedly “got over me” keeps happening out of nowhere. It doesn’t feel good, it makes me feel like I’m leading him on and disrespecting my boyfriend by keeping contact with someone that might have feelings for me. Do you think it would be better for all of us if I just try to end this 10 year friendship, or am I just overthinking this completely? On one hand, you’d think he wouldn’t want to be my friend if he likes me, because he has to watch me be with someone else and that sounds like it’s way more effort than it’s worth for one person who doesn’t want you. On the other hand, every time I try to cut him out of my life after his slip ups, he makes other accounts to stalk/harass me, gets his mom to text me and beg him to be his friend again, he even went as far as harassing my friends. It just seems like so much... I’m really tired of being made out to be the “annoying girl who leads the poor innocent guy on” by everyone that knows about our friendship. Some of my friends have said things like that to me, and I don’t want to lead him on. I don’t want him to like me more than a friend, I gain nothing from it. It really sucks losing friends, which is why I haven’t just given up, but I’m tired of feeling this way. ",27Nov2018,1

465,"My father left me and my mom a month before my 4th birthday, and that was for the better. About a year afterwards, he somehow managed to find my mother and I’s address and sent us a letter and a package. The letter told me that my little sister had been born a week prior. He gave me her name and, lo and behold, he named her after a character on a television show. 

I have been actively searching for her for 10 years now. It’s been an impossible task— with her name, not knowing her middle name, not knowing her date of birth, not knowing where she was born, not knowing her mother’s name, etc..  I subscribed to countless genealogical societies and websites and still dug up nothing for years.

Last year I found her birth record, and for the first time I learned my sister’s birthday, I learned her middle name. I learned the state where she was born. I was elated. The years of searching for her, longing to meet her, longing to have a sibling, longing to know if we are similar in any way, if there is another person who kind of looks like me out there in this world, all felt like they could be realized just by finding out these minute details.

I went on a deep search through Facebook, seeing if I could find her anywhere. Nothing. Looked at school district websites to see if I could find her name on any page. Nothing. Did a see search of her full name. Nothing. I was becoming defeated. I was so close but so far. I gave up looking any farther for a few months because I just kept finding dead ends.

So far I know she is a 15 year old girl, born in the state next to mine. 

Last night I got the urge to look her up on Instagram. I knew it’d be an impossible task. There are thousands of Instagram accounts with her name. I clicked on the first two profiles and both were middle aged women from the east coast. I clicked on the third— a 15 year old girl from the town right next to the one I grew up in. Same first name, same middle name, same last name as my sister. 

I’m trembling and about in tears at this point. She looks like me, she talks about how much she loves her mom and how her mom is her hero (my mom, too, is the center and light of my life), she’s an incredible artist (I guess we got that gene from our dad), she likes the same music and media that I do, and her favorite animal is also an owl. 

I was so excited that I found her that I couldn’t contain myself. I ran to go tell my roommates, I called all my friends, I did a happy dance with my dog— but then a sinking feeling met me.

My father destroyed my life. The sexual, physical, and emotional abuse my mother and I saw was unimaginable. The last time I ever saw my father I was looking out the rear window of the car as my mom was speeding out of our driveway: there was my dad, standing on the front porch holding the shotgun that’s shooting through the back of our car. My life has been plagued with nothing but the darkest and most vivid memories of the near 4 years I spent with him. I’ve been in therapy my entire life because of this trauma (PTSD) and it determined a lot of what I did in my life until my mid teens. My entire family still has restraining orders on my father. The court deemed it unsafe for us to collect child support because he was so violent. 

My dad contacted me once more after he sent that letter. I was 15, and it shattered my life. It brought back traumas I had suppressed so deeply that I was unable to function for weeks. 

I’m afraid my sister has suffered the same abuse from my father. From what I gathered from her Instagram, she’s estranged from our dad and his family just as I am. His entire family is violently dangerous. My grandmother and aunt have tried to kidnap me on multiple occasions. She looks like a happy, normal girl. And at her age I was, too, for the most part, until my dad tried to contact me.

I know she knows I exist, but I haven’t the foggiest if she’d actually ever want to meet me. I don’t know if my dad damaged her as much as he did me. I don’t know if me being in her life would cause more harm than good. I want to see her, I want to foster a relationship with her, but I don’t want to cause her any harm. 

If I come in contact with her and she is in contact with any of our father’s family, I am directly putting my mother and I in grave danger. I’m putting my entire family in danger. We have spent the last 15 years of our lives hiding from this family, moving towns to get away from them, and as soon as they know where we are our life of comfort is over. 

I’m torn between breaking the years of solitude and searching and contacting her, but I’m terrified of the harm may arise from the situation.

Should I reach out to her? What should I tell her? How should I approach taking to her? What should I do? 


TL/DR 

After a decade of searching I found my little sister. We both share a terribly erratic and dangerous father. I’m afraid if I contact her that it could bring up similar traumas I went through at that age surrounding our dad. I have been looking and longing for her my whole life. Do I reach out? How do I reach out?

I lost my virginity to my boyfriend a few months ago. I had never done anything sexual with anyone prior to him (I’m 20). But I made sure to get him tested before engaging in sexual acts with him. HPV was my main concern because my mom hadn’t gotten me vaccinated for it when I was younger. Being older now, I hadn’t thought to get vaccinated since I wasn’t sexually active, and when my boyfriend’s results for everything came out negative, we got right to it. I didn’t see the need in rushing for an hpv vaccination if my boyfriend was negative. 

But little did I know, men have no way of getting tested for HPV. I feel stupid for having not known that. I have a bump or two down there that have only come up recently, and I can’t tell if they’re warts or pimples (sometimes I get pimples). But needless to say, I’m freaking the hell out and will hopefully be seeing my doctor this week.

475,"I recently found out that I do not like my major one bit. Ever since the beginning of high-school I said I wanted to study physics because it was my favourite topic of the ones we had (we choose a program in high-school which has different subjects related to each other, mine was science) and therefore I applied to University in the UK which has a well renowned physics course as it is a part of the Russell Group. It felt like sheer luck that they accepted me. 

However, I’ve now been in this course for nearly two months and I absolutely hate it. I don’t believe that I can stand another two years, AND the full academic year of a research project at the end of it. I’ve been falling behind in my subjects as I cannot find any inspiration for doing them. I’ve been missing classes more often and I’m definitely slipping behind. I’m starting to believe that my interest in physics was nothing more of a sham, as I thought it would leave me with opportunities in other areas than physics after graduation if I didn’t like it. However, I never took into account the amount of psychological strain studying a subject you don’t like would be on me. 

I’ve recently found an interest in having a start-up, and anything related to businesses in general. It’s something that I have obsessed with for weeks and I’ve spent entire days devoting time into all different types of ideas and research around starting a business. I had this slight obsession during high-school, but I was never properly exposed to it, and felt very shy about my ideas and aspirations. It is however very risky to just hop off University without a plan B, especially with just a high-school diploma. Ontop of all that, my girlfriend who’s from the UK, has worked her ass off to try and get into the same school as I am, and I feel like I’ve let her down so much, especially as she has crammed in two years worth of schooling in a couple of months in the hopes of joining the same University next year (two year age difference). I feel like I’ve let her down so much by this sudden change of mind on this possible naive obsession of mine. I’ve talked to her about this and she’s open to any solution that would fit us in this situation. Luckily she hasn’t had her final exams yet (she has done her studies online the past few months). 

I need advice on what to do from here. Should I take a couple of years to cool off, work near the area where my girlfriend lives, what University degree is there that I could apply to (considering I took science related subjects in another country and not A-levels) that would fit me? This has put me through immense amount of stress as I believe I’ll be seen as a failure to my tutors and everyone that looked up to me joining this University (especially my parents and the parents of my girlfriend). My next holiday is in December and is around a month long until the start of the next semester in January. Due to Brexit, my student-visa will no longer be valid (I’m an EU resident), and I'm not sure about the laws regarding a visa and how long it takes to apply to one, would I be able to legally reside in the UK with work for a couple of years?

476,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I apologize for the disorganization of my thoughts. Sort of a long story, so TLDR at the end.

I was dating a guy a little under 3 years ago who I thought I was in love with. To summarize, we only dated for a few months before he broke up with me in the midst of me struggling with depression over my future/career, saying that he didn’t want to be in a relationship with anyone and just wanted to hook up with people. My guess is that he pretty much used me/the relationship for sex (we were FWB before becoming official); I was always there, and I was convenient, and throughout the relationship he was always pressuring me to have sex with him. So when the relationship started to get too emotionally heavy/serious for him, I imagine he felt like it was going beyond what he wanted to put into it and get out of it, so he didn’t want it anymore. 

Through therapy and all I’d come to learn that I was sort of using him to fill a void, too (at that point I hadn’t been in a relationship for ~3.5 years) but he was/is a piece of shit and terrible human being (for more reasons than explained here). I ended up having to see him a few times post-breakup because we had mutual friends, but I had no feelings or compassion left for him. I’ve since blocked him from all of my social media and have dated other people after him.

Anyway, about a year ago I was reflecting on the relationship and remembered something he did when we were still dating that made me REALLY uncomfortable and confused. 

***
[Possible trigger warning so scroll ahead to skip] 
One day, I was feeling really low and he tried pressuring me into having sex. I said no, told him that I was tired and upset, and wanted to go to sleep. I think (but am not totally sure - I can’t recall clearly) that I made a joke and said “just do it yourself” and laid down and went to sleep next to him (spooning). I ended up falling asleep pretty quickly but waking up moments later (I am a pretty light sleeper) to the feeling of something slippery on my back. I reached back with my had and touched it, realized what it was, got up, turned the light on, and found him holding his member. I realized what he’d done and didn’t really know how to interpret it - all I said was “what the fuck” before going to clean myself off. I can’t remember if I stayed at his place or if I ended up going home after that,  but I know he never ended up saying anything at all about what he’d done and kind of just looked at me guiltily before I went to clean myself. 
***

I don’t think I confronted him about it in that moment, probably because I was so confused and didn’t know how to process it. To be honest, I also kind of thought it was partly my fault because I (think?) I made a joke telling him to just take care of himself - giving him permission. I also thought it was “okay” and not something to make a big deal about because, well, he was my boyfriend - and you’re supposed to be safe with partners, right? Obviously I now know that always the case - I was young and naive back then. 

Anyway, as the #MeToo movement was gaining momentum, I couldn’t help but think about it after hearing the stories of so many other women. I ended up telling my best friend about it, and asked her what she thought. I prefaced by saying “I am not sure if this is considered a sexual assault because it’s nowhere as bad or violent as what other people have experienced.” She responded saying that sexual assault should be defined by my own parameters, and it doesn’t matter if my experience doesn’t completely line up with someone else’s, or if doesn’t fit some other person’s definition - I didn’t consent to it, and it made me feel uncomfortable so yes, it is a sexual assault. 

I ended up crying because this was the first time I was acknowledging the experience as a sexual assault. I felt so violated, scared, and disgusted that it happened to me and I didn’t know what to do. I think I told one of my therapists about it before but I’d decided that I didn’t ever want to confront him about it or press charges of any kind (I don’t even know if I could if I wanted to) because given how narcissistic and immature he is, he would probably argue against me and tell me I’m wrong - and, it would just bring me a lot of unwanted attention. 

In my most recent relationship, I saw the experience starting to manifest in different ways. Several months ago, I started getting very depressed (for seemingly unrelated reasons?) and lost interest in sex. This got worse after listening to the Ford/Kavanaugh hearings - I ended up feeling repulsed by anything remotely sexual because I was again reminded of this experience I had, so I ended up turning down all of my partner’s advances. I’ve told this partner about the experience briefly once, but I wasn’t sure if he wanted to hear more about it or not, so I didn’t end up telling him in full detail. I was also overwhelmed with the guilt of being affected by a previous relationship and my projecting these feelings onto my new partner, because he was such a sweet, gentle, and genuinely caring person - so I kept this from him thinking that I would hurt him if I made him feel like he was being compared to or had to involuntarily suffer the consequences of my experience with my horrible ex. 

Anyway, my most recent relationship sadly ended for a number of reasons that were honestly out of my control. As I am mourning this one, I am reflecting on what I could’ve done better, and the communication piece I referenced above was definitely something that came to mind. But when I thought more about why I had such difficulty communicating the assault and it’s impact on me, I realized that it is just so painful and I still feel so disgusted that I don’t even know how to externalize it without having a meltdown. I don’t even know how to begin to talk about it verbally (it is much easier typing it) because it is so scary to talk about, and verbalizing it would make it even more real. 

I have a new therapist now, and intend to bring this up again, but I feel like there is something more I could be doing to help me get over or accept that this has happened to me - without having the lingering trauma of the experience affect my relationships or even my day-to-day life. What can I do if I don’t want to confront the perpetrator or press charges? Or, is it necessary for me to confront him/is that something I *should* consider doing? 

TLDR: realized relatively recently that an ex sexually assaulted me. Don’t want to confront him or press charges, but don’t know what else I can do. It has been weighing heavily on my mind and has affected my behavior in my most recent relationship - specifically, on occasion when I remember the incident, I will be repulsed by anything sexual - even lighthearted jokes.",27Nov2018,1
477,"I'm 24, graduated uni 2 years ago in May, and by some miracle I was able to find a job in my field back in April. The only catch is that I don't like the job--more specifically, I don't like the people I have to work with to the point where they suck all the remaining fun of the job. Meanwhile, I've been living at my parents place while working. My parents are manipulative, emotionally abusive, textbook narcissists--suffice to say, I don't like them and they don't like me. But I've been willing to put up with all this a while longer in hopes that I'll save up enough money to move out. More specifically, my bf lives 1500+ miles away, in Massachusetts (where I lived until I graduated). My plan is to move back there. 

Recently, things have been especially bleak at work and at home, and with incredible timing I got a call yesterday for a dream job offer in California that I'd applied for a while ago. Well, they want to hire me but they want me there in 3 weeks--VERY soon. They offered to pay for my plane ticket up there, they offered to help me find a place to stay, and the pay is great. I'm just at odds with myself over whether or not I should take the job. It's a dream job, for sure, but it puts my farther away from my bf, will massively delay my moving to MA, and I've never been to CA nor do I know anyone there. Plus, I have no idea what kind of housing they'll put me in and it sounds like I'll have very little say in the matter. What do you think I should do?",27Nov2018,1
478,"18F with a serious issue. I've never met or spoken to my father, but as a struggling college student, I found him on Facebook, friended him, started talking to him, and asked for money. He has agreed to help me, but in a rather peculiar way. He says because he lives in Brazil, there is only one easy way to get money to me here in the US. He said he would go to his bank and take out a credit card, in my name, and mail it to me, but he needs my birth certificate. I would like to emphasize that I don't know my dad from Adam's cat, so I don't know how trustworthy he is. 

I don't know if he really needs my birth certificate to get me a card, or if he is just planning to sell my information. The last thing I want is to be a victim of identity fraud- I can barely afford TV dinners, let alone lawyers to reverse whatever damage comes with getting my identity stolen. 

I suggested PayPal and Venmo, to which he responded would not work, since neither of those platforms work with banks in Brazil (which I researched and turns out to be true). 

What would you do in this situation? Does this sound like a trap or is it reasonable?",27Nov2018,1

482,"I'm 22[M] and my so is 25[F]. Before I get into this, just know this is a lot so I apologise if this is all over the place. A little background about each of us - I'm an undergraduate student and part time worker and she's a PhD student and full time worker. We're both kind of awkward people, and I've been dealing with depression and I'm very self conscious. Idk if this plays into this at all but anyways...


I met my -now- girlfriend at a club. It was her birthday and I was getting surgery in a few weeks - let's just say we were feeling ourselves. Things went well, we danced and talked as much as you can in a club. Then we're leaving the club and going to go back to her place but her brother was visiting and had her keys and she couldn't find him or get a hold of him on her phone. 

So, we went back to my place. She was playing with my cat and then I saw her go on her phone - she was on bumble. I said wtf are you kidding me, and she said sorry and put her phone away. We had sex that night and then she left in the morning because she had to leave early to catch a flight for a work conference in the morning. Turns out her flight got cancelled, and also on that night her brother had sex with her friend who has a boyfriend. 

We met up again a week later and got drinks and talked. It was a lot of fun and then we went back to her place and did the deed again. A week later I texted her later at the night on the weekend when I was out with my friends but we didn't hang out later that night. Another week passes and I get surgery on my knee. We continue to text and talking to her really got me through some shitty days where I couldn't do anything due to my surgery. Two weeks pass and I'm back in the city and she knows this because were still texting. One weekend after I got back I got food posioning and couldn't hang out with her. The next week I broke my phone. I know, it's two really shitty excuses from her end, but it was the truth. 

It wasn't until Friday until I got my phone fixed and I texted her to hangout. It wasn't until later in the night because I didn't get home from work until 6 and had to repair the phone myself. She was out with friends but said she'd come over. She came over drunk and it seemed like she only wanted to have sex. We hungout almost every weekend after this. One time I invited her for a sports game with my work and she came. Afterwards I was saying that I was meeting up with friends and she got really upset and said she was worried I was hooking up with other girls. I told her I wasn't which was true and she said that she hadn't hooked up with another guy since we met that first night. We both agreed to be exclusive so that was that. We were exclusive like this for a couple months and then she told me she was worried why i didn't want to make things official. I told her I needed time, and she freaked out thinking I didn't want anything to do with her. I reassured her that that was not true and that I just needed to take my time. It was a few years since I had been in a relationship and it didn't end very well. She seemed like she understood, and things kept going well, so we emailed became official. 

A week after that she told me that between the time I went to get my surgery and we hung out again that she had been on dates with two guys. This obviously didn't make me feel good but she told me she only got drinks with them and she never did anything with them or saw them ever again. She also said part of the reason she went on them was because she thought I was using her/ghosted her. (Since I texted her later one night and when my phone was broken for a week). I got over this but recently she was showing me her agenda/journal and I reached one page and she freaked out and pulled it out of my hands. This obviously made me suspicious because it was during the time when she went to get drinks with those two guys. She told me it was embarrassing because it was stuff she was thankful for and she didn't feel comfortable sharing that with me.

I'm not proud of this, but a couple days later she was in the shower and I looked through the agenda again. She wrote she was thankful for going on dates with nice guys. My blood pressure rose. She made these dates seem like they meant nothing but that completely changed it. I was conflicted, however, because I dug up something I wasn't supposed to and she was off to work once she got out of the shower. I didn't bring it up, but it continued to eat away at me at the most random times. 

I finally brought it up weeks later when I was talking to her over the phone. She said that this happened during the time when my phone broke, and this made my blood pressure raise even more. She told me nothing happened during this time. I told her that, and she said she forgot to tell me that she went and got drinks with a third guy, but it meant nothing and nothing happened. I was obviously hurt but so was she because I went behind her back, but she was laughing when she was talking to me about this so it made me more mad. 

I obviously understand that it seems like I had ghosted her, but given my living situation, the fact I was on crutches, and had a broken phone, made me feel upset because I know she wasn't right in assuming I had ghosted her. I don't know whether I can trust her since this story has changed and she's the kind of person to say things just to make me feel better. I know she's not a slut either, having sex on the first night after meeting at a club like that was out of character for the both of us. She said it wouldn't have happened either if we would have went to her place. It just seems like she's closing off certain things from me to make me happy, but Im the kind of person who likes to hear the truth. I don't know what to do. ",27Nov2018,1

487,"I am a manager at a restaurant that has four locations, and every year we gather for a painfully awkward Christmas party. No one from the other stores know each other, and the event winds up very cliquey and if not awkward. It appears that this year, the owners want to have an “awards show” in the style of the Dundies from The Office. There is not going to be an open bar or gift giving. 

Is it wrong to throw a separate party at the same time as the other one? We are in a really busy restaurant and my store doesn’t ever have the opportunity to get together as a group. We are finally given the chance to be off simultaneously and I wanted to do something special for my staff, as the holidays are brutal to us and we could use a more loose event than a sarcastic award show and no alcohol.",27Nov2018,1
488,"In my office, we're separated into quadrants/areas, and every area has a supervisor. There are around 5-7 people per area. Around the holidays, every supervisor is expected to take his/her area out to lunch and pay for everything. Most areas also have a gift exchange, where they all go in on a gift for the supervisor, and sometimes the sup buys something for each person. 

Last year, my boss didn't want any gifts from us, but he did take us out to lunch. He had us pick the restaurant, and didn't make any fuss about how expensive any of our suggestions were, but we were mindful of that. We settled on a nice place, and he did comment that we ""took it easy on him"" when he got the bill. I've heard stories about other people in the office who are famous for ordering the most expensive thing they can find on the menu, just because the boss is paying. None of us did that, though. 

I don't know why, but I felt a little uncomfortable with him having to buy us lunch, especially since he didn't want any gifts. This year, I mentioned that I didn't want to go along on the lunch because I was uncomfortable. I explained why.  A couple of my colleagues (also in my quadrant) understand, but my boss is insisting that I go. So far, it's been ""friendly"" urging. He said that the point is that it's a lunch to thank us for our hard work throughout the year. I told him that a positive performance review and approval of my pay raise was sufficient. And the tone here was also friendly and joking, just to clarify. My boss and I have a pretty good relationship. But I did let him know that I was serious about not wanting to go. 

I don't plan on making a grand announcement to anyone in the office about why I won't be going. I plan to either take that day off, or just find myself conveniently working out in the field that afternoon. So, in case he's concerned that word will get around that he didn't take one of his people along and it will make him look bad, that won't be a problem. 

I know, I know... It's a free lunch. What the hell am I complaining about? Total first-world problem. 

 I'm just curious about other people's opinions. Am I being an unnecessary pain in the ass? Or would you also feel uncomfortable in the situation? ",27Nov2018,1

I used to play rainbow six siege with some pals and I'm in a group chat with them in snapchat. one of them took a picture of their class and captioned it, *""If we shoot up the school now they'll have no comms #12billionIQplays.""* and being stupid and having poor judgement I reposted it because I understood it was satire and of course I wasn't going to harm anyone, it was just a poor taste in a joke. but someone saw the post and told the school who told the police. And the police took my phone to do forensics on it and I had a bunch of cursed images and weird memes so they probably thought I was mental or something. The school made me get a mental health evaluation and forced me to be homebound because they thought I was ""high risk"" and shouldn't be at school. I went to a doctor to explain that and get the mental health evaluation and I was talked to by 2 physicians assistants, a psychiatrist and some other MD dude. And a nurse had to stay in the room with me to assure that I wasn't going to hurt myself or others, (And I wasn't.) And all the medical professionals understood and they were saying things like, ""we understand your situation and we know that there's nothing wrong with you but you're probably going to reap the whirlwind for this but we wish you luck.""

504,"Sorry for the long read (first post) So I (16f) have an older sister (18) who just started college in a different state in September.  She’s had a very long history of severe social anxiety and depression, and didn’t attend high school (public school, online, and homeschool all didn’t work) but somehow we managed to get her into a great college that is perfect for her. 

She stayed there for 3 months, and seemed to be doing great. When she lived at home, she never left the house, slept most of the day and never talked to anyone besides our parents.

She came back for thanksgiving, retracted into her old ways, and then started crying and refused to leave the house to go to the airport. My mom rescheduled many times, same thing happened. My parents have been extremely understanding and supportive, and have tried almost everything to get her motivated and go back to school (she only has 2 weeks left in the semester anyway).

Numerous doctors, tutors, and therapist appointments have been scheduled for her, and she agrees to them, but then backs out at the last minute. She is also on a very strict vegan diet, barely eating throughout the day and causing her to be extremely thin and malnourished. 

This has been very impactful for the rest of my family, and we all feel horrible about her, my mom and dad especially feel that they have failed as parents. She is depressed and miserable, and we want her to make progress but don’t feel that she can do that if she stays at home. 

Another thing, even if we get her back to college, how will she be able to come back for 3 weeks for winter break if she couldn’t even handle 3 days?

I have a few questions: 

1) What can we all do to help get her back to college and take advantage of her resources and opportunities? (therapy/other resources, medications, bribes, tough  love, rationalization all don’t work)

2) What can I do personally to support her? (she doesn’t like discussing anything personal about herself with me, and seems to not want to have anything to do with me)

It’s a close knit group of people, and I just feel like I’d be a third wheel/intruding. I’m on good terms with the past friends, but I am not a very outgoing person at all and I can see myself climbing into my shell and not knowing what to do and I’d make things awkward.

523,"I (f22) am incredibly lucky to have found the love of my life (f20). We were friends for a few years, and then realized we'd been slowly falling in love and got together two years ago. She is the most remarkable girl I've ever met. Brilliant, hilarious, gorgeous, thoughtful, strong, kind, gentle, goofy. In my heart, I have already married her.

A little backstory. We're in the US. I come from a household with a lot of mental illness--my mom and sister's suicide attempts were in the double digits by the time I turned 18, and my dad wasn't always around to help so I wound up in the caretaker role. My sister had serious developmental disorders and spent a lot of our adolescence in hospitals, often leaving my alone with my mom who was severely depressed. Supporting my mom could mean anything from sharing her bed when my dad moved out to cleaning up her wrists and helping her get to the hospital. This has in some ways made me very capable of extending myself for others, and in other ways made me terrified of being in that position. Many of my friends have picked up on the latter and have pigeonholed me as the person to talk them down off the cliff, so to speak. Over the years, I've had many people inside and outside my family call me to talk them out of suicide, or move in with me when they've been evicted, and I always think, ""I can't do this one more time. If I have to talk down one more person, I will die of heartbreak."" But then I get another call, and I talk them down, and I live on, and it's okay. 

When my partner and I got together, she was the first person who had ever really been there for me in that same way. It sounds dumb, but the moment I first really fell in love with her, I was dead tired after 36 hours with no sleep due to work, but I was eager to see her so I met up with her and some friends. Those friends were being really pushy about me traveling uptown with them (2 hours from my home) to party, and even guilting me about how they were really counting on me to help make a party happen. My partner saw how drained I was and she just stood up for me and made them lay off and lightly scolded them for being inconsiderate of how exhausted I was. I'd been in serious relationships before, but that was the moment I knew she was something different. It's small, but when she walked away, I just sat down and wept from how good it felt to be taken care of. 

I tell that story because I want to express how confident I am that this is a girl who would recreate the entire world to be how I want it if she could. She takes care of me in ways I didn't know I needed. And now, I'm in the position of taking care of her, and unlike all those other times, I want to do it, over and over, I want to be there for her. 

She has developed serious depression, anxiety, and post traumatic stress. Over the past 8-9 months, about half of our relationship, she's had depression so severe she often has catatonic episodes where she can't react or respond and can't even remember time passing. She has serious traumas in her past that very few people know about. Her friends don't even know she's depressed, they just see an act. But when it's just us, sometimes everything is normal and joyful for a week or so, and then weeks will go by where she can't smile or say a word. She believes this is just how she is going to spend the rest of her life. Crying all the time, canceling every plan, unable to feel hope or happiness most of the time. 

She is not in touch with her family and they are not supportive people. They do not believe in mental health, they think it's just strength or weakness. We are both students but her school won't do anything but offer to check her into an inpatient ward. Maybe she'll need that eventually, but right now she just needs a psychiatrist and a therapist. 

She has insurance but NO ONE takes it in our city. I've called at least 60 people all directly from the list her insurance company provided yet not one actually takes her plan. The insurance company itself says they can't provide an accurate list. I've spent hours on the phone with bluecross blueshield, hours on the phone with therapists and psychiatrists who can't or won't help. I am a student too and have limited money or no job but I would do anything to help her, if only I knew what to do. 

Sometimes she is willing to get help, and sometimes she feels too hopeless. If we were married, she could use my insurance and my doctors, and people might be willing to work with me more. Most people find out we aren't married and say they can't talk to me for confidentiality reasons, even though she has given me full permission to set things up on her behalf. She's just too depressed to do it herself. 

I am realistic about the possibility that we can't do this forever. There are times when I feel I can't do it for one more minute, but then I see her face and smell her hair and I feel I can do anything for her. I love her more than I can say. But even so, she is mostly alone in the world, and I can't let this beautiful person suffer like this without help. How is it possible that there is seemingly no recourse for a young person who needs help so badly?

Does anyone have any idea how to get urgent psychiatric care when the insurance company isn't helping, the school isn't helping, there are no adults or parents willing to help, and we have limited money? 

TLDR my partner is severely depressed and I have tried everything I can think of to get help, but her insurance is a failure and we can't afford OOP. Any ideas of what to try? ",27Nov2018,1

525,"Silly question, I know.

I used to wear makeup as a teen, dabbled a bit when I was older, then I was involved in a religious group that was highly against makeup and I haven't worn makeup in a very very long time. I have since left and I am needing to wear makeup after being invited to a holiday party at my spouse's work.

I don't want to look like I'm wearing a mask or anything with a lot of colors. Something natural but good coverage (I have facial redness scaring). 

What are good makeup brands that won't break me out? How do I find a good color match?

Do I use foundation then powder? My skin is combination. 

I want to wear eye shadow, but something very natural, do I need a primer for eye makeup if I don't wear a lot?

What is a good mascara? I need something that will lengthen my lashes that won't be clumpy or run if I cry (been an emotional wreck lately).

I have been using Burt's bees red Dahlia as a lipstick and I love the color, its so light and doesn't feel heavy or sticky. If you have a suggestion for good lip coverage, please share!!

I asked my spouse to take me to Sephora later and I was thinking about Dr. Jart bb cream. Has anyone tried this? I got a sample of bb cream in my sunscreen bag at Sephora and it seemed to do well with coverage with no breakouts.

I feel like I don't know where to start and don't want to look silly, I want to look minimal with good coverage. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!! I don't want to spend a lot of money, but if you know a product but is worth the price, I'd be willing to try it.

526,"I’ve been working at a cosmetic retail store for almost 3 years. I like to think that I am very good at what I do and that I am a reliable employee. A few months ago my boss called me to her office and asked if I would be interested in training to become a key holder. (A manger position). I enthusiastically said yes and was excited to begin my training. She said she would email our district manager and we would go from there. 

However she hadn’t brought it back up, and when I would bring it up to her she would deflect my question and would offhandedly say “Oh, I’m still waiting on the okay from our district manager” or some other excuse. I brought it up in four separate occasions only to be met with some kind of dismissing response. I continued to express my interest to grow in the company but nothing has come out of it. 

Then one of my coworkers was hired into the position. I was a little upset, but only because my boss didn’t give me the courtesy or telling me herself that someone else was getting the position, and I had to find out by overhearing it. All I want is some kind of constructive criticism about what I can do better but all I ever is “fluff” about how good I am doing. 

What should I do in this situation? I haven’t had to argue my worth before with a job and I am feeling a little less than confidant. I know what I want to say, but I don’t know how to go about saying it without her dismissing me again. I think I’m being too kind about it, however I don’t want to make her upset because she can be very petty. (She often cuts hours of employees who upset her). 

I love where I work and I love what I do. I don’t want to leave but I really need to grow in this company if this is what I want to make my career in. 

Any advice or experiences from any of you who have been through something like this before would be appreciated. I need to step up, but I have no idea how.",27Nov2018,1
527,"My family helped me out to pursue my studies abroad. They paid for everything and sponsored me for about 6 years. Thanks to them, I graduated and I am now working abroad making enough money for my frugal living and savings.

Where I live now, taxes take up a big chunk of your salary. But, the pay is decent so you can make ends meet. I also help my family by bringing in some money ($1.5-2.5k) 2-3 times per year. This helps them with their living and cover some of their debt.

Only a year ago I found out that we were in massive debt. During my studies, my family never discussed with me about the money and where it came from. I assumed they had a good plan in place. But it turns out that my family took a lot of loans with big interest to afford my tuition and allowance. Some of it also went to helping them when they didn't work.

Luckily, with my help and their refinancing, we don't have as much left to pay out. Despite their reluctance, I finally got from them the final figure of how much we have left to pay back to the bank. I was frustrated with some of their decisions but we discussed it and agreed to better manage money. Part of the agreement was that they stop taking out loans every year, especially for unnecessary things, such as a trip abroad. I stated a dedicated savings account to save money for repaying the debt. With my planning and help, I estimated we would be debt-free within 1.5 years max.

Recently, my mom asked me to buy her a new phone. I was happy to help since it would be a good XMas gift and this was also a good time due to the upcoming Black Friday. On the day I was going to buy a new phone for her, I gave her a call and found out that she had already bought the new iPhone X a few weeks ago. I was surprised she didn't tell me about it. But, what really shocked me was that she took out a loan with big interest to afford it. During Black Friday, when all prices go down, she took out a loan for 2 years to pay out iPhone X. I couldn't believe it and lost my temper. I told her that was a stupid mistake.

Since then we haven't talked. I plan on having another call with her to better understand what made her do that, what was she thinking and why she hadn't told me about that until I called her. This does sadden me. It's exactly same thing that happened a year ago, and, well, what has been happening over years now. Since my graduation, my family kept taking out loans for stupid things every year. And, this doesn't go away, despite any conversations we've had and the fact that we still owe considerable sum to the bank. Now, we have a new loan to cover. And, by the time that's done, they might get another one.

I get the impression my family is just digging a loan hole for themselves and I can't really help much here anymore. Especially since they get older and they are not as sharp as they used to be.

Please, let me know if you have any advice or experience with such situations. I really want to resolve this for once and improve the life for my family. But, it's really challenging when not everything depends just on me.",27Nov2018,1

530,"Hey all,

I need some advice and words of wisdom because I'm losing it here at work and not sure how to proceed. So basically I just got a new job 3 months ago with a really great accounting firm (I am a tax accountant). In addition, the job has great pay, however, the benefits are lacking a little. The firm has great oppurtunities for advancment and the managing partner told me he wants to groom me to become a partner one day. 

I'm at cross-roads here and not sure what to do. While the oppurtunities are great, work-life balance is pretty much non-existent. Its a typical 8-5 plus an hour commute each way, so in total I leave the house for 12 hours each day. The company does not have any remote work (although all my work can be done remotely) nor do they have flex hours or flextime. I'm really drained when I get home to the point where I don't feel like doing anything except relaxing till the next day starts. This however is restricting me from pursuing my other important professional goals such as getting my graduate degree and CPA license because I have no more time in the day and I'm exhausted by the end of it. 

I dont have any complaints about being busy and having enough work to keep me busy from 8-5 but the problem is we dont have any work to do and I'm pretty much expected to sit at the office and stare at the wall until something comes up. I feel chained to my desk and if I leave 15 minutes early I get in trouble (is this grade school, wtf?). So far this not having anything to do has been going on since October 15 with barely only about 3 hours at most of work throughout the whole week.

Honestly, I am not sure if I should stay with this company or look for something with a better work-life balance. Yes the partnership oppurtunity is very enticing but I don't want to wait another ten years and honestly I have plans of starting my own firm one day with ideas of how I can outperform many other companies in my industry. 

I'm worried if I look for new jobs now that I'll be viewed as a job hopper. When would be the best time to look for a new job? Should I leave this job? The most thing I like about this company is the oppurtunity that there is to learn and grow professionally but I'm losing my mind right now and cannot grow more professionaly because I don't have the time to study for my CPA and graduate degree.

531,"I'm an art teacher at a local high school.

Recently we had a ""free draw"" session (which wasn't graded because we had a shorter class period) and I was walking around checking to see how my students were doing, and one of them was drawing an animal that looked like a human (stood on two legs, looked very cute). I didn't say anything and just went on by. But what immediately came to mind was the term ""furry"", I had heard it being passed around the school sometimes but never really looked into it.

Now I'm interested. I like learning about new things that people like so I can understand people better, especially my students. Apparently after doing a bit of research, furry is someone who likes something called ""anthropomorphic"" animals (tongue twister, I know right) and likes dressing up as them. To me that sounds a bit fun actually!

But I also heard of some terms like ""yiff"", which is... furry sex/porn, to say the least. A bit weird, but teens will be teens, and I don't discriminate on what people like to do in their spare time as long as it isn't immoral.

535,"Recently I took an exam for a junior level engineering course and did not perform as well as I had wished too, a 51% to be exact. This was the case for most students though so the professor decided to allow test corrections to select students. I visited this professor during office hours and asked why I had not received the chance for test corrections on my exam. He said since I had done well on the first exam (94%) he would not be offering them to me because I was not in danger of failing the course. The 51% on exam two dropped my overall class average to a 72%, so ""not in danger"" is somewhat understandable and I left his office. I then contacted a few other students that had very similar grades to me and they were all offered test corrections. Including one student that got a 61% and a high A on the first exam. Now following the professor's rules for his own test corrections, this student should not have been given the chance either.

Fast forward over Thanksgiving break, I sent him an email explaining the situation in a professional manner. He then gives a speech to the entire class (doesn't respond to my email by the way) about being nice to those above you otherwise all ""negotiation terms are gone"" and ""you have burned a bridge"". All this was clearly targeting me. Yet with all the evidence I gave him of others receiving corrections that I deserve, according to his own rules, I did not get the option for corrections.

I am unsure of where to take this, should I elevate the issue to the Deans office? This is certainly a big deal for my grade and would like to at least be given a fair chance along with all other students to correct it.

544,"Not really sure how to word it, but i’m not as good with people as I once was. In my teen years, I was known as the class clown. I was a highly energetic extrovert that could speak with anyone about anything, mainly in a comedic tone. The only thing I found difficulty in was talking to girls I was attracted to, as they were the only ones that could make me feel shy. I got into my first and only serious relationship when I was 21. The relationship started well, but grew toxic and ended on a very bad note. It was bad enough for me that I needed to see a psychiatrist and I was prescribed with anti-depressants and anxiety reducing medications. This became a very dark time in my life, as I was constantly smoking weed, didn’t put any effort in anything, and just overall feeling down. It took over a year and a half, but I started to lose my thoughts and feelings towards her and was able to slowly find a rhythm of going to the gym and maintaining my school work. However, 2 years later, I feel like I still haven’t been able to get myself back to the person I was before my relationship. I have lost connection with some friends, I barely speak to my family, have 0 ability to casually speak with people, and have absolutely no capability of approaching women. I can barely look someone in the eyes for more than a few seconds. I either feel too shy or too good to speak to anyone, both of which I know to be horrible thoughts to have. Basically, I want to know how to regain my high level of energy and extroversion, if possible. ",27Nov2018,1

547,"I've known this girl for a couple of years now. We were never particularly close, but had a few mutual friends. This semester, we had a class together. We both dropped, but I needed another class to fill my schedule, so she said I should take the class she TA'd for, and I did. 


Over the last few months we actually started to get pretty close. Before I thought she was cold and bitchy, someone that slacked off and smoked tons of weed (not that I have a problem with that, it's just not what I look for in a girl). Instead, I found that she was the hardest working person I've ever met; she had almost the exact same sense of humor as I did; she came off as cold, but was extremely loyal and loving to her friends. I developed a crush on her, but didn't really think I had a shot; I mean, I'm not a slouch, but, given how great she was, I didn't feel as though I had much to offer her— and she was talking to another dude. I basically wrote it off. 


But then something changed over the last few weeks. Apparently she wasn't talking to that other dude anymore. And we just started talking more often. I helped her out with a lot of stuff she'd been stressing over. We went to lunch one day. We started texting for a few hours every few nights, then every night, then just texting all day.  More often than not, she'd text first. She loves music, and made me a 60+ song playlist of songs she liked because she thought I'd like them, too, and wanted to ""ease me into her music."" She hates basketball, but watched an entire game with me even though she had offers to do other things. She would tag me in stuff on social media. She always seemed really happy around me and laughed a lot more than anyone else at any dumb thing I said. I wasn't sold only because there'd been a lack of physical signals and body language cues, but I was feeling great about it. One night I got a text telling me that I had given her so much encouragement and support over the last few months, and that was something she didn't feel from anyone else. She also ended it with me being ""such a good friend."" Ouch. That kinda bugged me, especially because we'd just talked about how one of our mutual friends continually gets called friend and buddy by a girl that friendzoned him. But I didn't let it discourage me too much. I only wanted to be a bit more cautious.


Things were fine for the next few days, but I noticed she started texting less and less. She cut conversations short, often just stopping in the middle of something. She stopped texting first, and generally seemed disinterested of unenthusiastic— just off. Last Wednesday, I had gone to the club with some friends, and she knew that. She even texted me first just to randomly talk; I was thrilled tbh. I spent an hour or so just texting her about random stuff. But, again, she just disappeared. I sent her a ""Happy Thanksgiving"" text once it turned midnight, and didn't receive a response at all. Not even the next day. We've texted a bit since then, but it's only been so she could bitch to me about class or her stepmom or roommates. I saw her yesterday with some other friends, and she seemed very friendly, but more muted. She also went off on twitter about a dude and her loveless life, but I really don't think the subtweets were about me. I suspect she wasn't over the dude she'd been talking to in the beginning. 


I've just felt really discouraged. All my girl friends said they'd never talk to a dude as much as this girl did to me if they weren't interested, but they don't know why she dropped off. Did I just blow it by seeming too friendly and friendzone myself? Was I always just a friend? I'm not sure. 


I'm not sure what to do either. I still want to ask her out, but I feel like I'd get rejected. My friends tell me to try and hang out with her, but it's hard to hang out with her in person because she's so busy and goes home on weekends. I'm also graduating in 3 weeks, while she's starting grad school after this year, so I'll never really get the chance to see her, and I feel as though I've worn out  texting. If I ask her out I'm also worried it could fuck up the dynamics of our friend group which has grown very close of late. Anyway, sorry for the long post, I just have no idea what to do, and hoped a bunch of your voices could provide me with some advice. ",27Nov2018,1

551,"Hi all,

Why do I feel useless? 
I work 2 jobs, provide for my partner who is practically disables and provide for my 2 kids, both whom are at a young age (2+4)
 I work 40 hours at my main job plus between 9 and 12 hours at weekend nights at job 2.
 Not exactly financially stable but a lot better than a couple of years ago.  Just enough to get by without any major worries. A few debts here and there but they are slowly but surely being taken care of.
 So yesterday I got paid, and in a week or so will be getting some benefit payments too. I worked out with all the bills being paid I should have some spare income, which was thinking of saving. (My actual first thoughts were ""oh, I'll buy guitar bits or something"" but  decided to save for a rainy day or a new property (we rent) 
 So, instead of saving the cash or spending spree I actually cleared 2 debts of mine and 2 of my partners. It was somewhere along the lines of £350. Not a big amount by some standards but it's something. There's a lot more debt than that but it's manageable (payment plans etc)
 So as a 32 yr old male, who smokes, drinks not that often, helps around the house, barely an education, rubbish at diy, not great at cooking. Why do I feel useless for providing for my family?
 Is it depression? Existanal crisis? Midlife crisis? Season change? Any advice would help.

552,"Throw away account because yeah

I have been going back and forth on wether or not to report my ex’s parents for tax evasion. I’m not sure that my motivations are the best, and I’m not sure I could stand the guilt if it ruined their life as much as I think it will. 

When we were together my ex used to brag all the time about her parents not paying taxes. I’m not sure how true it was, but knowing her and then it seems highly likely. They run their own small business and take a lot of payments in cash which could help them avoid paying income tax. 

I’m torn between anger at my ex for what she did to me and frustration at her parents cheating the system. But on the other hand the penalties for tax evasion could be life ruining and I’m not sure I can stomach being responsible for that.

554," 

I (30'sF) stayed with my boyfriend (40's) this past weekend and Friday night we had a terrible, blow-out fight. Truly awful. Saturday morning came around and we were both still very much upset but he joined me in bed so we could talk.  Well our talk was not productive; it just reduced me to a sobbing mess.  I'm fuzzy about how it got to this point, but the next thing I remember is him kneeling in between my legs as he ripped off my pajama pants/undies and thrust himself inside me.  My whole body went limp and I was still sobbing; I couldn't utter a word/move/do anything.  He was rough and luckily it didn't take him long to finish.  At no point did I say I wanted to have sex, but I also never expressly told him to stop (couldn't speak).  When it was over, all he asked me was ""did you not want that?"", and I couldn't even respond.  I could only get up, take a shower and go on with the day.  

It didn't really register until later in the day what had happened and now, days later, I'm becoming more and more upset when I think about it.  I don't have anyone in my personal life I'd be comfortable talking about it with but I don't know what to do. ",27Nov2018,1
556,"Hi, Reddit. I’m very new to this whole app and it’s environment, so please excuse me if some things on here confuse me a bit. I’m a male, about to turn 19 in a little over a month. My issue is... I don’t know what to do next. My life is a mess and I need to figure out where I need to go.

For a bit of backstory, I graduated high school perfectly fine this year and was going on to a pretty nice college to major in Media Production and minor in Drama. While those are very strange things to go into, there’s a method to my madness. I have always wanted to ACT. I love putting on a character and becoming someone else just for the entertainment of others. I’ve always wanted to star in movies, video games, tv shows, etc. Voice act for them as well! Unfortunately, though, I wasn’t able to continue on to the college. I was accepted, got my meal plan all fixed, got myself a roommate, figured out my schedule, went to orientation, everything. But, a few weeks from my move-in date, I found out that I would have to be paying $1,500+ every month out-of-pocket to be able to continue going there, even with financial aid (I don’t come from a very... wealthy family). 

Sadly, I don’t exactly come from a family with a lot of help. My father has saved up $1,000 for me to use for college, and my mother had none. My financial aid didn’t cover all of it, and I was left with that fee every month. In other words, I would have to get a full time job to make the money to keep going to college, all while simultaneously only studying, doing homework, eating, or sleeping. I decided that there was no way that I was putting myself through all of that immediately, so I took a leap year to try and save up money and maybe figure out what to do next.

A few months later (now), and I have a job that I’m quite fond of. I work at a restaurant and I make about $9 an hour. While this may not nearly be what I need, it’s higher than what I used to be working for. I work Monday - Friday, 11:30 AM - 2:00 PM, but... it doesn’t necessarily work that way. I get to stay as long as the traffic keeps coming in. Once they start to trickle off, I’m cut and out of the restaurant, whether I want to be or not. I usually only get about an hour shift in and then I’m done for the day. I’ve asked for more hours multiple times, but we just have too many people who need hours as well. As you can probably guess, it’s not doing very well for me financially. It’s gotten to the point where I donate my plasma now to pay my phone bill and my gas, as well as a few other little things.

I’ve thought many times about getting another job on top of this one I have as well, but I cannot work weekends... as that is the only time I ever get to see the love of my life who lives over 2 hours away. So, that would mean I would either have to double up during the weekdays, or leave this job for a different one. 

So this is where I need help, guys. I don’t know what to do. I have a few different options but I don’t know how to make sense of them. My mother and father are both pushing me in different directions because they both have different agendas, but I don’t want to do either of what they are telling me.  My mother wants me to get a factory job and work full time like her and do a different college online, (Gen Eds), until I can get into my college again. My father wants me to go to firefighter school and become one of those, and then take acting classes as a side hobby. (He doesn’t believe I can do anything with myself in that department.)

But, I really, REALLY want to be an actor. I will not let myself fall short of greatness and become as depressed and monotonous as my parents have become. I live basically by myself in an apartment where I have to get out of in two months. I need to make a decision on what I’m going to do with myself before I move. What do I do, ladies and gentlemen?

TL;DR I have multiple different paths that I can take, I want to be an actor and figure out how to start going down that road. My mother wants me to be a full-time worker and just work my life away. My father wants me to be a firefighter and take acting as a side hobby. I have to move out of my apartment in two months and wherever I’m moving to next is going to depend on the decision I make.

558,"I (25M) am currently studying to become an IT technician at a university here in Sweden. It has proven to be more difficult for me than I thought, due to more math (electricity studies, script programming and networks, which means alot of numbers) than I expected. Math is my achilles heel when it comes to academics. Which has led me to consider if it’s the right career path for me. I choose it after I prematurely ended my previous studies in business/sales due to increased anxiety, and I just couldn’t handle it anymore. And I also have a interest in technology and computers (at least when it comes to using them) and I want a career where I can get a steady and future proof job. 

Before all of that I worked in the industry and in sales. I’ve been in warehouses, car shops, enough places to realize I want something else. 
I also have my own company. A production company of sorts. I made a podcast, as everyone else these days, that I hosted and edited all by my lonesome which I then retired when I got offered to produce and edit a new podcast for someone else. I still do that as a side business. Not enough to make a living. I like it. I like being creative. I guess that’s where my true core is. 
I’m not sure if I will end my studies, mainly because I don’t know what else to do, it seems like a good and chill career path and I don’t want to be the quitter who left the university twice. 

My biggest interest is films. I’ve had this idea in the back of my head to start a youtube channel and do comedy sketches (but making a living of youtube isn’t really realistic) and/or study film but sweden isn’t exactly hollywood so jobs in that field are scarce. But again I keep coming back to creative jobs.  Keep in mind that I have the creative part of my career on my freetime, and who knows what that will lead to, but I want something that I can fall back on.

560,"first off, im on mobile and im incredibly sleep deprived so excuse all the mistakes and typos. this is quite a confusing story but I'll try to simplify it as much as I can.

I had a friend when I was a little kid who I was best mates with for years. we'll call her (a). we'd do everything together and we were really close. long story short, in year 4 we had a massive falling out, bigger than most fall outs most little kids have. in year 5 we became friends again to a point, we could tolerate each other but we weren't as close as we used to be. later, in year 6, we had another argument. I can't even remember what it was about. it wasn't as bad but it meant we weren't on good terms going into secondary school.

during the first 2 years of secondary, we didn't talk to each other at all. we were in different forms and she had a B timetable and I had an A timetable, basically meaning we always had different classes. the only time i heard anything about her was when a close friend of mine at the time had gone on a residential trip in the same group as her. for some reason the conversation turned to my mental health (i have no idea how or why, and even if the later reaction from (a) hadn't happened, i would still be pissed about this topic being brought up anways). (a) said that I was making it up for attention, that I didn't have anxiety or depression, and I should just get over it. needless to say, I was annoyed.

later, in year 9 one of my friends, we'll call her (L), got really close to her. they became best friends. that meant (a) became a part of the friendship group. I was fine with this as long as she didn't cause drama. unfortunately, that was a big ask for (a). she would basically ignore me entirely, icing me out from the rest of the group and I would just sit there, completely silent. on the rare occasions I did say something, she would belittle me and make fun of what I was saying. it was horrible.

on one occasion, me and a friend we're walking around on our own, away from the group for whatever reason. the group was all together though, as usual, including (a). a friend informed me, when break had ended, that (a) had been, basically, talking shit about me. someone had outed me to her and she decided to say I was attention seeking and making it up. the only person who would listen to me about the issue was my friend (c).

another long story short, (L) and (a) had an argument and fell out. it's worth noting that at this point i couldn't go to school anymore for mental health reasons, so I was very much excluded from the group and only three people, (L) and (C) being two of them, still talked to me. about an hour ago, I found out that (c) and (a) are now best friends. I feel betrayed. this person has been making my life hell for so long.

I feel like I'm being over dramatic, that this is just petty teenage drama, but I usually don't get worked up about this thing. all the teachers at my school say that our friendship group is the best in the year, that it's supportive and mature. however, since (a) has come into the equation, it's toxic, exclusionary, and has such a clique-y feel to it. I never would've thought I'd be saying this about my friends but, it's true.",27Nov2018,1
561,"Hey Reddit, this is my first ever reddit post so I am not sure how this works. Please bear with me

I broke up with my long-term boyfriend (I’ll use the name Jordon as a fake name so it’s easier) a month ago, and I want to continue the relationship, but he claims he doesn’t love me anymore. I’ll explain everything below.

Jordon (20) and I (20) dated for two years. We met in April of 2016 and quickly became best friends. By November of 2016, he had flown out to ask me to be his girlfriend in person. We lived in different states and had met through mutual friends. He didn’t want to ask me to be his girlfriend over the internet or texting, so he planned a trip.

Because we were best friends, we already knew a ton about each other, and we just clicked. We told each other everything, did everything together. We went through the first six months of our relationship long distance, and then that summer I moved up to where he was (I happened to be going to college near where he lived, so I got a job there and moved to school a few months early). When the school year started we were back to long distance again, but it was less of a distance. I ended up not liking my college much, so I transferred schools, and we have been near each other since this past January.

We had our fights like normal couples, but we prided ourselves in being able to work through anything because we were such a good team and had amazing communication. We had a really amazing relationship overall, and everyone that’s been around us can vouch for that. This summer was a bit rough on us because I had to work A LOT to be able to afford the higher tuition of this new school, but we made it through.

Then, in August, a bunch of things happened in Jordon’s personal life, and he began suffering from what my therapist said is just an identity crisis. He claimed he didn’t know who he was anymore and he wasn’t sure what he wanted in life. He asked me for some space. I wasn’t upset and said that we could take a break for him to clear his mind if we wanted. We agreed on one week to test the waters, and agreed that it could be longer if necessary. We also agreed that even though our relationship was on break, since we are in the same friend group we would still hang out with our friends. Everything was going great with the break until one night, four of us decided to walk to a McDonalds after a football game and I got physically assaulted by a drunk person on the street. After that, Jordon seemed to go back to normal and said that he wanted to continue our relationship, so we disbanded the break and continued onward.

As weeks went by, I could feel him pulling further away. I knew he was still struggling with his identity issue, so I was still giving him space, but we were still in our relationship and went on dates and stuff. Then, he started becoming very annoyed with me. He would constantly snap at me and be rude when I was trying to be cute and cuddly like we always were. Even our friends noticed this change, and it was very unlike him. Right now he is a completely different person from who he was when we first met (of course people change over time, but this is like night and day). I kept trying to keep the communication going and tell him how he was making me feel, but he would just ignore me. I didn’t know what else to do, so I broke up with him.

After we broke up, Jordon told me that he had really been struggling with his identity still and wasn’t sure what he wanted anymore. He told me that he didn’t know if he wanted to be with me anymore, but he was going to really think about it and maybe we could come back together in the future. 

Since discussing this, he’s shown a lot of mixed signals on whether or not he wants to be with me (I can provide examples if need be), and we’ve also made love 3 times. Each time that we’d made love he was being all romantic and loving, including this last time (2 days ago), until afterwards I asked him how he was doing and he got all cold and told me he doesn’t love me anymore/doesn’t feel the same way anymore. He also keeps saying things like “AT THIS TIME I don’t want a relationship with you, so I won’t be pursuing that,” which confuses me. Is he leading me on?

I’m upset because Jordon is the best guy I’ve ever dated, and he was my longest relationship. I genuinely thought that we were going to get married after college, because we’d discussed it and we said we both wanted to. We were so in love, and we didn’t even break up over a bad thing. I really want to continue the relationship, so I am giving him his space (he wants to be friends) and just kind of sitting here with a broken heart.

I know that there are some things about myself I have to work on. I’m always looking to improve myself and make myself a better person, so I am trying to focus on those things. What I need advice on is what to do about this man in my life that I love who’s acting so weird and confusing. I think the reason I am having trouble is because I still see glimpses of the wonderful man I love within the cold shell that he’s put himself in. Also, he has not only shut me out of his life, but literally everyone he cares about including his parents and other close friends. He won’t talk to anyone about any of this. He’s always been quiet, but he would at least talk about how he’s feeling to me and his mom, but he won’t even talk to his mom.

562,"Hi I'm sorta new to reddit so i apologize if I mess anything up... 

Anyway, I'm [16m] currently a sophomore in high school and I'm sort of in a weird situation so bare with me. 
I've talked to my parents and here's what they think about me leaving school. 

-my dad thinks it's okay to ""dropout"" as long as I'm doing something productive with my life. 
-my mom disagrees and thinks I need to stay in school for whatever reason she has. 


Now, I'm not failing, I'm a C+/B- student so it's not that I don't do the work but I kind of see no reason to continue school.
I make music (beats) which pays pretty well for me and I work at Walmart after school just to get out the house and for the extra money. I do smoke weed but I'm not into drinking/partying that sort of stuff. I'm a relatively good kid and music is something that I'm really passionate about, this is the main reason why I am questioning school.

I know that I won't have the practical 9-5 job or whatever because I constantly talk about my future and I know what I want to do. I don't think that school is going to help me in any way that I think I need it. I know that I can just continue my last 2 1/2 years but I just don't see the point. I recently realized that I could care less about what the school is ""teaching"" me as I know what my career path will be. 

So what do you guys think I should do? I might come of as an ignorant teen just complaining, but I'm really stumped. I'm sorry if this was a waste of your time. I don't know what to do about school but I know what I am going to do outside of it. I'm not sure if you have any advice for me but I'd appreciate it you had something to say.

564,"I'm 20 years old (I recently turned 20 this September) and I look like I'm 13/14. I've been getting these comments for YEARS and while they aren't directed towards me negatively, it's just that I'm tired of hearing people be surprised when I say that I'm older than them and they look at me like ""wtf??"". 

It doesn't help that I'm also pretty short (I'm 4'12"") and pretty petite (I'm pretty flat chested with little ass lol) and while I do personally like the way I look, I just wish I was able to look...older as well? Like, I 'm fine with my shape and I don't see anything wrong with my height, but I wish that I was able to ""appear"" at least older to other people. 

I don't really know how to look more mature. I've seen people talking about dressing more mature and I have been working on my fashion sense, and I'm willing to try makeup. 

Does anyone else have this problem and if so what steps did you take to 'solve' the situation or at least make it better for yourself?

(Also, I tend to ramble in my posts, but I'm willing to explain my situation further if anyone is confused).   ",27Nov2018,1
565,"Hello internet. I’m about to graduate with a degree in political science but I’m having a hard time getting a job. Right now, I work in a really popular restaurant in a big city, so I meet a lot of professionals in my field. While I don’t have any political experience, I have worked as a secretary for my dad (lawyer). Is there a way I could market myself on a business card without looking like a total idiot? Maybe some kind of mini resume? ",27Nov2018,1
566,"I met this woman once. Once and I already know I never want to be in the same room as her again. 

**Now I know what you all are thinking (WTF who do you think you are trying to diagnose this woman without any credentials??) while I don't have any I am a Senior psychology major who is an assistant in a research group and is currently applying to counseling masters programs so I'd like to think I am more informed than the average person and i'm also really sensitive to emotions.**

Here is a little background on her. She's an immigrant from one of the islands within the Atlantic ocean off the cost of America and came here when she was 18. At 19 she fell pregnant with my best friend and ended up homeless. A couple of years later she had my other friend, my best friends little sister. She had a massive gambling addiction and for years they lived in motel rooms next to casinos and instead of getting a job she tried the slots with two young children.

My best friends childhood sounded like a nightmare even though she tries to downplay it now that I have a neg. opinion of her. Once they lived in an apartment and her mother couldn't pay the gas bill. The girls (4 and 6)  were alone and my best friend was trying to give her sister a bath by boiling water on the stove and ended up knocking it off and burning her arm (she still struggles with being near boiling water and oil). Their mother eventually met this older man and I believe she manipulated him into marrying her and supporting her and her daughters. The younger sister even got a private school education out of it and a stable environment. 

The main reason I feel like she is a sociopath is her manipulative behavior that I noticed within minutes of meeting her. As soon as she got into the apartment (two days late btw and just to pop by and get my bff to do her hair which meant we couldn't go out for halloween anymore cuz they had to attend to her) she started to tell us what was wrong with it and  why we needed to do better. She went around and arranged the curtains, told us how dirty the place was including my room, and just really putting us down. The most shocking part was she managed to get me and my best friend to fight for the first time without any warning.

I came out of my room and my best friend yelled at me about how our apartment looked and...I was shocked and hurt and when I looked down at her mother she  was dead silent and looking at me with nothing in her eyes. Earlier she smiled at me and talked about my curly hair but it was like her smile didn't reach her eyes. Later after she left and I started talking to my friend again (I spent the night in tears in the back of a club alone with my costume on) she told me that she felt like she had to do it for the sake of her mother. 

Later I was doing research and I found a journal article with this list of traits they associated with sociopathy and as casual as I could I asked my friend what she though it meant to ""lack insight"" and the very first person she associated it with was her mother. 

I am asking for advise as to how to even approach them with my thoughts and concerns for them because their mother causes them so much pain and worry and has their entire lives. I think if they recognize that their mother has a mental illness they will be better off in the long run but I don't know how without pissing them off or freaking them out. ",27Nov2018,1
568,"I'm Creating a mock-up of a consulting company which synthesizes financial reports on blockchain data collected by banks in India for the last  project of my university major.

569,"So basically, for the majority of this past month, I have been feeling super empty inside and emotionless. I have felt some type of affection at times, and even felt butterflies for my gf, but I just kinda feel like things are drifting away from me. Each day that passes, I feel as if my feelings are gone more and more. I also noticed at times my gf tried to make me jealous to see if she could illicit a response, but I honestly didn't care at that point. Then she said she was sorry and apologized profusely, saying she was trying to see if she can get any type of emotion out of me since she noticed I was distant. My parents look at me and ask why I seem so hallow when I talk to them and don't get excited when the surprise me. If anything, I am feeling an emotion, however, I feel like a douchebag because prior to this, I was trying to make sure everyone was happy in my life. Now, I can honestly care less about what they do or what I do because the consequences don't concern me anymore, and I hate that. It was actually beneficial, but I just seem to be becoming more reckless and unmotivated. What should I do to motivate myself? What should I do to finally break this dumbass spell of nothingness and be able to feel appropriately? Prior to this month, people told me I was too emotional, now I'm too emotionless, what do I do? I need help. ",27Nov2018,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going  to as I was holding the plates and  she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right while she looked at me as  I was wrapping cutlery on and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on  she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and  smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

576,"Hello! 

I currently work in an office which I feel safe in, however our parking situation is VERY DANGEROUS. I live where it snows a lot and we have very icy roads, paths from the multiple makeshift parking lots. One lot is gravel, barely plowed with huge ice mounds you have to drive over and I am worried of the damage it can cause to my car. There are also giant holes, some empty, some filled with half frozen water. Today I parked in one of the lots I have yet to &amp; almost fucking died!!

You have to walk through the snow to get to the main path and next thing I knew, the ground beneath me was cracking exposing a retention pond I didn't know stretched to that point! my foot got soaked with freezing cold water and i almost completely fell through, but frantically ran off.  It was totally covered with snow so I did not notice it was there. 

Finally I gain my balance and begin slipping on ice patches all over under the snow and then more when i walk on the blacktop covered in black ice. It is a terrifying 7 minute walk. Now, I know some of this is unavoidable, but COME ON. I am so scared each time I walk in and winter has just started. I brought it up to our office manager and she joked about mother nature. Fuck.

Now I am curious as to the expectation of an employer, legally, to maintain these areas and what action I can take to make sure I don't die on my way into work as well as my colleagues. 

Thanks in advance!

581,"I’m 23 working as a bank teller making only $14/hour. I love the operational work, but loathe the customer service. This job was getting bad for my mental health and I decided to apply elsewhere. Yesterday, I received two job offers from two companies and can’t decide which one.

Job 1: massive international company where I would be handling financial transactions for customers such as stocks, bonds, retirement, etc. I don’t care too much for professional work, stressful environments, or customer service, but it pays $24/hour which I believe is around $45k. This job also has a lot of upward mobility and would better benefit me years from now. 

Job 2: It’s for a big bank doing what I do now without the customer service. It’s just doing the operational side of things for the tellers in the corporate office. I love this work, but it’s only paying $17/hour. It would be stress-free, can wear my everyday clothes and just listen to music without being bothered. This job would not have much upward mobility and won’t help me make more money in the future... it’s just a job.

I’m at crossroad and not sure which to take. Job 1 is great for doing better in life and is a much better investment, but I hear it’s stressful and professional. I wouldn’t enjoy this job nearly as much, but it would help me more in life. Job 2 is something I would love to do, but there is not much room for growth. It’s peaceful, but it wouldn’t help me as much.

588,"I am in a position where I don't know whether I want to stay in SC or move back home to SoCal. I currently play volleyball in Springfield College, MA as a freshman middle. There is a slight possibility of being a red shirt because it would be very difficult for me to compete. I enrolled in SC solely for the reason in playing volleyball and  pursuing the sport professionally in South Korea. However, my chances to play professionally are at a disadvantage because 1) I am shorter than other competitors (181 cm) while average height is \~198cm and 2) international teams only take a select number of foreign players so I would be competing against the best in other nations. Trying out for the professional league will be difficult because as a native Korean, I would be sent to the required military service, and if I try out as an American citizen, I would be competing against foreign players. I've been playing volleyball for all 4 years and grew to have a big heart/passion for it, and giving it up will surely be a difficult process. In SC, the education isn't the best, and there isn't a major I would like to pursue. If I go back home, I can focus on education while being in a familiar environment. 

In Springfield College, there isn't an environment where I feel like I fit in. Since it's a college that is demographically white, they are culturally different from I am. And as someone who grew up in a Korean, Christian household, I looked for a Christian community/church but to no success. 

If I were to go back home, I most likely be giving up volleyball in order to pursue education. But here, I would be in a community where I can socially and spiritually strive. I would be paying less money to go to school, and I would be helping out my parents financially. 

tldr: stay and pursue my passion of playing volleyball or take safer, educational route back at home? ",27Nov2018,1

Would I gain any benefit by trying to become a left handed completly by practicing writing and doing more and more stuff with my ""natural main hand"" and is it even possible to practice that?

When he was introduced to me, he immediately offered me to help him with his projects if I want to. I didn't say yes at first because I had an employee who was assigned to officially give me tasks but after a few weeks, I noticed that I had actually a lot of free time during work and that I could easily have a look at the projects he did so I approached him and asked if he still wants me to help him with his projects. He agreed and we were working together on his projects which worked out well because we go along really well and make jokes etc. He didn't ask me a lot of personal questions and we only talked occasionally about personal topics. Which was fine for me because at work, we're almost always surrounded by coworkers and I don't really want them to notice that I have a crush on him. We had lots of eye contact during our conversations and talked about kinda deep topics as they were related to our work which was sometimes kinda awkward as we both began stuttering.

Two weeks ago, he texted me that he needs to bring that one project to an end alone but that after we could continue like before. He asked me if I'm okay with that. I replied that I'm absolutely okay with it and that he doesn't have to feel obligated to work with me as I have an assigned employee. He said that he really doesn't want me to take this the wrong way as he liked working with me and joking around during work. I replied that I also liked working with him and I wished him good luck for the project. He didn't text me after this.

During the following day, we didn't talk a lot until this week. On Monday he came to me with the occasional small talk and was asking me for my opinion on some work-related stuff. I told him that I'm going to take an exam next week and he wished me luck and jokingly said that if the professor is mean to me, I should just tell him and he would beat him lol. 

He's a really friendly person in general which means that he gets along with lots of his coworkers and he jokes around with them as well. That makes it really difficult for me to tell whether he treats me different than the other people. The thing he said on Monday makes me think he's trying to flirt with me as my platonic friends wouldn't say something like this, even jokingly.

Has someone an idea? As we can't really talk openly during work, should I initiate conversation by texting?",27Nov2018,1
609,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in o the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to stared at me kind of smiling a little as I walked in the doorway as she was sorting glasses and she didn’t look away  but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going  to as I was holding the plates and  she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right while she looked at me as  I was wrapping cutlery on and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on  she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and  smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

611,"Hi friends,
For some context I’m a senior in high school and this concerns my English class and a big groupchat all the kids have for it. So recently one of the girls in the chat had a lapse in judgement and sent a picture of the exact same stamps we get for participation in the class, saying that if anyone needed stamps it was 2.99 at Staples. Anyways the teacher found out because everyone in that program is out for themselves and it escalated into one of the boys getting exposed for sending quiz answers. Now while I’m not involved in either of these situations, in one of the screenshots my name appears because I was making a dumb joke at the time. No where else does my name appear. So realistically what’s the worst that can happen to me, if anything? Would it be within my rights to refuse my phone for a search? (I live in CA btw). ",27Nov2018,1
612,"I need some deep advice! My best friend invited me to her Xmas party and I need help deciding if I should go.   

Backstory: We’ve been BFF’s since HS. She’s the kind of person to have a ton of GF’s and BFFs too. I’m more of a one person is by BFF.  I like to be alone and have very few friends. It never bothered me because i never felt abandoned. I have major trust issues (childhood trauma: neglect and abandonment) There would be times throughout our friendship where we were close and not so much.. fast forward to last year she added me to her friend group. I’ve never had that many girlfriends at once so it was exciting. I had just had my my first baby and really wanted some girlfriends. It was all fun and games until this spring. 

I’ve been going through some deep personal transformation (one: was very overweight, still am but losing it). Being in that friend group made me realize how I longed for girlfriends. I started to feel anger towards my bff because I was starting to feel abandoned. I’d ask her to visit me and she wouldn’t.  felt so lonely surrounded “friends”. I had trouble connecting with them. They didn’t like any of the things I like: movies, music, or sports. I know I am pretty deep person and often come across as intense. But even the most basic things we couldn’t agree on. I don’t mind having a difference of opinions but we didn’t connect. We we’re all in different stages in life: babies, new home, new degree, career changes. There was a lot i also felt insecure about. I also had a part in why we didn’t connect. Felt somewhat less than. Safe to say I was over the group and needed some space and clarity. 

I decided to leave the group mid June of this year to work on myself and mental heath. Left the group on a Thursday. On Friday I see a post on Insta that had a photo of all the girls in group minus 1 gal and caption read “sissy trip” “best friend’s dirty 30”. My bff’s big 30 bday party was the following week. 

I never received an invite to this trip. 

I basically nixed her at that time. Ignored her all summer. We had a long 5hr sit down and talked about everything. 

There are still some lingering feelings but obvs our relationship just isn’t what it used to be. This girl doesn’t have a mean bone in her body but her actions cut deep. 

Well I’ve been keeping distant in general trying to figure myself out more especially as a mom.

Recently she invited me to her Xmas party but I don’t want to go. Not because I don’t want to be around her but mainly because I don’t care to be around everyone else. I love her and her hubby who I’ve known since I was 16 but I don’t care about rest. I don’t want to seem heartless or mean. That’s my problem. I hate coming off as mean or rude. I don’t ever want to hurt anyone’s feelings but I’m exhausted.  I’m terrible at making decisions like this. Help! Should I go? 

TL;DR
I don’t care for my BFFs friends and am regretting RSVPing to their party. ",27Nov2018,1
613,"Over the past few months, I have become extremely interested in the field of artificial intelligence almost to the point of obsession. I have researched a few masters programs in AI, and (unsurprisingly) they all require an undergraduate degree in a related field (CS, data science, math, etc.). Unfortunately for me, my degree is in politics. Is there any way I could prepare myself for such a program (or just generally a very radical career shift), short of doing another four-year undergraduate degree?

I have looked into certificate programs, but am uncertain if they are substantive enough to do what I want to do. I was also wondering if they would be suitable for someone like me who has absolutely zero experience in coding.

614,"Due to a lot of bad choices (that were meant with good intentions to help others), my boyfriend and I (also 2 cats) may have to live in our car this coming winter. We've done this briefly once before in lower temps, but had the ability to use free hotel nights for showering and the relief of a bed. I don't think with cats that will be an option this time around. I can store most of our belongings with family, and only intend to have clothing toiletries and essentials for the cats. 

I honestly may be able to place my cats with a friend or family member as I have done before but am preparing for the possibility that it may not be an option. I know to some this may seem off but I don't think I could mentally part with them, they have been with me for almost 7 years now and are like my children. 

All I am looking for are some tips as my first experience with this we had too many of our belongings with us and did not prepare in the proper way before hand (blankets were not thick enough). We may end up being fine but I get paranoid and scared that the possibility of homelessness will ""sneak up"" on us. 

After a bit of googling I've seen buying a car topper suggested and may look into that if we need extra space. 

For reference we mostly reside near a large city. Food will be available to us and many other types of stores. Our sleeping arrangements (location) are already taken care of. Mostly needing tips on staying warm, conserving space, and mental preparation I suppose. And I do hope that any comments left here will be of use to someone else as well.

616,"So this is really embarrassing and I don’t know what subreddit to ask. I don’t know if anyone else has the same issue. So basically, I have a problem after going #2. I wipe and wipe and wipe and use tons of toilet paper until it starts to even barely show up. However, it never comes fully clean no matter how many times I wipe. I always have to say “good enough” and go on with my day. Now it is solved at home when I use wet wipes. All clean and hardly any issue. However I would never let a soul down there for sexy time. So the bigger issue is when Im at work and have to inevitably shit. There are no wet wipes. I use the crappy one-ply until the bowl is almost filled and then I go back to work. However I start to feel it. The rash. So then I have to go back to the bathroom a couple hours later and wipe and lo and behold BAM! More fudge than on the last wipes from the initial dump! And I still don’t feel clean even after that. I do have a lot of hair down there but I know most guys do and I’ve seen waaaay hairier assholes. Other guys seem to be fine. I have to make a point in the shower to take my shower head and put it on skin rip pressure and spray out the starfish every day because it is never clean after a shit.

Nothing really happens when I’m outside but today some guy was asking my for money and my name. He had a badge thing around his neck so I thought he was trying to advertise something to me idk. I said no and I did not tell him my name. I walked the other way, he followed me for a bit then crossed the street. 

I called my friend and went to a store nearby since I was pretty suspicious that this dude was following me. I was on the phone with her for awhile then got off the phone. Then he came up to me while I was looking for what I needed and he said “Are you shopping?” “Do you want me to buy you anything?” “You have money?” “Do you live around here?” He asked for my name again and I gave him a false name. He said his name was rock or something but I knew that I needed to go ASAP. He looked sketchy as fuck. 

I ran around different streets to make sure he wasn’t following me. I’m paranoid now and I’ve never had anyone try to follow me anywhere. Ive been catcalled before when I lived in a bad area and when I ignored those guys they usually kept walking or cursed me out then they would mind their business. 

I live in a good area now and I have no clue why I’m still encountering strange people. I don’t know what I should do if I see this guy again. Or anymore creeps. I’ve never been in a situation before where I have to avoid someone like that. ",27Nov2018,1

619,"I've been with my group of friends for about two years, we went to the same school together. Right now, we all go to different universities and i feel like we've drifted off. They always want to hang out at times when I'm busy or late and they all live fairly close together so when they choose a place to hang out it takes a long time for me to go. So, I usually am not able to come so they always make comments. But, it's not that I don't want to hang out, it's that it's either very late and my parents are very strict so that's a no. 
When we went to a school, they used to always make comments like I'd be the first to leave the group but ever since we went to different universities I've been trying to keep in contact. But unless I text, I won't be texted back so I feel maybe I should just completely disappear from the group chats, because the only time my name is mentioned in the chat is to make a snide comment of me not coming to hang.

620," 

So I believe in constructive competitiveness the kind which prompt all members of the team to grow simultaneously. However this coworker always retains info from me and keeps it hidden from me (because he knows I am more competent than him). He asks me many questions to which I answer openly. I am in a team of two, him and my supervisor. I always share info with my supervisor quite openly and since we sit together in a common open office, my coworker is always listening. On the other hand, he always does it discretely and in a voice tone too low for me to hear. His childish behavior didn't bother me until he started taking my projects from me without my knowledge. I can't do anything about it since he supplies the responsible of the project with info that I could not obtain on time.I hate this type of behavior. I love my job but I hate this atmosphere. I am glade my supervisor is really mature and he shares everything with me. I want to be like him tbh.I can be like my coworker, it will take me a while but I can become like him. My question is should I?

I would really hate to be someone like that.Should I change job?He is aware that on a technical level that I am way more competent than him and that's why he is tryin to fight back. Eventhough, it doesn't have to be a fight and worst he does it so cunningly like for example asking me question in front of my supervisor so that I become obliged to answer. When I try to ask a question he pretends he didn t hear.When I ask for a document he sends another pretending he didn't understand what I need.

621,"  I'm on my first year of highschool. So I was up all night and brought coffee to school with me. But I hadn't eaten much of anything before drinking it so that's probaly what caused this. I thought I was fine but during English class we had a test and I had to pee before so I asked to go to the bathroom. I kniw the following is gross and seeems off topic but I swear it has something huge to do with the story. Then later I had the urge to fart but realize I didn't have to fart- I had diarrhea. I tried holding it in but eventually couldn't take it and asked to go to the bathroom again, which was embarrassing. So this time I went go to the bathroom because of fear of shitting on myself in class. And I tried to shit as much as I could. Thought I'd be fine but no when I go back to class it happens again. I'm not gonna go to the bathroom a third time. So I asked if I could go to the nurses office and told her my stomach hurt because I was scared to tell her what really happened. But really it was just discomfort in my stomach. The main problem was was diarrhea. So I went to the nurse and just said my stomach hurt and she said she couldn't do anything and to go back to class. I was too scared to really go back to class because I was so embarrassed. So I wandered the campus. When the be rang I had a class with my best friend. And I told her my stomach hurt as well and about the gassy and diarrhea thing. But afterwards I started exaggerating but it wasn't for attention or anything idk I did it (idk why I did this I've always been a impulsive person who does things without thinking so that could be why but still it is no excuse). I was worried about shitting on myself in other classes but yeah I still feel guilty as hell. Also she took me to the nurses office again and told her this time I actually told the nurse it was also giving me diarrhea she called home. Around everyone, not just my bestfriend, I over exaggerated. Even later at some point I thought I'd be okay but I just ended up continuing it and went home. But I just feel like a liar and she's my best friend so it sucks. Even worse she was there for me the whole time and worrying about me. She's always there for me when no one else is so I feel like what I did was awful. I'm sick to my stomach. Am I a bad friend? I just wish I could stop impulsively lying so much. Also I'm too embarrased to go back to school after that whole thing in English class and I feel people will spread rumors about me. I can't even sleep. And my exaggeration and acting was so good, I'm scared to tell her I was being dramatic and all that and I feel scared to tell her truth because she may not trust me or know when I'm for real ever again.

623,"I am nearing the end of my very first semester at college and I did abysmal to say the least... the highest grade I got on an exam was a 53, and the lowest was a 19.

624,"The problem is I recently have been job searching, and I'm going to go from making around 26k a year to 55k a year. And she is quite literally telling me ""not to do that"" because ""I don't want to drive."" She is also under the impression that we won't be able to afford a car, despite the fact that together we will be making around 100k a year. She says I keep ""rejecting her emotions"" and on some level thats true: because the situation demands she learns to drive. I don't demand she learn to drive. 

And thats the thing: Her emotions don't match the situation. 

First she works in an unsafe part of town. There is really good security at her place of work, but the bus stop is a solid 10 minute walk from it. And she isn't willing, and I won't let her walk there as I wouldn't walk from there.

I drive my fiance to work every day. I pick her up every night. Our shift lines up perfectly to do this. She typically drives home but REFUSES to drive to work because ""Traffic is way worse, and I'm not that good of a driver lol."" If there is any inclement weather she refuses to drive. Shes only has her permit.

Her driving is 100% fine. Its not perfect but its way beyond what I was at when I got my licenses. (I only drove like 5-6 times before taking the drivers test and passing.) In truth shes a better driver than both of her brothers, who both have licensees.

Now the advice I gave her is effectively the only advice I can give her: If you are nervous drive a bit slower (5-10 MPH),  always drive slower in bad weather, and avoid highways (which we don't take to get her to/from work.)

So I asked her ""Would you be driving to work if we weren't together?"" And she said ""no my grandfather would take me.""

Which brings me to this: The SITUATION demands she learn to drive. She is now telling me ""You shouldn't take this job because you can't take me to work."" Why would I stunt my career for her to feel 'comfortable'? That makes no sense. She might as well be saying ""Actively hurt yourself so I can feel good.""

She keeps talking about fear (which I will get to in a minute) but for me fear is an emotion that tells me when to have gumption, and 'buck up.' If I feel afraid I charge into what I'm afraid of to prove my fears and doubts wrong, and with her it seems to be the otherway around, to the point that I can't even empathize with her about it.

In her defense she has a ton of anxiety about driving because her father has crashed 10-12 cars because he is the worst driver I've ever met, to the point of being actively malicious behind the wheel. He does 2.5-3 times the speed limit down every road, if any one tries to pass on him he will intentionally dive his car into their lane, if they don't stop he will intentionally hit them or run them off the road, if he sees a one way street he drives down it the wrong way. Hes lost his licensee 5-6 times and only got it back because he paid a lawyer something like 25k to fight for him in court to get it back. If he ever loses it again he loses it for life no matter what, and he has just been saying ""well I have the money to just pay my way out of jail so I will just drive illegally.""

 Just as one example we were driving with him and she never told me about this. While driving we were in a 25mph road, while visible snow was on the ground, and he was doing 80, and ran 3 stop signs causing one person to crash, he lost control of the car 3-4 times and I started screaming at him ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!?!"" 

Also some time ago we were rear-ended at a stop sign by a woman who admitted to the cops and us that she did it on purpose to try and ""kill us"" because of a bumper sticker I have on my car (BTW shes a boomer and kept screaming about killing millennials the entire time after she hit us) her reasoning was ""You didn't run that stop sign so you deserve to be hit.""

A lot has come out in this time frame like her grandfather telling her ""Never get your licensee because driving is dangerous and it could kill you. I'll drive you everywhere."" Despite the fact that he is at best a normal driver and never wears a seat belt and never made her do it (Like seriously what the fuck?) I'm literally fighting her entire family over the issue.",27Nov2018,1

631,"I am a minor in the state of South Carolina, United States. Recently there was an attempt of a blackmail against me by a gay man. He tried to black mail me into having sex with him. I’m seeking advice of what to do next. 

So, a gay kid messaged me on a mobile app called Snap Chat, asking me what I will being doing Tuesday. I told him I was doing chores that day. He kept asking me if I had free time, and I told him no, and if he was wanting to hangout I didn’t have time. He said “I don’t want to hangout with you, I want you to suck my cock and have you ride me”. 

I told him I’m not gay, and I wasn’t into that. He then threatened me by black mail to attempt to get me to sleep with him. He said “I will show everyone at school a dick pic I have that is yours, and tell everyone you are gay and that you sent this to me.” He showed me the picture, which I can not only tell it was mine, but a picture I sent to someone whom I was fwb with. 

I told him that if you do that, I will report to the place that you attempted to black mail me, that you have child pornography on your phone, and that you are attempting to distribute it. He backed off, and said “I will get you. I will tell people you are gay.” 

The fact that he attempted to do that shocks me, very terribly. I felt almost as if I had no control, and I was very lucky to know some laws. However, I’m worried about him trashing my name around school and spreading lies about me. Lies that are not true. If anyone has any advice as to what I can do to have damage control please let me know. I haven’t told anyone about it besides close friends, and I have the messages saved and screen shotted just Incase he tries to do anything legally.

So eventually my bestfriend starts telling me and one of our other female friends about all these little clues/flirtatious things this new guy would say to her. So one night she leaves to go hang out with this guy, and when she comes back, she tells us all about how they got really drunk and made out in the back of his car. Apparently he even suggested going further but it never ended up happening. She keeps expecting that they will talk about what happened but he keeps on sending her blank snapchats, and eventually he stops replying all together. Later on when I'm hanging out with him he mentions a party but specifically tells me he doesn't want her there but doesn't tell me why. So  there was one time I was out hanging out with him then left to hangout with my bestfriend and our other female friend. My bestfriend reveals to me that she had actually had a big crush on him for a while and was super upset that he sorta ghosted her, and then preceded to say she was hurt that I would sometimes prioritize hanging out with him vs her. I asked her if she didn't want me to hangout with him any more but she said it was fine. But apparently it wasn't fine because our other friend revealed to me that she is still mad I hangout with him. That's a lot to take in but although this guy can sometimes be an asshole, he's still my friend and I don't want to ghost him/end our friendship. However I feel like I'm being a bad friend by continuing to hangout with him. What should I do???",27Nov2018,1

636,"i'm sorry if this isn't the right sub for this, i'm just really shaken and i don't know what to do.

my neighbors house caught on fire a few hours ago. it was incredibly bad. it's all out now and our house is fine (i live in a trailer park, everything is very close together) but i can't find my cat and i don't know if he's okay and it's making me anxious.

i left the back door open for him when i went inside to get my shoes on (even though i didn't see him at that point) and now i'm just assuming he's outside, but i don't know where he would be and he's not coming in when we call him.

there are still cars and police and all of that here. he's an indoor/outdoor cat and he usually comes when we call him. he likes to hide under our neighbors shed and i'm really scared that he inhaled too much of the smoke and ran off somewhere to pass away or passed away under the shed. there are firefighters and stuff around so i can't really go check without getting in trouble.

is there a way i can get him inside or make sure he comes home? is there a possibility he's gone? i'm really worried about him and i don't know what to do. if anyone has any tips or similar experiences that can give me advice i would really appreciate it.

thank you.

639,"First of all, thank you for taking your time to read my post. Now let’s begin.

It’s been months since we last saw each other. I asked her to go out with me to prom, she said yes. In that day we had a lot of fun. However, in the next days I decided to ask her out to another place, she never replied back, I think she ghosted me.

I accepted it and I decided to move on. Great! End of the story! 

...

BUT NO!!!! Months afterwards, I started feeling very moody. I had to block her in every social media I use. That would have helped me out, but it was a short-term solution.

I am feeling very moody. I ask myself, did she have a reason to ghost me? Should I have kept messaging her at the time she didn’t reply my message? Will things be different if I kept messaging her? Did I make the wrong choice to move on too early?

Oh boy... It’s really awful.

641,I live in off campus housing with 5 other people. One person handles all the money. He just sends out a few texts every month telling us what we owe and when it’s due by. He initially pays for them out of pocket and then we pay him back. I’ve never asked to see the statements before because I trusted he was asking us to pay the correct amount. After a few things went down in the house I stopped trusting him and this month I asked him to send the statements of the bills. He has been rounding up the bills for each person by about $.50. For example one utility this month came out to be $28.94 and he initially said we owed him $29.50. Am I being irrational for saying something about how it’s dishonest to up-charge us $.56? I would understand rounding to $29 but $29.50? Another utility he was asking us to pay before came out to be $49.03 and he asked for $49.50. Everyone pays with checks so I don’t understand why he’s not just rounding to $40.05 or $40.10? Any advice? ,27Nov2018,1
642," I have an eating disorder - binge/emotional eating. Logically I know the issue. I know when I'm not hungry and that I should not eat - especially the comfort foods, or jumping on fast food, candy, ice cream, chips, or just anything around. I know to check myself- am I eating because I'm bored? Depressed? (I suffer from depression and anxiety as well, just a big ole mess). 

I don't want to drop excuses, but after this last year of my life I have taken many, many personal hits that have me struggling much harder to control my food intake. My gma fell and broke her hip, had to find her a new home, my bf left me after we moved in together,  one dog got cancer, I cared for an aunt in hospice and watched her die, then the sick dog died, and then I got let go from my job. 

My workouts have gone from overly obsessive to hardly, my food intake has increased. I know I can do it: I was 250+ 3 yrs ago,  was down to 165 before the year fell apart, and am hovering 190-180 now. Not ""obese"" but the weight affects my physical body so it's needed for health primarily.  

Does anyone have any tricks to assist in food control?",27Nov2018,1
643,"Hi Reddit. I made this account because I like reddit but also mostly because I wanted to ask this question, and I think the advice of complete strangers is usually beneficial. 
I’m [18F] who just moved about three hours away from home to go to university. I have had a lot of experience in college prior to this. My high school offered classes I could take at my community college, and later on my state college. I have completed about almost 2 years worth of college after graduating high school, so I’m really familiar with how this all works.
I’m not having a tough time with the work, but I’m having a hard time coping with being by myself. I made a group of friends in the beginning of the year, but they all ended up being whorish druggies, and they quickly excluded me. 
I truly do not want to sound boastful, but I’m a pretty girl. I’m nice and sweet, but over the years I think I’ve become cynical and kind of odd. I’m having a lot of trouble making friends and meeting new people, but again, I really don’t make any effort to. I have a boyfriend, but he is back home. Our relationship is very rocky, but I’m not interested in meeting anyone else while I’m here. To cope with being alone, I smoke a ton of weed, drink, and pop adderall. I’d never do anything harder, but I’m a depressive and my coping mechanisms are awful. It seems to have worsened severely ever since I’ve been on my own and have this new found freedom. 
All this has me wanting to go home and just go to school where I did before and live at home. It’s a fortune to go where I’m currently attending, and going home would cut that cost in half. On the other hand, I don’t want to seem weak and like a failure. I want to be able to live on my own and be healthy. I want to be able to become a successful, independent woman who doesn’t have to rely on her parents or boyfriend for happiness. I fear if I stay here longer though I will just dig myself into a deeper hole. 

I know this sounds very teenagery and depressing, but I didn’t know where else to turn. ",27Nov2018,1
644,"I’ve recently had insight that I’m “nice” to some people in my life with the expectation that “they’ll stay” or that I’ll be worth something to them. 

Don’t get me wrong, I will do a good deed for a stranger without expecting anything in return, and couldn’t care less if it’s seen by anybody. This mentality only seems to apply to people I have formed relationships with. Two recent examples: I baked a cake for a friend I’ve had feelings for in hopes he would call me more often or pay more attention to me, and when he didn’t, I instantly felt spiteful and regretted “looking so foolish” for a guy. I spent hours on a project for another friend’s baby nursery with the secret hope I’d be given some praise and recognition among my circle of friends. 

I truly think this is stemming from the intense loneliness I’ve been feeling lately. I just landed what’s supposedly my dream job, yet I feel anxious and miserable as I let people step over me half the time. I’m losing contact with my friends and though it’s expected because we recently graduated and have our own lives to lead, I’m angry at them for not reaching out and checking up on me from time to time despite all the “good things” I do. It’a apparent I crave some sort of validation that people still value me. I’m sure my first and only relationship had a huge impact on this. My ex was financially manipulative, and ended up ghosting me and jumping straight to another relationship. I’ve been harboring all the hurt, insecurity and rejection even though it’s been two years.

People who know me always say how sweet and thoughtful and kind I am, and how I always go out of my way for others. It’s killing me inside that I’m constantly fighting off these horrible, distorted thoughts wondering why they won’t do the same, or that if I don’t do something they’ll just disappear from my life, and constantly thinking they don’t care. Most of all I’m terrified of the thought that I’m just not a kind person after all, and that nothing I do will prove that. I have enough objective reasoning that this is some sort of defense mechanism from past events and my intense fear of abandonment. I find it odd that I’m aware and can admit to it, but can’t get myself out of it.

Any advice if you’ve had people in your life who behaved like me would be great. ",27Nov2018,1
645,"My inner family seems to be homophobic but I'm not 100% sure and I need to be sure if they are homophobic or not. 

Right now, I'm just going off a movie. I picked a movie at random, Bessie and we started watching it. One of the few opening scenes were two girls making out or something. Everyone was pretty uncomfortable but I thought that was just cause it was a 'sex' scene and we're a family. I was going to skip it when my brother said, 

'Let's watch something else, I don't really wanna watch lesbians.' 

And at first, I thought it was because he thought it might have more 'sex' scenes but whenever I think back on it, he seemed very uncomfortable and... disgusted by it. My mom agreed with him and we watched something else. 

My family doesn't seem to have a problem with gayness as a thing in general (I may be wrong) but they don't like seeing LGBT PDA and have said once or twice they wouldn't want their kids being gay (ahaha too late) and have in ways expressed that thought. 

My family also doesn't have friends who are part of the LGBT community (my dad had a trans coworker but, idk, when he spoke of her, he seemed to be fascinated by her in a 'I'm actually making fun of her' kinda way) and my brother has never really vocalized his opinion of LGBT people or said anything about them really.

Does that mean they're homophobic? 

Does anyone know of a way I can test them to know if they're really homophobic? I'm bisexual and I've thought about coming out to my brother, who I trust very much but I'm underage and still live with our parents so if he tells them, I could get kicked out if they don't accept me.

646,"Growing up, I was inadvertently discouraged from being confident. It was my mom's attempt to ensure I didn't become egotistical and stay grounded. However, as an adult, its severely damaged my confidence and self image.

For this new project there is a 2 day workshop that I had to join remotely. Unfortunately I just learnt this morning that it will start at 7 am, which is little early for me to start the day. I joined the workshop nevertheless and was listening in.Around 25 people, mostly seniors, were in the conference room and some of us in different locations were remote. 

I didnt have a good night's sleep, and had to skip my coffee due to early start. To make sure I was getting the notes, I tried to record the call on an app- unfortunately this app would not record if my phone was on mute. So I was recording the call and my phone was not mute the entire time. 

We had lunch break for 20 mins and then we joined the conference line again. During this second session I fell asleep and people in room could listen to me snoring. My manager tried to call me and I missed that, only to wake a min after to listen to the voicemail. I listened to the recording to see that it went for almost 5 mins and they figured out it was me, and they had to redial in. 

I dont know how to face them now. I feel like I should just resign and do something else.

I’m applying to move forward. To start working on my dreams. Nothing crazy, I have an extensive background in hospitality and my goal is to work on a cruise line in order to garner world experience and save enough money to get my TEFL Certification and properly travel and teach. 

The problem comes when I actually finish job hunting for the day. After all the work of resume tweaks and cover letters and application processes I just break down. 

I make efforts. I pack up my laptop and change locations to both relaxing and conducive venues, I take small breaks when I feel I need to, I’m already on anti-anxiety meds that (generally) work, I ask for and positively receive help when necessary, I apply to jobs within my field and ability scope. 

No matter what measures I take to prevent it, after every day of job hunting I come home and am immediately reduced to a tense, sobbing mess on my bathroom floor.

652,"Nobody likes a long story, so I will try to keep it short.

My now officially ex is an illegal alien. I have taken care of her financially and emotionally for the past 6 years. She is charming and very beautiful and tends to get what she wants from people. She was hired into a great job in her career field making good money despite her lack of education or and lack of documents to legally work in the United States. As soon as things were seemingly good and my financial and emotional help was no longer needed. She turned cold, less caring and respectful. Went on random secret trips, ignored me, and eventually ghosted me by blocking me from social media and ignoring all contact from me.

After begging and pleading for an explanation I was told she had not been in love with me for over a year and had been faking it to me. Cold and emotionless she ended the call with ""Goodbye"". Understandably I am in shock and beyond angry.

There is a very dark side within me that wants to call INS and report her and her employer and hope it gets her fired and deported. The rational side in me wants to try and just accept her behavior and move on without causing any drama.

656,"So... Oh man this is going to be long. 

I'm currently 21 and I feel like right now I'm at this point of my life, where whichever path I choose to take, then this is going to be the one that I will be walking on forever. 

After being unemployed for quite some time, in the beginning of this summer I started working as a taxi driver. At first glance a job like any other, long shifts (12-13 hours a day), the pay was okayish, for a 21 year old still living with his parents, it was prerry solid, I couldn't complain.
But I loved it so much. I loved the driving. Sometimes I had to pick up/drop off people in these really small countryside villages which looked like they came out of a fairytale. While cruising through their narrow paved streets under the melody of my favorite music in the background, I just couldn't be happier.
The interaction with people was a pleasant surprise for me. I have always been good at talking to people, but I never knew that I could be good at it in a professional way too. Our company drove mainly for these stuck up suit guys, but even with them, surprisingly enough, I could keep an amusing conversation. On the other side I kept my mouth shut when the client wasn't talkative.
Old people were GREAT. Absolute sweethearts. Helping them to get into the car was pure bless... I don't know, I'm not a saint but I liked helping these people out. And they never shut up, which was annoying from time to time, but in general I liked listening to them. 
I made some great friends with my clients and we are still keeping in touch.

And here it comes. I thought that doing this for the rest of my life wasn't really such a bright plan for a young fella like me full of potential. So I decided to study in a university. I chose to ponder my mind to its limits in the arts of philosophy 3 months ago.
Now don't get me wrong, philosophy has been one of my interests for a long time, and I thought that it could give me a good base ground for whatever career I decide to persue in the future.

Well, yeah... but ever since I started studying it I feel miserable. Maybe because it's too hard. Maybe because I'm lazy and I procastinate all the time. Maybe because of both. All I know is, I think that I found out for sure that I'm not an academic person.

So I'm considering to drop out. The results of my last few tests seem to prove that this might not be a bad idea at all. But then where will be my life heading? Back behind the wheel? Something new? To a better place or a worse future compared to a hypothetical me that majored in philosophy? I don't know.

I know that's nothing new and that there are a lot of people of my age, younger and even much older, that also feel lost.
I just wish someone could guide me in the right direction. ",27Nov2018,1

First off thank you for taking time to grace me with your excellent wisdom, I myself I am not wise. I am also not reddit fancy,  I know you guys have formatting rules! Sorry ahead of time.

I am going to very generally sum up the back story to get to my problem. I have also formatted my question within the wall of text.

Girl meets boy, boy lives in another state. Boy moves across country to be with girl and girl and boy are so happy. Boy brings mother, girl is OK with this. She was living with him already. She is on disability so he takes care of her as she only gets $700 per month. 

Girl is not like boy, I am not wealthy. I am very underpaid for the hours and work that I do for my company but, I am actively looking. Just a competitive market for someone with no degree in my field. I get by well enough on my own. 

Let's go to about 4 months after they move to me , his mom decided to pick up and leave. We are not living together at this point. He comes to me and though he makes very good money eh tbh, he is cheap. He gives me the sob story and offers me a really good rate on rent, so reluctantly I move in to help him out. We are even in separate bedrooms at this point. Fast forward 2 months and she comes home and I am moved from my bedroom to his. This apartment is not big enough for 3 people but again, I make do. Fast forward almost 2 years and my savings is depleted and being a financial employee I of course spreadsheet all of my expenses. I noticed a trend to my spending when she is here and not here. 

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is, with her back I spend more than my budget allows. It is actually cheaper for me to pay more in rent and not live there. There are many benefits to this as she has no boundaries and has stolen cash from my wallet as well as throws away anything of mine she does not like. I know what you're thinking, talk to the spouse. I have and he handles it but, this is part of her disability and something we just deal with on a daily basis. His handling also holds no weight to her.

&amp;#x200B;

She eats 3 meals a day at home and never leaves the house she also takes a lot of prescription medication and smokes a great deal of weed for someone her age. The woman is like a garbage disposal. I also eat very differently then my 2 family members. I eat low/carb free so when grocery shopping what happens is, my food is eaten then replaced with food I don't eat. It is very frustrating to buy a block of cheese to last you 2 weeks to come home 24 hours later and find it gone with a box of ding dongs where it once sat. I have tried meal prepping and labeling. She ate the stuff she liked out of my lunches. Was a nice surprise at work.I have tried to get my S/O to pick up the financial stress of his mother but, it just doesn't happen. He is cheap and doesn't have a concept of money. He makes 3 times more than I do, I make $13.00 per hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

The emotional side of it is she will nag at me and refuse to watch my dog during the day and overall make my life a living hell if I do not give her what she asks for. Think a spoiled toddler you have no control over and you have to be careful not to set off a multiple personality. My S/O won't give her $5.00 here or $10.00 there because he knows she is going to go blow it and not buy what she said the money was intended for. I try really hard to cut what money she gets from me. When I don't, $400.00 in cash goes missing from my supposedly secret box ( the non bank account cash we all stash just in case you find yourself needing cash now.) I have learned that when we are not home, she has been through every inch of our space. We tried locks on the door and she broke them off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have mentioned moving several times to test the water and have given the reasoning in a logical manner. He absolutely won't hear it. We are not married and he associates me moving out as us going backwards though, I did not move in as a progression to our relationship. I don't know how to make this anymore clear to him and be able to move out without the destruction of my relationship. ***How do I get this across to him without directly insulting his mother, letting him know moving out doesn't mean my feelings are different?*** Simply put, I cannot live the lifestyle they live and despite many efforts to get that information across or come up with some kind of family grocery budget all I get is....do what you want sweetie ..... her crying ..... or him telling me to get a new job. When I moved in I had $3,000.00 in savings and a healthy checking account, which was pretty good given my pay. I know I have done this to myself, I am just at the point that I see no light at the end of the tunnel as she has decided to stay with us for life. If I don't do something now I will continue to go without eating most of the week and struggle to put gas in my car. These are struggles my SO is unaware of though I have told him several times I am not just broke but, living paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to go anywhere. I need 2 weeks notice if we're going out to dinner, where we also go dutch.

&amp;#x200B;

To give an idea here are some averages of my spending over the last 2 years. Please keep in mind this does not include what he spends which mirrors if not quadruples my spending. We are not a unit financially, even discussing marriage we have opted to keep our finances separate and when we need to purchase something for the household we go dutch or if I cannot afford it we go without. We have both been burned very horribly with loved ones stealing from us and just feel safer this way especially given the wage gap. If he made closer to what I do, I would not be a burden to his bank account but an equal if that makes sense. Doing the math and looking below it is probably good to mention I live my life over drafted by about $300.00 bi weekly. I will say the last 2 months have not been this way, she went out of town and my account has kept $200.00+ in it.

666,"To offer some context, a few weeks ago, my family lost our home to a huge wildfire. My girlfriend and I were living in that house, and we were sort of forced into living in the next town over. A ton of people lost their houses and apartments were filling up like crazy in the city. Luckily we were able to lease an apartment that accepted dogs and wasn't insanely expensive. It's aimed at students but it's not dorms, so we share the apartment with roommates who pay for their own rooms.   
When filling out the ""Roommate Application,"" we made sure to check that we had a dog, and we were assured our roommates would be fine with pets. After living for a few weeks generally issue-free, the office people told us we had to get an ""Emotional Support Certificate"" online for our dog so they couldn't kick us out, apparently one of our roommates didn't put that they are okay with pets on their roommate application. None of my roommates have expressed discontent with our dog by the way, so I guess they are witholding it. We got the certificate for the office, and a few days later, the staff in charge of leasing is telling me that one of my roommates is allergic to dogs. They can't tell me who, of course. So now they are telling me they are going to relocate us to a different apartment in the complex, and it has to be Co-Ed. There is fuckery afoot, and I'm wondering what we should do? My girlfriend and I do not want to move all of our stuff out into another room, we just lost all most of our belongings to the fire and we just want to settle after a stress-filled month. Should we just let them move us around like bowling pins?

669,"Like the title says, I want to know how I can be more confident. I was always extremely outgoing as a child up until about the age of 14, (currently 17) and being shy is now affecting my life and my goals for the future.

Around friends I’ve known for a long time, I’m very outgoing. All my girlfriends and friends with benefits so to speak have all been a result of me being around my friends, as my “outgoing self”. It’s like because I’ve known them so long, I know how they will react to things I do and say so I am comfortable being myself.

The problem arises when I meet literally anyone new by myself. I just get into this really shy mode where I never speak unless spoken to and act all dumb for some reason and never voice my opinions, and then I’m known as the shy kid. It can be frustrating sometimes because I know I’m not really shy deep down. It also affects my career as finding a job was a nightmare with recruiters saying I didn’t talk enough and my current job said before she hired me she got the impression I didn’t care and was just a stereotypical whatever teen, but now she is really impressed with me. 

Sorry for the wall of text, just want to know if anyone has any advice. I think a lot of it is a self-confidence thing. I’m going to try get into exercising to build some weight as I’m pretty skinny. Thanks for taking the time to read.

670,"Hi there,

I'm 17 years old, a senior in high school. I have to apply to university before January and I have no idea what to go in. I'm not good at academics but to be fair, I never really studied that much. I really wish I could just have the will power but I keep telling myself I'll study but I end up not doing it. My average is 72 right now and I feel horrible for myself. I'm trying to bring my grades up. Almost everyone in my grade applied to uni and are getting early acceptance and I still haven't even applied as I don't even know the faculty I want to go in. I suck at math the most, but maybe it's just because I haven't applied myself. I feel like such a failure. I have expectations of myself that I'd graduate by 2019 and go to university then too. I just can't even think of taking a gap year, I think I'd fall into depression. I would hate myself, honestly. I just don't know what to do. I looked through the programs and I can't think of anything that would accept me or that I could get a job in. I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't deal with this. I feel so dumb and like a failure. I've spoken to my guidance  councellor about my problem on how I don't know what to apply to as my undergrad and he just told me that there's no harm in taking a gap year, and I just don't want to do it.",27Nov2018,1
672,"This is pretty much my first time taking advice on reddit but I’ve been through a hell lot of journey to get to college — so long story short, I had to take a gap year after doing my sixth form and I finally got into college for fall 2018 term but had to defer a semester because my finances rely on a legal case my father is involved in. Its a large chunk of money that will allow me to go to college in US without any hassle but the legalities are taking time. 

Now I have to defer a semester again, and my father is pretty certain that he can pay for college but some people are confusing me with their opinions. 

In the semester I’ve already deferred, I’ve already been investing my time in making music, working out and plan to start studying my university modules as plans have changed. I’ve been totally investing my time and have been working day and night to make it as a musician basically. 

I don’t know if taking another 6 months is going to be harmful to my journey in college but my extended family is insisting me to join a local college here (which I totally am against because they do not offer the modules I want to study, and there is not really a future of what I want to do in this country). Going to college as an international student allows me to take a fresh start and explore new avenues as an artist and grow which is pretty important for me to make it. 

Do you think I’m taking the right path, and would taking this 6 month gap harm my learning ability?

I am in need of advice in order to overcome my own fear of asking my friends and family for help. 
Basically, I am getting ready to move 3000 miles away from my hometown 100% alone. The move is taking place in January, and with Christmas coming up I feel like it would be appropriate to make a simple Facebook post asking my friends and family to donate to my move. 
The issue is, I have a terrible fear of asking for help, especially monetarily. I’ve planned this trip and I do have a bit of money saved up, however it would be extra cushioning for car maintenance and in case of emergency, etc.
I understand that I’m not forcing people to give their money to me, but I can’t help but feel like I am. Or at the very least, that I’m undeserving of financial help because I’m not destitute.

680,"Today has just been an absolute shit fest.

First off, my three year old son has been waking up every morning at 4 o'clock in the fucking morning for about two weeks. He absolutely refuses to go back to sleep, and once I get up to help him back to bed, the puppy sees, and decides it is time to use the potty.

So we wind up waking up at 4am.

Fuck my life.

Usually I'm a little tired, but overall okay. We take the dogs for a walk. We do an art project. We practice letter identification and sounds. We practice sight words. We play a bunch of games. We walk the dog again. And then its time to do chores and make dinner. 

Usually I'm exhausted by 7pm, but can't manage to sleep until 11-12.

Anyway...today started at 4am, just like it has been. But this time, my three year old was an absolute monster. (He's usually a great kid. Listens. Does chores. And is polite.) All day long he was an absolute beast. I scrapped our usual schedule by 8am, when it became apparent that he wasn't going to cooperate.

By 10am, he was having meltdowns over absolutely everything. (For example: He would tell me he wanted to play hide and seek, so I would say ""Okay! Great! Go hide!"" And suddenly he would burst into tears screaming ""NO! I DON'T WANT TO PLAY HIDE AND SEEK!"")

All. Day. Long.

I tried to get him to take a nap, but he wouldn't. He laid in his bed and threw a tantrum for twenty minutes before I told him he could get up as long as he would be nice.

I tried to get him to color with me. He hid under the table. 

I tried to get him to paint. He threw a tantrum. 

Finally I decided to just let him have screen time, because that's what he wanted. I turned on Dino Dan, and began to get the chores done. Soon enough he was following me around screaming at the top of his lungs that he wanted to play. 

At this point I had had enough. I told him that I had been trying to play with him for almost 8 hours, and now it was time for chores.

Another meltdown. 

Then the dog (who is fully potty trained and has not had an accident inside for nearing 6 years) peed on the carpet I had just shampooed over the weekend.

I got out the spot cleaner and cleaned it up. Then my son dropped a full cup of milk all over the carpet. (Because our house was built by idiots, and there is carpet in the dining room.)

I went to the bathroom for a minute or two and cried. 

Then I got the milk cleaned up. I made dinner for everyone, my husband came home, my son threw another tantrum when he asked my husband if he would go to the store and get him a donut, and my husband told him no.

I gave my son a bath, and started bedtime routine early while my husband walked the dogs. Several more bouts of not listening, and eventually I ended the bath early because my son refused to listen when I told him not to throw his toys.

I went downstairs, having still not eaten anything at all today. (Too busy keeping the puppy in check to eat while my son ate breakfast and lunch.) Dinner was cold, so I tried heating it up on the stove. Got distracted by the dog having ANOTHER accident.

Burned dinner. Decided fuck it. Tossed the food. Told my husband I was heading upstairs. 

Now I'm going to take a shower.

Maybe tomorrow will be better. ",27Nov2018,1

It makes me very uncomfortable because I feel like I’m hanging out with a stranger. I don’t want to seem weird or an asshole because he’s still him, and I love him very much but it feels weird being hugged by someone that doesn’t look like him visually. He has a shaved head and a full beard so it looks weird and intimidating to me.
