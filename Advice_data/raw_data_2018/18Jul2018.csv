0,"I’ve been feeling really insecure lately. I think I’m so ugly and I have gained a lot of weight in the past year because of stress from college and my medication. I’ve always struggled with body and even when I weighed less back then I still thought I was fat. A lot of these insecurities come from childhood and also both my parents are super conscious about their weight and put themselves down because of it. 

I’m going to the beach with my boyfriend this weekend and I just can’t help but think how gross I will look in a bathing suit and when we go to the boardwalk there will be a bunch of beautiful, sexy women. I try not to compare myself to other women but it’s hard not to especially when so many women are beautiful and they’re everywhere lol. 

I’ve been going to the gym and I want to start the keto diet but buying groceries is super expensive and Ive only started working this past week so it’s gonna take a bit before I can make enough to buy my own. (I live with my mom but she never buys groceries because she can’t afford it so she gets our food from a church and it’s basically free but the food expires earlier than normal because it’s al the food people don’t want anymore.) 

I keep crying randomly when I start to think about myself because I just think about how ugly I am and how I feel like I’m wasting my summer away because I’m not doing something everyday. I mean I want to do something everyday but I either don’t have the money for it or just don’t really know what to do. 

I’m just mad at myself for gaining this much weight and that I hate myself because of it. 

I know looks are only temporarily and people will love you for you but I just want to feel good in my own skin and it’s really hard for me to do so. If anyone has any advice on this subject I would love to know. Thanks. ",18Jul2018,1
1,"so recently i thought about this girl and i liked her so i was going to ask her on a date.  one of her friends told me that she liked me too so i thought why not.  i couldnt really think of a date but i settled on a fortnite one since i thought it would be pretty fun.
he told me that they were at the mall today so i went there on my bike and tried to find her.  i saw her but i was too nervous to approach her so i walked back and forth far away but soon they saw me doing this and they were staring.  i felt bad but they started approaching me.  i felt nervous because the way the guy was smiling and i thought maybe this was a trick but my crush asked me what i was doing there.  i asked if she wanted to go on a date to my house and play fortnite.  for some reason nobody said anything and her friends started snickering and she had a weird look on her face.  i felt really bad and thought she was doing a rejection so i left and she just said ""im sorry"" as i was leaving.
i was crying i feel so embarrassed and idk what to say.  i never want to see her again but i probably will when school starts again.  idk what to do help.",18Jul2018,1
2,"I'll give a quick personality background of my family and their current relationship with the rest of our members (including my own)

Sister: Due to unfortunate events, my sister currently has bipolar depression, anxiety, and PTSD. She seems to have the best relationship with my mother because she can sense emotions easily. She is also quite childish (even for a 21 year old), screaming a lot when she gets excited, making jokes/puns, and making unconscious and unpredictable decisions. Because of her mental state listed above, it puts constant stress on our family; we have to take care of her. But yet, she also cares about us.

Myself: I tend to be secluded from my family, with the exception of my father because I am currently most comfortable with him. I had a history of clinical depression because of isolation in high school (I'm currently 19). But episodes are more rare today because my current hobbies are keeping my mental stability up. I tend not to favor people with childish attitudes and displaying signs of narcassism, which puts a strain between my sister and myself, but yet i feel empathic towards her. I am also in a current mindset that my mother is the reason why i developed depression in the first place. I believe that she emotionally abused me as a child: constantly teasing, yelling, and lowering my self esteem when i was younger (but I'll include more details). I display a bitter attitude towards or seclusion from her as a result.

Father: I would say he is the glue that holds the family together. (but his mental state is collapsing due to the stress and the reason why I'm writing this now) He's a calculated man. He takes every decision into account and tries the option thats most straightforward and benefitual to the situation. He displays a liking to me and my matureness. He enjoys the playfulness of my sister, and he is patient with my mother - even though she's not patient with him. He also tends to partake in his hobbies to reduce his stress.

Mother: My mother is an outgoing individual, not afraid of voicing her opinion - even if it's not the best idea to do so. She shows signs of being a toxic narcissistic parent and it affects us all. She says she does everything in the house while also neglecting how we feel about her saying it. This started to take a toll on my father because all he wanted to do was keep the family together. She gets angry easily and takes it out on us. My mother is abusive towards my father, always causes me feelings of guilt, and makes [the wrong] choices for my sister.

- at 7/17/2018, 6:58 pm, my father just called me and said my mother threatened him with divorce but he just kept quiet. He kept quiet because he didn't want to stress my sister and myself with a divorce in the family. Also hearing him cry over the phone breaks my heart

- at 7/17/2018, 7:04 pm, my sister just called me and mentioned how my mother said that my sister, myself, and my father need help, but she, herself does not need help.


I just don't know what to do anymore. We tried to get help for her before but she just completely denies her mental status and it negatively affects all of us. My only escape is to wait until college but it's too far away.

*Please note that there will probably be typos, grammatical errors, and parts that will not make sense because my mind is all over the place, so please ask questions. But i will not give specific information outside our personalities and relationships*

4,"So two weeks ago we buried my girlfriend’s mother, very emotional situation, and we are of course all grieving. We kept two rose heads from her casket to make a memory ornament or something out of. We dipped them in wax to preserve them, but they have started molding and growing this cotton type fuzz on them. My girlfriend is very upset and wants to just throw them away but I would like to try and salvage them to make a memory for her mother. Is there anything I can do to keep these preserved (as much as possible) and maybe stop or remove the mold? Any help is appreciated ",18Jul2018,1
6,"I work at a Goodwill Industries in a very small town in Texas. It's a small town surrounded by very rural areas. I moved from out of state and had an extremely hard time finding a job since it's such a small town - Goodwill was the only place that gave me a chance. I started working at Goodwill in December of 2017.  I work in the back/warehouse area pricing all the donated goods. Since Goodwill is all about giving all people a chance in the workforce, there is a WIDE variety of people that work there. They basically have to accept anyone who applies despite their background. The one guy in particular this post is about, I will call him Gary. Gary is 25 years old. He lives 40 minutes away from Goodwill in a secluded, rural area. He didn't graduate high school (no GED/diploma), only has an elementary education as he was home schooled by his bible thumping mother until he was about 10, no drivers license, no vehicle, still lives with his mom and dad whom both do not work due to disabilities and he and his older brother support financially. He and his brother rely on a ride from his dad to drive them into town to work. I've never been close with Gary or would consider him a friend outside of work, we only talk in passing or the usual coworker small talk. However, he did eventually start stopping at my work station more frequent to vent about his frustrations about not being able to get a job anywhere else cause of his lack of GED and that no girl will ever like him. I would kindly and patiently listen, sympathize, and give my sincere opinion and advice to him.  Another elderly woman has witnessed the same things I have and has offered him rides to and from GED classes and even offered to pay it for him in which he declined and said ""there's no point of me even trying."" Around April of 2018, I was waiting in line behind Gary at the time clock. I asked, ""how's it going? Do you work tomorrow?"" and he said ""yeah, but who knows if I will be here"" - my first thought was ""oh, maybe his dad won't be able to give him a ride."" But then he followed it up with ""because someone might find me dead before then...."" I didn't know if this was a cry for help or if he had a dark sense of humor that he was slowly showing to me. I had about another 2 run-ins with him after that where he casually said ""i could die today, i've seen everything i need to"" or something along the lines of that. It made me concerned as I take everyone's feelings and emotions very serious. I started to think about his suicidal comments more and more because I was concerned and would feel guilty if I misread someone's cry for help as a dark sense of humor. So I told my boyfriend everything and said ""would you be okay if I gave him my number so I can tell him if he ever needs someone to talk to in a dark moment, he can reach out to me?"" My boyfriend didn't mind and said he thought it was a good idea. The next day, I walk up to Chad and say ""i'm not sure everything you are going through at the moment but don't want you to feel you are alone. Here is my number if you ever need someone to talk to in a moment of weakness"" he said ""your boyfriend doesn't mind?"" and I said ""I told him I was worried about you and he didn't mind"" - So it was clear it wasn't any sort of romantic or shady advance. It only took a few days before he started sending me close to 10-15 text messages in a row basically feeling sorry for himself and manipulating me into saying what he wanted to hear, things like ""everyone I work with thinks i'm garbage, right? i bet even you do."" At first, I was replying and comforting him and telling him to not be so hard on himself and to stop beating himself up. When he started saying he would be stuck at Goodwill forever and never be able to get a good job or move out from home, I kept encouraging and urging how helpful getting a GED would be. He said ""i don't think God wants me to get a GED. I think God wants me at Goodwill"" I learned fast he thrived off the pity and cranked it up when he saw he was getting sympathy. I gave him a very realistic solution, which the first step of bettering his life would be to get a GED and he would always reject it saying ""only if someone else does the work for me"" or ""I know God doesn't have that in his plan for me."" The messages started multiplying and multiplying over the next week or so. I finally had to confront him and say ""i meant it when I said I was here if you needed someone, but i'm not going to be an outlet for you to pity and trash talk yourself. Im here if you need me, I don't want to listen to you call yourself names"" He stopped messaging me and ignored me for a few weeks at work even though I would still say hi and ask him how he was doing. Sometime around May, a little frog made his way into warehouse, we all gathered to look at it and the girls were saying how cute it was. Gary chimed in and said if he found it first he would have cut its head off and whenever he finds a snake in his yard at home, he cuts the head off. That made my stomach drop because the way he announced it was almost like it was supposed to be funny or boastful. A few days later, he had a violent outburst/reaction when a garbage truck driver who came to pickup a load politely asked him for future reference to have the garbage ready on the other side of the door. Gary started kicking boxes over, punching these large plastic containers til they tipped over, then he finally made his way to the break room where he started kicking the chairs, punching the wall and fridge, and screaming. This has happened many times since then. When he has to dump garbage, he will find the glass items and slam it hard as he can while he screams/growls. One day we found this poorly designed Winnie the Pooh jewelry box where it looked like Eeyore was drowning, Gary said ""if I ever saw an animal laying like that in the water, I would just stand and watch it drown."" Management has been around plenty of time but to no surprise, Goodwill has very bad management and does nothing about it.  The advice i'm asking for is, I generally feel unsafe and uncomfortable working close to someone who has shown manipulation, no remorse towards animals, has a lot of aggression from his family situation/upbringing, and volatile behavior. He's been caught in lies and constantly airs his laundry for sympathy but rejects all reasonable solutions and suggestions. Management hasn't done anything when I've expressed my concern for safety and obviously I don't think confronting Gary head on would be smart. I can't quit because I don't have another job at the moment I could go to. Do you think I'm reading too much into it and he isn't someone to be feel unsafe by? Or am I connecting the dots correctly? I'm sorry for the long explanation, I just wanted to give you some context on why I think he is the way he is and why I feel he may snap. ",18Jul2018,1
7,"I graduated with a MIS degree that was part of the university's school of business. 

2 relevant internships but having difficultly getting an entry level IT job.

Issue is I don't have any exceptional technical skills (coding, networking, etc)",18Jul2018,1
8,"Here's the situation that's causing these feelings at the moment:

I work for a security company that, as I found out at the last second, has just had their last contract in my ""local"" area expire... ""Local"" as in the closest location was 1 hour from my house. The closest location now is two hours from my house. 

They pay for my gas in full and even provide a bunkhouse that their employees who drive long commutes get to share. It's basically a 2-hour drive to the bunkhouse, which is a 10-minute drive from the site. Equipped with a bed, internet, and everything.

I've practically broken my back for this company and they know it. Staying for 24-hour shifts because someone called off, doing runs to help ensure people are well-stocked so management doesn't have to drive 2 hours out to do it themselves (pack of water is only right next door, so why not), being the only one who ensures everything is done right and holds others accountable, etc. Not even six months in they were talking about promoting me to a corporate management job... Which hasn't arrived yet because they aren't stable.

They want me, and keep trying to encourage me, to double my commute and drive to these sites because ""you're my best employee, you're an asset to the entire brand and the company as a whole"". That's from the owner himself and while I believe it, that doesn't sway me from my stance that I shouldn't.

Every shift is a 12-hour shift from 5 to 5. My fight with depression makes it difficult to sleep anywhere that isn't my house or my car. My back makes it hell for me to sleep on any bed that isn't my bed, which I know their little cots will likely screw me up. I'm taking college courses and this fall semester I will have an extremely heavy work load (business analytics, business statistics, and business finance; mandatory in-person classes) and I'm practically obsessed with maintaining a high GPA. This obsession even has me shrugging my 3.2 off as ""meager"", which is one of many tendencies that fuels my depression. The 2-hour drive is literally over 95 miles one-way, my car has 155,000 miles on it and my mother's car is... to put that simply, it's just a miracle it even runs at all. She also has an old spinal injury (cages in her spine) that makes me paranoid to spend the night elsewhere in an extended capacity. Then there's the expectation and literal requirement for me to stay if my relief doesn't show up, which is why I am unwilling to do even one day per week because I've done five 24-hour shifts in the past two months alone due to no-shows and call-offs. Hell, he's been in business for six years and not only does it still seem like he's in his first year but the owner's even said he's expected growing pains for ""at least two more years""...

It's one of those things where I *know* I'm not being unreasonable. I want to help and I can go out once per week or so but the issue is that the pros are vastly outweighed by the cons for me to even do that. ",18Jul2018,1
9,"Hey guys, I was searching for a warehouse job, but unfortunately the job was not available by the time I applied. Instead, the employer offered me another job. The manager offered for me to post 2-3 sponsored ads for the company he worked for every week. The website he ordered me to put ads on is [indeed.com](https://indeed.com), and he would provide an email from [yahoo.ca](https://yahoo.ca) and the details he wants in the ads. He would pay me $250 in money order or certified cheque every week ($1000 monthly) I would do this. I would first be putting my own money into these sponsored ads until my first paycheque. I've never had work before so does this seem reasonable? I think it's a little too good to be true since it doesn't take much work to set up these ads, but then again I guess some of the money that he gives to me will be used towards the ads.",18Jul2018,1
10,"So in my region, many of the kids that grew up in my neighborhood are making the common mistakes I was making at adolescence. And yes, there are mistakes people should make in life. But there are many that are way past learning and are very destructive towards their own life. Resulting in years of depression, almost always undercover because of stigma. . They all have similar childhood stories to mine. Physical abuse, part of the culture when growing up. To ""toughen us up, apparently. Low-income area. Negative and difficult home situations, family issues, childhood neglect etc. In my region, the people are very familiar with each other, that's how I know.

Now, I've learned as I've aged what my own issues were and how to fix them to function more properly(Not all of them, duh). I've also learned mind my damn business, but some of these young guys I've literally seen grow up from babies. And our problems are just so similar. I just can't turn a cheek. It's such a sad scene to see. Of course, there are the ones that excel, but those are few and far between. 

I'm just wondering how I can gauge who I CAN help. And how do I do this? Like, how can I approach this stuff? I know there's a lot of psychology knowledge in these parts of the internet, so maybe some info can help me help others. I also have a tendency to be straightforward. How can I be more subtle?

And it doesn't have to be life-changing, ya know? But mostly they're stubborn. Inviting them to the gym takes me like 900 tries before they cave in. I've seen people have temporary boosts in moral because they stuck to the gym for a couple months. 

So yea, if anyone has been or is in similar situations, from either side of the coin, what do I do?",18Jul2018,3
11,"Both my parents are very religious and participate regularly in church events. My mother prays twice a week with a group and every Sunday I go to church with both my parents. They also plan to go to a sort of religious gathering thing out of state at the end of this month. However, I'm only really required to go to the weekly mass.

The problem is that I'm 18 and about to go to college and they've been reminding me that I have to keep going to church. I've written a letter in a past saying that I'm ""struggling in my faith"" and to ""please be supportive"". But that was put very nicely. Truth is, I have no interest in going and I've decided that for years now. I'd call myself perhaps nondenominational. My idea of God is more abstract than the Church's and I don't agree with some of its teachings. 

I know that since I'm 18, I can technically do whatever I want. Though, I have a very close relationship with my parents and I'm especially sensitive to their feelings. We're asian so family solidarity is important, not to mention the slight cultural difference with white people, where it's normal for an 18 year old to be more independent.

Months ago I struck up a conversation about birth control, and they did not take it well at all. My father was frustrated and upset for a long time. He said I could get it if I needed it, that's not the problem. It's just the emotional turmoil they went through was exceedingly painful and I really don't want to go through a similar ordeal again.

They don't agree with a number of other life choices I've already decided on. I haven't mentioned those either, but the question of religion is the one on my mind right now. Any advice, sentiments, or personal anecdotes are wholly welcome. Thank you very much",18Jul2018,2

My groom-to-be also said that he’s going to stick me with the non refundable expenses, such as my wedding dress, the venue booking, and the honeymoon expenses, as well as the cost to book a barkeep.

15,"I recently had an interview (actually a second interview) for a well known company. A starting position with excellent pay, benefits, and upward mobility. In short, a life changing job that would have allowed me to A) leave the toxic retail world B) stop living out of my junker truck, and C) allow me to save money and pay off debts. 

I was referred by an employee, and I went all out for the interview. I spent a chunk of my (small) savings on a nice outfit, cleaned myself up, tidied my resume, and studied the material for a week prior. 

I went in nervous, but honestly thought the interview went really well. We had an excellent, conversational dialogue, I asked some good questions, and was very open about my eagerness to learn (something they emphasized). I left feeling confident and excited. Hell, one of the interviewers was even commenting on my resume and asked if I might be interested in joining one of his personal teams.

But then, a few days later, I got the email that someone was chosen over me. It wasn’t for a single position, rather a pool of people that will be enrolled in their classes. 

I was devastated. Honestly I’ve never felt so disheartened. Life is not good right now, but I truly thought I had a good shot and this was a fork in the road for me. I thought it would go better.

My friend suggested I reapply occasionally, which I will. Should I wait before doing it? 

I was also in direct contact with the hiring assistant (among her duties was to guide us through the hiring process), and I’ve considered sending her an email professionally stating my enthusiasm for the job and that I really do feel like I would be an asset to the company, something I do believe. But I also don’t want to be obnoxious. 

I can’t help but wonder why I wasn’t chosen, too. I feel like if there was any red flags I put up, I would have an idea of them at least, but like I said I thought it went well. My friend said it may not have been something I did *wring*, necessarily, just that there were better options this time.

18,"Dear reddit,

I'd love some advice to help through the coming weeks as I'm in total despair. I'll set the scene before I expand on the title.

I suffer from depression, which in most part was attributed to the second hand trauma of the rape of my girlfriend before we met - me being the sole person she's confided in.

I tried so hard to help her get the help she needed as she wasn't sleeping and was moved to panic very easily due to the PTSD she incurred. Eventually she went to see the psychologist at her university for help. Long story short this made things worse as said councilor wasn't well versed in rape cases.

I started seeing my own councilor and noticed dramatic improvements and was starting to feel myself again.

Until my then girlfriend said she needed a break to help with her head space, now fair enough I knew things weren't in the best place as our relationship was straining due to our respective troubles. Eventually she told me that we couldn't be in a relationship when she was emotionally unavailable due to the stress involved with finally processing her trauma (2 years later.)

Now I understand this is fair and I'm so proud that she is finally taking control over this, but I cannot imagine hearing anything worse that ""I love you, I want to be with you and I can see myself having a future with you but I can't be with you at the moment because I have to deal with my rape.""

I wouldn't wish this on anyone and it really is truly heartbreaking. She's said to me that she hasn't given up on us and she would like to revisit the idea of us in the future but I would like some advice with how to deal with the roller coaster of emotions I'm experiencing right now. Since she told me I've had panic attacks, moments of happiness and moments of sadness. 

I really am happy for her but don't know if I should hope for us in the future or try to move on. We hadn't been together long in the grand scheme of things at only a year, but we had the strongest relationship out of anyone I knew and we never fought. 

I just don't know what to do, but I have made another appointment with my councilor whom can hopefully help me but it won't be for a few weeks.

Please leave any help or support below.

at dinner, my mom cooks food, but for the rest of the day theres not much to eat but eggs, chicken slices, broccoli, quinoa, tuna, etc. which is okay i guess

they've finally gone shopping after 2 months (we went on vacation for a week) 

they do this a lot. im 18 but a couple years ago, before i started cooking or making meals myself, sometimes theyd just not make dinner. 

technically we could order food or some shit, but its unhealthy, expensive, and we'd need to use my money or my parent's money

my dad keeps making stupid jokes in the text chat saying ""can you bike to the store and get groceries? we're too busy"" and shit like that. my dad always tries to make jokes that arent funny and if i say something he says ""its just a joke!!!!"" 

I'm going to university, but my brother is 16 so he'll have to deal with this for two more years or something. 

If i complain they'll be like ""get a job and buy your own food"" or get angry or something, saying ""we're so busy and tired cant you guys help out?""

20,"So I did a 10km run/race with my friend about two months ago. She kinda made me but I enjoyed it - she brought along her friend. Me and this guy got on pretty well tbh, but not amazing. I usually know if I am gunna be good friends with someone within the first minute and I didn’t get this with him but he was nice enough.

Anyway he now keeps inviting me to these gatherings he keeps having. I am not totally opposed to showing my face but he’s 6 years older than me (relevant because I’m 22 and a student and he’s 28 office worker) even though it doesn’t seem that much of a difference it can be at this age.

It’s just a pretty daunting prospect - go to a gathering with a older group of people where you only actually know one of them. He also lives in a different part of the city than I do and it’s about a 2hr journey. 

How should I handle this? My main problem is that if I say no again then me and him essentially stop being ‘friends’. I don’t actually care but deep down I feel shitty - I don’t like rejecting people when I don’t have a reason too- although I don’t love going to big gatherings of strangers I know I will pretty much be fine, I am good in social situations and force myself into them despite the dread.

But I also want to try being a fighter and I used to practice Maury Thai a few years back. I also want to look into all types of art. The only issue is I feel like I'm to old to make a living doing any of these things. I never knew anyone with actual talent who started so late. I feel like in order to be good enough at certain things to make a living you have to start at a very young age because I've never heard of someone who didn't. Should I just try to do something else? Most people who are talented started their careers a long time ago. Is it worth it to try so late?",18Jul2018,1
26,"hey guys, I'm 18, don't have a license, I'm unemployed, and I don't leave home. not because I don't want to but because of my parents. My parents say i need to focus on my studies, and hence is why I'm not allowed to get a job, even though I've asked them many times. my mother is okay with me getting a job but my dad WILL not let me. I have a small group of friends I've been friends with since middle school and they want me to hang out every now and then, but i always say no, i used to say yes and try to hang out. but my parents would come up with an excuse like ""we don't want you in a car with people of your age"" and so forth. I've seen right through their excuses though, they just do not want me to go. in fact, last time i asked the response was basically ""because i said so"". I've been stuck in my room for about 3-4 months now. my friends still talk to me on discord and stuff but that's about it. can't really play games with them cause my [internet speed is ass lmao](https://imgur.com/a/Ko2PIvq). i spend literally all my time now just in my room watching shows, listening to NAV and working out and sleeping. I've walked around the neighborhood and stuff to clear my mind, except it's more of ""cool, I'm doing nothing outside instead of inside now""  but that's not the full cookie. here's how i mentally feel:   
I've been browsing Instagram and snap-chat every now and then on my phone, and i always see acquaintances or friends having tons of fun and going out and stuff. i feel happy for them but at the same time i feel insanely jealous. I sometimes lay in bed and imagine what tomorrow will be like, and i sometimes perfectly predict it: wake up, feel depressed, entertain myself, eat, feel depressed still, and then sleep. it's been on a loop in my head for a while now. it's like my whole life is just become a repeat episode. 

If you were in my situation, what would you do? i just wanna feel like i'm doing something important instead of letting days fly by.

TL;DR: I'm stuck in my room, don't hang out, no job. need to find something fulfilling to do instead of being bored",18Jul2018,1

Browsing through spam, found an email from someone offering drugs in a really weird way (letters were spaced out and had accents and other weird shit like that littered through it), i dont think they were illegal drugs as it was like viagra and something called ventolin and stuff like that, but it seemed weird due to the domain being something from a jewish community center in pennsylvania. So like, im not sure if the center is legit, but it has a building and a pretty legit looking facebook page and website, but im not sure, is the lady who emailed me even part of this center? If she is, are the employees aware?

30,"Hi all, first time posting here. While out camping with my youth movement I found out someone stole $80 from my wallet. I’m not going to go too much into detail as to what exactly I believe happened. I can tell you I have ruled out every other option and the hard truth is that someone within our group of 25 leaders mist have stolen it while we were setting up the campsite for the kids.

I’m stuck right now, I believed all these people to be my friends. I thought I could trust every single one of them but this is clearly not the case. 

In 2 days I have to decide wether I remain a leader in the youth movement. Honestly I’m leaning towards leaving. I don’t feel like being in this group for much longer. It’s really not all about the money, more about trusting eachother. 

TL;DR :  Someone within my youth movement stole $80 from me, I don’t know who. Deciding wether I stay in this group or leave.

I don't even really care about sex I am just frustrated because my lack of experience makes me feel stupid. and I feel like I am wasting time and I will only get further and further behind others.    

I had the same problem where never having smoked cigarettes started to bother me. I don't care about cigarettes. I don't want to smoke. But like I didn't know anything about smoking so it wasn't that not smoking them was a choice. does that make sense? 
and I am an alternative person so it's such a common thing in that subculture, like I felt stupid and different for having never done it. so it's the same with being a gay guy and having no experience with sex
 
I want it to at least be a choice.

37,"I’ve been with him for a while and his parents live pretty close so we go to see them once a week or more usually. They usually only speak Spanish at home and while they do all speak English pretty well, it’s not as natural and comfortable for them. I’ve been trying hard to learn Spanish by listening to them, studying almost everyday on my own and practicing with my boyfriend when we’re together and his family when I see them. It’s clear they really appreciate the effort and I know eventually I’ll be fluent, but it takes time. The language barrier is sometimes an issue but it’s not a big deal when it’s just the family. Last week, his little sister had a birthday party and they invited a lot of adults (all native Spanish speakers). I tend to be a shy person and not speaking the same language as most everyone at the party definitely makes it harder. My boyfriend’s mom kept him pretty busy doing set up and cooking and stuff and his parents were busy too so I was stuck in a house of 15 or so people that I didn’t know and didn’t know how to talk to. I felt really excluded tbh and since I’m shy I have a hard time just interjecting myself into convos. Even if I could do this, when I would go up to people they’d all be speaking Spanish so I wouldn’t know how to get into the conversation anyway. I tried to talk to my boyfriend about it but all he said was that basically he can’t help me if I don’t want to talk to people. His sister asked what’s wrong with me cause they were talking and I wasn’t saying much but I just wasn’t feeling great cause I didn’t feel like I belonged. I felt really excluded and I want to avoid feeling like this since I know there will be a lot of similar parties and stuff I’ll have to go to in the future.

38,"Long story time, genders and names hidden for privacy. My sibling is an adult now, and we still live a few houses down from the rapists family's home, where they and the rapist still live. When my sibling was still in single digits, the neighbor (a younger teen) molested my sibling multiple times a week for years. We only just learned about this a couple years ago. My sibling would usually go out and play with the rapist and another friend in their area so we had no clue. Nothing ever seemed wrong when my sibling would come back home; would sometimes roll their eyes and say that the rapist was annoying, but never anything bad. So we were obviously shocked and upset by this. I wanted to attack the rapist, but didn't, because I'm not a monster like them.

The rapist now leads a fine life- getting a degree, is ultra religious (yeah, 'cause they're going to heaven after what they did), thinks they're so blessed. They're a monster, and it makes me unhappy that they get to go about their life carefree, while my sibling has suffered massive depression, anxiety, and PTSD because of what this person did. My sibling is getting help, and as God as my witness, will have a happy future. But it just doesn't seem right that the rapist gets to go about their life pretending it never happened and gets to be happy, and their family gets to live with the monster I'm sure they helped to make. 

I want to send a letter to them; just an anonymous letter to the house. Something that's just informative: ""Your child raped someone for years. As your child's confidant, I can no longer keep my silence on what they did to that child."" I figure sounding like a friend of the rapist's might at least prevent my family from being dragged into anything- because we don't want them near us, and especially not near my sister. And you can send letters without a return address. But I think they should know. Maybe they would move out of shame. Or I feel at the very least, they have doubts about their child and they all might end up with ruined lives thinking about what the kid did to my sibling. 

I don't know what to do about this. I just think they should know. Should I send the letter, not, or go a different way? Any help or advice is appreciated!",18Jul2018,3

I ask my brother how he does stuff and he says he either uses both arms together in some way or eliminates the need, like he doesn't wear shoes he has to tie.

This is not my problem to deal with and I should be accepting and such, I know, but I get short of breath and start to feel like I'm having a heart attack when I see this kid eating or tying his shoes. I want to help him but that would be embarrassing and offensive. How can I stop having this kind of reaction and just act like it's all normal.

My Fiancee and I just broke off our relationship this past weekend mainly because we're both unhappy and we don't take time to do things for ourselves or take care of ourselves. 

So this coming weekend she's off work and is willing to take care of the dogs and she said I could do whatever I want, and she suggested I see my parents if I wanted to.

\- my 3 servers in the basement (also obvious if I take those as one runs the internet)

\- my laptop, phone, Nintendo Switch (I'd be taking those with me anyways)

61,"Hey everyone, bit of backstory here:

I'm involved in a small online community. Like 4 years ago, I met up with someone I didn't know very well from this community, we got drinks and had a one night stand. I regretted it pretty much immediately but ultimately wasn't a big deal, no one else found out as far as I know, etc. 

Now, I've gotten really close with a girl from this community. We've talked about how much we (platonically) care about eachother and she knows I have a crush on her, and that we're both attracted to each other. She lives super far from me and I'm planning on visiting  soon, and have been pretty up front that we might hook up on this trip. 

As the trip gets closer, it kind of hit me that the first encounter might be something she should know about. Our community skews heavily male and while she's not the jealous type and it's not like I owe her my entire sexual history, the similarities make me wonder if it's something she deserves to know -- so she can make the judgment for herself that I'm sort of weirdo trying to fuck my way through the women of the community (i'm super not, i know plenty of the other women in the community and we're friends and nothing more, and I want nothing more). Plus, her situation is so different because I care deeply about her and the first thing was just a drunken one night stand. I wouldn't lie to her if she asked but I'm debating on whether or not it's something worth bringing up.

I asked her if she wanted water and I started to sit down on a nearby chair and said I can sit with her for a few minutes while she rides it out. She said no, she just wants to be left alone. I didn't want to force myself to help her if she didn't want it so I took her advice and left. I walked to a nearby lot to grab my bike and rode past the entrance maybe 5 minutes later. She was still sitting by the window with her head buried in her hands. I stopped and went to ask again if she's sure she's okay and if she wants something to eat. I had a banana and granola bar and offered them but she said no thanks. I said okay and left.

I didn't feel good about leaving someone who was so visibly in discomfort/pain but she kept telling me it's okay and that she wanted to be alone so I decided to do as she said. 

Did I do the right thing in that scenario? Redditors who suffer from migraines, do you just want to be left alone or was there something more I could have done. It was a super hot and humid day today and even I felt a little faint which is why I'm wondering if I did the right thing by leaving her be. I'm worried it may have been heat stroke related or something.",18Jul2018,2
70,"About a year ago I went on vacation with friends to celebrate my birthday and met a man and mutually sparked a fling. The original post and backstory can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/76s7nf/international\_love\_with\_a\_man\_20\_yrs\_my\_senior/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/76s7nf/international_love_with_a_man_20_yrs_my_senior/)

Since that post, I visited him 5 times in his country and which one time he flew me out, and he's even came to visit me twice. I went back to his country with friends for my birthday this year and it was a great time....or at least i thought. Once i boarded the plane and settled in my seat for takeoff, i received a series of text messages from him stating that he could no longer see me and had to end it, or things would not end well between us. I'm so confused and him and i have not spoken or text since. i didn't make a big deal bc i figured, it's his decision and i never want to convince someone to stay when they obviously made up their mind without considering a discussion with me.

Now i'm just feeling stuck in some type of limbo wondering if i'll ever hear from him again, if he even cares, or what is going on. Has anyone been through this or something similar and can offer advice? I would like to him from him again, but i doubt he cares...",18Jul2018,1

72,"I was with my dog and my bf at the park when I noticed around 9am a man hiding a book under a bush, turning around several times and running away after he finished, it was odd but I didn't care much, we walked home shortly after but at 2pm I noticed that I had forgotten my dog's collar at the park so I returned there and found it laying on a bench, I had probably left it there when I took it off my dog's neck but I noticed something: the book was still under the bush, I decided to check out if the book had a name on it, maybe the man was trying to pull a prank on a friend, but what was inside disturbed me...l took some pics (https://imgur.com/a/bSmxRk4), I know that the 01 stuff is binary code, then the circled words are ""dieci"" (10), ""quattro"" (4), ""autunno"" (autumn), “bacon”, “mezzogiorno” (12:00), “spegnere” (turn off) then the underlined stuff is “g”, “i”, “o”, “r”, “n”, “i”, that I thinks means ‘Giorni’ which means ‘Days’, then “Sky” is underlined as well, idk what that means but there is this very popular TV platform called “Sky”, it’s Australian but it is in a lot of countries.
And here I am at 5am still thinking about that book, which btw is “Fahrenheit 451” by Ray Bradbury, the only thing I managed to somewhat figure out is one blank page with some symbols on it, the symbol on the left (ЯIR)  represents Latin and Roman culture while the one on the right (triangle stuff) represents the German ethnicity (thanks to Führerreich Lmao), the symbol between them is the Bluetooth icon, I’m very passionate about history so I know that it is a Nordic rune and stands for “Blue Tooth” who was a danish King who managed to gather together all the Viking realms convincing them to put their differences aside (same as The Bluetooth which links different devices together) but I have no clue at all about the other stuff or the meaning of that (Latin/Roman and Germanic cultures putting their differences aside and linking up[?]), I hope that somebody understands something about this mess.

73,"Before anyone comments, please be aware that I am no way trying to defend, justify, or downplay my actions in any way shape or form. What I did is wrong, and I acknowledge that completely.
This night, I've realized something I did was very, VERY bad, and I'm now facing a moral conundrum over it.

A year or two ago, my friends and I decided to get together to watch some TV shows (mainly The Simpsons, but some other shows also). Me, at the time being a horny and unattractive teenager, decide I'd get some extra ""excitement"" out of our meetings. 

While no one was looking I would slide my hand to a female next to me, and cop a feel of her. When they noticed, I'd pull it back and pretend it was an accident.

At the time, I thought it was just a playful way of being sneaky with my friends. Now, though, I realize how disgusting and slimy my actions were. No one deserves to be touched without their consent, and for that to be done to you in secret by one of your friends must be truly horrifying. 

So now, the way I look at it, I have two option:

1.Confess what I've done and face the consequences, apologizing to the people I did that to and facing potential jailtime.

2. I don't tell anyone, and live with the fact that I'm not much better than a flat-out rapist, constantly having the fact that I did that on my conscience 

That is why I need your help. If I confess, I could potentially ruin my entire future, but I don't know if I could really live with myself knowing I did what I did. I know opinions on my actions will be divided (if not unanimously hated), but please just point me in the direction you think I need to go the most.",18Jul2018,0

76,"I have this list of prioritized career goals:


*very important*
- 40k a year salary eventually
- Masters required max
- Viable in many cities
- Good benefits (insurance, vacation time, etc)
- No more than 40 hr week, I like 35 really
- Not too hard on my body

*important*
- Contributes to the community
- Work at a nonprofit/co-op/gov
- Varies day to day
- Interaction with people, community/coworkers
- Potential for advancement
- Work with a team
- Requires critical thinking and problem solving sometimes

*would be cool*
- Occasional travel
- Uses my spanish somehow

*absolute cherry on top*
- Work with a diverse team, different cultures


Keep in mind this would be an absolutely ideal career. I know I will never get all of these things and compromise is necessary; that's why they're prioritized. I'm merely brainstorming. Any occupations come to mind that would meet some of these goals?

77,"I'll try to keep the backstory for this short. Basically a close friend of mine starting treating me like crap over a period of four months. Essentially I hadn't heard from them in a while after they had told me they weren't sure if they wanted to be friends during the fourth month and I eventually I figured I'd never hear from them again and send them a letter saying I was going to move on and walk away from our friendship. Then a month later they sent me a letter back saying they still wanted to be friends, but I didn't bother responding because I was over it by that point and it didn't seem worth it. It's been about three weeks since then now.  


Earlier today I posted a general tweet about how sometimes toxic/unhealthy relationships don't always have to mean abusive relationships and instead can just mean relationships having very negative effects on your life. I also said it's possible for a relationship to become unhealthy even if both people involved are good people and aren't necessarily completely to blame. Like I said this was a general tweet and wasn't about any one specific person, although the relationship I described could fall into the category. The friend I stopped talking to posted a tweet pretty soon after about how some people like to play the victim card and will make everything about themselves. It seemed pretty clear it was most likely about me after seeing my tweet. It just really annoys me because I'm not that type of person at all and the irony is in the letter this person had sent me they even owned up to the fact that they were the one to blame in our friendship falling apart. I know I shouldn't care, but I just can't help it. Does anyone have any advice for how to learn to not care about what this person thinks of me?",18Jul2018,2

82,"tldr: this is a pity party about losing my job and feeling like shit

So I was in a leadership position, found out I apparently wasn't doing so hot and was basically manipulated into stepping down rather than offered tools to do better. Yes it was a stressful position but I loved my coworkers and it was a really good job. I prematurely agreed to step down rather than taking more time to think about it, I was feeling emotional and guilty and thought it was what I was supposed to do. 

I almost immediately regretted my decision but made the mistake of waiting over my weekend to tell my boss and she already filled my position. I was heartbroken. I still feel like all my time, energy, blood, sweat and literal tears have all been for nothing. I feel like I just don't matter at all. It was a huge pay cut right off the bat. I eventually got over that, got a second job that made tips and moved on from that issue. This company has excellent benefits and time off, especially for something in the food industry so even with the pay cut it's still worth it to ride it out. 

The thing that has been the hardest to overcome has been my actual job performance and it being judged/ reviewed by a new manager at a new location where I didn't know anyone. I've been trying to accept that I no longer was a part of the team I'd grown close to, feeling stripped of my confidence, just generally feeling depressed and hopeless because my schedule had also changed from 40hrs to 24hrs, putting me at risk to lose my benefits I was trying to hold out for. I started applying for other less skill- that-I-am-trained oriented positions because there would be full time hours and I know it would make me a million times happier. I got shut down from this. I was told that if I wasn't thriving in one position they would not hire me in another. That was when I was like you know what, I'm pulling myself out of this, no more ""woe is me"" bullshit, I'm going to be positive, kick ass and show them the bad ass I really am!! That was three weeks ago and know for a fact I've done a complete 180 and I've felt really good about my performance and almost happy for the first time in months. 

And then I got fired. Because of my shitty job performance, I know everyone needs to be held accountable but I just thought I'd have more time. More opportunity to state my case, make them understand how hard I'm trying and how important the relationships I've built have been. They've been growing and becoming more corporate so everything was just so impersonal. 

Tomorrow I go to HR to pick up my paycheck. My boss who I love and supports me so much but unfortunately lost the battle in trying to keep me (her position has changed, also complicated) told me to explain how complicated the situation has been and that she would do everything she could to make sure I'm at least rehireable. There have been policy changes recently as the company becomes more corporate and I'm one of the first people who have had to face them and she wants to make sure this never happens again. I'm just so sick to my stomach and I can't stop crying. How do I tell people? My fiance? Our wedding is in 3 weeks!!! There's no way I can deal with being 100% honest about this until after the wedding. I just know how disappointed in me everyone in my life is going to be.",18Jul2018,2
83,"I recently started working again after finishing my associate's degree. I work at a restaurant chain. I have 2 years experience working for this chain and now I am working at a different location within the chain. For reference, it's been six years since I worked at the previous location and some of the way we do business has changed, so I'm still getting used to some aspects of my work.

Mostly people have been pretty decent to work with and I haven't gotten an excessive amount of complaints about how I do my job since I'm already mostly familiar with what I'm supposed to be doing.

Except for this one girl I work the drive-thru with. Sometimes when I make a small mistake she complains about it dramatically. I accidentally put sauce on a plate that wasn't supposed to have it and she literally stomped her foot on the ground and said ""UGHHH!"" like I had made a huge mistake. The error was easily remedied with little delay and we didn't have a lot of orders at the time so it's not like I made a customer wait an insane amount of time for their food. 

There was also a time when I pulled out a specific plate for an order and she just kept repeating in my face something like _""That's the wrong plate. That's the wrong plate. That's the wrong plate,"" like I'm clueless or something and it turned out I had grabbed the correct plate and she was the one who was wrong. I doubt she would have appreciated it if I started stomping my feet and being like ""UGHHH. This _is_ the right plate! Don't you know anything?!""

I understand that I am not perfect at my job but I fill the vast majority of my orders correctly and I'm not slow. If I didn't have any experience working there and she had to train me from the ground up (which can take awhile) I would understand her frustration, but I mostly fill the orders on my own without having to be told what to do. Even the managers have told me I'm doing alright.

It's really irritating to me that she treats me like I'm stupid though. I don't know if I should say something about it or just suck it up and move on, but it does hurt me to be treated like a dummy. I've been trying to ignore her but I get tired of her acting like I can't do things right. I'm sure we're going to have to spend more shifts together and I really don't want to say or do anything that I'm going to regret later, but it grates on my nerves to work with her.

84,"Hi guys! I’m an upcoming freshman next year at university, and one of my goals - both for university and life in general - is to become a much more sociable and charismatic person. I’d like to know what kind of jobs I can get as a college student with experience working back-of-the-line in fast food that would help me get out of my shell socially.

I actually got a summer job this year at a fast food restaurant hoping to improve my people skills, but I was mostly just placed in the back of the line in the grill, where 80% of my coworkers speak exclusively Spanish, and I didn’t really have any good opportunities to interact with customers (which is what I was hoping for)! 

So can anyone here name me some good jobs that actually fit the schedule of a college student that improve social skills? I was thinking maybe becoming a waiter, or working in a customer service or university call center - the advantage of a university call center being that it’s covered under a Federal Work-Study program.

86,"I guess some backstory. I’m 19 about to be 20 in September. 

When I was in spring of 11th grade my mom got sick (Lupus or something, honestly she might be faking it but that’s a whole different post.) 

Anyway she went to the hospital and was there for about a month. I ended up skipping a lot of school to be able to care for and do all the general house duties for my younger brothers. (11yrs old and 1yr old at the time.). Things progress my mom misses a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma. 

Now here’s where shit really hits the fan. So tensions build between my grandma and my mom because of my moms suspected prescription opiate and Benzo abuse. Anyhow, dfchs gets involved (not related to the drugs but that didn’t help) about 4 months before I go to college and my moms health deteriorates seemingly out of nowhere. So freshman and sophomore year I’m juggling trying to work to support myself, school, and helping my grandma take care of my brothers. I thought I could handle it, I couldn’t.

Of course my schoolwork suffered and my gpa dropped below Hope eligibility. 

So I tried to find a full time job, and I did. Then got laid off not too soon after due to “budget cuts.” My first time experiencing adulthood.

Shortly after my car died and my depression got to a dark place.


What followed is 3 grueling and miserable months of applying to anything I could reasonably walk to or do online(I was trying to search within 5miles) because transportation in the part of Georgia I was in was a huge deal and I could not get around. 


No jobs responded. Including the Walmart a mile away with a fucking hiring sign out front that I repeatedly went in to try and talk and build rapport with the managers. 

During these 3 months I took out 3 credit cards and ended up maxing them out. I needed food and other essentials that I simply had no money for. 

The depression kinda spiraled out of control.

I had a plan in place to hang myself but my friends at the time took the rope I was going to use and I was too broke to buy another. 

My dad who has been in and out of my life. Mostly out prior to this. Invited me out to come stay with him and his family in LA while I tried to get myself together.

I’m working hard, I found a job here. Retail but it’s a job. I’m waking up early (between 6 and 7 am regardless of work), I’m participating in noFap and I’m working out 3x a week to try to keep my depression in check. 

But despite all that, I want to die still. But that might be for a therapist to handle. Although can’t afford one so /shrug for now I guess. 

I don’t see a future where I’m able to continue school. Dfchs told me they couldn’t help pay for college because “I wasn’t in for long enough before beginning college” but they had no fucking problem coming to my dorm and asking me questions and causing stress once a week. 

I feel like I’m barely supporting myself, and honestly I haven’t talked to my brothers since the youngest ones birthday (April 15th). Because I feel like I failed them. I haven’t talked to my grandma either because I feel like a disappointment. I have no real savings, nothing I enjoy anymore. I’m just existing in the worst way.

And my mom keeps calling me every other month telling me she’s gonna kill herself because she feels like nobody loves her. Even through I bent over fucking backwards trying to help her by bringing my brothers to see her and making sure they could talk. 

(My grandma and the rest of my moms family won’t talk to her because she’s cursed all of them out horribly when they tried to be there for her).

My friend pulled me aside to tell me that he did something bad. That something bad was: He got drunk with this older woman (30ish), she supposedly fell asleep, rolled on top of him, and he said he groped her. When he told me I was repulsed and pissed off. I was disgusted by him. But he showed me HOW guilty and sorry he was. This is a guy who in general, isn't very open about his feelings. So when he told me he did that, and showed me this foreign side of him, I felt bad. I immediately told him to tell this girl what he did. He agreed to it. I figured the victim will call the shots on what to do. But I have some questions.

Can I stay friends with someone who sexually assaulted a stranger without knowing? Should I be the friend who can lend him sympathy? Does he deserve sympathy? Forgiveness? Ok torn because I love my friend. He's been there for me through everything, but my moral compass is saying ""DUDE HE TOUCHED SOMEONE WHILE THEY WERE ASLEEP. NO CONSENT. UNFORGIVABLE"" do I just leave it up to the girl to handle the situation? What happens if he doesn't tell her? Do I step in? Do I call the cops? Please help me reddit.

TL;DR: my friend got drunk, groped a girl who was sleeping. I know it is absolutely 100% wrong and he needs to tell her. Should I stay friends with someone who obviously did something horrible?

91,"Okay, so bare with my here, this is probably gonna get lengthy. 

So I'm only 16, and this is my first job. I understand it's gonna be difficult in the beginning and such but I feel so extremely stressed and just lost. I work in a smoothie place and while the job itself like the tasks I do aren't hard (most of them at least), I feel very lost and confused A LOT. My training was practically nonexistent. The first day I went in to do orientation, the manager wasn't even present.. I worked with someone from another store.  I was sat down to fill out a bunch of paperwork and stuff but a few things couldn't be completed because again, the manager wasn't there. So there's that red flag already. My first official day working was spent reading a huge ass training book and none of the words stuck at all. I didn't even know how to clock out until my 4th day which is just the cherry on top of it all. As far as coworkers, most of them seem to be really nice and we get along well, but there's times where I feel like I'm annoying them by asking for help or when they tell me something I've done was wrong. I feel like they all think I have more experience than I actually do, so I look dumb asking these questions. Maybe it's just the anxiety speaking, but this is another thing that contributes to my stress.

Another huge problem I'm facing is trying to do register. This is where everything went downhill. I have pretty bad anxiety at times, but it's gotten a lot better but there's still those few times I get choked up. But I was very briefly taught how to do the register like minutes before we opened and started my shift so I was already in freak out mode. My manager helped me a few times throughout the day and things started to progressively get better and easier, or at least I thought so. At the end of my shift, I went to count my till and ended up $9 short. I had absolutely no idea how and still don't. It had to have been something on the manager's part as she told me she counted it and then just shoved me to it. But anyways, I got written up for it. I was absolutely dumbfounded and losing my shit on the inside as I didn't know what this meant or what to do next, all I knew is that something got screwed and it was on me. 

Needless to say, when I got home, I just spent all night bawling. The stress of this job combined with my already existing severe depression and anxiety was a shitshow. I was so miserable and just distraught. I don't remember the last time I've ever felt that bad and ready to end it all tbh lmao. But the next two following days were just awful. I couldn't bring myself to think of anything else but having to return to work the following Monday. I was absolutely dreading it and I swear within the 48 hours that passed, I had developed literal ptsd over doing it again. 

Monday came and everything was smooth that day, I stuck to making smoothies and stuff but then today however, I was back on register. I was so scared I was gonna be short again I could hardly function doing register. I made sure to count the cash amounts I was receiving and giving back a good 5 times, but I was so anxious and nervous and kept getting all fidgety. Come the end of my shift I had 270 in my till, so I thought for sure I was fine. Nope.

Apparently I was never taught how to enter my till amount and stuff related. So after I counted everything up, wrote it down and all, I headed back to the register and put in 270 as the amount. Nobody had told me I needed to subtract 100 from that number then enter it, so I thought I was fine and clocked out. I was ready to pat myself on the back for finally doing register without having a meltdown or something going wrong, then the team manager on my shift scolded me a bunch as if it was my fault for not being taught that and clocking out afterwards even though I was 30 mins behind when I should've gotten out. I apologized a bunch and tried to help with anything I could but she just seemed even more annoyed with me now. So they called general manager and everything to figure out and still didn't figure anything out, and then let me clock out. 

Again, leaving work stressed as hell and dreading returning. I know people say it gets easier and the beginning is never easy, I understand that and I agree, but I literally don't know if I'll be able to handle it mentally and emotionally. Everyone says I should give it at least 2 weeks, but if I have to spent another 2 weeks feeling THIS miserable... I literally will not be able to function. I've already lost my appetite and sleep over this. At this rate, this job will quite literally be the death of me. 

So I guess in conclusion, do I stay? Is it worth it? Should I just try and tough it out..? ",18Jul2018,1
92,"I'm a girl and I'm about to turn 18. I've been thinking about getting a specific tattoo of some black work flowers on my arm since I was in 9th grade and I'm about to confirm my appointment for august 30th. The thing is, I have a dad who is a complete maniac when it comes to tattoos. I've mentioned several times that I like them and I plan on getting one but he has always yelled at me about it. I just brought it up again because I'm turning 18 in about a week and I don't want to have to go behind his back. Unfortunately he said if I ever get a tattoo I should be prepared to move out and to never speak to him again. He went so far as to say he will divorce my mother if it means he will never have to see me again. He says I should wait for when I have a job and a house so I never need to come back to him for anything.  

This tattoo means a lot to me and in the future I see myself having almost my whole body filled. I feel incomplete without any tattoos. I'm at a point where I don't feel like myself and this tattoo is gonna help me redefine my body. Especially since I'm moving away for college at the end of September. I want a fresh start in a body where it feels like I truly belong(sorry this all sounds so cheesy). Although I am moving away, I'm still going to be relying on him a lot. He's helping me pay for college and I'm gonna have to come back during breaks so I'm terrified he'll stop paying if he finds out. 

Basically, I'm asking for advice on whether to do this or not. I've found an artist who is absolutely talented and I'm lucky to even get the chance to be tattooed by her. I am going to be paying for it and I guess I'll just have to hide it for a couple of weeks until I move away. What do you guys think? At this point I don't think it's worth waiting since it doesn't seem like his opinion is going to change anytime soon. ",18Jul2018,1
93,"I'm a 17 year old male and if having 2 big issues and I don't want to ask my parents because they'll likely give me some dumb sugar-coated answer. I would just appreciate someone to read and give advice if they have any. Overall I'm extremely confused and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I can't stand this generation of soft airy lazy ass kids and I have a huge desire to change so as not to be like that. 

1. Concerned about my future financial situation. 
I spend most of my time thinking about money. My parents want me to do the college experience like they did but I don't want to and I don't see any payoff With it. I'm also tired of the whole school thing. However I am looking forward to Seinor year because I want a one more year with my classmates before we all go off on our ways. I also want to move out and pay all my own stuff after high school. i want to be able years later look at my success and know it is all mine. I don't want to be like all these privileged white kids, at this point I've got more respect for the criminals. I have a big desire for money and I am willing to work hard for it, I'M currently applying for a part time job.

2. Having""an identity Crisis"".
Throughout my childhood I've always been a really shy and quiet rule abiding kid. I'm used to my teachers talking about how I'm like a good kid and student. But truth was I was just a conformist to shy to violate the no talking policy and the teachers were racially biased as I'm often the only white kid in class. But now I recently decided that I hate my personality. I've become rebellious and I've recently started to enjoy facing my fears from a social standpoint.  I recently decided to stop hanging out with my dad who I've been really close to because he has the same personality as me and I don't want to be like him but deep down it makes me feel bad. I really appreciate the financial support he's given my family and I love him but I feel like he has coddled me to much and caused me to be the soft little kid Im trying to vear away from now.

94,"I had a one year relationship with this who Icwas friends with for two years. We liked each other a lot. I had an issue with her best friend. so i asked to curb their meetings and talk. i asked her to take time and decide. One month later she came back saying I can do that but you never cared for me, so I don't feel like coming back. I had one chance of showing this care when her mother was ill and that time I didn't. Otherwise there was no such incident of not caring. I tried to makenthings right but in doing so I constantly messaged and called her for three days. We met one day in those three days and it didn't go well. That same day I begged her to meet again and behave nicely. It was raining and I called and messaged her constantly to meet me. I even reached out to her friends for help. She was pissed. we met. She said dont you understand no means no. Why are you acting like an idiot. Let me go. Dont call or message after this.  Didn't go well. I decided to let go. I couldn't. I contacted her begging for another chance. I told her we can be friends only but don't cut me lose. She agreed. I got carried away and sent a mushy text. She got pissed and angry. I apologised. She blocked me. Next morning i messaged her on Instagram apologizing. She blocked me there too saying I was selfish and didn't ever think about her. Blocked there too. She called me half an hour later ranting and yelling at me angrily asking me never to reach out to her again. 
Next morning she realised I reached out to her friends two days before. She sent me many texts saying she would contact my parents and if I cross lines then too she would go to police. She asked me to please let her govand leave her and her people alone. This is all of it.

She liked me a lot. This was both of our first relationship. I know anger drives a person crazy and we say things we don't mean at all. 

I want to ask is this a general thing? Does everyone say things they don't mean when anry?

I plan to give her space. I have asked her best friends to take care of her for a month. After one month I will meet her with her best friends and talk all of it through hoping she is less angry on me and all this was just her anger talking.

Why I think it is only anger. We were very good friends for  a year before we dated. We were good in relationship as well. Only some mistakes from mine and her side. I think my three days of constant contacting her is what tipped her off. I was wrong in doing that. 

I hope she is ready to talk with an open mind after a month. 

She is not a person who can give up easily. She had a crush and it took a year to get over. And this was a relationship. 

I hope talking to her after a month, accepting my mistakes, remindong all good memories can help. Please advice.",18Jul2018,1
95,"I feel like my dad is a very selfish person. He comes home to sleep and eat dinner but doesn't talk much to my mom. He usually just looks at his phone all the time; even more than a teenage girl. He is really uncleanly around the house and doesn't care about complaints because my mom cleans it I guess. I guess he got his selfishness from my grandma. He wants me and my mom to respect his mother, but doesn't really give a damn about my mom's mother who has kidney failure. He takes his friends out to eat more than he does with our family. I feel like he is treating my mom as a stranger. My mom is putting up with him because my mom doesn't want me to have a bad life and I feel kind of bad for her. What should I do?

98,"First(14), I had social anxiety and stress from being kinda tight finically at home. I wore the same clothes for about two years and after all those voices in my head  I just couldn't handle going to school  and feel like I was being judged, so then I started skipping school (1-2 out of 5 days per week) for the last two years and didn't get the other half of the credits I needed. 

So then after(18), I got a job at some supermarket and worked there for half a year but then quit and decided that it was shit. And then depression hit hard and just stayed home regretting and thinking about my decisions and trying to find options to try and improve myself but also overthinking about them, what could go wrong and all that.

Now (20):
I've got ahold of myself and my depression, still have se social anxiety though. I have one idea(go to job corps) that seems like it might be worth it but I'm seeing if maybe you guys have any others. Also, any specific trades that will stand the test of time? Heard that alot of trades are starting to dry up right now. I'm just glad I didn't start drinking/ doing drugs because I'd probably would've taken longer.

99,"My sisters 18th birthday was today, I'm 20. We've always been really close. Today she asked me to come over to her girlfriends apartment to celebrate her birthday. I knew some people would be there, but i didn't know all the details because my sister is very unorganized. 

When i got there my fiance and I realized my sisters girlfriend's ex-girlfriend was there. My sister and her girlfriend are still ""friends"" with the ex but it makes me and my fiance uncomfortable because the ex has been caught multiple times talking crap behind everyone's back and the ex specifically hates me for no reason whatsoever, i don't think we've exchanged words before. 

My sister was aware that the ex's presence makes me upset and uncomfortable (I have really bad anxiety and anger issues that I've been working on and seeing the ex made it really hard to remain in control of my emotions) but i decided to be calm and try and have a good day for my sister.

When my fiance and i went into the apartment we greeted everyone and sat on the couch and played with their dog. There was more people than i thought and everyone i knew closely was busy so i chatted with my fiance

Keep in mind my sister never thanked me for coming, and never thanked me for our gift. She came over and read the card with us and laughed at it and then went away. The whole time i was sitting on the couch i was really uncomfortable because people weren't really talking to us and the ex had gave me a dirty look before moving to another room after we sat down. 

My sister saw that i was visibly uncomfortable and came to sit across from me on the couch. She immediately started attacking me. She asked me why i was making an ugly face and i told her i was uncomfortable. She got angry really fast and asked me when i would stop being so fucking depressed to which i responded that i was trying my best. I was at least giving it my best shot. She didn't like my answer and started angry laughing and said ""Here we go again, you always have to make everything about you!"" to which i was shocked and upset at her words.

I said ""Okay i will leave then"" I grabbed my purse and stood up to leave, i had already began crying. She blocked my path to the door and tried to get me to go to another room to talk to her and i just kept asking her to please move out of my way because i wanted to go outside and calm down for a minute. 

She kept getting louder and blocking my path, causing a scene. She finally let me go with an attitude and more harsh words. I went out to my car and cried. My sister has blamed me for ""making everything about me"" on different occasions as well like her high school graduation (During her graduation she ignored all her family and spent the day with her friends and didn't organize how we were supposed to meet up afterwards, i was left trying to navigate an entire group of people while getting yelled at by my mom, sister, and dads side of the family. It's a really complicated story but that's some background on that)

My fiance joined me in the car and i cried for awhile before my sister texted me that i was being ridiculous and that i had not tried to be civil enough to sit in the same room as the ex (The ex left the main room, not me) and that i was making her birthday about myself.

Eventually she came outside and argued with me more. my sister has narcissistic qualities and it really showed today. She didn't want to hear anything i had to say and continued to blame me for causing a scene and making everything a big deal. She told me to get over it (the ex being there) and that i needed to grow up. I told her i tried to do everything i could, all i did was sit in the house quietly. We weren't even there a total of 5 minutes before my sister was angry that i wasn't chatting with every single person and being the ex's best friend.

Eventually she got tired of me trying to explain my feelings and proceeded to tell me that she shouldn't have to deal with this and it's not her problem and that she didn't have time to deal with it because it's her day. In the end she slammed my car door on me and went back inside the apartment and i was left distraught wondering what i did wrong.

I'm sorry it's such a long post. It's a complicated story with a lot of background. I'm not sure what to do anymore with my sister. I really tried my best to do what she asked. I don't feel like i did anything wrong. How should i handle this?",18Jul2018,2
100,"So, everyone tells me I overthink, but I'm used to growing up with someone who would only minorly telegraph their abusive rages so generally assuming ""they don't like X"" or ""they're mad about Y"" or ""if I bring up Z they'll punish me.""  I'm used to a bad pattern of over-sharing or not saying anything.

I know it's a toxic behavior and I've explored it in writing fiction, but awareness /= a solution. Every kind of rejection--jobs, scholarships, or social--or even harder percieved rejection like not getting likes, attention, or no one reacts positively to a joke or a story or something I'm excited about and my mood will 180. Apparently its common in ADHD individuals, but I don't want the background of it--I want to fix it. 

I'm aware of it (sometimes, sometimes my negative first assumption will be brought to my attention by someone else) but it seems to be constant. When I take opposite action like being positive it crashes down quickly if someone tries to dismantle it. ""Butch Hartman is inspiring and--"" ""He's a hypocrite and clickbaity."" Like I'm aware of the bad side, I'm the one who sees it all the time, I just wanted to vocally focus on the good side. I then get vindictive and spiteful or jealous and out for blood. I never act on it and most of the time I talk myself through what they could be thinking and if I hurt their feelings. 

I know I'm caught up in a ""assume they won't tell me yes. They won't like me. They all believe I'm bad. Im weird and no one likes me"" even if I don't post it all over social media. I know a D/R on a message can cause panic even if I can logically pick it apart as ""they're busy or don't know what to say.""

Like I don't get it. I'm aware and able to reason, but the emotional side always wins. 

I'm just learning to cry again and trying to work on rebuilding emotional empathy, because I know I don't know my emotions and so when other people get emotional I shut down or just just become cold and factual. I know it's useful sometimes, but I don't want to be cold. I don't want to be living in ""trauma screwed me up so why change"" mentality. I want to be healthy minded so I don't do anything toxic like become physically/emotionally abusive. 

But yet I can't seem to shake off the age old coping method of ""ha, cant hurt me if I already predicted this was going to happen and shut down to protect what little mind I have."" Because when people mean well and you still have that mindset it ends in you causing what you're scared of. ",18Jul2018,2
101,"Sometimes I want to scream ""well sorry I'm depressed, living tends to be a chore."" But I know they won't take it seriously. My family likes to call me dramatic and lazy. I've self-harmed in the past, but stopped because it didn't really do anything. And when my parents ""found out"" (private school principal intervened, but that was the extent) I was told to stop and just pray whenever I felt like cutting. Then they would guilt trip me by saying I was basically insulting Jesus by making my suffering more important. Yeah. 


So basically it's been me trying to get the point across though hints and outright asking. But nothing has happened. My mom said she might have found someone though our pastor, but still nothing. 


Sometimes it's like I'm stuck in the backseat of my own mind, and I don't know whose driving. I keep wanting to scream, but have absolutely no control. Or it's like trying to wrestle the 'wheel' away while in the backseat. 

I can't even tell my parents I'm not straight because that's automatic conversion therapy, which my church fully supports.


I can't sleep, I can't eat anything that's not plain, I'm always wound up. I don't know who I even am anymore. 


Most of all I'm scared I'll hurt myself again if I lose control. It's what happened when I first cut, and it was horrible. I feel like I've always been sort of crazy (I used to full out have panic attacks and pull out my hair in elementary) but that it's only gotten worse in the past few years.


I'm pretty sure I have some sort of social problems, but when I try to bring up add/adhd or stuff my parents say that I'm normal or that doctors over-medicate society.",18Jul2018,1
102,"I NEED HELP!

My mom said I have to move in as soon as I am done with school (am currently a college junior) because she says she is not going to live much longer and I need to take care of her.

Problem is she only says that but it is hard for me to believe. She really buys into fortune telling and the superstition beliefs. She claims she is really sick (cancer but she fought it off) and the fortune teller said she needs love and compassion from your first born son 24/7 or it returns. But I think she will be around for a while. She is only 46 and I am 21. 

I don't want to sound mean but I am so excited to kickstart my life, but I have to move in and take care of her for years (god knows im not wishing for her death). 

I want to say no but if I do she will be extremely depressed. She is an alcoholic so when she gets drunk she talks about how everyone in her life hates her, and I really dont want her to push herself over the edge (she has threatened suicide). 

I can take care of her once she gets older but I want to have a life ready, I dont want my knowledge to go to waste, my prime physique, getting married, etc.

She currently lives with her husband, two daughters aged 6 and 3. She says her husband cannot do it because he does not truly love her or some stuff.

I know my mom to be a bit unique but is there a way I can go about this?

103,"Okay so my brother and his girlfriend have been dating for over two years now (both 19). They were planning on going to a music festival soon (Lalapalooza) and have been planning it for the past couple months now with mostly everything paid for by my brother which is like $1500. His girlfriends parents agreed she could go before they bought the tickets and booked the airbnb (which they had to put a down deposit on). They leave in the beginning of August for the festival but today her parents decided they don't want an embarrassment of a daughter like her and that they would rather not have a daughter at all. 
A little background on her, she has very controlling Asian parents and a handful of other siblings at various ages. 
Anyways, they're basically telling them to cancel everything or else she will be disowned. My brother paid for everything so he would be at a loss but overall I'm more frustrated that they got his excitement up for months just to crush it over nothing.

But the weirdest thing he’s been doing that’s been bothering me the most is that he started hanging out with younger kids...keep in mind we just graduated high school...at first it was just sophomores, but now he’s obsessed with one of his sophomore friends 7th grade brother...he’s always wrestling him and tickling him and stuff. I heard today from a mutual friend that he got under the blankets with him and started tickling. It’s fucking creepy Ik. Well it gets worse. He’s starting to walk down to the nearby playground/basketball court to hangout with FUCKING TODDLERS!! I shit you not!! I know this because he takes pictures of them and posts it on his Instagram/Snapchat stories. 

I honestly find this extremely disturbing. He’s acting like a pedophile, even if his intentions aren’t bad it still looks extremely weird...like u just can’t do that!!!  I just don’t wanna be affiliated with someone who’s acting this way ya know?

106,"Basically I’ve worked with this person for almost 3 summers as I’m just a summer student. Their attitude towards the First Nations community has bothered me for as long as I’ve known them really, but I was unable to say anything because I have terrible anxiety. But last summer my grandpa (who was Metis) passed away and it felt like I was disrespecting his memory by not being able to confront this person. 

Several weeks ago we worked together and they said some things I found offensive but because of my anxiety I couldn’t bring myself to tell them in person that their comments made me uncomfortable. So I wrote a note and left it for them today, I don’t want to be too revealing but we work in such a way that only they will get the note. I believe it is a personal thing and if they can change their attitude and views towards the First Nations community, they should not have to get in trouble from the bosses. 

The note is not harsh in my opinion and I hope they don’t take it badly. I just couldn’t let it go, and I feel uncomfortable knowing that they have this kind of view and say these kinds of things, especially to someone they hardly know. What are they saying to people they are really close with, you know? I basically asked them to not say these things and try to change their view. I didn’t want to sound like I was trying to blame them for the situation so I also mentioned that they might not have been intentionally racist but their words were offensive. I politely said I hoped that this wouldn’t affect our working relationship as well.

The only issue I’m having now is that I’m a bit afraid they’ll make my work life difficult. And that my bosses won’t do anything to help or worse that they’ll just let the racism slide if she brings up my note. I guess I’m just asking was this the right way to handle the situation?

116,"I’m am a 14 male and I can never sleep until 3-4 am. I no matter what always wake up past 11pm and I’ve tried everything from exercising in the day to setting alarms and getting others to wake me but I never wake up. I’ve even been told by my family that I don’t wake up no matter what. I can’t “force” myself awake, and even if I turn off all the lights and shut off all electronics at 8 or 9 pm I still can’t start to feel sleepy until past 1 am. This is probably unsolvable and since school is coming up I have to wake up at yes 4 am, just to get ready then my bus will come at 5 am then after that I will be in school till 3 pm.

118,"My brother has aspergers-in other words he works, drives, does a lot of independent stuff-no group homes or anything-got a 21 on the ACT-finished community college- yet is still socially awkward. I like him well enough, just sometimes he really kills my mood with selfish behavior that I rarely actually mention in real life. Still, no one wants to be around a selfish dick. The last time I visited my mom's house-a brief day mind you- my brother parades around like it's his territory and I'm unwelcome. I grabbed some milk of magnesium out of the counter and I briefly rubbed his knapsack on the counter unknowingly. My brother quickly rushes in and loudly whispers some swear words like what the fuck how dare she ruffle my knapsack. I just nod it off. We get in the car with my sister and he says under his breath WHY does she get the front seat. He continues to swear and get mad at my every little move. I just have to be positive, but sometimes it gets annoying especially considering I'm never at my mom's house. But then he does stuff that's actually worthy of me getting mad about. I'm in the middle of writing something and he just grabs my hand away from what I'm doing. I also feel like he doesn't do most of this to any degree to any of my other siblings. I have two whole other sister's and he didn't complain once about either of them. This seems to be this way with my mom too. They get so pissed about my existence and l would be okay but they don't do it my siblings. It's never shit that's major at all. Once I left a few bubbles in my mom's sink. Once I asked for my health insurance cards. I ruffled a knapsack unknowingly. I placed the tent in the wrong place in storage. I didn't put the couch pillows back appropriately.

125,"H I need an immediate change to my personality like right this moment please the slow improvement over time is not working. 

I will try and make this post as short as I can.

I keep having the same problems over and over again which is mainly due to my learning from my mistakes.

I don't know how to word this, I'm a male 23 years old from a well to do family who keeps having the same issues, over and over again. Each  time I think I have learned it turns out I haven't, to give a bit of context, I have read self improvement very often for close to 3 years now there was a time I practiced alot of self help exercises religiously for close to 5 months, ignoring social life just trying to change myself. 

A major flaw I noticed in my personality is not taking things as seriously as I should waiting most times till the situations are almost  irredeemable, things that if I had taken care of earlier I would come out on top, mostly cause I expect a miracle of some sort to happen at the end which when it does still don't leave me the best shape, funny thing is I get more opportunities than anybody I know and I promise I don't think I'm lazy I do put in a lot of effort just at the wrong things.


On self assessment I noticed that most good decisions I have made were a result of people giving me advice so I guess
I'm good at taking  advice just don't have the people that use to give me those around me anymore and I can't ask my family cause I don't want to disturb them.

Please if you use to be like me or know a a way for me to change ask quickly as possible no matter how difficult the idea is let me know.

127,"Although she wasn't my favorite of them 2 (the other is a boy), I did cry. That bird was my everything to me.  You know that feeling when you hate someone or something, but in reality you really really loved them a lot? Yeah but this bird also hated me as much too. But to see it stay with my boy budgie and they slowly love each other it really makes me feel better when all is lost. I never showed them attention since they were so hard to take them out the cage and actually feared me a bit and would bite into my skin.

I got both of them at PETCO 3 years ago in the winter of 2014.

Since my dad and mom are not the most pro- animals, my dad got me it becuz i wanted one. For the past 3 years, I fed them pretty much made them home. 2016 tho, I locked them in a cage (I regret it so much and loathe myself) , becuz they feared us and would fly everywhere around the house. It wasn't till early 2018, I decided to keep one of their cage doors open, and surprisingly enough, they came out and explore. THey really loved it. It was also this year they mated that the female budgie (I never named them) given birth  to 5 eggs. My mom never really loved them, and I asked if she could buy them a nest. She declined. This what made it hard.

My parents were cheap and never bought them any other food other than seeds (they lacked the necessary nutrients.) and water.

The pair continued to hatch eggs but it continued to broke and the condition of the mother declined. It was until the morning of July 17, my female budgie had an egg bound (her last and final attempt to conceive). I was hurt but in my mind I shrugged it off. I thought she would be able to lay the egg out. If ur wondering why I didn't take them to vet, I couldn't becuz i am only 15 , had no car, and like the cold and selfish my parents are, I thought it just wasn't worth asking them. 

This happened on a rainy day also. 

My mom went home, I woke up from a nap. I checked on my parakeets and there was blood under her bottom. I was shocked and literally in the midst of tears. In my mind, I still thought it wasn't a big deal and thought that as long as it still alive it will be fine (my ignorance). I saw it get up for one last meal (seeds) with its mate. It was then I came back from using the bathroom, my female budgie fell backward and laid on its back. I realized her egg was stuck between her uterus. It bled her and she died from the infection. I will never ever forget that moment I literally cried and about to explode. SHe died a painful death....

What I'll never forget is how my mom treated it as a joke and laughed it off (that bitch). She was laughing hysterically and said ""aww honey, dont cry. the dirt will make her alive again"" and she basically laughed at me. She was like ""honey. Remember to throw the dead body in the trashcan"". Later my dad came and treated it with carelessness as such. 

My sister and I dug a hole and threw the bird's body in. There was no proper way to bury it since my mom didn't want to take too much effort getting it a proper burial. I was really hurt but kept quiet.

It was sickening and disgusting. My sister and I were the only one who actually cared. I'm sitting here crying writing this. It was my stupidity and plus my lack of love. Now that she's gone I really really miss her. i felt like it was my fault. THis was the first ever time, i really ever connected with an animal. It was all my fault. 

Now its 3am and I know for sure, I won't let myself go for this. All i know is I'll forever be broken seeing my only last parakeet left all alone. Is there any advice? ",18Jul2018,1
128,"Four years ago, I went on vacation with my parents. I needed to be back home earlier than my parents did, so I left a week before they left. On my way back, I spent about 18 hours in a hotel by myself, in a really conservative country.

I was alone, and I did what any 23 year old male would do. I went to the hotel bar, and hit on girls. I patted one girl on the arm, and I had asked her if she wanted to go outside with me after drinks to show me around. She told me not to touch, since it wasn't allowed.

She didn't seem offended though. In fact, she actually did make small talk with me. I would probably be ok if I went back, but I have horrible anxiety about being in trouble.

I left the next morning, so if she had told on me, I left in time to escape the trouble. I later did some research. Hitting on strangers and touching them on the arm is an actual offense in that country.

My parents have planned another vacation this year, and there's a layover exactly where that happened four years ago. I told my parents I would go with them, but then I remembered this. I am really uncomfortable going back to that country.

What if, upon my arrival, I learn that there's a warrant out for my arrest, and I now have to spend months in jail? It might sound funny, but that country literally jails people for this stuff.

What if, the next day, that girl told a manager or employee, who told the police as part of company policy? It's a hotel, and they have my passport number and everything. As soon as I get off the plane, they scan my passport, a red flag appears, and someone says ""sir, come with me.""

But I told my parents I will go with them. They've spent thousands of dollars on tickets and hotels. It hurts to back out now.

129,"First, I'd love to make sure that I'm not wrong for reporting this noise. I don't know if religious protections apply to excessive noise? I'm afraid that by calling security and having their services interrupted to be quieted down that I'm harassing them. 

My new neighbors of about a month hold a religious service in their apartment every Tuesday night. Their preacher comes with professional sound equipment, you can clearly hear him and his music all the way down the row of about ten apartment units, so it is painfully loud in my unit. The audio equipment apparently needs to be assembled and configured, so there's a ton of banging and popping against our shared wall at the start and end of services. They've been contacted by security a few times at the start of services, but it's like they forget how loud they are and turn things up at the end again. There's usually prolonged clapping at this part of the service, so the guy has to better make himself heard. 

Also, the children who come along with their parents for this service will run through my porch screaming afterwards. It's nearly 10pm or later by this point and it's dark enough to worry they'll trip over my furniture or plants, or accidentally cause a major trigger for me by knocking or falling into my door.

I have a disability that causes me to panic and then become angry after prolonged exposure to loud noise. I actually can't leave my house much, so I'm not sure if I have any recourse or special outlets as a disabled person to have reduced triggers in my home. So in addition to wondering if I'm being a dick these people, I'm also afraid that I'll snap and scream at a child (panicking and thinking it's a bad guy) with all that's going on.",18Jul2018,2

The dog will be outside alone for inappropriately long times, barking to be let in, which especially bothers me when the weather is cold. The barking dosent bother me, whatever, but I can’t help but think, maybe I could ask him to help care for his dog? Is this totally weird of me? I’d hate to take his companion, I think he loves his pet but it may be getting more difficult as he ages. maybe I could just offer to walk the dog sometimes or help out ?

131,"2 weeks ago I showed my bfs mom a post about a kitten a girl I know was giving away for free. I didn’t think his mom would actually want it. His mom is seemingly nice but can be crazy (she drinks a lot &amp; abuses painkillers) but she would not stop begging for this kitten &amp; sent me literally dozens of texts about it. I was unsure if I wanted the kitten to go to her house because she smokes &amp; the arguments between my bfs mom and her boyfriend have gotten heated &amp; physical before(not often). She wouldn’t leave me alone about it &amp; I asked my boyfriend for advice and my boyfriend told me they had cats when he was growing up &amp; she was always very good to them, regardless of how she is with other aspects of her life. The next day we pick up the kitten &amp; bring it to her house. My bf and I are young &amp; in college &amp; spend a lot of time at his moms. The kitten took a liking to us &amp; would always hang around us rather than his mom. His mom started calling it “ our”kitten (meaning only my bf and I’s kitten) but it was supposed to be hers. Yesterday (2 weeks since getting the kitten) she was particularly pissed off (&amp; drunk &amp; on drugs or something) and storms into the room we were in screaming &amp; swearing at us 3 separate times that we didn’t clean “our” kittens liter box &amp; were gone for 3 days. It was supposed to be her kitten &amp; we don’t live at her house. She never once asked us to clean the litter box &amp; literally starts screaming at us that we don’t take care of “our” cat &amp; do nothing to help her around her house (completely untrue we always clean). I’ve never stood up to his mom before when she’s acting crazy but this time I did &amp; said I’d take the kitten if it was mine &amp; this was such a big deal. She gets even ANGRIER &amp; says that it’s her cat &amp; not ours. Things escalated &amp; she completely turned it around, trying to say that my bf and I were the only ones that EVER called it “our” cat, which we never did, &amp; she had just called it ours (meaning only my bf and I’s) when she was screaming at us about the litter box 3 times within an hour. She is clearly delusional &amp; my bf even said this. His mom THREW A BASKET AT MY HEAD when we were cleaning the litter box a few mins later to try to get her to calm down &amp; make her happy. We left as quickly as possible. I am so upset I ever thought it was a good idea to bring a kitten to her house, they have another cat &amp; it seems to be treated fine &amp; I know it’s not abused but I feel terrible for leaving this kitten with them, especially when it clearly likes my bf &amp; I better because we aren’t shouting &amp; crazy like his mom always is. I am so heartbroken &amp; I don’t know what I can do to save this kitten. There were no official papers when we gave her the kitten from my coworker we just brought it to her house, &amp; the kitten has not had its shots yet. I want to tell the police she assaulted me but my bf said that she’s crazy enough to say that I was abusing her first or something like that. If anyone has any advice please help.

This is the third relationship I've been in, and I really do love her) and she basically said I could do better than her and to go after the job. It made me feel bad.

133,"It's been a little over a year since my parents' divorce (to be clear, she divorced my step dad and this was her second marriage). She has dated a few people but one man has gotten so close to her that he's moved into her house, the home I grew up in. I immediately got poor vibes meeting him - I was never introduced and I crossed paths with him while doing laundry in her house. Awkward.

Anyway fast forward a bit to me enduring a pretty painful breakup, which I definitely believe has influenced my behaviour. I have a difficult time trusting anyone let alone a strange, aloof man who suddenly lives in my childhood home. But add the following and it just becomes even more difficult for me: he's the uncle of a girl my age who has a reputation for heavy drug use from her teens until now, cheats on every boyfriend she's ever had. Admittedly, I did a pretty shitty thing to her nearly a year ago today: she pestered my then-boyfriend to hang out more and ""are we ever going to see each other again or?"" so I made a fake facebook account and told her anonymously that ""he isn't interested in you, you have no motivation"" etc, I don't remember what else I said but it wasn't nice. I regret it but I regret even more admitting that it was me because days after, I had people coming to me accusing me of telling my ex awful things on fake facebook and instagram accounts. And on his facebook, where he'd post statuses' alluding to it, this girl left ""fuck em, love you buddy"" and other such things. I get it, I'd be pissed off too if someone did that to me and I understand 'squaring up' or whatever, but then she also approached my mother and uncle to tell her I'd sent her a message. Left it at that. 

Fast forward more, I've been on and off suicidal due to a slew of things including the nature of my breakup but mostly having to heal after 4 years of very toxic relationships, coming to terms with a childhood event, handling the weight my mom's second divorce has placed on me, and mourning dropping out of school and possibly having a more severe mental illness than I'd previously been dealing with (diagnosed Major Depressive, very well might have Borderline Personality Disorder). It really feels like everything has dropped on me all at once and to say I'm hurting feels like an understatement. I'm being swallowed whole. 

Anyway, after saying some choice things about my mom's new boyfriend, not to him, but to her, and causing her a lot of grief over my mental state, I offered to apologize to him about how I'd approached first meeting him. I am still not that cool with him; my mom is a completely different person now that he's around - she drinks more and smokes weed, she's adopted all the interests he has, and now has a bunch of self-help books on verbal abuse (my step dad was NOT abusive...this part disgusts me if I'm being honest), he's on ODSP jobless and other than that, living in her house and on her salary. He told my mom an apology was not necessary. I felt weird about this but any time I came over he didn't act particularly cold toward me; we got along fine. 

I add him to facebook, he ignores the request. I tell my mother this, and then suddenly it's accepted. He likes lots of my photos, compliments some of my profile pictures, etc. I get the impression we are on ok terms.

I get rid of facebook for a month, not deactivated, permanently deleted. I recently got it back and added him. He not only deleted the request but made it so I cannot re-add him and shared a picture reading ""I wish Santa would publish his naught list, what a great way to meet people"".

I go to see a movie with her tonight and she tells me ""\*name of boyfriend\* says hi""

I brought all this up to my mom, and I'm just being made to feel that I'm blowing it out of proportion. 

My intuition tells me that I am being dragged through the mud psychologically and that I don't deserve this. I'm pretty deeply hurt. I've been told that he just knows I'm still wary of him and to let the relationship evolve organically, but having every member of my family except me on facebook and then being made to feel crazy for being bothered by that feels like a punishment. And for what? I thought we were past this.

I don't know what to do for myself or how to act around this relationship that seems like it's in the throes of its honeymoon phase. I think my mom is being lovebombed and I know almost for certain the ball will drop. I don't know how long it will take or if it'll ever happen.

He once stole $60 of wax from me and admitted to it when backed in the corner. I don't trust him at my girlfriend's place because I know he's stealing shit. It's a given. On top of that he never pays rent. He lost his last job because he just stopped showing up, then lied to my girlfriend about why he lost it. He uses her for rides everywhere, even though he has his own vehicle now. 

One of the most irritating things to me is he's pronounced his love for her, and tries to get involved in our relationship in pretty in appropriate ways.

The worse part about it is, tonight I decided to use Tinder and my upgrade isn’t even on there any more. I absolutely hate Tinder. Right now...

I feel so stupid, if anyone can help me. I’d be grateful. I’ve been charged over 160.00 on a service I don’t even want. HELP!",18Jul2018,2
142," I really need some advice on this one. It’s a long story so I’m just gonna write a tl;dr.

I have huge crush on a friend of mine, he is a bit older and a couple  months ago he helped me through a difficult time in life. He asked how I was doing, cared for me and was there for me when I needed someone  to talk to.

A lot has  happen since then and not it feels like we're just very distance from each other (no talks etc). Please  note that I didn’t have feelings for him when I was dealing with my  problems back then, but the feelings started a couple months ago. 

I’ve tried to reach out to  him and show that I care for him but I  either get a ”cold respond” or not a respond at all. So it seems like he  is mad at me or simply doesn't want to be with me anymore.

He is truly an amazing guy and I really care for him. Now, I don’t  know if I should just let him go and move on or if I should write him an  email telling him how I feel? I don't think that he knows that I actually have feelings for him...

Would it be rude, expressing a love for  someone that no longer care for you and (obviously) doesn't want anything to do with you?

Please, all advice is much appreciated.",18Jul2018,2
144,"Its kind of complicated, but some info to start with is that I'm a 23 year old male. I have a fairly serious, what I would call auto-immune disease called IGA Nephropathy. I'm a former college drop out giving it another go with ASU's online program(I'm in my junior year now) and have considered trying to get to Arizona for a while. I have no money what so ever and medical bills are pilling up already. I can not count on my parents for any financial help other than some of the medical bills. This is where it gets more complicated. My mother has stolen and cheated so much money from companies/credit card providers/my father/our family for so long that I just want to be done with her. My father refuses to set real boundaries because he is terrified of being alone. I'm not even supposed to know so if I try to intervene she will leave him and f\*\*\* us both credit and bill wise I'm sure of it. I've been back at home just long enough that I'm not sure where all of my college credit card offers etc have ended up. I'm so filled with hate at loan companies etc that I don't even know how they work, just that I monitor my credit closely, have no credit cards and only some college loans from the federal government at the moment.  Its not difficult to see, I'm 23 and need to make my own way, but my condition means that I may need a kidney in the near future. As an O blood type my chances aren't great without family and they are my only family left. I also don't want to leave my father alone to that mess, but I need to live a stress free lifestyle, its imperative for my health. If I can get to Arizona I can get an on campus job, but what if it doesn't cover the bills, what if I get sick again. Rent is crazy high in the Tempe, Phoenix area as well from what I've seen. I even considered trying to get an RV by selling my truck, but it'd have to be motorized and under 6k(yeah right, its  impossible). Contacting ASU's disabilities department did me no good, they don't have financial aid programs for my situation. The are so many conflicting thoughts in my head I cant think straight on what to do.

146,"During the past 3-4 weeks, I have become extremely apathetic. I literally don't enjoy anything anymore. It's really difficult to put this feeling into words but all I feel is complete numbness. I feel no connection to the things that I used to love/enjoy and new activities aren't appealing either. I feel stuck in a rut but have no desire to get out. 
What's even scarier is that I've tried lots of new hobbies such as painting, singing, playing an instrument, coding, cooking, horseback riding, but nothing makes me feel fulfilled. I'm so jaded that I do not only lack a connection to the things that I used to like - I actually can't get into anything new because everything seems uninteresting.

147,"Apologies ahead of time for the wall of text.

I have a 2012 Chevy Cruz and for the past couple weeks my car has been struggling whenever I start it up. It's always worst in the morning whenever it's been off for a long time. It stutters and kinda chokes whenever I try to start the car. The other day it just clicked and I had to try a couple times to get it running. I also had an issue with acceleration (gas pedal to the floor but about 10 seconds before it moved forward) but the problem seems to have gone away. Once it's running the car works fine. After it's been running a bit it also has less difficulty starting though it still struggles. 

Also, when it starts up i occasionally get warning messages about battery saving and servicing power steering, as well as stuff like hazards turning on automatically, delay in ac and fan starting up and once my windows wouldn't work until I started the car.
I've changed the oil, oil filter, and the air filter (thinking this was the issue) and the problem just seems to persist and continue to get worse, though the oil change seems to have solved the acceleration issue because I haven't noticed it since.

While the internet and talk with friends has been kinda helpful in identifying a couple possibilities, the information is scarce and somewhat conflicting/unreliable (“friend” says spark plugs or wiring while internet says battery/charger or possibly, fuel system, plugs, alternator, a dozen and one other things) and I REALLY don't want to continue what feels like a wild goose chase through the engine to find the problem without a better idea of what it most likely is. Also, finding a mechanic to look at it has been a pain which is why I’m posting here.

Any Idea on what it is and/or tips on how to proceed in solving this issue?

He sounds very perfect to me but I feel he did not do several years of karate and kung-fu because those are like the most popular generic martial arts compared to something like Muay Thai and Jiu-Jitsu (no offence to karate and kung-fu users). He comes to my house everyday and is supposed to teach me many things since he is so good and he even offers lessons for free and at first, I was excited to learn, get A's, then impress my Mum and buy some stuff on my wishlist, but it didn't turn out as I expected. My first meeting with him, he offered a handshake, I hand shook him then he taught me about how real handshakes are a firm 3 shakes going up and down. I thought he sounded pretty legit but when he started tutoring me which was supposed to last for an hour, he taught me stuff easily found and remembered off the internet such as ""All triangles add up to 180 degrees"". I think it lasted around 18 minutes maximum and he spent more time telling me to drink milk, eat fruits, telling my sister to pour me iced tea, flirting on my mother, answering calls that are staged to make him sound better on speaker which my mum overhears, and telling me to eat more sugar to think. It just passed the holiday and my sleeping schedule is messed up. I tried sleeping and awoke in the middle of the night to him coughing and walking to the kitchen to get water.

156,"So I have an older brother for reference I’ll call him Dan. Dan was always a bit strange when I was growing up. He was always fighting with me and my sisters and my parents. At around 12 he would skip school and hang out with the wrong crowd. I guess my parents had enough of it and at the age of 16 they gave him a choice. He could either get help for his anger and other issues or he could go and live with another family member. Needless to say he moved and we hadn’t heard from him until two weeks ago. 

So me and my girlfriend, her name is Gail, we’re at my house watching Tv trying to relax after the long month we had. My parents were working in their office and my youngest sister was in her room. When there is a knock on the door I answer it and I see a guy there. He says hi and tries to hug me but I kinda back away not knowing who he is. But he says that he is my older brother Dan. 

I’m not buying it and tell Gail to get my parents. When she leaves Dan wolf whistles and ask who the help is. Gail and I have been through a lot so I start yelling at Dan saying how that is uncalled for. I’ll admit I overreacted but after what she’s been through I’ll always protect her. 

Anyways when my parents come they immediately recognize Dan as my brother. I was still shocked and when he came to hug me a just pushed him away. My parents said that was rude since he is my brother but I stood my ground. My youngest sister is 14 and she didn’t even remember him and was hesitant around him. 

My parents were concerned and asked what’s gone on in his life and he told us a lot. 

According to him he got into drugs for a while and some other bad stuff. Eventually that lead to him getting arrested for driving under the influence and possession of illegal drugs. He spent some time in jail and after that in rehab. He started to turn his life around and felt bad about how he treated us. So he decided to come home and make amends. 

My parents were in tears by the time he finished his tale of woe. I wasn’t convinced when I questioned him about his story he would change some details or get confused. My parents just scolded me and said that he is my brother and I should question him. I didn’t want to hear any more so me and Gail went to make dinner. 

While we were cooking Gail and I talked. She was able to tell I was uncomfortable and we talked it out. I told her that I’m pretty sure that he’s going to either ask for money or to stay till he gets back on his feet. And that my parents being as loving and naive as they are would let them. She agreed with me but said that if my parents let him back in that doesn’t mean I have to. It helped a lot and when it came time to have dinner it didn’t go that well. 

For one my family and I are white. I have pale skin, green eyes and dirty blond hair as does my mom. My dad on the other hand has blue eyes and brown hair much like my sisters and Dan. While Gail is Hispanic. She has tan skin, dark brown almost black hair and very dark brown eyes. 

Like normal we were talking and joking like normal. However Dan was constantly staring at Gail whenever I looked at him. And several time he would make racist jokes about her heritage and how she was only dating me for money. Which is not the case at this point Gail is very financially responsible. My parents just said that wasn’t polite and demand that he apologized which he did half heartily. But before dinner ended he pooped the question about moving back in until he got back on his feet. Me and Gail shared a look but my parents said of course. 

Dan said that he was so happy that we would be able to be a family again and started heading to where his old room was. The only problem with that is that it was turned into a guest room a few years ago and currently it is Gail’s room. When we told him that he turned looked at me and Gail and said. “Well why aren’t they sharing a room if they are fuc**** each other’s brains out.” He then followed it by saying joking and asked where he could sleep then. 

My parents offered up my bedroom until they could turn the storage room into another bedroom. That meant I would have to sleep on the couch. But instead I ended up sleeping with Gail in her room which wasn’t too uncommon to be honest. But that’s what lead to the next weird part. 

One night when we were sleeping I woke up to get some water. Now the way the room is positioned you can see the bedroom door from the bed. At the door stood Dan just staring at us. I asked him “What the Fuc*”. And he just said that he was getting up to get some water as well. When I pointed out that the kitchen was upstairs and not in the basement he admitted to wanting to see Gail. 

He then asked me if having sex with her was any good and if he could have her when I was done with her. There are multiple things wrong with that. For one me and Gail are not sexually active it’s not something we are interested in. Two even if we were it’s not something I would be willing to brag about to friends let alone Dan who I consider a stranger. Three no I will not be done with Gail considering that me and her are more then boyfriend and girlfriend. 

He then goes on to tell me that he has a thing for Hispanic women because of their big breast and butts. I asked him if that is why he is staring at her and when he replied yes I asked if he was mental. He said no but if she was going to flaunt herself like that then he was going to stare at her goods.  He went in to say that she was honestly one of the sexiest girls he has ever seen and asked if he could join in on our next sexcapade. Needles to say we sleep with the door closed and locked after that incident. 

I told Gail and my parents everything that happened that night   And guess what when they asked Dan if that was true he straight up lied. Everyone but Gail bought it. It’s been a difficult two weeks. Not only has he been screwing with me. Such as trashing my papers and donating my clothes that I still wear. He has also been trying to get closer to Gail and has tried several times to touch her only to be met with a dirty look and either a slap or a punch. She doesn’t tolerate that in the slightest. 

He has also been a huge slob and contributes nothing to help out. He doesn’t do any chores, he refuses to get a part time job and won’t run errands for my parents. He has started to pick on my little sister to the point where he has her in tears. He is a compulsive liar. For example he claimed to be bilingual and says that he speaks Latin and Japanese to Gail. However he didn’t know that Latin is a second language for her and she took Japanese as a class. He kinda turned red when she spoke to him in both asking “how is your day going so far?” Besides that he will go out and although he claims to no longer do drugs or drink he will come home smelling of it and tell my parents that he walked through a crowd of people who were doing it. 

I’m at wits end right now. My parents are blind to everything he is doing. Including the fact that they gave him there credit card and he has wracked up almost $4,000 on it. I have told them everything that has gone on and they just say that he is my brother and I’m just paranoid.

How can I show my parents how Dan is without them hating me?

TL;DR my estranged brother has reappeared in my family’s life. He has decided to be a creep and a two face and my parents are blind to it all. Please help. ",18Jul2018,12

We have discussed religion, politics, life philosophy, relationships, family, food, travel, social issues, etc. He has candidly talked about his finances, what his marriage was like, and what kind of things make him happy.

170,"Hey all, I hate to have to come here for advice but I feel like I have no choice.

Some backstory; my boyfriend and I have been together 4 years exactly. We just celebrated our anniversary a few hours ago, and I drove 3 hours to be with him. We live together, but he’s currently on a business trip for an internship he’s doing. 

Part of this internship involved going to Disneyland for 5 days, in which he told me he hung out with two girls the entire time. One of these girls is totally his type, and is very very pretty. He told me about their conversations, about how she isn’t happy with her boyfriend and other such stories. I wasn’t happy he was at my favorite place in the world exclusively with another girl, but I understood. 

A week or so later, he has another trip in another city. This time he says he couldn’t answer my calls because he was in a hot tub with peers. Turns out, the girl was there too. 

My boyfriend isn’t huge on social media, rarely uses Facebook and NEVER uses Instagram. I did a quick search for her name in both, and she follows him on his insta which is completely inactive and they’re friends on fb. 

Still, I’m not too worried at this point. Today, however, I decide to look at his messages between her, him, and the other girl that was with them in Disneyland. A recent text says “I’ll see you guys at the Rivercats game!”, which he’s said nothing about. I look on the calendar, and although the Rivercats are a team located in our home city, they’re here where I am now playing another team. Coincidence? And yesterday he texts me saying “hey, I have to go to dinner with the team at 6:25, since I can’t go tomorrow because of our anniversary.” (Note: the baseball game starts at 7:05pm and is half a mile from the hotel we’re in). This city is also the girl’s hometown. 

The only reason I’m going off on an investigation like this is we’ve been together 4 years, I know how he acts. He acted just weird today, of all days. I don’t think he would ever cheat on me, I’m just worried he’s hiding the fact that he’s hanging out with her. He’s done this once before when he was texting an ex, I found out, and he lied about it until I told him I knew. I’m just really upset, and I worry if I ask him about it he’ll just get mad. But this is eating at me and I can’t even sleep. I feel bad for snooping, but I truly feel like I may be right. What should I do?",18Jul2018,1
171,"The band program at my high school is divided into 3 bands: a concert band (freshman), symphonic band, and wind ensemble, with wind ensemble being the one you have to audition into.

Heading into my senior year, I would have like to have been accepted into the wind ensemble because I feel like I have a pretty strong understanding of the music we're given in symphonic band. In essence, I don't feel challenged by it anymore and I really want something that will challenge me and continue to push me to excellence. Not only that, but I also have several friends who are in the wind ensemble and I'd like to continue playing music alongside them. I've grown to really love playing music and being involved in it and am seriously considering some sort of music major in college, I've involved myself in just about everything the band program at my school has to offer, including taking music theory classes (which I will also be tutoring this next year), waking up an hour earlier to participate in the jazz band, and joining the band leadership team (which is the student organization that helps the directors out). With that being said, I'd like to go into college with a better technical and musical ability, but being in the symphonic band that doesn't challenge me just feels...like I'm going to fall behind in that regard, and it's frightening to me.

I spent months practicing for this audition and I really felt like I nailed it that day. But maybe I'm just fantasizing.

I've talked to my band director about reauditioning (he knows that I'd like to pursue music as my career) but that was turned down, not because he didn't want me to reaudition, but because there becomes a gray line between who can reaudition and who can't, essentially. It's a valid enough reason but I won't ever have a chance again to be in the band that challenges me more. Coming to this conclusion has put me in this ""pit"", like a heavy weight on my chest, a sense of longing for something I know won't ever happen, and to be frank I don't know how to get out of this state of mind. I've tried to reach different perspectives on it, such as the whole ""if one door closes, another opens"" philosophy, but either way I still feel that longing weight on my chest.

What can I do? If not any advice on maybe how to sway my band directors opinion, what can I do to ease my thoughts?

Thank you, really, I appreciate any advice.",18Jul2018,2
172,"I'm just gonna be blunt: I'm a man who cannot be in a stable, happy relationship. It's boring. It's not sexy. There's no ""thrill"" to them. I cannot be with someone who's loving, reasonable, and accepting of everything about me.

I need a person who hits me, constantly screams at me, manipulates me, and isolates me from others.

I've never met a ""nice"" person who satisfied my sexual needs. But my abusive partners were always the ones who were best in bed and gave me the most amazing thrills. I've stayed in an abusive relationship before simply because the sex was *that good.*

If I'm not constantly struggling to maintain a relationship because they threaten to leave me, it feels like there's no passion or intimacy to it.

I know I shouldn't perpetuate this cycle that I've dealt with since I was a child (my father is profoundly mentally ill and savagely abused me as a child for his own sadistic pleasure).

 Me and stan started giving each other shit. We never mean anything of it and it always ends with a big laugh from the both of us.  He starts off by giving me shit about the first time I had sex so i gave him shit on how he had sex with his ex in a really weird place and we laughed it all off.

177,"Hey,

I don't actually have anybody to talk to this about so I thought I'd post here and see.

I'll try keep it brief, I broke up with my girlfriend recently, we had made plans to move to a new city together so I didn't bother to renew the contract on my apartment, and our plan was that I would stay with her for two weeks then we'd move together. After I got back from holiday, she told me she doesn't want to move with me, then a few days later said she's not in love with me. 

My plans were shattered because I'd already left my job and my apartment, now I'm in the new city crashing with a friend, and having a tough time finding a new job. I'm also feeling very depressed, going through stages of feeling numb, or incredibly sad and lonely. 

I had an idea that I should take some time and do the camino de satiago after first hearing about it back in October. On paper it sounds good, I'd have a month of just walking to spend time with myself, reflect, feel how I want to feel and not worry about dragging other people down with my depression. 

but I'm concerned that I could just be running away from my problem and when I get back I'll have an even harder time trying to find a new job, and the biggest thing is that the cheapest flight I can find is tomorrow. When I get back my friend said I would be welcome to stay in her place until the 26th of September, and I would have money to tide myself over for a little bit.

I've gone through a lot in life, and have realized I have some pretty toxic behaviors and traits, and I really want to work on them. I've tried things in the past, but never really committed to getting better and been serious about it. 

For a little background, I do have manic depression, social and generalized anxiety, OCD, and PTSD due to growing up in a very abusive household, and while I know these things contribute to my behaviors, I don't want to be the person that uses them as an excuse to act shitty. 

The things I want to work on are mainly going with the flow, trusting, being less lazy/not giving up when something doesn't instantly work, standing up for myself but in a respectable manner (do no harm, take no shit kind of thing), having more self confidence, handling/expressing my emotions in a more productive manner, thinking more positively, patience, and using my words in a more productive fashion. 

I'm on medication for the mental illnesses, as that seems to be working the best for me at this stage in my life. I've tried bullet journaling, action/reward strategies, self help books, etc. But I'm at a loss on where to go from here, and what the best ways to work on these things would be.

It's a 2 hour walk. doing that twice a day along with a 9 hour shift inbetween is going to be hell.

The buses would run when I get off each shift but that won't matter until I can pay for it. Walmart payday is every 2 weeks so I'll be doing this for at least that long until I can buy a bicycle and pedal my way there. I'll have to explain the situation during my interview and hope they can put me in a different shift but I can't afford to be picky so if not I'll have to stick it out regardless.

I have no problem with walking like that, the root of my anxiety right now is the fact that I basically have to share a room with my schizophrenic mother.

I am a 27-year-old guy from Thailand, and I would like some advice on how to proceed from here.

For context, I feel my current career is stagnant, and I need a new degree in order to breakthrough. For the past 2 years, I have been applying several scholarships to do a masters degree oversea (only in the SEA region though). What I want apart from the degree itself are the language and exposure of the new culture. And I do have an inclination towards both of them. Last month, I got an offer as a partial scholarship from a university in this country I have been applying to (I feel like I should not disclose the name). I have applied to only a few places based on the programs offered, and I got rejected by all but this one. I have not accepted it yet as I was waiting for Thai government scholarship results. However, today I just got rejected. And I wonder whether I should take the leap and get on with life, or wait for a better opportunity though I feel I am getting old. This university is quite rural and not quite famous, but it offers a program that I am interested in, though. Its ranking overall is much lower than some universities in my home country.

191,"I'm kind of looking for some advice on how to tell myself it's all in my head...AND believe it. So here's some backstory. Me and my gf have been together a touch over 6 years now. At first I had huge issues trusting her, but I do with anyone (I used to always not trust my parents and think I was adopted or something... ikr, dumb af).

Now it got bad about 2 years in, she made a really stupid choice and decided she was telling me she was going to meet up with her female cousin, I even dropped her off and she actually went to meet her male ""bestie"" who she met at work and they were texting 24/7 even infront of me. Of course I wasn't comfortable with it, but I don't stop her doing anything and I never let her know I'm not comfortable with it... I just bottle it up. Now as far as I know they never did anything, she met him at work and they walked to his house then she went home (she didn't go inside or anythjng) apparently he wanted a chat about something. Now that would have all been perfectly fine if she hadn't have lied to me, That's the worst bit.

Ok and since then there has been more incident where she's lied to me, but nothing super major (nothing to do with other men), so I just ignore it. She's a very shy and nervous person, she will just say something quickly when she feels pressured even if it's wrong without even thinking about it, then be too nervous to correct it.

Now fast forward to this week, she's gone to Ibiza with her female best friend and their other female best friend (who also has a long term boyfriend). Apparently this is the ""sex capital"" of the world and now I'm just super worried she's going to cheat or something, and I'll never find out. I'm also worried she may get drugged or raped or something horrible happen and I'm not there to protect her, apparently there's shit loads of booze and boys with nothing but tits and ass on their mind... Not only that but if she does cheat and doesn't tell me, then I get an STD from it... wtf do I do then?? But ultimately what if she doesn't have the intention of cheating, goes through several bottles of booze, keep getting hit on then a f*cking greek god comes out of nowhere and she fucks him.

We've moved in together about 5 months ago and if she did cheat honestly I think I'd just top myself, my entire life is dedicated to giving US the best future, the reason for me working hard at work and getting promotions and pay rises is for US and NOT me. I don't see anything but US in our future and we've talked about marriage, kids, getting a house in a couple years, how I want to buy her a car she's after and a dog etc.

How do I stop myself being so anxious about this, I literally get diarrhoea (sorry for being explicit) from the level of nerves I go through, sometimes can't sleep and sometimes just sit and cry (which fuck, I'll never admit, not even to my gf). 6'1"" 300lbs dude crying like a baby. Lol.

It's common for students to find internships here and some companies just accept all applicants (as most internships here are unpaid so they don't mind). The actual unemployment rate here is very low but obviously the lucrative job posts are rare.

I guess while I am not technically an Aspie, I have been diagnosed as having some Aspie traits so I guess I have below average social skills. My grades during my first three years at uni were also terrible.

The thing is so far, every internship didn't work in my favour. I think got good feedback on my performance in these internships, but it always ends with the manager or boss saying the prefer hiring students from another uni. 

I just don't get how networking works. It seems over here, whether your manager likes you or not depends more heavily on random factors such as which school you went to.

I will soon complete an internship at an NGO founded by a former manager of a company which is well known for being very competitive to get into. The thing is he is a former manager though and had already retired. I don't know if networking with him is that ""useful"".

My in-laws offered to pay for half of our future house (which they eventually ended up doing).

Now that we're about to move in, in-laws broke up and my retired dad-in-law wants to move in with us.

I work from home most days, love to go bra-less all the time, and basically love the freedom of having my own space.

Dad-in-law likes my kid but never offers to take care of him, etc. They usually give us gifts and a small monthly allowance (200 usd) to help with grocery bills. This we can do without but they offered and we accepted. 

My dad-in-law is an old fashioned baby boomer and as much as I love him, I love my freedom more. He also has a lot of stuff and I don't know where he'll put all his things since the house isn't that big. In hindsight, I badly wish that we never rushed in to buy the house since upkeep is expensive and not to mention the strings attached. 

Lastly, we lived with him for about a year and it made my depression worse. He's very nice but I know that he looks at how I do stuff around the house and I feel pressured to cook and clean for him (and use less resources as humanly possible). For example, I used to love taking warm showers twice a day but he kept on mentioning how his water bill keeps going up and stuff like that.

I know this is such a privileged post but I need advice. Should we let him move in? He keeps on sending hints that he wants to move in with us. I also have a strong urge to breakup and just find a place of my own. I've worked so hard to be in a good place mentally and finally weaned off of meds. Advice appreciated!

205,"I own a home. I inherited money when my dad passed away and bought a small house. When I was 21.  I don’t owe anything on it, but it’s old, it’s got issues, and my neighbors bamboo is wreaking havoc on my yard. I’ve been battling this house for 5 years. I’d like to sell the home before it loses more value. I’d like rent for like a year and move to Texas after.

I’m having my first child in October and it’s just gonna be too much for me to deal with the house and the baby. My mom says I’m making a mistake, my wife’s mom is encouraging us to get rid of the house. I’d use this money for the move and a down payment of a house in texas.

Unfortunately, she dropped out later as she couldn't handle the work stress or pressure, which my dad had to pay back the scholarship money. He didn't mind the finance as the mental pressure is understandable. But now after 2 years of her just staying home with no future education or work planned, we're starting to get worried on what to do. She wont accept any offer to continue studies from my dad. I even offer her to work with me, she rejects the idea. My dad thinks that this is because of her lack of self confidence. Is there anyone who faced similar situation and manage to help?",18Jul2018,2

209,"My fiancé and I currently live in Colorado. In the past few months, he has had surgery on his shoulder and he’s been diagnosed with PTSD and fibromyalgia. He also has bowed legs and has since he was a child. He used to be an electrician, but when he dislocated his shoulder for the 8th time, he couldn’t go to work anymore. 

I’m a full time student, and I’ve been over loading my courses to finish my degree in 2 1/2 years. I’m working part time in retail, and there’s not much I can reasonably do to make more money. He’s behind on bills, and both of us are almost maxed out on our credit cards. His parents have been helping him with rent and some of his bills, but I’m still paying for the car.

210,"I've had trouble reaching out for help on this subject because I feel like I can predict what a lot of the answers will be.    

Basically me and my roommate live in an apartment complex. Across from our building in another building lives a guy we get along with and his daughter. I would assume shes between 8-13.

The issue is when the father isn't home this girl turns into an R-rated character from an episode of Maury.    

She will blare the most heinous rap music at top volume (and the buildings make a cacophony that only amplifies it)     
Her favorite thing to do is every 20 or so minutes make a very loud sexual moan like 'Unnghhyayaaaa' and she will get her face like right to her window so she can project it out.    
If me and my roommate are on the balcony she will come out and taunt us, say smoking kills, bring attention to herself then say things like ""what the fuck do you want"" etc.    
The other day she was dog walking for her neighbor and she jumped off the step and landed on the dog, when me and my roommate looked to see what happened we received a ""mind your own fucking business""    
If she isn't blaring rap music she is playing that frequency deal that only young people can hear [example](https://youtu.be/X5XCjBH8t84?t=20)
It's gotten to the point that I am paranoid and just expecting this harassment on a daily basis.     

The reason I am reaching out is because I know all the things I can't do to try to bring an end to this. I know I can't berate her or tell her to stop, because it will just fuel her. Or she will just tell on me and since I am an adult white male I'll be in the wrong.    
I can't tell her dad because he's a drunk and will just give me either ""no she doesn't do that"" or ""mind your own"" etc.
I can't ignore it because she's *good* at it. 

What is your advice reddit?

tl;dr I'm being bullied by a very young girl and I am afraid to react because I am an adult and she will be able to play the victim card.

211,"Hi there TL:DR at the bottom.

This is not a fun topic to have because I really love him. He is my best bro and we love hanging out with each other. Now my brother is studying in a town one hour away. His girlfriend is studying in my town. I started getting this feeling he only comes and visits when his Girlfriend wants to see him. He won't drive out to see me on his own. My place is small. They take over the whole place like it is theirs when he visits. She lives in a hostel so he can't go stay there, they don't allow men. Also they are both students and their salaries are based from their parents

His girl stays inside and only my brother joins me when I want to have a BBQ. The one time I had a BBQ on my own. He fell short of money made a loan from me to take him and his girlfriend out. When asked for it he was certain he paid me back. (That was the last time I lend money to him)

I think she likes the gifts that my brother provides and he does this in abundance. He spoils her so much and he manipulates others to do so. My mother pays for the trips for both of them or pays for the gas when he wants to come visit his girlfriend ""me"". He also manipulates his friends for his night out and so forth. 

Now I decided you know what I am going to organizing one big BBQ and inviting all my friends. They won't be able to stay inside because people will need the bathroom and kitchen and I told him they need to join this time. My friends are chilled and I know he would fit right in with them. The moment he heard about the plans he was upset because he I think he knew his girlfriend won't be happy with this. He is now trying to get me to cancel the BBQ because ""they like spending their time on their own"". I also would have gone rock climbing on Saturday but due to trying to host the BBQ I would not have enough money for both. He is now willing to pay my debt on Saturday because they were planning of chilling at home while I am out and I guess he wants me out of the house. 

Now if your advice is to go through with the BBQ, I cant. Most people canceled. I wanted to go through with it to show them they are still living underneath my house and they have to abide my rules. I don't mind if they want to spend time on their own as I understand they don't get to see each other but this is a bit ridiculous. What should I do ?

TL:DR

Girlfriend manipulates my brother to get them to stay at my place because they don't allow men in her hostel. They take over my place and I have to find things to do on my own. When I ask for sometime with the both of them she would rather stay inside then join and he would only be allowed to join BBQ. I decided to throw a BBQ where I invite all my friends which will force them to join us now my brother wants me to cancel the BBQ because ""They like spending time on their own and not with others"".

214,"Before I write this, I want to say mental health is a real thing and is important to take serious. Some people do have mental health problems, but in this generation I see a lot of people who claim to have mental health issues, I guess because it’s a trend to blame mental health. On social media you always here people talking about their mental health etc, but then again maybe it’s just more normal to speak about it then it was 10years ago. Now I have this friend for about 3 years who claims to have mental health issues, however I’m beginning to think she may blame her mental health for everything. I am not sure if i am wrong for judging her this which is why I came here for advice, also for advice on how to help. Throughout our entire friendship she stated she had depression and anxiety and I have seen instances where the depression and anxiety is prevalent. For the last two years tho I honestly feel like it has been an excuse. She was living with her mom in a fairly large house, her mom was a nice lady who treated me well. Her mom would tell her to feed animals as a chore, and also to do small things such as dishes. My friend would get very upset and outburst” what does mike do!? Nothing why do I have to thisEveryday?”  Mike was the moms boyfriend is also lived there. Her moms response would be “he pays for this fucking house “ that was a ongoing issue in her home. My friend complained to her dad about her home situation and her dad recently got her an apartment in a beautiful loft that he is paying for. During this move my friend said her mental health will be better now that she isn’t at home. My friend has had about 3 jobs in our 3 year friendship , all which she hated and said it was unneeded stress and she hated going to them so she quit each one. Her dad recently had his friend hook her up with a job being a social media coordinator for a company. She texted this morning saying she hates going to the job. I will copy and paste some of her text below, I hope the format comes out well since I’m on a iPhone writing this.

“Work is really really stressing me out and giving me real bad anxiety, Sarah tells me to do something one day and the next day my boss tells me to do something else bc no one ducking knows. I need structure. They don’t give me any tasks. They literally don’t fucking know what to do with me since they had to create this stupid position for me And it fucking sucks bc I don’t even feel mentally ready. And I’ve been focusing on my job and things surrounding it and not my mental health. And I have to lie to them saying I go to a different job the other 3 days a week,He also has no idea what to have me do. They have no social media accounts so I literally have to build something from scratch. That’s so much. It is affecting me “

See in my eyes, she needs money and most jobs are stressful, but then again is that part of being depressed or is that just being entitled ?? I’m trying to help but I just think she needs more of a drive and needs her dad to stop paying her rent and putting a few thousand in her bank every month.  Is it really mental health or is a excuse for being lazy? How do I help?  I must say my friend has been on SSRI’s and came off of them. She’s currently in group therapy 3 days of the week and she stated she’s not feeling as good as she should and hasn’t made the improvements she thought she would have by now. I just need help understanding, is this how mental health issues are? She’s constantly blaming her mental health on things and idk how to help?

Do i wait for a couple of years and see if all that changes and maybe start something with me or talk to him again about plans. How. Im scared. I love him to bits and i want him to be happy.

221,"i haven't had the best relationship with my parents my entire life. my dad was super strict on my sister and i to the point where we were very afraid of him and avoided him at all costs. he used to yell at us to the point where we started crying for not doing things his way or for not understanding what he wanted us to do. i feel like he only every really interacted with us when he was yelling. he also only really cared about us doing chores the way he wanted them to be done (the whole house needed to be absolutely spotless). it was so extreme to the point where he told my sister, who was self-harming and battling depression, that his feelings were more important than hers and that she needs to get her chores done because he wants his house to look a certain way. this has been going on for 15+ years (im now 20 and my sister is 25)

now more recently my dad has been finding small reasons to get angry and shout at us. when i was 18 he made me quit my job (because he didn't like the fact that i was working) but said it was because he didn't want me coming home late at night/he didn't think i'd be able to balance work and school (which was complete bullshit bc my gpa was about a 3.7). recently i told him about my boyfriend, whom i've been dating for about 8 months, and he mentioned (in an unrelated conversation) about this ""rule"" where whenever i go on a date, the person has to come inside and meet both of my parents. but since i live in the middle of nowhere and more often go into the city to meet up with whoever i'm hanging out with, that has never happened. my dad got really frustrated and started yelling at me saying that i was disrespecting him and that ""when"" things go bad between my boyfriend and i, i can't come to him for help.

my dad also blames the way my sister and i turned out on our mother, who is also battling severe depression. he thinks that she was too lenient (which isn't true at all) and that's why we like her more than him. he blames all of the problems within the family on everyone but himself. my sister and i want to move out and when we brought it up to our parents they took at as a joke saying that we're not capable of living on our own. i would also like to point out that we do all of the chores in the house (wash dishes, take out the trash, wash our parents laundry) and if my sister and i aren't around to do it, it doesn't get done. my parents literally expect us to stay with them forever (or maybe at least until we get married) and try to do everything they can to make us stay, including not letting us go away for college. they even catch an attitude whenever i try to go out and get really petty by saying stuff like ""why do you always have to go hang out with friends"" ""why can't you just stay home"" ""you went out yesterday why are you going out today"" and even giving me a strict 10pm curfew while i am a full adult.

there's soooooo much more shit that my parents have said and done over the years and i keep hearing shit like you're just being a brat"" or ""they're just doing what's best for you"" but i feel like i can't be myself when i'm at home and that i can't achieve any of my goals and it's so exhausting.

We were in constant communication, either through text, Facetime or in person up until January, when he went completely off the grid. He deleted his Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat. He disconnected his number. Poof. 

We have almost no connections to Andy's family or life outside of the experiences we've shared. We don't know their names, addresses, current locations.

226,"In college I was friends with a girl from work but most of the time it just felt like she was taking advantage of me being nice. She ended up quitting but we remained friends although a lot of my actual friends didn't really enjoy her presence. I would invite her out with us but some of my friends would make different plans if they knew she was coming.

Anyways, it also always seemed like she was using me. Most of the time when she would contact me is if she needed a ride somewhere because her car wasn't the best. She also lived with me for two months while she was looking for somewhere to live. At this time I gave her a key to my apartment but she never gave it back once she moved and thought it was funny when I came home from class and she was just chilling in my apartment even though by this time she found a place to live. I hate confrontation so after a couple months I finally worked up the courage to ask for the key back. She was reluctant but gave it back to me. 

She is also very self centered and when I talk to her we always only talk about her. I know I have a problem opening up to people in the first place but being 'friends' with someone for so long you think I would be able to talk to her about things. 

Once her lease was up she asked to live with me for a few months again until she found a place. Luckily, this time I had another friend who would be staying with me during that time so I had an excuse to tell her no. After this we kind of drifted apart and finally I moved 2 and a half hours away.

Recently, she moved to a city that's near where my boyfriend lives so if I post anything on snapchat with a geotag when I'm with him she messages me asking to hang out. I always say we'll make plans one day but then I never actually do. I'd honestly prefer hanging out with my boyfriend especially since I don't want to start a friendship with her again.

On the other hand, since I've moved I really only hang out with my boyfriend because my actual friends live 2 hours away and I don't have time to make new friends. This weekend my boyfriend is going to be working a closing shift but I was going to chill at his house while I wait for him to be done with work.

I'm a regular lurker on r/environment r/lostgeneration r/collapse for a while now and it's certain that the world is doomed. I try to be optimistic about it (clean energy and recycling etc) and I see some uplifting articles about how countries are taking on global warming and moving over to other sources of energy and protecting endangered species, but it seems that we are past the point if return no matter what we do. I can recycle all the plastic bottles I want and turn off the tap when I brush my teeth but the world will still go to shit by the time I'm middle aged.

232,"Some backstory first for further understanding of the situation:

I'm a 20 year old male, my gf is soon to be 21. We found out about the pregnancy in May, and decided that we want to keep the baby. Both of us are extremely happy about that, and we are looking very forward to it. My mother's side of the family is very supportive, and very happy for us. So is my girlfriend's entire family, and it's been a huge help.

I'll try my best to keep this short, but I kind of need to vent a little bit about it as well I guess.. So please bear with me.

First off, I lived with my mother until I was 13, when I moved to my dad because I was a bit of a difficult teenager at the time. My mother though, has always been extremely loving, a great mother, and treated me like an individual. She always listened to my concerns, fears, opinions and I was always taken seriously no matter my age. I love her very much.

I told my dad about the pregnancy last. This is because I know him as a person, and I knew for sure he was not gonna be happy about it. I also recently found out after speaking to my girlfriend and her family about my situation at home growing up with my dad and my stepmom, that I was abused.

This is something that has been eye opening for me, as I always thought the way I was treated was normal. But I've always been verbally abused, getting yelled at all the time for nothing, being treated like I'm just a child all the time, even as an adult now. Decisions were taken for me, I was told, whatever I did, that it wasn't good enough, that I wasn't good enough and can't support myself at all doing anything myself. My father physically hit me twice when I was younger, and I was led to believe it was normal, being guilt tripped about ruining the family when I eventually told my teacher about it and my dad found out. Nothing came of it.

So, in short, I've lived in fear of my dad for years.  Never daring to stand up to him out of fear of what might happen, and it ruined my own self esteem. I moved in with my girlfriend a year ago, and it's been fantastic for me mentally.

So yeah, let me get to the point. I told my dad about it, he got furious as expected, yelling, telling me I fucked myself over. But after lots of supporting words from her family and my mother and grandparents on that side, I was confident this was the last straw, as I'm not letting anyone try to tell us what to do, especially regarding our child.

I remained calm the entire time I was speaking to him, telling him that I've been afraid of him for a long time, and that it's affected me a lot mentally how they treated me, verbally and physically. And he just called it bullshit. 

So I told him if you're gonna be like this, block my fucking number cause I'm done being told what to do. He called me a coward, and that I have one day to apologise for everything I said. And like hell I'm doing that, I think he should be the one apologising. So I blocked him, my stepmother, and I have no plans on contacting them again.

But I have two little brothers, aged 11 and 8. The oldest brother is depressed and suicidal, and he's just 11. I know a lot of it is because of the situation at home. And I feel so damn guilty about leaving them. I want to contact them somehow. I have my brothers snapchat, but I know what I say is gonna reach my dad and stepmom anyways. I also have no clue how to explain any of this to them.

I'm sorry for the long text. Any advice would be deeply appreciated as I'm concerned about them, and I don't want to lose them for good, even if I have no plans on contacting my dad there. I just want them to know it's not their fault.

And if there's any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.",18Jul2018,6

234,"Hi, 

Hope this is an appropriate place to ask this question.  

I have a really good long distance friend who constantly asks me if I’m OK or sending me texts checking in on me whenever we go for a few says without chatting, and even after I’ve said that I’m busy taking care of a lot of stuff in life. This is true since I got a lot of work pressure and other life events which I won’t go into. My other friends respect my space.  They check in once and wait for my response. This person just does it every 2-3 days and it really annoys me. Sometimes I just don’t want to socialize and just to be left alone so I can deal with my stuff. She told me that she does this to everyone and a friend actually asked her to not contact her [the friend] again because of this.  I feel like telling her straight out that I’m alright and I just need some space to sort my shit out. I just don’t want her to feel offended. I think this behavior, while sweet and caring, is just too needy for me. I understand that with long distance friendships, you can’t know if the person is ok unless you all text. But I feel like she’s not respecting my boundaries.  Like I check in on friends but I don’t do it every few days or so like this,  I understand people have lives.  Im not sure what to do or what to say to my friend without offending her.  

Please send me you wisdom and insights.  Thank you so much in advance!!!! 

- mildly annoyed chicken 

PS: I realize I may come across as prissy or ungrateful when I have people who care but sometimes I just want to be left on my own to recuperate and to do some self care.  I count myself lucky that I have people who care but you know, I think I should be allowed to have my own personal space.

235,"(X-posted from /r/careerguidance)

Hi! 

So I’m trying to get back with my old company. I left on really good terms with two references. 

My manager was a really cool guy who I jived really well with. I’m not liking my current job, it’s boring and soul sucking. He was my reference on my most recent position at that company, and was happy to send a letter of recommendation to their hiring manager. 

I’m wondering if it is still appropriate to ask to send a letter of recommendation to the hiring manager of the job I’m trying to get into at the company. I feel weird about it and I’m just trying to make sure I’m being professional. 

Thanks guys!

236,"My bf had an unusual and strained relationship with his mother due to her mental health and alcohol problems. (That’s putting it nicely.) He and I have been together for almost 7 months and I have not met his parents yet due to this, despite them being less than an hour away and him regularly hanging out with my parents/family. I was finally supposed to meet them this weekend. We got a call from his father at work this morning saying his mother was dead. Our supervisor immediately sent us home from work and I assumed I would go with him, but he told me he didn’t want me to come and that he just wanted to be alone. 

I don’t want to make this about me, and I know that a lot of my feelings are about me and not about him. That’s why I haven’t pushed the issue and am just at home now, not sure what to do. I never got to meet his mom and still haven’t met his dad. I understand it would feel out of place and might be too much for him to handle to have me there with everything else going on. But I love this guy, care about him a lot, and I want to be there for him. However he is (and has been) extremely private about anything with his family, specifically his mom. Comforting/consoling those that I care about has always come naturally to me and never been difficult. I’ve never been in a relationship where someone wouldn’t open up to me about something like this. 

Is there anything that I actually CAN do for him?",18Jul2018,26

238,"Hello! I'm a 26 year old male and about three years ago I moved into a big house which was occupied by one other tenant. She was very weird and anti-social and she had a very angsty 'punk' vibe about her. At the time I was in a pretty bad place in my life. I had just dropped out of University, I was working a dead end job, a lot of my friends were moving onto bigger things and well, I was sorta stuck. Amid this loneliness I decided to start chatting to my new house mate and got to know her a little bit. One thing led to another, we'd hang out in each others rooms and talk a lot. After awhile we started cuddling. And then after more of awhile we started taking our clothes off and cuddling (never took our underwear off though). It was pretty good to be honest, it was nice to feel closer to someone, but the more I got close to her, the more she would 'guilt trip' me on things. She would avoid eye contact with me, slam the doors behind her in the morning etc. And then when I'd ask her, 'what's up?', she'd just avoid the question and continue being in a mood with me. I noticed that she'd always blast really repetitive punk music from her room whenever she was in a mood with me. I'd have to go to her room and make her feel better. I almost felt like it was my duty to make her feel better. And I'm a sucker for this. I've always been the type of guy that likes to make people laugh, and I hate to see people upset. 

After a few months we both went our separate ways. I moved back to my hometown and started a business. I have no idea where she went. But a few months pass, my business is going great, I'm actually succeeding, when I get a phone call from the police asking if I would come in for questioning. And so of course I oblige. I had no idea what the police wanted at first. I assumed it was something relating to one of my friends, or maybe I was an eye witness to something. It wasn't until about a day before going to the police station that it clicked that maybe it was related to her, after the police called me up a second time and recommended I get a lawyer etc. So I went in for questioning without a lawyer, I mean I've got nothing to hide so what the heck. The questioning was quite brief. I told them my side of the story and that was that. 

It's been two years since that police interview and overtime it's been harder for me to live. I'm a 26 year old virgin whose never been in a relationship and the FIRST person I get close to happens to be a fucking psycho. God knows what could happen if she finds out I'm actually successful now. I mean, she could potentially ruin my career in an instant in this climate I imagine. So I'm constantly faced with this fear of her, it's like she's a mental block in my head. All my goals and drive is constantly being hindered by the thought of her ruining me one day. It's my fault for getting close to somebody who was blatantly crazy from the get go. I'm worried that maybe she isn't doing anything with her life, and one day she might devote herself to ruining me so she can get attention and be part of these toxic movements (#metoo etc). Meanwhile I'm over here working my ass off every day. 

So that's the story. I'm very suicidal at times because I've always tried to be a good person and the image I have of myself is now distorted by her accusations. I'm constantly torn between my ambitions and her in my head. I want to live. I love life. I love people. I want to see the world and fall in love. But at the same time, there's this darkness of her in my head. I'm reminded of all the times she went full psycho on me. The time she smashed all the plates in the kitchen on the floor because I didn't wash my pan the night before (I had an early morning start at work). All of these little things are in my head now and I can't seem to get rid of her. 

Any advice would be much appreciated, but I'm aware that there's not a lot I can do in this world as a white male against these sorts of accusations. ",18Jul2018,1
239," My sister is 33 years old, has a master’s degree in social work and is a Federal Probation Office. Currently she is living with our parents due to a job transition, lease ending and previous long distance job training. Despite having a solid and successful career, she struggles with a level of depression and personal satisfaction. Unfortunately, she spent the majority of her 20’s in a relationship that was not healthy or productive. Though she was able to final come to that realization, it came after 10 years of invested feelings and at a time when she was already 30 and feeling as though she was already “running behind on life”. Her typical day consists of working 10+ hours, coming home and sleeping. When she does have free time, she shops because she doesn’t have a social circle. This past year was particularly difficult for her because me as her baby sister (six years younger), I married and started a life with my husband. Though we are close, this brought out a lot of aggression in her, which caused consistent fights with both of my parents and myself. We know that a lot of this is due to the difficulty of me going through this phase first and her wanting a family, but any effort to talk or help her, she would shut down immediately. I do believe that she is still young enough to find someone and live a fulfilled life, but it requires that she take some action in working on herself. I am firm believer in therapy as I myself have gone to counseling during difficult times in my life. However, how do you encourage someone to go to therapy that does not take kindly to advice or help? Desperately seeking help for a loved one. ",18Jul2018,2
240,"My wife and I bought a condo over 2 years ago from a guy that bought, renovated and sold to us. Walls had some brush bristles in the paint, hardwood had some minor gaps here and there, and there were some other imperfections here and there. All visible when we toured and bought the house.

We just got a check from him for $2,000 out of the blue saying basically, hope all is well, please use this money to repair any of my shortcomings, if you're satisfied hold on to it for future repairs or donate to charity.

Kind if weird, but my wife and I are stuck... other than they imperfections in his work, which were very visible when we bought the place, nothing major has happened. Sure, we had to replace the garbage disposal and the drywall is soft (which sucks for trying to hang stuff, but its probably orginal from 2009 construction).

However, coming out of the blue, we are also saying maybe he sent this out of guilt and whatever 'shortcomings' he is worried about havent reared their heads yet. Or maybe he did some other shady stuff on other houses and is doing so from broad complaints.

248,"I’m going to sound like a douche. I know I am but I’m getting really really desperate. 

The context is that there’s this autistic guy called M in my school. M and I used to be in the same class for year 1 and year 2, and now we’re in year 4. He’s much taller than me too, as I am really short for my age (4”11’ at 16 years old). 

From year 1, M has been super creepy about his affection towards girls, he used to stalk one of my friends around the school compound and he used to follow me around even when we were outside school. He proclaims to his classmates that he watches porn and thinks about date rape. 

A really large problem for me is that M doesn’t leave me alone even if I tell him politely to do so. I’ll usually say something along the lines of “please leave me alone, I feel very uncomfortable and I’d like to be alone right now” but he never listens to me being polite. It’s to the point where if I’m not forceful or swearing at him, he won’t leave me alone. And when I’m slightly nicer to him, he automatically thinks I’m interested in him and then he won’t leave me alone. 

An incident like this typically happens a few times a week: M likes to come up to me and one of my friends (he insinuates that we’re lesbians for each other too, even though we’ve never shown any sign of being in a gay relationship) during break time, and he’ll attempt to start some sort of sexually explicit conversation. I’ve been told to ignore him, but if I do so, he won’t go away and he’ll jab me multiple times until I acknowledge him. 

(And it’s not just me who feels threatened. He has followed around many other girls in the school, but to my knowledge, he has never faced any consequences for his actions)

I just feel so frustrated and helpless. My Teachers always brush it off when I come to them for help, saying that “M has a condition and can’t help it, there’s nothing we can do about it.” I understand that autism is something that i will never be able to understand, however, his actions have been going unchecked for 4 years, and I’m afraid that if I don’t do something soon, his actions might escalate. 

I’m aware that maybe I’m not being understanding or tolerant enough, but there’s been so many more incidents than just the ones I’ve typed up so far. I’ve been trying to deal with this on my own for the past 4 years but I’m unable to take it anymore and I feel really uncomfortable and threatened.

256,"I just turned 21, I had plans to go working abroad at a summer camp this summer but plans fell through and now I'm stuck back at home with my parents.

Note - Everyone I know lives with there parents, in my country it's pretty common up until your mid 20's if not later.

No one is expected to move out (due to rent prices, and living out in the countryside) and most people don't have any real work, because we all live in the middle of nowhere.

I've no problem doing jobs, if I'm asked to light a fire I will, empty the dishwasher, cut the grass, bring out the bins I've no issues whatsoever, I expect to have some jobs to do.

But they're never enough, I do 30 minutes of sweeping up in the shed, my mother now wants the whole back garden swept up, and I only did '5 minutes and only a small bit of sweeping', I also apparently never do any work and to ask me anything is like pulling teeth, I say I brought up the bins earlier 'oh but that's just bringing up the bins!'.

I was asked to cut the grass today, no problem.

I started and realised there's a couple of problems.

The grass isn't that dry.

There's stones, turf and sticks all over the grass I'd spend a full day picking them up before even cutting the grass. (that's because we got a delivery not too long ago, it's not always like that).

The lawnmower was recently fixed by my dad, it's still not working right, it keeps shutting off (ride on mower).

My dad has been cutting the grass on the top setting for awhile, so he just runs around really quickly skimming some off the top, If I did the same I'd be made redo it within a week.

I'm not an only child, I've a 15 year old sister and a 19 year old brother.

My sister does nothing, if she's ever asked to it's basically tidy up after yourself (which everyone else already does).

My brother does next to nothing, he's bad allergies so I understand him not cutting the grass but he is also never asked to do anything..

My mother has to be busy, and as a result we all also have to always be busy, she does all the work in the house and we do everything else, somehow we're both always busy..

I do anything and it was only a small, little, quick, tiny, easy job.  


I'm naturally tidy, my rooms immaculate, I put away all my towels after a shower, I bring out all my bowls, plates etc.

It's not like I'm constantly kept working, but if it was up to my mother I could be.

My brother and I were made clear out behind the shed last summer.

We shoved and wheeled out a skip full of rotting grass, mulch, rock, fencing, seesaws, pogo sticks and weeds/branches.  
'Well that needed to be done, it's not like it too ye long!', as of now the back of the shed is being used again as a dumping ground.  


My dad and I spread a tonne of stones (literally, that's what we bought) over a garden feature, it took close to 2 hours, 'that back yard needs to be swept down it's very dusty, will you go out and do that sometime today?'..

I could open my own landscaping business any second now, it's ridiculous.

I found very shortly into working there that he lied about the entire position (quality/ quantity of staff, equipment, amount and type of work, his ability to teach, the list goes on)

So I filed my two weeks about a week and a half ago (worked there for only 6 weeks) in pursuit of a new , higher paying job closer to home and with just all around better benefits (several friends work there and they attest it’s a great place. I’m pretty sold.) 

Knowing the boss at my current spot is manipulative and a flatterer, I decided to not list a reason why I’m leaving, nor even the fact I got hired at his competition. Except now he is relentless in trying to get me to tell him why I’m leaving, going as far as actually pull me aside and interrogate me for a reason. He really wants me to stay, and is offering really anything for me to stay. I’m not a shit worker. Architecture is my passion and I work my hardest. 

I know if I tell him he’s a liar, manipulative, immature, and just an awful person, he is going to challenge that reasoning and argue with me that he’s a great guy. 

The thing is, I thought about leaving a letter on his desk the Friday I leave (he leaves early on Friday) indicating all of the reasons why, but I’m not sure. Its really tempting to tell him off, but at the same time there might be drama.

262,"I've been thinking about quitting my job for at least a month now. Things with my new boss have been pretty bad. He started here in April and I was ready to just up and leave by May. I have seriously been considering it recently though. He is an extreme introvert and has no social skills at all. Several department heads do not like him now either and refuse to help us when we need it (because of him exchanging words with several of them). He is extremely pushy and when he gets what he wants he complains about how it doesn't work like he wants it to. 

I do most of the work here while he leaves the office, takes naps on important days where I need his help most, and is lazy and has terrible hygiene. I've talked to the higher ups and HR about this but nobody seems to care that he's an embarrassment to the office. I know it sounds like I have it out for him, but I don't, I don't even want his job. He's made this place a toxic workplace for me to the point where I feel I am balding from the stress and anger. There's been days where I came seconds from just yelling at him at how ignorant he is about this job and how he has no business doing it. Other days I get bad stomach cramps just from being mad at knowing that while I'm slaving away, he is in his office napping or microwaving tuna fish without a care in the world of how nasty and inconsiderate that is. Keep in mind that this is a two person office only, so it's just me and him working in this department. 

About a month ago he did something that just made me start to seriously consider quitting. He sent me an email saying that he wanted me to send him a daily email before we leave the office, describing what it is that I worked on all day, as if he didn't trust that I was doing my work like I should. If I were to quit, it would be for a similar paying job, possibly returning to banking. I just don't know if I'm overreacting to this or if this is legitimate grounds for feeling like quitting.",18Jul2018,1
263,"I need some advice, reddit.

My SO has been at their job for almost 4 years. Started out designing catalogs but has slowly transitioned into more a Production/Layout Artist position where they are mostly making corrections to the catalogs (catalog designed is now outsourced to India). 

2015 was great. 2016 - they took away their bonus structure and introduced mandatory overtime during Aug-Nov. There were weeks where they were working 6a-7p. 2017 had the same overtime during Aug-Nov except hours were then cut in December to compensate for all the overtime that was paid out earlier in the year. Now we are in 2018 and they have been notified that their PTO will now not carry over (Vacation/Sick is bundled into a single PTO bank. Previously, you could carry over 40 hours). Since they accrue time off based on hours work, this new policy means that as of January 1st, everyone will have 0 hours. [I feel that this is ridiculous but, I digress]

It seems like every year something else gets changed for the worse at this job. It has gotten to the point that during their busy time, I develop extreme anxiety because I know my SO gets upset when they are pulling 55+ hour weeks. 

SO feels discouraged because they feel that they have have settled into this current position and won't be able to find another job...

Should my SO just deal with what this job has put forth? Any advice on taking some classes to find a more in-demand job?

264,"Yet again, I’m seeking out advice from the Reddit community. I think I’ve entered a period of just feeling bad for myself, although I shouldn’t be. 

I recently got out of a relationship that I believe was unhealthy and dangerous for me. The farther I get removed from it, the harder it is becoming for me to remember the bad, and my head just fills with things I miss from it. I have several posts outlining what all happened in that relationship. 

I have dreams of applying to PA school, and as it becomes time to take those steps, I’m thinking so negatively. I keep thinking that I have to wait at least a year before I’m into the school, then I will have to move, and then be busy all the time. When will I have time to meet my significant other? I’m very much looking forward to one day having a family. 

It seems so much scarier facing this journey to PA school alone now. I miss the promises of having someone to support me through the rigors of school, I miss the thought of having at least one income during school, and I am just feeling rather down in general.

I suppose I’m looking for some advice in two ways. How do I get over the guy, and quit blaming myself? And how do I keep my head up knowing that I’m facing these next steps alone nowhere 

A little summary of my relationship for details:
I believe, from what I have read online, he was a bit of a narcissist. It killed my confidence and I still find myself to this day saying, “oh, he wasn’t so bad, I probably caused a lot of his actions.” I had extremely bad anxiety around him, and often was in bad moods (I believe this was due to him, I’m generally upbeat). He was ready to marry me within a few months of meeting, pushed moving quickly, I became isolated from any male friends, there was some physical abuse, etc... 
I find myself missing his constant compliments, having someone there all the time, and the promises of a future. I’m worried somehow I was the root of his problems, and I messed up something wonderful. ",18Jul2018,1

I am 35, and have been in Tampa Florida for a year. I have an MBA and about 65k in debt from school, but little debt elsewhere, about 10k. 

For some reason its nearly impossible for me to find a good job! I do everything you're supposed to do: have a great resume (hiring managers have told me,) interview well, dress nice, write cover letters for all jobs I apply to etc, but lack a lot of experience. I have 2 years finance, 3 years Operations management and 1 year insurance sales since college. I did well in Ops management and those are mostly the jobs I apply to.

I dont apply to anything over $50k and can't seem to even get interviews. They all want to low ball me at $30-35k. I know I am qualified for the positions but the salaries are always so low it's hard to earn anything over paying my bills. 

I have signed up for Radioligy Tech classes thinking I can go back to school, earn an associates in this field, and will hopefully never have to worry about getting a job since they are in high demand in the medical field. Anyone have experience trying this? Suggestions? Most likely I'll be over $100k in debt at that point, but can't see the point in working any longer at dead end jobs for no pay. ",18Jul2018,3

He seemed very friendly through conversation, but later on yesterday I had an appointment for something so as I was leaving I went to go get my wallet (where I ALWAYS lay it.. on my bookshelf) and it was gone. I would bet every dollar I have he stole it, that's how sure I am.

My wallet had the following inside:

Debit Card (which I reported as stolen last night)

Drivers License

4 Student ID's from previous years

25$ cash

I have gotten a new license already and am getting a new card today. My main concern with this is that if I report this, he will most likely just get fired and not arrested because I don't have any actual proof to get him arrested. If I just get him fired, I am extremely scared he will backlash and use all that information about me he now has from my license and student ID's (or even worse come and try to murder me at my house, but I am really not worried about this scenario).

271,"I’ve been labeled by my classmates as gay ever since elementary school. I’m about to start senior year of high school and I think a lot of people at my school have the idea that I’m gay. It’s made relationships quite difficult. 

I’ve had someone who I was very interested in invite me to two formal events as her date before she offhandedly mentioned something about me being gay. I corrected her saying I wasn’t gay and she seemed surprised. This was even after I took her out to a pretty nice restaurant for dinner which seemed to be a date to me. After I mentioned I wasn’t gay and I actually had feelings for her she said that she wasn’t interested. That sucked but it’s ok not to reciprocate feelings others have for you. What mainly sucked about that was that I misinterpreted her asking me to these events as  her being interested in me. She just thought I was her gay friend with a tux that wouldn’t mind spending an evening driving her around and watching boring presentations. I don’t even think we’re really that much of friends. She just was required to have a date and I’m a sucker for her so I said I’d go. 

Another case of someone assuming I was gay was by a coworker at the store I work at. He is actually gay and I thought he would understand how annoying it is to be mislabeled by people. He asked me why i had to ask for a Saturday off and I said I had to go to a formal event with someone. I showed him some pictures from it and he said my date looked pretty. I responded with “she is but unfortunately she doesn’t like me in the way I like her.” He then gives me a funny look and says “I thought you were gay.” This shocked me because he’s outside of my normal high school community and wouldn’t have heard rumors from anyone. 

These two events are just the two of the most recent instances. I had a girlfriend about a year ago who would make jokes about me being gay and tell me to start walking like a straight man. It’s hard to believe that a girl actually likes me now because I’ve started to believe they just think I’m gay. I don’t know what to do because I want to be true to myself and be who I am. I don’t want to play a character that seems more straight or bro-ish I guess. ",18Jul2018,2

She however only work Tuesday-Friday 9-12 and calls out at least 1-2 days a week and is ALWAYS late, which is why he needs me. So I start this job, and this girl is responsible for training me, she's late my 1st and 2nd day. My 3rd-5th day she doesnt even show up, no call- no show. She finally comes in and i learn she is my boss's neighbor and his wife's best friend, so that explains why she can come and go as she pleases. She will show me how to do things but wont let me do them. My boss had a talk with her and told her that i needed to be trained on all of the daily, weekly, monthly tasks because i would be taking over and he would use her for special projects, so she shows me, we make a list of things I will be doing and then she shows up early like an hour and a half before we open to make sure all of my responsibilities are done before i get to work. She also came into work on Monday (her actually scheduled day off) just to make sure it looks like i'm not needed. 

  I don't know what to do, I don't feel like i can go to my boss and tell him what's going on, she is his friend and I am still very new, But i NEED this job, I WANT this job, this is a career for me. I dont want him to think i'm being petty or insecure. But its hard to show up to work for 8 hours and just sit and wait for the phone to ring because you're trainer wont train you.

For example, we forgot our appartement keys in the car, he got so angry he just started to say “omg how I hate this shit, for fuck sakes *swear words in Russian*”. Or, after work we drove home and there was a truck driving in front of us and couldn’t get on the road because of the traffic and it’s size. My boyfriend started yelling and groaning and hitting the steering wheel and just acting like a temper tantrum big boy, all I could do in that moment was to stay quite and close my ears, as I do every time he gets like this, cause if I say anything he will lash out at me.

I have talked about this a lot of times with him, he always says that he is just tired of life, cause he had to start working and making money for himself since he was just a teenager and he is sick of seeing all his friends enjoying summers, doing good at collages, not having to work cause parents still provide for them (including me). He just hates that he has to borrow money from me almost every month. He hates that his mom isn’t educated at all, that in no way possible his parents can support him anyhow. 

Because all of this, he says, he gets those moments where he just can’t handle it anymore and lashes out.

I want to help him. I am now going to psychiatrist, drinking some antidepressants myself and it has changed me A LOT! I want him to go to my doctor only once a month as I do, I am willing to pay for the appointments and (if needed) medicine. BUT he refuses, he says that he won’t take money from me, but he won’t pay himself case it’s too expensive.

284,"Quickest of backstories: I belatedly started looking into graduate schools after I got my BS in an engineering discipline. I was quickly directed to a research group that perfectly fit with my past experience and they were interviewing for immediate positions. After meeting with two of the professors, things felt hopeful and I left both meetings with a general sense of positivity and receptiveness. 

Issue at hand: They abruptly replied that none of them want me. This is not a funding issue, that is secure and set. There is a possibility that someone had been chosen over me, but there were several open positions, so they’d need to have found 7-8 spectacular candidates. I truly believe this is a “me thing”. 

To elaborate a bit, I’m fairly outgoing and self-assured for an engineer and speak well, though sometimes too much. I had an incredibly similar experience happen after a job interview where the hiring manager signed off with, Can’t wait to have you here, then sent me an email the following week rejecting me and detailing that they thought it didn’t seem to like the city enough. 

I don’t feel like an out of touch person but this would definitely happen to an out of touch person. The advice I’m seeking is, what sort of composure should I be aiming for and what are things to keep in my head to maintain it.

My husband and I get healthcare through my employer, but after it comes out, I’m not even getting paid enough to cover the cost of childcare. Another issue with this, is that the cheapest childcare option in our area will also be charging us for weeks when the schools are on break (I completely understand why they need to, but it’s hard to spend that much money on a service we aren’t using). 

While I love what I do, it feels ridiculous to continue to work knowing that I won’t even make enough to pay for childcare. Really, I would be paying to go to work rather than getting paid for it, just so someone else can raise my children. 

The healthcare coverage we get through my employer is decent. And while my husband’s employer also offers health benefits, it isn’t quite as good, and there aren’t any in-network providers in our area.

I decided to visit home for a couple of months but my dad got sick and I decided to stay and help him and my mother out with my little sister. Started training at a law office about 10 months ago. I think it's important to mention I barely get paid, as in $300 a month.

I've always known I wanted to be an artist, whenever I mentioned it to my parents they'd shrug it off as it was ""just a hobby"". I let it go for a couple of years but now I find myself constantly wanting to spend my days improving myself and working to be an illustrator/graphic designer.

I feel like I've reached a plateau in my art and there are no schools/universities/courses around that I could take. 

I don't know if I should just leave my parents and little sister, quit my job and move somewhere else to work some bar job and make money for art classes, or if I should just stick out the rest of my training and get basically no pay (I finish training in 2020).

I know that what I want to do in life is be an illustrator and graphic designer. But working in law isn't completely depressing and I find myself constantly looking at different ways to improve, though I'm not sure if that's just boredom. ",18Jul2018,1

I had a decent time met some nice people, and afterwards went over to some old friends house.

While there I was drunk and wasn't that mentally aware, during that time a guy brought me t othe back room and started to kiss me and touch me and do awful things I didn't want.

He stopped when I started to cry and I ran back to the others and just sobbed until I sobered up and went home.

I don't know what to do, why didn't I say no? I can't blame him because I didn't say no, but I didn't want to do the things he did, I felt violated.

301,"My moms ex boyfriend on her and all he does is take and take and then argues and whine when he doesn't get his way. I can barely look at him now because of what he did.

 The problem is that he has depression and suicidal tendencies. They actually separated for 3 days and my mom got his oldest child taken away (not for lack of a reason.) He came back suicidal so my mom is in a really bad spot. The way I see it she should do everything in her power to contact the family and THEN cut him out. I don't see a reason why she has to do anything else. She has no obligations, especially because of what he's doing to our family.   


He actually caused a rift between me and my mom and we had to go to family counselling. thankfully there wasn't much of a problem to fix but she still sees the family counselor on an individual basis. My mom is also getting her masters degree in counselling in a couple weeks and that might have something to do with it. But clearly neither of them are addressing the elephant in the room.   


I don't know what to do. I hate him with a passion and I hate the fact the he's doing this to her even more. I know that the situation is more complicated then it seems but I don't understand why it should be. He shouldn't be on his own. He should be with family.  My mom shouldn't have to deal with this.  


Another thing I didn't mention is that he has kids. Kids that he is absolutely unfit to raise. His apartment is a pigsty and he'll go to sleep and leave a four year old and six year old all alone. Sometime he has his other child (A ten year old and the oldest one.) And he has him take care of them while he naps. Honestly I'm more worried about the kids than anything. But I don't know what to do because the last time he got his oldest child taken away he went suicidal. Though to be fair he's only though about suicide a handful of time but that doesn't make it any better. I don't know where to post this so I thought I'd try here first.",18Jul2018,1

303,"We've had our Cocker-Spaniel since early spring, and we love him like a child. We had to put down our last dog in the fall of 2014 due to failing health. Since then, we've only entertained the idea of getting another dog. We like the freedom of being able to leave the house whenever we want, for however long, etc.

I would prefer that my friends and family not know my private matters, so for this post my dogs name is ""Ralph"".

Like I said, we got Ralph in the spring. He was a rescue dog from a different state. My wife has a friend who fosters dogs until she can find a suitable home. She was well aware of our love for dogs. Since our last dog, we always said; ""We would love to have another dog, but he'd have to be the right bread, gender, house broken and well trained.""

It just so happened that her friend had recently obtained a dog with all the qualities we wanted. He's 3 y.o. very well trained/house broken and loves to be around people. My wife and I had a long talk and agreed to an in home visit, just to see the dog. That's all it took. "" Ralph"" is now a family member, perfect in every way, (this is where I'll get into explaining the title of this post) except for.....

Ralph seems to get stressed out when my wife and I get close, as in hugging, kissing and yes, when we're getting more intimate. To add, at night Ralph has slept on our bed with us since we got him, despite the fact that we bought him his own large, comfy pillow bed which has since been at the foot of our bed in the corner collecting dust.

Anyway, our sex life has declined because our dog doesn't approve of us getting physically close. He's never gotten angry. He just runs around the room, jumps from the floor to bed and back down, tries to get between us. Not to mention, he has doggy toys which squeak. He will sit there with his favorite squeaky toy in his mouth and frantically chew on it so it's a constant ""SQUEAK - SQUEAK - SQEEEEEAAK"".

At first, it was hilarious. We'd be getting down and dirty while Ralph is squeaking his toy. We'd hear this loud squeak with every movement during sex and we would laugh hysterically! But now, the humor of it all has been replaced by frustration.

If we keep him outside of our room and close the bedroom door, he claws at the door and barks.

Also, we have never kenneled him, plus it makes me crazy seeing a dog in a kennel, even though I know it's how you housebreak a dog, starting as a puppy, which he is not.

I told my wife we'll just have to get him used to it by having sex more often. Easier said than done when Ralph is driving us crazy.

If anyone has had similar experiences and/or advice, PLEASE PLEASE give it!! My sex life depends on it!!",18Jul2018,1
304,"Back story: there were 12 people and 6 bedrooms at an Airbnb rental. My brother kicked me out of one bedroom for one of his friends. All the other bedrooms were taken so I figured I’ll sleep in my brothers and SIL bedroom which had enough beds and couches to hold 6 people. Apparently she got offended I slept in the same room as her the first night but didn’t tell me. Second night my brother kicks me out without saying why. She got offended again for me “invading her privacy” which I had no idea I was doing. I was in that room to sleep on a couch and only that. 

After that night and for the next 3 weeks I noticed she wouldn’t even acknowledge my existence. Felt a little off but we don’t interact much anyways, she’s always been quiet around me. 

Now my brother brings up the issue 3 weeks later. We talk and work things out. I felt sorry for not knowing what I did and said i would apologize to her in person. Now my brother is telling me she doesn’t want to see me and wants a strictly handwritten letter of apology. 

I know she doesn’t want to see me but I feel like her being this way ruin our immediate family’s dynamics.

308,"As my username suggests, I've never been more confused and broken. I need help. Anyone who is willing to read this and give me your honest opinion is my hero. I won't leave anything out.

My husband and I got married straight out of high school a little over a year ago. I know how young that is, but at the time I thought it was the best thing for us because we've been together since I was 14 years old. I just thought nothing could ever tear us apart.

Let me begin by saying that I was crazy over this guy from the first time we met. There were many times we hurt each other, but we kept going back. Looking back, there were so many red flags at the time, but I was too delusioned and insecure to see them. For starters, when we first got together he was in love with someone else and I always felt compared to her and not good enough, and that shattered my self-esteem. I helped him through it though, because I loved him. There were several times within the first year or so that he almost left me because he didn’t think he’d ever love me like her. It was hard.

Eventually he got over her though, and he was all about me. Sometimes things were wonderful, but we fought a lot and looking back he really didn’t treat me like he should have for a long time. I was kind of treated like an option. There were times he would go days without even giving me the time of day, despite me actually needing someone at the time. He would always come up with some bullshit excuse that didn’t make sense. It would be that he had slept a lot (no one sleeps for three days..) or that his internet was down (he had a phone..). He said he really did love me, he just didn’t see the point in talking over the phone. During this time people constantly told me he didn’t treat me right and that I deserved better, but I just couldn’t see it.

I’m not saying I was perfect at this time. I was a mess. I hated myself and looked to him for validation, putting too much on him. I always overanalyzed everything he said and twisted things the wrong way. I see that now.

Despite this, when we were together things were great. Being with him has always been where I feel safe. We argue sometimes, and he drives me crazy..but he’s always been my best friend and that meant more than all of the bad combined.

Toward the middle of my senior year things started to take a turn. I was no longer as much of an insecure little girl and he was treating me like his number one priority. He loved me more than anything, I knew it. Things were a bit different for me though..I still loved him, but I wasn’t as obsessed like I used to be. I guess being hurt by him so many times did that. I still loved him though, more than anything, and I thought getting married would be the best thing ever.

Before we married he told me that once I was his wife he would always do everything he could to take care of me. He said he would make sure I had everything I needed and do everything he could to make me happy. I believed him. Things actually ended up being quite perfect for a while. Everything was like I had always dreamed. I was happy..until the summer was over and it was time for both of us to start actually working and getting into the real world. Before we married I knew he had trouble with working...he didn't even work enough to take me on a honeymoon. I just assumed everything he had told me was true and that would all change. But it didn’t.

At first he went about two or three days a week, which wasn't great but I could live with. But now (a year later) it has gotten to the point where he hasn't even had any hours at all on the past 3 paychecks, and he hasn't worked even 10 days since 2018 began. He works for his dad, so he doesn’t get fired for it, but he also doesn’t get a paycheck. Meanwhile, I work every single day, sometimes way overtime. Sometimes I find myself coming home and seeing him sit there playing video games of the couch and it just makes me resent him so much. After working I have to come home and do all of the cleaning and everything, and he acts like it kills him when I ask him to help me do something. He will do things when they absolutely need done, and by that I mean he will put the dishes in the washer if there are literally none left to use. But that's pretty much all.

The thing is, he always has a valid excuse though. He has insomnia and can’t sleep a wink most days. I know that has to be hard, and I’ve tried for a year to find something to do about it. I’ve tried to get him to go to the doctor time after time, but he won’t. He makes me feel horrible for getting mad about it though, because he truly does have a problem. But how long can he keep making excuses? How long will this go on? He keeps promising me that he will go ""tomorrow"" or ""next week"" but then that comes around and he doesn't go, despite how genuine his claimed seemed at the time. When I bring it up or get upset over it, he tells me everything will get better and I need to give him more time. It’s been over a year now though and it still hasn’t. And yeah, sometimes I get so angry that I go crazy and I just have to let all of the anxiety and frustration out. Sometimes I yell at him, or say something I don't mean..and I know I shouldn't do that, but I just have so much anger and sadness in me sometimes. I'm already an anxious person, so having all of this on me just makes me want to die sometimes. I do everything. He hardly ever helps. I’m about to start school full time. With that plus my full time job, I don’t know how I’m going to do it all combined with the stress of having someone else completely dependent on me and having to keep all of our bills paid myself. It’s even worse to know that there is someone there who loves me and should help, but he won’t. He says he wants to, but he just can’t.

On top of all of this, everyone has always told me that he acts very abusive, but I've truly never seen it. Like, we were hanging out with some friends the other day and he made some jokes and apparently it really rubbed the people there the wrong way. They won’t even hang out with us anymore. That has happened so many times. I don't know if they just don't get him or if I'm just so used to it. When we argue he punches holes in the wall and starts screaming and breaking things, making me feel like I need to just shut up or he will break everything in the house. When I start telling him about how hurt I am he just tells me I'm making too big of a deal out of it and I should enjoy our time together instead of arguing, and if I still go on about it he calls me pathetic and says I'm being a child. The other day he punched my arm pretty damn hard, it made a small bruise. But to be fair, I am always nagging and being horrible whenever he does something like that. That's only the second time he has every laid a hand on me though, out of all the years we've been together. And I know he'd never actually hurt me. I know this sounds like what an abused woman would say, but I truly do provoc it. I'm kind of crazy sometimes, and I know that..but I'm that way because of everything I just wrote about. I'm constantly so stressed out trying to make it all on my paycheck alone. He does have horrible insomnia though and he gets sick a lot, so I feel like it truly isn't his fault that he can't work. But sometimes I feel like I should leave.

I’ve been thinking hard about leaving lately. I’ve told both my mom and my friend about it, and they both say I need to, but every time I do I just feel so guilty, like I’m hurting him and tearing his world apart, especially since I recently did something horrible. This is going to make me sound like a bad person, but I cheated on him with my friend. We had sex. To be fair, we were going to have a threesome anyway and he was fine with it, but I know that doesn’t justify anything. I feel like shit for what I did, I was just so angry at him and tired of feeling helpless and depressed. I just wanted to get my mind off of everything.

This really is killing me. I wrote him a 4 page note about a month ago explaining that all of this pressure is making me suicidal and that I can’t do it anymore. He threw it away and told me I was overreacting. He said he would start working after he read it, but he hasn’t been one day since.

I almost left yesterday. I was at home without anything to eat or any makeup to wear. The only thing in the house to eat was half of an old frosty from a week ago. I told him if he loved me he wouldn’t be okay with putting me through this, and all he did was point out that he’s going through it too. That’s true, but I’m not the one doing it to him. I almost left, and his parents came up and heard about what was going on, and basically they blame both of us for it. They say that we’re a team and if he won’t work I need to learn to budget on one paycheck. I explained how hurt it makes me, and they just said that unless he physically abuses me I have no right to leave. I got so angry at that. I felt worthless, like my life doesn’t matter. Like it doesn’t matter if I’m hurt and suicidal every day. After they left I was crying over it and he said that I was just mad someone disagreed with me. He also said taht no one else would react like I do over all of this, and that anyone else would say it wasn’t that big of a deal. He makes me feel horrible for wanting to leave, he says that means I never loved him if I could leave over something so “silly.”

I told him he had today to go and if he didn’t I would leave. He still didn’t go. He cried all night over me, but still didn’t go. He said he hadn’t slept in a week and couldn’t. I told him if he didn’t go then he had to make a doctor’’s appointment, but he refused to do that either. He said he would straighten it out himself by tomorrow, but he has told me that every day for over a year. I pointed that out, and then we started arguing. He starting hitting the walls and calling me names.

I just don’t know what to do. Would I be in the right to leave? He’s my best friend. I never want to hurt him. I feel like I would be ruining his life. Plus, thinking about actually leaving and never holding him again literally makes me sick. I’ve been aching all day. ",18Jul2018,4
309,"So I was friends with a girl who had some pretty severe mental health issues. When we moved in together she would scream at me and make me feel uncomfortable and then say it was because she didn't like change and would adjust over time. Well, she didn't. She got more and more mean and disrespectful towards me and our other roommate. She would belittle us for having loving significant others and say our ideas of what sex and love were, were wrong and that we were clearly unhappy and trying to shame her because she was sexually open and body positive. We never shamed her for her sexual choices, she shamed us for ours.

She would walk around naked all the time, making us incredibly uncomfortable and regularly make sexual comments towards us both, as well as my boyfriend and the other roommate's girlfriend. When we told her we didn't appreciate that, she screamed at us and said we were overly sensitive clingy bitches who needed to stop being so possessive. My boyfriend regularly told her via voice chat he didn't like her nor did he appreciate the vile comments she made and she threw even bigger fits. Eventually I moved out after a month and a half and went full no contact with her. Blocked all her numbers and removed her from social media and refused to speak to her.

The problem is she's using our mutual friends to harass me even though I've repeatedly told them I want nothing to do with her and owe her no explanation as to why I left and why I cut her out of my life. They don't agree and say I need to talk to her and forgive her because she's mentally unwell. They won't leave me alone and some of them eveb refuse to speak to me for forcing our drama onto them. I feel as though this is unfair because I don't bring it up and want no part of it. How should I handle this moving forward? Just say fuck it and ignore them too?",18Jul2018,26
311,"I am in an apartment out of state from my home for a summer internship. I thought that I had to give 30 days notice to vacate since I'm not renewing my lease, which would be today. I called them today to let them know that I won't be renewing my lease, and they told me that I was actually supposed to give 60 days notice. The penalty for not giving notice within 60 days is one month rent (to be paid before moving out), and the penalty for not giving notice within 30 days (or not giving notice at all) is 2 month's rent.

I was already going to only *maybe* be able to pay last months rent, pay for a moving truck, pay for movers, and pay first month's rent on my apartment back at school.

The reason I'm not in highschool is because I dropped out, and I have two more tests to take before I finish my GED, which won't be hard.

When I was in highschool, my stress levels were beyond overwhelming because I failed every single class.

The reason I failed is because I was being pressured by my grandparents to be a certain way, and didn't have any room to breathe and be myself.

I tried talking to them, but they'd always turn the conversation around and make it about how much they just wanted me to pass and have a good life.

320,"So today I have an interview for an unpaid internship that's in another state that I'll be moving to. I guess I'm asking, are they really as bad as they're made out to be? The position is for a marketing internship. I'm not attending college so the only thing I'll be gaining is experience.

My situation is this: moving to a new state soon, and have been applying to jobs where I'll be moving. I came across this unpaid marketing internship and applied, and have an interview scheduled today. I will be living with a friend, and money is not an issue for him so that will not be a problem.

I'm aware of the negative connotations that arise when someone mentions an unpaid internship. Slavery, shit work, etc. My train of thought is this: get the internship, get my foot in the door (it's in an industry I really want to get into), learn as much as I can, and hopefully be able to parlay that into a full time position, or use the experience and knowledge gained to find a similar job. According to the job listing, it is working under and being trained by people who have many years of experience in marketing. I understand very basic concepts of marketing, but other than that I have next to no experience. So it will all be pretty much brand new to me. So that is a big reason why I think something like this could possibly be good for me.

Again, I have my mind on a bigger end goal (as I'm sure most people who take unpaid internships do), and I want to make sure this experience would be a positive for me in the long run. 

Would something like this even be worth it? Or am I in for a rude awakening if I do get it? The possibility of me doing the internship for a few months, and then simply being discarded and back to square one has crossed my mind many times. But again, I'm hoping that maybe I can gain valuable knowledge and skills that will help me in the future. Am I just being naive?

Any advice, criticism, comments are welcome. ",18Jul2018,1
321,"So I recently came out to my GP as gay (not family for certain reasons) and have realised that I have been attracted to one of my friends for over a year. He's a great guy, we share common interests and I like him alot. Said friend is also gay/bi.  I know when I will tell him which is this weekend but I've been freaking out for weeks about it. Stress, anxiety, lack of appetite, can't sleep, distracted. How the hell do people cope or prepare for these situations! Hell talking to anyone here's fine. Doesn't even have to be advice, just talking helps a bit because I can't talk to anyone else.

323,"Cross posting from r/homeless due to low traffic there and, well, because I need advice!

I'm currently transitioning out of homelessness; I work with other homeless people, mostly veterans, but some civilians too. In 99.9% of civilians getting into housing, it's because family or friends bail them out. Oftentimes the family or friends had no idea their loved one was living on the streets.

Now, there's one homeless civilian, let's call him Bob, who I think I can get into housing, but it might be against his will. Bob is a chronic, non-functioning, alcoholic; from what he's said, and I've inferred, he became homeless when his wife divorced him and took pretty much everything, in addition to his booze habit. He's the black sheep of his Mormon family, but he has a daughter whom he is/was on good terms with. Bob had managed to arrange a ride out of state to visit his daughter last year, but unluckily didn't make it as the vehicle ended up in a wreck and Bob was hospitalized. His daughter never knew because it was supposed to be a surprise visit. Other than that, they don't keep in touch because Bob doesn't have a phone, and he can't remember his daughter's phone number.

The last time I saw Bob, a couple of months ago, he'd sobered up, as the camp he was staying in recently brought in a zero-tolerance policy on alcohol. He might have slipped since then, I don't know, but it's quite likely; I've seen Bob go to rehab a few times before falling off the wagon days after getting out.

But, I've managed to locate his daughter on Facebook; I am tempted to get in contact with her to see if she would be willing to take him in. I strongly believe she has no idea her dad is wasting away in a tent city, in a different state. I think she might be willing to take him in because from what Bob has said they have/had a really good relationship.

I say 'against his will' because I've gently tried to encourage Bob to get back in touch with his daughter, in the past, but he's always rebuffed it, saying he doesn't want to 'burden' her (she's married with kids). I suspect she was also either clueless about the extent of his alcoholism, or he knew a condition of staying with her would mean he'd have to give up the booze (she's a devout Mormon). Bob is also super best friends with an alcoholic vet, 'Frank' (who refuses to go into housing or sober up). Bob calls himself Frank's 'caretaker', even though all they do/did is get drunk together. They're like an old, drunk, couple; it's a little endearing seeing them together. I believe if I first went to Bob and offered to put him in touch with his daughter, he would refuse, both because of his burden excuse, and because he doesn't want to leave Frank.

I hate seeing Bob just bumming along in a tent city, wiling away his days in drunken obscurity. I know if my dad was alive and in his position I'd do everything I could to get him out of there.

So...do you think I should get in touch with his daughter?",18Jul2018,1

325,"Help! I don’t know what to do about this, but my boyfriend’s ex is taking up way too much headspace/emotional space. I’ve always had a kind of curiosity in past relationships about exes, and may Facebook stalk them a couple of times a year, but it hasn’t ever been like this before. I don’t even feel this way about my boyfriend’s ex before me, it’s just this girl. And she's not even someone I feel jealous of (not really that attractive, not that great a personality from what I can tell). It’s possible that it’s our weird history together that is the cause, so I’ll give a background. 

When I met my boyfriend, he had been single for 2 months. He was with Laura for eight years. He had been the one to do the dumping, and I know she was extremely crushed and devastated and had wanted to marry him.  It wasn’t until \~5 months of being friends that I developed feelings for him and told him as much. He said that he was really interested in me but wanted to be single and work on himself until he felt ready, but that he was well over his ex and their relationship. So, we entered this pseudo-friends-will-they-won’t-they thing that was very confusing and emotionally painful for about a month, then took a break from each other, and then he came back into my life to be friends/potential future lovers again. During our time apart I had started a fling with somebody to try and get over him (unsuccessfully). For whatever reason after coming back into my life and saying he still wanted to be single for a bit, he suddenly felt ready to be with me, and we started our relationship. 

I later found out that a small part of why he wanted to stay single was out of respect for his ex. This wasn’t a major part of it, but it was at least some part of the reason. She was going to be devastated about him moving on, and had already previously begged him not to date another friend of his (that he actually had no interest in). That sucked to find out, but I moved past it because he wanted to be with me now. When we decided to be Facebook official, he wanted to avoid doing it during the coming weekend because it coincided with their old anniversary. At the time I understood that, because it would have seemed like an “F U” to her, but stacked on top of everything else it kind of bothers me. 

A couple of months into dating his grandmother passed away unexpectedly. He called me from the hospital to let me know, and I rushed over to be with him. Later I found out that immediately after he called me, he called her. She had been close with his grandmother, and I know she deserved to hear about it. I selfishly didn’t like that she was his second call. I feel guilty for feeling that way, because everyone’s allowed to do what they need to do during periods of grief, and I shouldn’t be upset about it or make it about me. 

She was invited to the funeral, and that was a giant shitshow. When she showed up she went right up to him and cried in his arms for several minutes. I stepped aside for a bit out of respect and hung out with a family member of his instead. After the service was complete, she came up to him several times to cry in his arms some more, and to catch up. Each time I just stood aside awkwardly, trying to mind my own business. Then at one point when I was standing alone, she came up to me from behind and introduced herself. I tried to introduce myself back but she interrupted me with “I know who you are. I hate your existence.” I was pretty taken aback by that, but tried to keep things cordial and asked how she was holding up. Her response was “not so great, especially now that I’ve met you” and walked away. It was extremely awkward and uncomfortable and devastating that someone would act that way toward me, especially at a funeral service. After the service, I let him know what had happened. I later heard from his mom that she also spent some time at the funeral badmouthing my boyfriend. Based on her behavior, we decided she would be uninvited from the celebration of life that was happening two weeks later. When he texted her that, her response was along the lines of “I did it because I was so overwhelmed, I hope this doesn’t ruin anything we could have had” (meaning friendship). 

There were other incidents, such as almost running into her at a restaurant (followed by a text from her saying “DON’T YOU DARE COME IN HERE”). In December she wanted her Christmas decorations back from him and when he offered to drop them off on our way to an event, she turned it into a dramatic, drawn out conversation where she accused him of “rubbing Throwaway in my face” (when he hadn’t specifically mentioned me at all), and decided to warn him she was going to start dating somebody soon and she thought he’d like to know (that never ended up happening). It’s been radio silence in 2018 thankfully, minus the time my friend went on a date with her without knowing who she was, and us running into her in a grocery store. 

But as I get to know more and more people in my boyfriend’s life and becoming Facebook friends, she pops up on my Facebook feed more and more. She’s been commenting on or liking the posts of people we are mutual friends with, which could be normal but honestly feels kind of pointed (for one of them in particular I got curious and looked back through his posts, and she hadn’t commented on/liked his stuff until I became friends with him). Just recently she wrote a birthday post on that friend’s wall that specifically mentions that they got together last time he was in town. My boyfriend and I didn’t know they had, or even know they were still friends really, which is perfectly fine with us. But the way she included that in her post felt very pointed, like she wanted me to know (I know that sounds crazy, but it’s honestly what it seems like). 

Anyway, how can I just move past this? We live in a small city so we’ll probably run into her some more. She’s Facebook friends with a lot of his friends/family and so she’s going to pop up in my feed inevitably. Hell we’re engaged and getting married this fall, so I just want to forget about her and totally should be able to, but it’s been difficult with these constant reminders. What can I do? ",18Jul2018,1

327,"TL;DR: I just moved out and am having a constant feeling of intense sadness and of missing my family and don’t know how to get over it.

I just recently moved out of my Dad’s house and am mostly moved out but there are still some things left at his house that I still have to get. Every time I go over there, I’ll walk into my old room and feel really sad that I had to leave it. My dad has been fully supportive of me and my girlfriend (who I got an apartment with). I understand that most people feel sad upon initially moving out but I don’t think it’s supposed to be this intense of a feeling. There’s maybe an hour per day where missing my parents and my old house isn’t on my mind, and at times I can’t hold back the urge to cry because the feeling is so strong. 

I am feeling slightly anxious about moving in with my girlfriend, so that could be adding to the general feeling of unease and sadness, but mostly I am really missing my dad and living at his house. I’ve talked to him about it and he said it’s a normal thing to feel. I just haven’t been able to get over the intense sadness and I hesitate to call it depression because I don’t want to self-diagnose, but this is the most intense feeling I have ever felt. My girlfriend is being extremely supportive as well. I am thankful for the support I have but I am wondering if there is anything I can do to get over these feelings I am having... has anyone had any sort of similar experience of intensely missing home when they first moved out? I could use any advice anyone can offer.",18Jul2018,2
329,"Currently, I go to college and live in a college-style apartment that I hate so very much. It’s overpriced. My roommates are untidy and irresponsible &amp; smoke in the apartment &amp; always have sketchy people over late at night. The place has roaches &amp; palmetto bugs that will not go away no matter how many times I’ve cleaned and had the place sprayed. Luckily, that lease is up at the end of this month. 
I made plans with a couple that I’m friends with to rent a 2 bed 2 bath apartment and split the rent 3 ways. It’d be cheaper, nicer, larger room size, better area of town, and I know they’re tidy people. 
Unfortunately, today I got a text from the girlfriend saying that they broke up. The girlfriend claims it was her fault and she thinks that she can mend the relationship and everything will go back to normal. They’ve been dating for a year and a half and have never broken up before (according to her). The boyfriend also messaged me saying that he still wants us to all live together and so does she even if it’s just as friends. It’s bizarre to me that they’d both be willing to share a bedroom even as exes but ok I guess as long as they’re cool with it? Idk
We haven’t signed a lease yet and I’d make one of them the head signer and the other one and I would be co-signers to try and prevent me from becoming responsible for the whole rent if they break up agian or want to move out for some reason once we’re all living there. But that’s no guarantee. Not that I think they’d do that to me, but I do want to be cautious. 
My other option is moving in with my boyfriend who I’ve been dating for about 8 months. He lives in a 4 bedroom town home with his sister and two other roommates. The two others are moving out soon and so there will be open bedrooms there. That rent is significantly cheaper than my current rent and cheaper than the rent for the place where I’d be living with the couple. They also all sign separate leases so I wouldn’t be relying on anyone else to make their payments, just my own. I don’t know how I feel about moving in with him so early but the fact that it wouldn’t be just us two in a house &amp; that we have separate leases makes it less scary. I haven’t really talked to my boyfriend much about it yet but his sister is okay with it. 
Should also note that I do not pay my own rent, my mother does. I haven’t talked to her yet either. I know she’d be freaked out if I told her the other couple broke up and I don’t know how she’d feel about me living with my boyfriend. She’s a very reasonable person and will probably ultimately let me make the decision for myself but I do want to be as respectful of her as I can when deciding. 

Current rent: $680
Rent with couple: $550ish
Rent with boyfriend: $400ish

330,"So to understand how I purchase something from Amazon (because I live in Saudi Arabia) I buy them from Amazon US, ship them to a company in the US called WS1 (http://ws1.com/). What they do is that they unpack everything and put it in one box. This helps in reducing the shipping cost a lot, since amazon doesn't always ship everything in one box and some items don't even ship outside of the US. This time around, I purchased a bunch of different items, around $150 in total. One of them is a box containing 16 different Essential Oil bottles. What WS1 did is that they unpacked the set and put every bottle in a separate box, greatly increasing the dimensions of the general box. Total weight calculated by them was 41 pounds, which in reality it's around 10 pounds. This resulted in the shipping weight being $264, which is insane. I contacted them about this and they said the reason they did this was because Essential Oils are considered dangerous items since they are flammable and they have to be packed this way. I told them that this is understand, and I would like them to remove the oils from the box and re weigh. They replied that once a box is packed they don't touch it again and that this is final. I replied with this:

&gt; Dear WS1
&gt; 
&gt; It is incredibly unreasonable that I have to pay $264 for an $18 item just because you refuse to repack it. This is an amount that I am never EVER going to pay. 
&gt; 
&gt; As I said before, take out the ""dangerous items"" from the bag, throw them in the trash or give them to one of the employees and re weigh the shipment.
&gt; 
&gt; I sincerely wish that as a returning usual customer to your services, you value me enough that you don't waste my time and do this quickly. I need the rest of the items as soon as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you

they then replied with this: https://imgur.com/a/I5Uti5s

331,"So i’ve been talking to a muslim woman almost a year now and i guess you could say we were pretty much dating. Anyways, we got into her basically ranting to me about how the gov’t is trying to make malaysia more chinese friendly or whatever and the conversation progressed into me basically asking whats the difference between malay and malaysian. I thought malay was just the language of malaysia but, its apparently not. She got quite upset with me asking questions just to know more since thats just something i do when i want to know things (most people do). Now, thats not the part where im unsure of. After she calmed down and apologized because i told her i just was wondering. Right after explaining to her that i basically asked what her race would be and she’s saying its malay. Thats what my biggest problem was. I told her what a race actually means but, once something gets one thing stuck in their head they dont see it any other way. Race would be caucasian, european, asian and etc right? Arguing between what race is pretty much escalated til she said she doesnt need an american to tell her what she is so i called her a monster behind a mask because she acted like she understood my reason for wanting to know but instead she acted aggressive. Is it my fault? Like, should i just know these things or have just let her believe that her race is malay or is it actually? I dont know at all.

334,"My last drunken night was at a Christmas party 7 months ago. My friend and her family throws one every year and she had just recently gotten engaged. This was the 4th time attending this annual party, and unfortunately this time I felt very awkward and alone. Which, in turn, caused me to drink a little more than I should have. After the actual party she had an after party at a hotel down the street, which I also attended. Things started to get a little hazy, but I do remember mostly everything. I was a little awkward and kept to myself. I remember her friends having to pull me into conversations because I didn't really know anyone and my friend wasn't really talking to me. Anyway, we ended up getting kicked out by security. My friend got mad so she crushed a wine glass in her right hand, which prompted her to take her engagement ring off. (The ring was her fiance's grandmother's and worth a LOT of money) We were all pretty drunk, and I start to brown out at this point. I remember being in the bathroom with her cleaning up her hand, then getting into the uber and riding back to her house. When we get there, she realizes she doesn't have her engagement ring on and FREAKS out. She's crying, we're trying to call the hotel, she wakes her whole family up, I'm drunk as hell trying to console her. Then, something in me tells me to look into the small pouch of my purse. There was her engagement ring. I must have put it in there when she took it off so she wouldn't leave it, and then forgot that I had done that. I immediately start to cry because I felt SO bad that I put her and her family through all of that anxiety. they put me to sleep on the couch and assure me that everything is fine and they were so happy I had it. 
I wake up the next morning and kind of do a walk of shame to my car, slightly embarrassed I got so drunk and blubbered like a baby, but ultimately everything was fine so I wasn't too bothered. I texted her and apologized for the craziness and said I was SO happy we had found her ring. She texted me right back and said she was so happy too and that she loved me so much! I thought all was well and this was just a story we'd laugh about for the rest of our lives. 

Until I tried to tag her in photos from that night a few nights later, and realized that not only did she block me on every social media platform, but so did her sister and her fiance. I was heartbroken, and still am. I was friends with her for four years and she just up and annexed me from her life with no explanation. I've been sober since December 31st. Not because I thought I had a drinking problem (although I do have alcoholism on both sides of my family) but because this night has scarred me so bad that I never want anything like this to happen again. 

I've racked my brain for months about what I did wrong. On one hand, I did cause her and her family a lot of grief for about 45 minutes, but on the other hand, if it weren't for me pocketing the ring, she probably would have left it sitting on the bathroom counter and it's VERY possible she would have never seen it again. I've talked to many of my friends about this and they say that 1. Definitely not my fault, I was doing her a favor. and 2. The only two conclusions anyone can come up with is that she either thinks I was trying to steal her ring (which why the fuck would I do that... what friend would STEAL an engagement ring?!?) Or two she and her family decided to annex me so that they could either blame me for what happened, or so that they could forget about it and never had to talk about it never again. 

Just wanted to get some strangers opinions on what they think happened. Just know that even in a black out I would never want to STEAL an engagement ring. I absolutely put it in my purse so that she wouldn't leave it there. My dumb ass just forgot. Also, does anybody have any advice on how to move on from this? I know it may sound trivial when it's not your personal story, but it caused me to give up alcohol so it was obviously pretty traumatic for me. I've had a LOT of things happen during blackouts (including sexual assault/rape) but honestly, this was the worst.

335,"So I ( Alexandria ) have known Taylor since i was entering highschool we first met because our siblings started dating now married with two amazing children.  It's now been five years we will occasionally drink together ( when our families get together) and text here and there.

Taylor is a few years younger then I am but we will occasionally do something flirty to the other person like slap each other asses or even something like confession something about the other person ( usually romantic )( Taylor admitted to have a crush on me before)

I have a significant other and we've been together for a year, were planning on moving together.  This person has helped me so much in life and I honestly could see myself growing old with this person.  Love is a big word to use so I don't know about that but I really care for this person.

Well this past weekend one of Taylor's siblings had a 21st birthday party ( alcohol everywhere ) so everyone was invited.  Well sure enough Taylor and I were looking after the two kids and then Taylor hugged me and Jesus did it feel good it literally made my heart skip a beat.  After that I had the urge to kiss Taylor.

I moved in for a kiss Taylor stepped back and said we cant we're both in relationships.  ( Keep in mind were both feeling pretty intoxicated) So I put my hands on Taylor's hips and kiss Taylor's cheek then neck. We both split up because we heard keys rattling, we're really not trying to have anyone find out about what happens between us.

As our siblings take there kids Taylor walks back over to me and kisses me ( since I was pretty intoxicated I barely remember what happened directly after) but I remember my heart having this feeling of like love/happy I haven't felt that happy since like forever.  After the kiss Taylor said don't tell anyone but it's killing me I've texted Taylor, and said "" i can't stop thinking about the party and what happened between us"" Taylor replied ""nothing happened, understood.""

I think I'm getting feelings for Taylor because can't stop thinking about it and how my body reacted but I don't want to lose my S.O. ughhhh. At the same time I would be very much interested in attempting to get in a relationship with Taylor

I haven't told anybody, very conflicted about what to do I kinda just want to forget it but at the same time it's just too good to be true I've been wanting to date Taylor for a damn good while but I'm happy with my current relationship and don't want to lose it.

So should I try to continue with Taylor and forget my current relationship, or just suppress it and stay in my current

Unfortunately in this industry it has its busy seasons and then really slow seasons, so income differs week to week. This is temporary though as he wants to set me up as a manager for one of his sites. Could either be nashville or miami, and not to sure exactly when also as there are contract negotiations and whatnot. I'm not opposed to moving and would like to travel for work if they need me to. The pay for being a manager is above 2k a week but not exactly sure if it really is. A big risk and more unknown territory. 

This other job was offered yesterday by a customer who I installed for last year. This would be at a hospital in Walnut Creek doing telecommunications. Pay is, I'm assuming between 20-25 an hour, but company offers benefits. There is a lot of room for growth and they have contracts to take on other projects. I would be new and just starting off in this field so to me it's a step back in terms of experience from my field. Talked with the owner already and like the guy and he wants me to work for him.

I have a couple weeks to decide what I want to do and already am taking a week off of work to work at the hospital for a week. What bothers me most is the pay and the drive to the hospital as it's a little farther than where I currently work. I am looking for a solid career and not a job and am tired of our slow seasons. I am leaning a little more towards the hospital job because it's more stable and secure. I've never lived outside of california and am interested in travelling. I know moving to ohio and I'd be making fast money but I'm wondering if I should take the risk.",18Jul2018,1
344,"I'm close to finishing up graduate school so I've been applying to a slew of jobs lately. This will (hopefully) be my first professional job with an actual livable salary. I applied to a job about a week and a half ago and they got back to me very quickly. I talked to one of the hiring staff members on the phone and she told me she would forward my information to the department manager. She also told me I should hear back about if they want to move forward with me by early this week. Now its Wednesday and I've haven't heard back yet. Would it be a good idea to follow up with the woman I spoke to on the phone to ask about the status, or is that too much? I've never applied to a professional job before so I'm not sure what the standard method is. Do I just keep waiting or check-in? Maybe wait a little longer before checking in? What do the professionals or Reddit think?

345,"So long story short, i broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years about a month ago, and until 3 days ago i didn't feel anything special to other girls. So 3 days ago i hanged out with my best friends girlfriend and him and his gf brought a friend. The girl was really communicative and i enjoyed her company. We also hanged out yesterday and today. Yesterday we exchanged numbers and snapchats and talked alot. Today while the 4 of us were hanging out in front of everyone i said that i noticed that she has sweaty armpits and that shes a pig. After that she just texted my friends gf that she wants to leave and left. I then sent her 2 texts how sorry i was and that i was scared to goof something and that while being scared i messed up big time... What to do now??",18Jul2018,1

347,"I’m 28(f) and my parents split up before I was born. 

I was told by my mom that basically they hadn’t been dating very long when she got pregnant, and they decided to keep me- but they weren’t staying together. 

He was present at my birth and I had seen him a few times before I turned 1, when he stopped returning my moms calls. 

My mom ended up moving with her parents and their business one state over and didn’t bother letting him know we had moved because she had tried and failed to get into contact with him for around 5 months leading up to the move. She worked for my grandparents and if she had stayed in CA, she would’ve had no family or job. So she had to go.

One afternoon, when I was around 3 years old my father called the business line, and as my mom was picking up the phone, the answering machine was also picking up. 
She said my father refused to speak while he was being recorded, so she told him to call her back because we were on our way out of the house to a doctors appointment. 

He never called back. 

Fast forward to a few months after I turned 18- my father sends my mom an email asking if I know about him and if it would be ok to talk to me. 
She told me immediately and said it was my choice. 

I decided to meet him. 
He drove up here and we spent an afternoon together. He met my then boyfriend and all in all it went ok. 

A year later, I was getting married (dumb- I know, I was way too young) and having a kid. 

He came to the wedding and left half way through because he was uncomfortable. 

We had a few discussions via text once or twice after that. 

2 1/2 years ago, I was sexually assaulted. I missed work for a week, and I was panicking about my rent. I’m a single parent and I just couldn’t afford to miss a weeks pay, but I couldn’t handle being back at work right then, either. So I called him and asked for some help. 
He’s never paid a dime in child support to my mother (she never pursued it) and I thought maybe- just maybe- given my situation- he would come through. 
He flatly told me no, and that I should go to church and pray about it. He didn’t have the money for me- he has a family of his own to care for. 

Ever since then, I’ve felt this intense hatred and anger toward him. 

Growing up, feeling like I wasn’t good enough to love, only intensified with this incident and his complete lack of empathy was just heart breaking. 

He’s sent me texts on Christmas, Father’s Day, (never my bday) and a few random ones since then. 

Last month he emailed my mom again. 
I guess he wants to see how I am? 

Should I even bother? 

Honestly, thinking about him makes me anxious and the feelings of worthlessness just amplify any time I picture myself talking to him or seeing him. 

But... he’s also my father, right? 

My boyfriends dad died the year before we met (4 years ago) and he had a complicated relationship with his dad, too... but he eventually got to know him and grew very close to him. He says he’s grateful that he set his anger aside and got to know his dad before it was too late. 

I feel so conflicted. Part of me doesn’t want to be a stranger to half of my DNA forever- and the other part feels sick just thinking about how much he must have not given a shit, if he stayed out of my life for practically 28 years. 

What should I do? 
Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?",18Jul2018,3
348,"I have 4 younger brothers (ages 14, 11, 10, and 8) who seem to think it's fine to piss all over the bathroom. Every single time I go in there I find pee on the toilet seat, on the floor, and even on the walls. How are they fucking up this bad? It's disgusting. 

The worst part is that they won't clean it up. Ever. They all deny making the mess and tell me that they ""don't even use that bathroom."" They do this to every bathroom in the house. But sure, I'm supposed to believe that they had nothing to do with it. Must be some sort of malevolent piss ghost.

I'm sick of having to clean up their mess every time I need to use the bathroom. I can't even tell you how many times I've accidentally sat in someone's piss because I forgot to check the toilet first.

I've tried asking them nicely to clean up if they make a mess. I've suggested that they either lift the toilet seat or sit to pee. I've asked that at the very least, they flush the toilet so it won't smell so bad in there. They won't do it.

Asking politely doesn't work. 
Yelling at them doesn't work. 
Begging doesn't work. 
Threatening to take things away might work, but my parents would have to enforce this. The most my mom will do is ask them to go clean it up. When they don't do it, she does it herself and lets them get away with it. My dad doesn't seem to give a shit about what they do in the bathroom. In fact, he seems more annoyed with me when I get upset about how nasty it is. ""They're just being boys,"" he says. ""Stop overreacting."" 
I'm sorry, but fuck that. I think they're old enough to know better.

Am I wrong for thinking that they should clean up after themselves? What can I do? ",18Jul2018,1
349,"On top of my other career, I escort. Recently I had a couple dates with this guy, and haven't mentioned it yet.

And we have had no talk about being exclusive, because it's still early and casual. So do I have an obligation to tell him before we have sex?

Very few people in my life know, and I worry about telling someone who has my real name and knows where I work. I worry about risking my career or getting blackmailed or just him having a weird reaction.

352,"Hey everybody, I made some big mistakes recently. I'm 19, and for years I've found the wife of a close family friend very attractive. I never did anything about it, because she is much older than me, also I believe you should never mess with another man's woman, I thought she was not interested, and I care about her family. Over the last month I've spent a lot of time with their family, and time with her alone. I've grown more and more attracted to her, and last week I 'made a move"". Nothing sexual, just being more physically close to her than is normal for someone who you aren't seeing.   


Over the following couple of days, we began getting closer and closer, until it turned slightly sexual. We did not have sex, we didn't even ""touch each other"" but we both very clearly were sexually arroused and wanted to be physical. Things escalated slightly over a day or so of hanging out with her, before I left where she was staying. I told her that I didn't think I could come back for a while.  


A couple days ago we began texting, and we are both horrified by what we did, and ashamed. We don't want things to ever go back to where they were, and so we've decided not to see each other for a long time. This is hard for me, as she is one of my best friends, but knowing the consequences of what almost happened, I'm more than happy to not see her.   


I'm struggling with if I should tell anybody. I know it won't ever happen again, and it didn't go all the way, but I feel so guilty and horrible that I instigated/encouraged a married woman to be unfaithful to a spouse that loves her. I feel like fessing up is the right thing to do, but that it will destroy her family.  


Because of how close knit our families are, and our community, and knowing how religious my family is, I know everybody would take the side of the husband. They would likely ex-communicate me (my whole family, all my friends, and church) unless I 'repented', but even then, things could never be the same. Her husband is a great friend as well, and I don't want to lose that friendship too, which I would if I confess. I don't want to run from my problems, but I""m not sure what to do.  


Any advice? Thanks

355,"That’s the gist of it. There are a lot of factors that I won’t go into detail about here, moreso to protect certain people involved. 

Essentially, I hate my job. I love most of the people i work with, but what I am doing brings me zero joy but an endless supply of stress and anxiety. I have had multiple conversations with previous management about being interested in another position, about deserved compensation for the work I’ve done, needing help with certain tasks, etc. I had been promised a raise multiple times, promised that things would change with my position, and nothing has been delivered on. 

We recently had a change in upper management and we’re not working with someone completely different. He hasn’t a completely different style, he is straight forward and direct, doesn’t take any bullshit, and is all around intense but knows what he’s doing. However, I had already had a conversation with him about not being in the right position. And he agreed. Yet nothing has changed. 

This job brings me an insane amount of anxiety. I also learned about a lot of things that has been going on behind the scenes that I ethically don’t want to be a part of I had interviewed with another company and accepted another position with them. I will start out at a little less than what I’m making right now, but will pretty much be the same after the probationary period. And there are management opportunities available that I would be eligible in the next few months. 

I came back to my previous job and put in my notice. I did not go into that conversation to negotiate. I said, this is my notice, this will be my last day. Immediately the HR person was asking, “what can we do to get you to stay? Where are you going? What would you be doing there? What if we could offer you something similar.”

I said no. This is my notice. Thank you for the opportunity. 

I have since had at least 4 more conversations with HR and my boss, them saying that I am worth fighting for and what their plans are for the future and where they see. Again, no guarantees, not actual numbers have been given, but “we value you and want you to stay.”

This has been incredibly frustrating. I’ve started every meeting with, “thank you for the opportunity, but this is the right move for me.” And they just keep pushing, but can’t give me any guarantees. And now I’m anxious that they will consider my notice somehow invalid and this would be job abandonment. 

I just don’t know what to do in this situation. I worked for one company for 8 years and put in my notice no problem. Came to this place, which has been 1000 times worse and now I’m dealing with this. It’s like I’m in a bad breakup with a psychopath.

360,"Hi,

I’ll try to keep a long story as short as possible here...

I have recently bought a Astra SXI 2008 which apparently had 1 previous female owner for £2,700 with low mileage. Thought it was a steal at the time. Purchased with cash on the 05/12/2017 and have a receipt and invoice.
I also have a log and lots of text messages and emails as the dealer proved difficult to get hold of by phone.

However, after driving it away I noticed a odd whirling noise coming from the engine. The day after purchasing the vehicle I messaged the used car dealer advising that the car was making a strange noise and advised that I was going to get the vehicle looked over by a local mechanic as the dealership was a hours drive away and seemed a pointless drive 

The local mechanic had the vehicle for a few hours and noticed that a few parts had been replaced over its lifetime - in particular the a second hand alternator that had been fitted to the vehicle which looked cleaner than other parts. Given the whirling noise and the strange second hand part he diagnosed this as the cause of the sound and that I should approach the dealer about what his thoughts are.

When questioned about the alternator his response was: “Thanks for update ..we we're trying to get the car ready for you to pickup the following day. If it fails we will replace it or if you prefer to have it done locally will help with the cost”

My reply: “Great no worries, I will let you know how it goes”

2 weeks down the line... 24/12/17 (Christmas eve) - The car begins to be a very loud tractor like sound and looses all power whilst driving down the road.

Message to dealer: Hi, I have had trouble with the Astra yesterday and have had to get an emergency call out from a local garage, the car started making a very loud noise and lost all electrical power whilst I was driving and the steering went, it was very dangerous. The mechanic found the crank pulley bolt on the sub frame when he opened the bonnet. Also the Alternator belt wasn’t full on and he said that it was probably wobbled off as wasn’t tightened correctly. He wasn’t able to put the bolt back the engine at the time and didn’t want to start the engine until it was in again as it may cause damage so have had to leave it on the side of the road until he can come back and fit it. The battery and the oil warning lights are on on the dash. I’ll let you know how it goes when the bolt is back in but think the alternator is going to need replacing regardless”

No response from the dealer.

Thinking back I should of instantly demanded my money back but given the awkward time of year and thinking that the alternator was the problem, the car shouldn’t have any further problems if replaced.

Anyway, Christmas and new year blows over. Mechanic fits bolt back in vehicle and puts belt back on to the alternator to start it up... loud tractor noise has gone but still the odd whirling sound.

02/01/2018 messaged dealer:  “Hi, I have had a mechanic put the crank pulley bolt back in the Astra. He has advised me that the car requires a new Alternator and belt. I have already had a quote for a new alternator before this happened after realising the one you had fitted wasn’t a new one and was making a strange noise. I can send the quote over to you by email - if you can let me that you will pay for the invoice? What is your email address?”

No response.

Chased by phone on 04/01 and managed to speak with him and got his email address.

The new alternator is fitted however I still haven’t received payment from the dealer...

After numerous emails/texts and phone calls he finally drops money into my account 30 pounds short of the invoice claiming that if we brought the car to him he could of done the work for cheaper.

However the whirling noise remains.........

Clearly this noise isn’t coming from the alternator, however the car is running fine with no warning lights or louder concerning noises.

I decided in the end this may just simply be the noise of the car being 10 years old and the fact I haven’t got the time to deal with this ignorant sales man any longer about this noise at the moment, I live a very busy life with work and home life.

09/05... the noise is still there and I have some time off work booked off the end of next month for a well deserved break - seems like an ideal time to sort this noise out.

Message to dealer: Hi, still having problems with this Astra. Since having the alternator fitted, it’s still been making the strange whirling noise. I have took it to another garage from the one who fitted the alternator and the he has had it on the ramp and can’t determine where this sound is coming from - I’m due to get them to have another look this weekend. Is there any chance you can get your guys at your garage to have a proper look at the problem, I need this resolving ASAP.”

No response.

After multiple attempts again by text, emails and phone calls to this ignorant guy. I finally catch him with a phone call.

21/06 (please note how long between my original message - this guy is a nightmare!!)
He agrees if we bring it up to his garage he will get his mechanics to have a look at it - booked in for 28/06

22/06 car noise is genuinely sounding worse - I dare not drive it after last time. At least he has agreed to have a look at it.

After using my friends car to get around as I dare not drive the thing again until the garage have had a look at it. Scared after what happened at Christmas time, far too dangerous.

26/06 (week off work) decided to take the car to the local garage to see if it would be safe to drive an hours drive in it.

The car cut out and lost all power again on the way to the garage and struggled to start again - luckily the garage is only 2 mins down the road and managed to push it there to be looked at.

The mechanics say that it’s hard to determine what the problem is... but seems to be an internal engine problem this new louder noise...

I leave the car at the garage in anger that this happening for the second time.

Called the dealership and explained what had happened to the owner (The dealers Dad) was extremely rude when I explained what has happened and got very defensive now he heard the engine had gone again. “3 month warranty is up nothing to do with us” and various other petty comments.

Week goes by and got a second opinion from another mechanic, definitely internal engine problem... the engine needs stripping down to find out the problem or simply a new engine - very pricey either way...

The dealer is now obviously wanting to wash his hands with me and the car even though this is an ongoing issue from day one that was never resolved. 

I’m furious and obviously without a car or a resolution to this problem.

Im taking him to small claims court. I think I’ve got a more than reasonable case, the car was simply not sold as seen and has broke down twice within 7 months of having it.

What are your opinions?? Any similar experiences?

363,"Okay, so bit of a back story. I considered myself asexual before I met this man in college(part time art prof). My intuition went haywire, because it was insanely crazy how much of our interests align along with our world views. Only strange thing is that he likes to party/club on the weekends while I would rather stay in with a good book. Ironically, I’m an extrovert &amp; he’s an introvert. Anyway, I pursued him mostly because he’s very shy and oblivious in real life. 

Everything about him was amazingly unexplainable, from having the same interests, to just understanding each other deeply. Since I was much more extroverted than him, I would always make an effort to chat. And he was very awkwardly cute. He was always very nice to me, apathetic to everyone else, and oblivious as all hell. Painfully so. (Probably why he’s single). 


I invited him to an art show I have having. (He is also a freelance artist, which leads him to be very busy). He couldn’t make it, but I said “no worries make it up to me by tea” and we went out to a tea shop to just chat for about an hour. Next time I saw him was when he gave me a book I let him borrow back, some time later over coffee. 

As we were wrapping up I said, “wanna go on a sushi date?” I gave him my number, and kick my self for not asking for his, since he’s not really an indicator type. Anyway in person he said yes with no hesitation, but then weeks later sent me a really weird message. 



It was extremely frustrating not to know what he meant.

Weeks later I follow up in an email with the whole, “still interested in getting that sushi with me?;)”

**&amp; THIS was this response. I don’t know what it means:**

“Hi there!Sorry as you know I am unreliable for meeting but with good reason, I am busier than ever and that's good. As for meeting up I will ask you to wait and maintain our present good nature, I have appreciated our conversations so much but I cannot lead into more than that. I will look forward to being in touch and keeping up with your exciting active life :)”

364,"Hello everyone. I have been struggling with something for a long time, and I need some more opinions on it.

A little background on me: I am a late 20's man who recently changed careers. In my early 20's I bounced around from job to job, mostly doing service and retail stuff. Recently, I was lucky enough to find myself in a position to go back to school, and I decided to pursue a more stable career path. I don't want to get into much detail, but I will say that the area of work I'm getting into isn't glamorous, but I feel good about the fact that I will be helping people.

Here's the thing: I don't know if I can say I'm passionate about the work. In fact, I don't know if I'm passionate about anything. It's just that I hear about people having this spark, this burning drive to do or pursue something. And I can't remember the last time I felt that way, if I ever have. I mean, it's not like I don't have interests or things I want to pursue, even aside from my new career. For example, my main dream is to really develop as a poet and try to make some sort of name for myself in that sphere. However, I find myself getting easily discouraged and convincing myself I will fail, or that it's too late for me. And that's just one example. But, inevitably, I always end up back at this feeling that maybe I just have some sort of fundamental lack of passion.  Or maybe I just don't understand what passion is.

So, any words of advice? What do you feel passionate about? Have you always felt that way, or did it develop? Can passion for something be cultivated? Am I just putting too much importance on a rather abstract concept? Is it much simpler than I think? I would love to hear about your experiences. Thanks.",18Jul2018,0

366,"These past two weeks have been the most stressful weeks of my life. I need some advice on how to deal with stress or how you guys have dealt with it.

I just recently learned I need jaw surgery due to my jaw being locked for weeks now from jiu jitsu. I also received a DUI 5 days ago and have had to pay $4k so far in lawyer fees. Before all this terrible news, I put a down payment on a car and picked it up yesterday... I scratched it against a rock the next day...  On top of all this I loaned a friend $100 and he is avoiding me to pay it back. Thankfully, I have a 2 day vacation in Cape Cod, Massachusetts! Until I learned theres thunderstorms all week.

Sorry for the rant, just needed to do that...
Anyway, what’re some ways you guys deal with heavy stress? Im not the most optimistic person, I work hard but expect the worst so I’m not disappointed. Also, what’re some ways I can change my perspective and have a more “silver-lining” view on things? Thanks

367,Was searching through my husbands emails and was looking through his “personal” folder because it had our old emails. Started looking through cheesy emails that we had from the past and reminiscing our old relationship when I came across this email to another girl. The emails were from years ago. They were before we were married but we were living together at that point. They were semi inappropriate and very flirty. When I asked him about it he apologized but also said I shouldn’t have been looking through his emails. He said we are married now and he would never do that as a married couple. ...He is a different person now than what he was then. He continues to be upset with me over snooping more than anything.  I guess it just really hurts because he has never done anything  like this and we have a great relationship. I just don’t know how to react at this point. Should I continue to be upset or take his word and believe that we would never do this as a married couple?,18Jul2018,0
368,"I'm 22. I don't want kids now. I'm disabled, so I don't want to carry them ever - my partner and I are agreed on adoption + surrogacy. I'm on birth control, and if I got pregnant I would get an abortion.

I only realised I was pregnant when I miscarried. Really early term, probably 4 weeks. I thought it was heavy cramps from lactose intolerance coupled with a bad period. Once the worst was over, paranoia set in and I took a test to be sure. Got the positive, and realised what this much pain and blood meant. Two days later, I got the negative result I expected.

It was a relief. An early term miscarriage is nothing, most women will experience several in their lifetimes and just think its a late period. At least this meant I didn't have to get an abortion, I didn't have to change my pill again, and, most importantly, I could still eat cheese and cream. 

A couple weeks pass and I'm completely fine, aside from wondering whether I should tell my partner. It would have just brought up old shit of an abusive ex using an abortion of a child he wanted against him, so I decided not to. For such a small and common thing, it wasn't worth it. Probably not my first or last one. Decided not to tell him and felt good about that choice. We would have just had to abort it anyway, which would have been worse for both of us.

But now I just watched a video of guys finding out their partners were pregnant and I want to cry. I just saw a reddit post where a guys just reported his dad to the police and saved a 6 year old from sexual abuse, and I feel so maternal. A couple days ago, he rested his hand on my stomach and I felt so guilty. 98% of the time I'm fine, 2% I'm really not. But telling him will only make it worse for both of us.

I just don't know what to do to get past this. I absolutely do not want a child right now. I absolutely would have happily got an abortion. I absolutely do not think an early-term miscarriage is a big deal (unless actively trying for a child, and I am not here to debate that). I absolutely do not think telling him is worth the pain it will cause us both.

But I just can't get it out of my head. ",18Jul2018,1
369,"basically, i (surprisingly) have some friends and all i can seem to do is convince myself that they secretly hate me. 

for example:

i have this friend i've known since middle school, we're in high school now- we go to different high schools.

374,"So I'll get right to it, I did a DNA test several years ago and a few months ago I received several messages on FB wanting to speak with me as I had matched as a close relative with someone unknown to me. Ancestry suggested I was her uncle or had grandparent status yet age wise that made very little sense. This woman believed I was her half brother as her mother and father had split up and he had moved to my city when he did. 

This news wasn't a big surprise to me, my mother had serious addiction issues, was in and out of mental health facilities and my life.  I didn't imagine my father to be a particularly well put together man either. 

I was raised by the love and generosity of parents of friends. Practically living with other families from the age of 11 or 12. At 16 I met a boy (I'm a gay man) that changed my life and thanks to him and his family I got into and went to a new school, eventually college and eventually made some good of myself though I still smoke too much weed. 

When she contacted me I was hesitant but since I've very little in the way of assets I agreed to meet her since she couldn't want me for my money! It was insane how alike we were. Physically the resemblance is there but not obvious perhaps it would be more so if we were the same gender. Everything else however blew me away. 

She drank her coffee like me, didn't drink alcohol and was interested in politics. She was smart and funny, more interestingly she seemed willing to open her life to me. She spoke about going to London together to meet our potential father after she had discussed everything with him. She spoke to him and he did indeed remember my mother.

When settling the details of the trip I suggested that I could stay in Catherham with friends while she stayed with him. She insisted we stay in a hotel together to bond. We did and it was lovely. The trip was for two days and we only spent one of those days with our father. He was a nice if a slightly senile old man, he was by all accounts lovely to me. He even said some really nice things that made me feel like a bit of a psychopath for thinking 'what absolute bullshit'. The other day we spent, exploring museums and bonding over how similar we were. 

My sister has never been great at communication. She would usually text me at 9.00am and reply at 10pm despite being online often. This was quite irritating when attempting to plan a trip but I let it slide. She really didn't know me that well. 

Cut to when we return from the trip and the same issues are occurring. Her day job isn't that demanding and this situation has left me feeling like someone she felt obligated to text. So one morning I just didn't respond to her morning text as it seemed pointless. I would relieve her of her responsibilities toward me. The next day she text again. So I replied hours later like she would, but since there has been no response. 

My sister has a very full life with a huge family on her mother's side and unfortunately I find that terrifying. Family becomes exponentially more important with age and apart from her I don't really have any. I am worried that I am not good enough and have already proven myself to be a burden. This texting issue is really solidifying that. I know that I'm undoubtedly not handling it right as I nearly always make situations much worse than I intended. Even when attempting to think clearly, take space and exercise caution. 

I honestly don't know what advice to ask for here but I don't know how I should proceed with this. I feel like bringing it up will only make her feel pressure to communicate more when she doesn't want to but I cannot communicate like this either for the reasons outlined above. 

It's honestly distracting me from work, I range from irrational anger to sadness. Essentially it's been an issue for months and I thought one trip would fix it. I'd rather she didn't communicate at all than this way,

So please any advice would be welcome. How would you guys react to this and what can I do to improve this situation for us both?",18Jul2018,2

376,"I'll start with a bit of backstory. We live in an apartment complex in Missouri on the first floor. About 8 months ago we were told by the apartment handyman we have a plumbing issue in the bathroom causing a leak into the basement of the apartment. They said they may have to tear up the bathroom floor and remove the toilet to make the repairs.

Months went by and we heard nothing. Until yesterday when the landlord called and said that they will be coming to the make repairs tomorrow at 10am and it should only take about a half of day to a full day.

Well the repairmen showed up about an hour and a half late at 11:30am. They removed the toilet, ripped up the floor, and fixed the leak. After working about 3 hours they came to tell us that they're pouring the concrete but they ""don't think it will set in time to put the toilet back tonight""

The landlord has offered no accommodations or acknowledgment to us while we will not have a toilet or shower access for 24+ hours. I've been trying to research tenant rights to see if it's reasonable for me to expect accommodations to no avail. Normally I try and be accommodating and reasonable, but I literally don't have a pot to piss in and frankly find this unreasonable. I just feel like it's being treated as a business rather than my home by the landlord.

Am I being unreasonable to expect some sort of accommodation?  If so what should I expect and how should I approach the landlord.

Anyways, the main reason I think there's a hint being dropped is because today she walked in front of me to throw something away. Nothing unusual, but as she goes back to her desk she decides to turn around and throw something away again, and as she walks in front of me again she pulls up her shirt.

387,"I apologize for the length and sporadic thoughts and sentences. I am really struggling and just want to put everything out.

 I feel like i've been running on auto pilot for a long time now. I am a student finishing graduate school and due to a trip out of the country I got very behind in class. I got half of my work done the other day but have been really struggling to get started today. 

 I struggle with different vices, and since my sibling passed away from terminal illness three months ago I have been smoking weed and cigarettes pretty regularly. I know it isn't good for me, so I just recently got a vape to try and tail that down. I also know that with my heavy smoking I won't pass a drug test and am scared to actively search for work post graduate school, but also don't feel that I'm ready to just move on. My father has reached out to me saying there is a position open at our neighbors firm, and that it pays well and I should reach out to him (I think in part as a gesture because of everything that has gone on with my family), but I absolutely will not pass a drug test and I don't want to put my neighbor in that situation. My dad doesn't know that I have been smoking so regularly, and I am scared to tell him that is why I have yet to reach out for the position. 

 I am so mentally exhausted, find trouble getting up in the mornings, and have so much difficulty doing homework, making myself food, or just doing anything. I've been eating fast food almost what feels like everyday because it is just easy and at least at the time makes me feel good. Even when I tell myself ""I'm going to the gym today, or I'm going to make myself (healthier) food at home, I just fucking sit around and drive to the fast food place down the street. I dont know why I am the way that I am. 

 I have struggled with my weight my entire life for the most part, and have put on even more weight since my sibling passed away (also adding to how long it will be until I can pass a drug test). The issue is that I'm pretty tall, so I don't look too horribly out of shape, but I fucking hate my body and hate that I cant find the energy or discipline to not eat like shit or go lift weights. Every single day I am consumed with thoughts about how people think I'm fat, or how embarrassing it is to be in public because I feel that people can start to see my stomach and weight through my shirt, considering 80% of my entire wardrobe is large shirts, and I don't really fit into them anymore. I've gone from a size 32 waist a few years ago to 36-38, and it just fucking makes me so sad. 

I would go home and be with my family, but my family life has been so fucked with terminal illness and the tolls it has taken on everyone in my family. I have another sibling with the same disease that took my sister's life, and I have had one of my parents tell me that they don't think their marriage is going to work out. Everybody at my family's house is miserable, and I feel like they think I'm some ray of light who's persevering to get my degree despite everything, but being home only amplifies how awful I feel because I am reminded of the grim situation my family lives in. With that also what kind of fucking person am I if I ignore what my family lives with every day while I'm at school. I struggle with that a lot. 

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist coming up next week and I plan on letting him know how much I've been struggling, but it is still a week away and I just feel so horrible.

I have a group of friends who for this I will refer to as A and B.

For around a year or so A and I have been continuously getting into petty arguments about who’s right and who’s wrong (in both factual and opinion matters). But, we both have issues in admitting when we are wrong, so it almost always ended in a heated stale mate. Usually the argument was because one of us was just flat out wrong and wouldn’t admit it, or I forgot something (I don’t have the best memory).

About 2 months ago we got into a heated argument because I had forgotten about a plan we had made, but I was sure I was right. Only this time A immediately started calling me a liar, saying things like “This is the classic narrative of you bending the truth to play in your favor.” This really upset me because I honestly and truly try not to lie ever, and really don’t. So we had a long and civil sit down conversation  where at the end we both agreed to try our best to admit when we are wrong and have friend B hold both of us accountable.

Now in present time, I think I have noticed an improvement in my admitting to when I’m wrong and friend B has expressed to me that I have been doing much better. However, friend A is still treating me as if my opinions are completely wrong and his are right saying things to me such as “It’s just better, period.” But when I try to express that they can have that opinion, mine is different they accuse me of being “condescending, high and mighty, and patronizing”. Friend B and I try to express to friend A that we think they are acting as if they are always right again, but they simply accuse us of the exact same and refuse to talk to us for a while saying things like “I’m not going to waste my time here arguing” or talking about one of us behind the others back to “avoid arguing to just figure out [A] is right.”

I don’t want to lose this friendship, but I feel as if, especially recently, that I have to defend my every opinion in front of friend A, just to have it shot back at me. It’s tiring. Am I the problem? What should I do?

400,"Whatsup reddit,

I'm bumming hard right now at 22 years old. I'm staying at my parents place and really contemplating if this is the best place to be as a young man trying to live his best life and explore his limited time in the world.

I beat myself up for not having a degree yet, but I have 40 credits, so I'm not too far off. I'm a pretty sociable guy and figured I could bartend or be a waiter for money, and save up to do a community college CC program (like radiography or respiratory therapy).

I would most likely move out and find the cheapest rent I can. I would take out credit cards and build a credit score, as well as save and save for school. Paying rent and doing school full time would be tough, but that's far along in the future, and who knows what could change in the years to come.

I'm a naturally hard worker. I should be graduating with a degree and limited student loans due to an athletic scholarship, but that's too far in the past to dwell on now.

My main reasons to move out would be to build my confidence as a man and try my hardest to overcome adversity/build independence. My parents seem miserable that me and my brother still live at home, so It would do them a big favor. Also, I have no place to bring girls. Having my own space would make me feel somewhat accomplished. Also, I could die tomorrow, and living at my parents house for 22 years wouldn't sit well in my death bed.

Is this a good idea, or nah?

401,"Hello all. I can't really reach out to my parents for advice when it comes to life advancement as I am the first in my family to attend college. I went to college right after High School not really knowing what I wanted to go into, hell I don't even know now. I was always advised during High School, if you don't know what to do, get a degree in business. Here we are today, I got my Associate's, I have a well-paying (For my area in Michigan), kind of relevant job (Customer Service Rep. for a company), and have no idea what to do next. I am interested in continuing my education, and the easiest would be to get a Bachelor's degree in accounting, but what will that get me? I pretty much know the basics, I can be an auditor, public accountant (After CPA), Taxes (Ew), Financial adviser (Interest me the most).... Point is, I don't know if I should be going back to school without being 100% sure of what I want. But I also feel like I'll never know exactly what I want. I don't like the idea of doing the same thing every single day, I want to feel like I'm accomplishing something, helping. Which is why financial advising or auditor interest me the most. As an auditor, at least you're going to different companies, or so I think. Is there options that I am missing? Am I over-stressing on this, or is this a normal thing? (As I said, first gen. in college, so I'm constantly questioning everything.

403,"So a few months ago I received a promotion to a Senior Management position. My title is Quality &amp; Innovations Manager. To give you guys some background, I have been working at this business for 10 years now. Have been happy there, good people, and the only reason I have stayed is I have progressed from the shop floor, through most of the areas of the business to now senior management as a 34 year old. The company has 50 staff, half would be in manufacturing the other half admin, sales, operations etc.  
Our previous Quality Manager was working 4 days a week and she resigned. I saw an opening to move up and I asked for her job. The conversation with my boss at the time went well but he had this mindset that she got her work done in 4 days, so technically its not a full time position (too be honest, she was barely keeping up doing 4 days and doing the bare minimum to keep our QMS running) so me taking initiative, I suggested that I take over as Quality Manager and also run our companies Innovation projects (it has been a goal for a long time to make our own products, as up to then we only make other people products as a contract manufacturer) so we negotiated the role and it all fell into place really quickly. Great.

Now me personally, I have 2 young kids at home (3 year old boy, 1 year old girl) and a wife that has just gone back to work 3 days a week as we have a mortgage and bills to pay and my wage (I'm on reasonable money for a senior management role but cost of living here in Melb, Australia is insane!) just doesn't cover our expenses. So to say we are a busy family is an understatement. My capacity to work big hrs is just not there right now and here is my predicament.  


I just had my performance review with my boss (he is a very old school business kinda guy in his 60's, never ever takes time off, works 6 days a week, his wife has always stayed home to run the house so he can just focus on work) and he has zero empathy or understanding about my family life. Whilst he believes I am doing a great job, he said that doesn't matter how busy we are as senior managers, we should never work 9-5. He said a senior management role is never 9-5. Now firstly I rarely work 9-5. Most days I start at 8:00am or so and finish no later than 5:30pm as I have to pick the kids up from daycare (my wife has a way longer commute then I do so she cant' get to daycare in time before it closes at 6:00pm)

I explained to my boss that I don't take lunch breaks, or if I do I eat at my desk. So technically I am already working 9.5 hr days rather than the 8 they pay me for. Plus my role is technically two full time roles nearly now as things are heating up.  


I feel stuck. On one hand this company has given me so much. I love it here and being close to home it makes it easier on my wife as I can pick kids up etc. I am doing well in the role and I am also very hopeful to be made General Manager within the next 3 years (My boss is the MD but wants to retire in 3 years and stay on the board and appoint a General Manager) I know the board well, I am on great terms with everyone. The only negative here is really my boss needs to see me put in the big hrs to show how much I want this, and I just don't know how I can do it without putting massive pressure on me wife and kids. If I were to work 8am - 7pm every day, it would mean I wouldn't see my kids much, my wife would have to do EVERYTHING, she would have to change her work hrs (not easily done) and she would be the one making all the sacrfices and it just doesn't sit well with me. I love being a Dad and I won't be one of those Dad's who puts there whole life into their job and then get to their 50's and 60's and have regrets about not spending time with family....

405,"Just for reference I have one sister (25), two step-brothers (20, one deceased) and a step-sister (40). My parents are divorced and both remarried.

I grew up with undiagnosed autism (has now been diagnosed). This caused a number of issues in that I had meltdowns much older than would be normal (like into highschool) and had a very hard time making friends. No one would say that I was mean or actually rude but they would say I was super quiet/invisible, and that I was more interested in books than people. I also have very serious depression which admittedly means I am not always the funnest person to be around.

Now, as an adult I have virtually no relationship with my family. I have spent years trying to have one. I would set up plans with my sister over and over but she would never show up. I go to every event I am invited to and always try my best to be happy and outgoing. However it seems like no matter what I do no one is really interested in having any relationship with me. They go on camping weekends without me, or have big family weekends at my parent's cabin without inviting me. This last year I also made group plans (i.e. I invited my sister/her SO, and appropriate step-siblings) for mother's day, my mom's birthday and father's day. I later learned my sister made plans on my dad's birthday, which would be the most recent of all those dates, and no one thought to invite me. I don't really know what to do at this point. It becomes pretty dificult to keep inviting people and be rejected because it will trigger me to have bad days depression wise which is difficult enough to manage already.

I am desprete for any help at this point. My sister will probably be having a child soon and I want to have a relationship with her and the future kids. It would also be helpful for my own mental health to have some family in my life, or at least not feel like they all hate me.

406,"Hi all, I'm really looking forward to starting a relationship but I'm scared of letting a girl see all my flaws. It really sucks because I constantly fantasise about what being in love feels like. I imagine it is amazing.

Does everyone have this fear? I'm not desperately trying to get a girlfriend at any given chance, I understand that I'll meet someone when the time comes but how do I handle this fear? You may be wondering what my flaws are but it's not so much physical, although it is to an extent. (I unfortunately carry a small facial scar on my left cheek from an accident when I was younger) However, I am more scared of allowing a girl to know everything about me therefore making me vulnerable. You know? I can't open up very well so I fear that when I finally do, I may think of myself as weak and exposed to someone.

410,"Tl;dr:
Best friend accepts touchyfeely when it's from ""straight"" (closeted gay) friend. But can't stand my bisexual touchyfeely EVERSINCE I told him about my orientation. Remark: ""straight"" friend gets even more touchyfeely than I ever have but best friend even plays into it but I can't even look at him.


So my best friend has known that I'm bi for like over a year and I'm a very touchyfeely kinda dude and it never really bothered him when I e.g. randomly hugged him or felt his biceps. If I met someone and they told me they'd be uncomfortable with it I'm ALWAYS understanding and do my best not to make them feel uncomfortable, but here's what really confuses/angers/saddens me:
Eversince he knows about my sexual orientation and even about some exchanges that happened with a mutual ex friend he's behaving really weird, like seemingly running away everytime I so much as only look at the general direction he happens to be positioned in. Anyways we have this friend who I'm pretty sure is closeted gay but he claims to be straight. 
Now here it comes: we were at a little get together and gay friend got all touchyfeely with best friend even more than I EVER HAVE with ANYBODY, but bf didn't mind AT ALL! He even played into it thinking they were wrestling or who knows what, dude legit, like, gay friend was reeeally into it and bf was all OK with it. So naturally cause I was actually hurt by it I confronted him, albeit via text and with a bit of an attitude, but still! So he said he was fine with it because gay friend claims he's straight, doesn't matter he basically molested him. As long as he's straight he doesn't matter. But when I do ANYTHING he can't stand by it because I'm bi. WTF! Like, dude, get over yourself. I used to have a crush on him because he used to be really kind and he's certainly some nice eyecandy but now... I can't even imagine being into him any more than as a friend.

A lot of people, except me and some of his friends, hated him because of his rebellious personality. However, he was very friendly to me and I owe him a lot of emotional debt.

My brother and I have never really been close. We fight constantly. As we’ve grown older, our fights have gotten worse and are happening much more frequently. We don’t normally physically hurt each other, it’s always just a shouting match. These shouting matches happen a couple times a day.

We are able to be civil with each other occasionally, but those civil times are starting to really concern me. 

My brother is displaying...strange behaviors towards me. 

I’m afraid he’s having incestuous feelings for me, and that’s freaking me out. Things came to a head yesterday, and they are the reason I’ve finally decided to make this post. 

So I’ll just sort of list the strange things he’s said and done to me over the past year or two:

He’ll touch me (not inappropriately, just like weird arm squeezes and pokes that make me uncomfortable. I don’t like being touched) for no reason. Like if we’re just near each other, he’ll randomly start getting super weird and touchy. I’ve expressed that it makes me uncomfortable, but he just laughs it off. 

He has asked me if we weren’t siblings, would we date. Unprompted. I said no and told him that wasn’t appropriate to ask. 

Sometimes when we’re fighting, I’ll say “fuck you” and he has responded with “I’d like to”, “I will”, “Mmmm”, and “Oh, yeah” in a non joking way. This specific thing has only started in the past month or two, and it freaks me out. I’ve expressed my disgust at him saying that, and the first time he said he didn’t mean it like that, but the other times he’s said he couldn’t help it/he doesn’t know why he says those things. 

Yesterday while we were in a swimming pool:

More unneeded touching. 

He asked me if boys told me I was curvy. I’m a skinny DD girl, but wouldn’t consider myself curvy. I was wearing a non-revealing one piece. It was weird and I told him that wasn’t something you should say to your sister. 

He told me he’d get me some girls, implying sexual acts with his tone and facial expressions. I’m straight and he knows this, so that was pretty odd, but I would’ve brushed it off if it wasn’t for the rest. 

I was stretching my legs at the side of the pool (underwater, I might add) and noticed he was staring at me. He was...hard. I politely averted my gaze and exited the pool. I know that happens to teenage boys sometimes, but with all the other things he’d said and done that afternoon, I was concerned. 

All these things are piling up quickly, and it’s making me uncomfortable. I’m not sure what I should do, if anything, at this point. 

Am I overreacting? Am I just being a shitty sister and jumping to conclusions? 

Advice very much appreciated, as I have absolutely no idea what to do.

As far as me and her goes, we’ve hung out several times before and got along amazingly. I’ve never been so quick to connect with someone before it was crazy, I feel there there may be somthing there. My friends who do hang out with her a lot also joke about how she’s obsessed with me. I just don’t want to take advantage of her in this kind of situation. I know how grieving can mess with your judgement.

I’m shaking with excitement about this opportunity to hang out with her again and I really don’t want to screw things up. What do?",18Jul2018,1
430,"Gonna keep it short. I'm a virgin. He is not. I have no idea how to go about this? I want to. I really do! We live together and we can both get really heated but then it stops... 

How do I go about this? I'm a sheltered young adult and I don't really know how to start things up... 

Any tips please. ",18Jul2018,0
431,"I’ve asked my mom several times to stop using a certain turn if phrase as I’ve expressed that it makes me very uncomfortable. To which my dad keeps saying “you know she says that because it bugs you” 
It doesn’t just bug me, it really makes me uncomfortable. When I told them that I was being serious and didn’t want to joke around about this, she just said “you can’t dictate what I say” 
To which I replied that I wasn’t trying to dictate anything, I was just politely asking her not to use phrases that make me uncomfortable. Then she said “well whatever.” 
I hate that they just brush me off and disregard my requests like that, if they asked me to stop saying something around them, I would stop. This isn’t the first time this has happened, how can I get them to understand my point?",18Jul2018,2
432,"I'm 19 years old, Non-binary, and I graduated high school last January. I had all my credits a semester early, so I decided to graduate and start working instead. I came out with a 2.5 GPA. After that, I lived with my mom, paying around $300 for rent on a $400 paycheck. That only lasted a few months before we moved again, to a 3 bedroom that I share with my older brother \[21\] and mother. 

The fall before graduating, I applied for college at a university in the next city over and was accepted, plus started to apply for community college. I almost went to the university, but cancelled after being afraid. I wasn't sure what I actually wanted to do for a career, or with my life in general. I became ""interested"" in different colleges off and on for about a year.

Right now, I work at Target making roughly $1,400 a month, but I pay over $700 in bills and spend my leftover money recklessly so I have no savings. Most weeks I have to borrow money from my struggling mother to pay for food or gas. I just feel like I have no direction or purpose in life. Sure, I have like, one friend, and she's cool and all, but we're not besties.

I can't afford to go to college full-time while working 40 hours a week and barely scraping by. I also can't go at all with no idea what I want to do with my life. I grew up in a cult, where my father sheltered me from kids my age. Our religion discouraged going to college and finding a place for yourself in ""this world"", so I never gave college or a career a single thought until my senior year of high school. 

Now, my childhood is catching up with me, and I'm behind everyone I know. All my high school friends just finished their first year of college and are doing well. Friends younger than me have been accepted to colleges and know what they want to do with their lives, while I have absolutely no clue whatsoever.

I don't have any skills or talents, I'm unintelligent (as my 2.5 GPA would suggest) and did horribly in high school. I have ADHD, dyslexia, for starters, and I don't learn easily. I barely passed HS geometry and had to take algebra 1 as my last math credit. I am literally so fucking dumb.

Anyways, I just need help figuring out where the hell my life is going. It seems useless to even keep going at this point. ",18Jul2018,0

434,"My mom was pulling in to our condo complex but the road is extremely uneven so you have to slow down to pull in. This guy had been riding my moms ass the whole way and got mad when she had to stop for a few seconds. So he followed my mom all the way to our building and screaming “why did you stop.”

My mom got out of her car and was with my 16 year old sister. He kept yelling profanities at her to the point where it was verbally abusive. My mom wrote down the plate number and called the NY state troopers. She said they couldn’t do anything because it was all word and there is no physical evidence. 

There are signs that say “no soliciting” as soon as you pull in. I’m not accepting that nothing can be done about this. This guy should not be able to get away with this and I’m sure he’ll do it again to someone else. ",18Jul2018,3
435,"So in my hunt to find anything that isn't League of Legends, I stumbled onto a game called Brawlhalla on steam. Losing aside, it's a really cool little game, trying to knock people off the stage and get victory yada yada. The first....2 hours of the game, I was really enjoying the game. It was fresh for me, I even won a game a 2, and I was looking forward to playing it more. But then I started losing too much, and that's when the game became a pile a shit for me.

I hate that I've ruined the entire experience of enjoying this game now. I just played a few games today, decided I'd hop in some 1v1s just to screw around. But nope, I couldn't deal. I get matched against clearly good players, and I couldn't land much of anything on these guys. I just said screw, and would suicide my last two lives away; it even got to the point where I was steaming so much that I wanted to tell them post game how much a fucking try hard they were when deep down I knew it was me with the issue.

I know it's wrong. I know I'm wrong. But idk what it is, losing just takes a great toll on me. I'm a really sore loser; I can't even begin to think what that's attributed to either. Like, I really want to enjoy this game, hell even League, but as soon as I start losing, I just don't even care anymore. So at this point I'm just contemplating uninstalling all multiplayer, competitive games on my PC. Not because I think they're bad, but because of my current mindset. 

I want to be a better, level headed gamer. I want to just have fun with games, I don't want to trash talk enemies clearly outplaying me because I think I should win, or that the game is against me. Feeling like shit because I can't take losses is getting really old; at this point it's either I just stick to single player, or coop games, or quit gaming altogether. It's not fair to other players that I act like a big headed asshole who deserves a win, and I feel like shit because of it afterwards everytime.

I want to change my mindset, and become a better sport I really do. It's just, I don't know, just the losing really, really grinds my gears sometimes...I just can't help it, and I don't know why. Please help...",18Jul2018,4
436,I HAVE BEEN POSTING ASK FOR ADVICE AND WAITING FOR HOURS!!!,18Jul2018,0
437,Had the most amazing night of my life with a stranger and purposely didn’t get their number to prevent my self from attaching to the situation. However he got mine and he hasn’t contacted me and I am 100%  sure he won’t. The first couple days after I was just genuinely appreciative for the amazing night and could see it just as that. But a few days after ( now) it’s slowly sinking in that that’s all it was. I am trying not too attach to it and I do have self worth but there’s a small part of me that wishes he would like to get to know me even more. Serious advice only please ,18Jul2018,0
438,"Recently I purchased a rather expensive time piece, which happens to be a Rolex.  A friend of mine that I’ve known online thru programming in the past saw an image of the watch on social media, and expressed interest in buying it from me.  I am strongly considering selling it to him for a few hundred dollars more than I paid for it, but he lives across the country from me in California.  It would be nieve of me to trust someone I’ve never met face to face (or anyone for that matter) by shipping this product across the country.  My concerns:

-What is the best way to receive payment?  Wire transfer?

-What if he claims I sent him a fake watch or that something is wrong with it, when I know that there isn’t anything wrong with it?  (I have the paperwork and proof of my order from the initial retailer).  Should I take a video of the watch in its current condition as I hand it over to the shipping carrier?

-What would be the most efficient way to ship an item of this value?  Insurance with additional tracking?

Any other forms of tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

439,"So I woke up to a message from this girl I haven't spoken to in ages saying ""is your name annabelle crisp or is that just silly"". I just replied ""huh what"" and she sent me this Rick and Morty meme (I don't watch the show). After I asked her what was going on, if she was drunk or something, she said her friend took her phone. (Personally, this explanation doesn't make sense to me as the initial message was sent a half hour before I replied, then the image was sent after I replied, so her friend had her phone for about 30 minutes...?)

We made small talk for a bit after that, then she went to bed

I'm really confused, I'm 99% sure it's nothing but I'm really bad with people so I don't know if this is a hint (again 99.9999% sure it isn't, but I thought I'd ask you guys anyway)

Should I follow this up tomorrow or just let it go?",18Jul2018,1
