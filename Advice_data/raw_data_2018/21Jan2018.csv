1,"I (21 F) haven’t been in a relationship in about 2 years. I’ve recently been going on dates with people and have been using dating sites (tinder and bumble) to try and meet people. My problem is that I am finding it difficult to start conversations and to talk to any people I do go out on a date with. 

I’ve looked up conversation tips and whatnot, but they all seem really fake and more like they belong in an interview. Any help would be appreciated since I’m fairly certain I come across as boring and personality-less. ",21Jan2018,1
2,"So I've been having this weird problem since last year first semester when I was taking calc 3, where now I'm beginning my second year. Class starts and I'm feeling fine. Ten or so minutes into the lecture, I start feeling rather cold, and eventually tired. I'll begin yawning and nodding off constantly, or accidentally shutting my eyes for 30 seconds. This continues until there's only a few more minutes left in class, where I'll suddenly feel perfectly awake. It's a real problem because classes are a little over an hour long, and i'm only able to really pay attention for 20 minutes of it. I keep having to relearn my material by myself, which feels like a waste of time if I could have just stayed awake. 

I've gotten plenty of sleep most times (6-9 hours) but that seems to have no effect on my attentiveness. I think one of the biggest problems is that I start getting cold before I get tired, and as it's the winter time, this is a lot worse for me. I've resorted to trying to layer shirts, and wearing my winter coat during class. I really hate doing that because it doesn't help much at all, and I fear I look weird doing so. I don't believe it's too cold for anyone else, I've asked a friend his opinion but he says the temperature is fine, and all the other students take off their jackets and feel fine.

I sit in the front row because I hear that's supposed to help with staying awake and getting better grades, so I'm not snoozing in the back of the classroom.

In terms of potential health issues like low iron or a thyroid problem, I got myself tested hoping that might provide some insight, but neither is my problem. 

I wonder if the problem may be that my brain is conditioned to think that math class corresponds with nap time, but I don't get tired when doing math homework or reading my textbook on it. 

Sorry it's a lot of info, but I want to put everything out there and hope someone has an idea of what I can do to stay awake.

TLDR: I keep falling asleep in a particular class and I've tried a number of things to stay awake, but it keeps happening.",21Jan2018,2
4,"So basically I was friends with this girl, like BEST FRIENDS for like 3 or 4 years. After I did my GCSEs and left high school I went off to do A levels and she went off to college. We haven't really spoken much since like July or something...maybe slightly on and off by text but she lives in an awkward place to get to so we never saw each other.

I had my moments where I was really angry with her. My kitten got run over by a car in April of last year and I was so devastated. She never called me to see how I was doing, if I needed anything. Just nothing. Since then she's just been blowing me off if I want to hang or whatever, not talking to me and it's just horrible really. To my recollection I did nothing wrong and I don't understand why she was being like this. Basically just being a flakey friend.

But recently she's been trying to meet up with me and talk to me and I just feel really hurt by the randomness of this. It's completely out of nowhere and at first I didn't really know if I wanted to see her because I felt used for whenever she wanted me to be ""available"" for her but when I needed her she wasn't there.

I made a huge deal about how I didn't want to see her but kinda dealt with it in a passive aggressive way which I kind of regret now but hey, whatever. My boyfriend said I shouldn't give her a second chance, that she was never there for me when I needed her the most and that she was a crappy friend. But...lol pity story apart from my boyfriend I don't have any constant friends in my life at the minute and when we used to hang out, we had so much fun, had good food, got drunk, had a great time. I miss the company but it's wierd because I've never felt the need for friends in my life until now. I just need my boyfriend. But idk.

I need some advice. I mean obviously you guys don't know the full story but you get the gist. What should I do? I'm thinking about calling her and asking to hang out, I want a life outside of my boyfriend too. I love him but I want to feel like I have an exciting life.

7,"So my ex is vindictive and I’m 99% sure he reported me at work and at the place I do research. For the place I do research I had a “random” drug test this past week and I’m pretty sure it’s because he told them I was taking controlled substances. I used to, but not anymore and they were prescribed. So that’s the first off thing to happen to me. Now this morning work tells me that there’s an ongoing investigation and they’re being ridiculously vague with me, but I know it has something to with him reporting me to HR. They want me to bring my work computer  in to them on Monday for the investigation and they won’t tell me anything else. Usually when you quit they have you ship your computer to another location, so I know it’s not just so it can be returned to them. For the time being they’re telling me not to work, but my name has already been removed from the system. Pretty sure I’m fired, but they’re being so vague and it’s upsetting. Should I actually take my computer in or just completely cut contact with them? I know this will make me look suspicious, but pretty sure they’ve already made their mind up without an investigation.

15,"Hey Reddit sorry to bother you. 


Bit of a backstory, I will call who I am talking about Mr.X.

Me and Mr.X meet in college and both of us bonded on several shared interests. He struck me as a smart guy and was pretty well liked by a mutual friend group, actually the one who introduced me to saod friend group. 

Before I meet him his mom contracted Brest cancer. She later passed away, and afterwards he went through a period of Few of and his step dad kicked him out of the house. I lived with my parents at the time and convinced them to invite him to live with us for a bit and they agreed. He wasent the cleanest house guest but that was a whatever. I know it frustrated my parents but I ignored alot of it because of what he was going through. 

When I moved out he moved out. That being said we still hung out and he stayed very much in touch. He seemed to be doing better eventually even moving in with a friend of his and getting a job delivering papers. He still however alwayse seemed lost. He eventually drifted away a bit and we were in less frequent contact but still made a point to hang out with him I trusted him and we were close.

 So after a while he moved into his own apartment and seemed to be doing pretty good but the apartment sucked and I needed a roommate at a duplex I bought so he moved in. All well and good but after he moved in is where the issues started. 

 He was an awfle person near the end who took advantage of me. I had to have the room he stayed in professionally cleaned he even stoped paying rent the last few months. He broke my couch and almost all my dishes.  

My problem is we shared alot of interests and the issue I'm haveing is that I don't want to think of him.
How do I stop thinking about him? ",21Jan2018,0

22,"My uncle died when I was a baby - 2 years old I believe. He was my mother’s oldest brother and when he died it broke her heart, and she never got over losing him. She’s not old enough to really be losing siblings. 

My uncle was a typical redneck hillbilly. He had a confederate flag which was his prized possession next to his custom cufflinks he wore when he got married. 

He told my mother on his death bed he intended the flag for me because I was an intense child, a “rebel”, by his words. My mother just found the flag this week. 

Now, I would have loved to inherit the cufflinks. I would have worn them when I eventually marry. I would have passed them to MY grandkids. That is something special, and it means something on a personal level, my uncle wore them on a very special day. 

But a confederate flag? 

I don’t want it. I don’t respect this hate symbol and I have no intentions of showing any reverence to it. I was previously engaged to a woman of colour for god sakes. 

I felt pressured into accepting it, because my mom was sobbing in my arms when she gave it to me, but I don’t know what to do with it now. 

It’s a historic flag - not dated to the civil war period, but it is something like 100 years old. I’d rather just have it burned, but I would feel awful because of how obviously important it is to my mother. I just don’t know what she expects me to do with it. I will not display it in any capacity.

24,"Hello reddit.
I need a third set of eyes on my current situation. My SO and I have been together 12 years. I (29/F) and he (30/M) dated and lived together for 9 years prior to getting married and getting married was more for convenience. We both love each other. 

A couple years into our marriage I committed an emotional affair with someone who I met online. I threatened to leave our relationship, and was selfish and hateful, intentionally hurting my SO because I felt like he didn't understand me. We moved past my discrepancy. 

At the beginning of last year, he told me that he was unfulfilled in our marriage, and that he had been interested in trying a BDSM dynamic, which when I explored it, seemed to fit us perfectly. (Prior to this, sex was always a point of contention, as he would initiate and I would turn him down, this happened frequently)

Our sex life increased dramatically, there was something new and exciting in it for both of us and it seemed to repair the points of contentment in our relationship as well, opening up new forms of communication, exploration (even inviting new partners into the mix, together)

My SO and I have always been introverted, but approximately 3 months ago we decided to start going out to bars, restaurants, etc. more to meet new people. We met people that were also into the BDSM and poly lifestyle and everything seemed to be going well for the both of us.

Our decision to start going out came from the fact that we had both been introverted and never really did anything except hang out at home. Neither one of us had close friends or family that we could see/spend time with.

The last several months I have felt completely lost about who I am, while he has found out exactly who he is through communication, education, and experience. He knows what he wants and how to accomplish achieving it, and I seem to have no idea what I'm doing at all. I feel like I'm having an existential crisis, and that I've lost my identity somewhere along our relationship, although I'm not sure if I knew who I was before even entering it. We continuously argue, sometimes for days on end, and then we are both so tired that nothing gets accomplish. I have lost his trust, I have manipulated him into staying in this relationship (and I just became aware I was doing that), and generally I am a terrible wife/partner/sub. 

I just want some insight from someone who doesn't know either one of us, our family/friends would not be helpful since they know both of us. Thank you in advance.",21Jan2018,2
25,"I know this is a long post, but I desperately need advice. I included all the main details of the events that occurred.

My dad is physically and verbally abusive and he has been for several years now and it's only been increasing. For example - from the amount of times he has hit/punched my scapular muscle is fucked up and it pops out of my shoulder. He has severe anger issues and has hit/yelled at me for looking at him 'the wrong way' just yetserday. Two years ago I made an attempt to run away to a friends house for two weeks - the police found me and the people i was staying with explained the situation to the police. The police agreed that it was not a good idea for me to return home but all they could do was send me to a general hospital. The detective stayed as long as he could with me to make sure I was ok in the hospital. The doctor who checked me out was horrified by what she had heard from me and the detective, and said that under no circumstances did she think it was a good idea for me to go home, but of course that wasn't her decision to ultimately make.

I spoke to 3 different social workers with CPS in less than 48 hours. The first one was on the phone and I never met her - she was very sympathetic and also thought that the home situation was not safe let alone ideal. The second one I talked to in person at the hospital. She was also extremely sympathetic and was very concerned about the conditions in which I was living in. She wrote everything down that I told her to across several different pages. I talked to another social worker that same day at the hospital who also took notes and displayed concern. I was sent to a short term out patient facility for a psychiatric evaluation, and there I spoke to another social worker; she said that it was unlikely that CPS would take me away from my family and instead recommended some sort of counselling and she said 'don't keep your hopes up'. I was at the In Patient treatment facility for six days. My father visited twice and we had meetings with the social worker. He was acting very sweet as he always does in front of people he doesn't know. I went home and of course it was hell all over again. I cried for hours until the neighbors filed a complaint with the police. The police came to check up, and I kept crying - 4 hours later my father called the police out of frustration because I 'would not shut up'. 

The next day a social worker came to my house - she said that she wanted to talk to me and see if we could figure out a plan to make things better. After a bit of coaxing she managed to get me out of my room and we all sat down and tried to talk. My dad became angry when I showed her the bruises on my arms and he stood up and slapped my across the face in front of her. She stood up in shock and I'm not sure what happened after that because I ran to get the home phone to call the police. She never visited us ever again after that, nor did any other social worker follow up on our case. The police came and took me to the general hospital that I'd been at about a week and a half prior when the police first found me. I was sent home about an hour and a half after. 
I'm not sure what to do at this point as it's only getting worse. He twisted my arm really hard and threw me on the floor, the grabbed the computer monitor and threw it down, and it landed just next to me. It's getting unceasingly hard to deal with the situation and I really think I've reached my limit. I need to run away, but don't know where to or how. I don't think there's any chance I can get emancipated because he will not let me get a job. He's constantly neglectful on top of the abuse - I was recently diagnosed with severe migraines. I had multiple brain scans done but doctors concluded it was stress induced. They recommended I see a psychiatrist immediately but it has been 2 months and I have no received any kind of help. I'm scared for my life and I know I need to get out asap, but I don't know how or what. I've already decided that my education can wait - I can get my GED as soon as I turn 18.

26,"Long post but I need some advice from an outside party. Please help me out. 

My sister in law and her husband... there is no real way to put this nicely... they are not the sharpest tool in the shed.

To start I make gobs more than them. I am considered upper middle class right now. I make six figures just on my own. Wife is taking college courses right now and when she graduates we will make an additional 75% more. We are not hurting.

My sister in law and her family? I’m not sure they’ve seen a one hundred dollar bill in the last decade. This becomes relevant later. 

So rewind to my sister in laws teen years. So has always been a trouble maker. She had wrecked more cars before turning 18 than I’ve ever owned. She had lots of problems with drugs. She was under witness protection for awhile because some guys had some other guy kidnapped in her home. There could be a whole Jerry Springer episode just about this girl.

Eventually she started dating her drug dealer and ran off with the guy. Didn’t hear from her for years until I found her one day on MySpace. We communicated for awhile and all seemed fine. Then she ghosted everyone.

Several years passed until I found her on Facebook this time. She had two kids with the drug dealer (who no longer deals drugs) and they lived about 4 hours drive away. I had just moved to a new state to start a job but my family were still there so they came and visited. My wife had a great visit with them and then my family finished the move and we all lived together again. Now about a 30 hour drive away.

Several months passed and we stayed in contact. Then one day she texted us and said she decided to pick up her whole family and move in with us. Um... little weird but she had a job lined up about 2 hours away and they just needed a place to land until they could get some housing squared away. We agreed. They moved out and, to no ones surprise, couldn’t find a place to live. Why would they? They were living rent free, they didn’t pay for food or entertainment... their only expense was gas for their car... until they asked to switch cars with me because they had what I nicknamed the “Gas Pissin’ Durango” while I had a small Acura. I switched with her so she could get better gas mileage.

My wife can’t handle much of any situation aside from that which she is accustomed. If it is something unusual she freaks out.

In the beginning things were pretty good. But I could see my wife unraveling slowly and I knew it wouldn’t last forever.

Sister in law worked. Brother in law did not because he has epilepsy and did not have insurance at the time. Yes... this is in the USA.

Long story short they didn’t do a whole lot and they ended up stealing medications. Wife flipped out and made everyone’s life hell. Seriously, she was the queen of Bitchlandia.

A few weeks later and we found her a new job close to home and found them a house and moved them out.

Things were... tense. We didn’t see them much because of it.

The whole family did get insurance through the state. He got his epilepsy diagnosed and was given a medication that worked beautifully. No more seizures.

I ended up getting laid off and we got a new job about 14 hours drive away. We said our goodbyes and left.

Things remained tense and we lost contact with them shortly after moving away.

Three weeks ago we got in contact with them again and things went better.

Husband lost his job six months ago because he lost a finger. L&amp;I helped him sue because the fan didn’t have a protective shroud. He somehow lost even though it sounds like a slam dunk case to me. We were told he got a new job and started Jan 3.

Today we got a call... he committed suicide in the garage yesterday.

My wife talked to her and cried with her. The job he started January 3? He didn’t find one. He just told his wife that because females from my wife’s family are evil when things aren’t what they want. Seriously... my wife will even own up to that.

He got up early and told his wife he was going to work. Went to the garage and hung himself.

He left a wife and two children. A 12 year old boy and a 10 year old girl.

I don’t know what to do. She is obviously in a tough position because they have no money. And I can afford the heck out of whatever I need to afford. But this family has a deep history of taking money from anyone. Her parents won’t even speak to her because of the money that she owes them is more than $20,000. So if I give her money it won’t be spent well (think more drugs and alcohol).

If I offer to bring her to me and have them live with us again it’ll only turn into a disaster again. She also currently lives in a very very Democratic state and gets lots and lots of state assistance. I currently live in a very Republican state and she might not get half of what she gets there. She also has friends and a support network there. Here she would only have us to lean on... and I know that would be bad juju mixing with my wife.

But I feel like an ass not helping because giving her the money would just mean we wouldn’t go out to eat as often or maybe the kids wouldn’t get to go out and do stuff on Saturdays AND Sundays each weekend.

So help me out r/advice ... do I help her? If so, how should I help? If not, what do I say when I am inevitably asked for help? Should I offer to have them move in with us again?

tl;dr - Sis in law and her husband aren’t great people. Her husband committed suicide yesterday. I can afford to help but they have a history with me and others of abusing that help. I can offer to have them move in with us but that won’t work well with my wife. What should I do?",21Jan2018,1

30,"Hi reddit,

This is only really the essentials so it's readable even if it's overly simplistic.

I broke up with a girl in 2013. During the time I was with her I noticed I was often tired but due to lack of sleep as I was working full time with high school also and enjoying managing a fairly successful (until the end) relationship.

In 2015 I stopped working and the sleepiness/tiredness it only progressively got worse. I hadn't seen or spoken to her since 2013 and didn't feel depressed so I was diagnosed with excessive sleepiness. When working full time I would literally sleep all day on my 2 days off.

June 2017 I finally get my shit together (kinda). I get rid of my car and stop work to focus on studying, which wasn't happening while I was working as I struggle to get anything done due to tiredness so i start falling behind. Which happened even after quitting work.

So a week and a half ago, I meet someone who's boyfriend recently (1 month) broke up with her I find this out after, so I am cautious about just being a fill in for him and want to give her space to recover and find herself so I let her know that is the case, so we just start talking a little. I've met people over this time before but after this everything changed.

I had no car and no job so I was determined to finish studying quickly. My unexplained tiredness started to go away, I had the energy to run to the beach early every morning (still hard), hang out with friends, started staying up to study, even going to bed after a long day and not being able to sleep. I've generally felt the happiest I've been in years, so I just went with it.

The night before last night, I was pretty exhausted, got one of my major assessments finished and just before I went to bed I got a message. She said she wanted to be friends because she doesn't know what she wants yet and still has some feelings for the other guy. I've already prepared myself for this, which is why I didn't let things advance too quickly, but it still hit me a little bit. But I was determined to keep the lifestyle i had just started living so I set that alarm up anyway.

Now as of yesterday I have almost no energy or desire to do my run to the beach, but I pushed myself and walked there. I'm sleepy and have no desire to get anything done. I'm back to normal, except feeling a little disappointed in myself.

How do I get back to where I was?",21Jan2018,3

I guess the largest recent problem is severe headaches. Sometimes they happen randomly throughout the day. They've been happening a lot at work in the afternoon. I feel uncontrollably irritated. Everything I used to do in my spare time just doesn't work for me anymore; mostly just reading and playing video games.

I just feels like I'm angry all the time. I keep looking for a way to change my situation but it's just dead ends. For now I just wish I could calm down. I've tried everything I can think of: exercising more, a single beer before bed, walking more, etc but nothing works.",21Jan2018,2
33,"I was going to post this on my throw away account, but I decided to say fuck it because I don't want to hide behind an anonymous user.

My mental health has been steadily deteriorating for about a year, maybe a little less. When I was 14, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and severe anxiety/panic disorder. Over time, there's now potential ADD, OCD, and PTSD added into the cocktail. These things all run in my family, so its not unlikely. Those last three I have not been officially diagnosed with, however a couple therapists have suggested that I'm likely suffering from them and encouraged me to get checked out. I haven't yet, as my insurance is gone.

Anxiety has always been my biggest issue, and depression has been mostly dormant for a few years. As of lately, my depression has sky rocketed. I moved across the country recently following a lot of really upsetting things that happened (i don't want to get into it, but it was highly stressful and raised the point about PTSD, and I wanted to escape it.) My boyfriend (let's call him J) came along despite him not being particularly enthusiastic about the city we moved to, promising to be open minded and give it a try.

The first couple months were okay, we had a small amount of savings, my dad paid my first round of rent to help me out, I found a full time job a couple bucks above minimum wage within two weeks, the apartment was cheap, and I had some cool opportunities present themselves. J and I got along fine, things were starting to look up a bit. I had to fly back home a couple months ago because my brother was hospitalized, and it brought up a lot of really negative emotions due to the nature of the hospitalization. When I got back home, I panicked and J and I broke up. After a miserable week that I spent drunk and realizing my mistake, I went and found him at a bar and asked for him back, admitting i made a mistake. He came home happily, and we proceeded to have probably the best few weeks together we have ever had. We were on top of our shit, I was feeling happier, we were making huge strides - and then we both got the flu, and lost our jobs, within two days - leaving me devastated and horrified at the idea of eviction. In this city, eviction is a huge no no. It would be nearly impossible to find anything else again. 

Because of all this, I lost about 10 pounds in the week I was sick. I couldn't eat or sleep. It was like there was a storm cloud over my head following me everywhere. Every day was hazy and I could barely make myself shower. J and I got into multiple fights, he told me I was making him miserable because I was miserable, which in turn only made me more miserable. I begged him to let up and give me a little time, but every time I asked this of him it blew up into a fight. The last few days, I've been in a better mood but he has been extremely sensitive to anything I say. If he feels I'm using a negative tone, he starts an issue with me. Telling him I'm ok and feeling better does nothing, he just says ""no you're not"" which drives me up the wall because I hate being told how I feel by people that don't actually know. He has refused any intimacy at all, it's been like pulling teeth just for a kiss. He keeps talking about how inconvenient my sadness has been to him.

The part that bothered me is that he's typically quite understanding and caring, and generally just tries to cheer me up. He's super thoughtful, he used to draw baths for me after work when he knew it was a long day, he would surprise me with candy and let me play video games and just keep me company until i found the willpower to get up again and get on top of my shit - which typically wouldn't take so long since he made me feel comfortable and loved. So the sudden change in tolerance is extremely uncharacteristic. As of the last day, he won't let me touch him at all. I've tried sitting him down and apologizing for upsetting him and telling him I love him very much and giving him a hug, but as soon as i lean in or grab his arm or something for a hug he literally twists out of my grip and tells me not to touch him. He expressed that he was depressed too so I did something I shouldn't have, and looked at his phone. I went in looking for an anonymous confession app that we used to have downloaded, and as I typed it into the search bar a super sexual conversation between him and a girl popped up in iMessage - I clicked it and he had notifications for the conversation turned off. They had a whole bunch of photos exchanged over about a week and a half. I confronted him, and the only thing he will say about it is that I'm an asshole for looking at it and invading his privacy - he refuses to acknowledge that he did anything wrong. He refuses to give me an explanation, or address it at all outside of assigning the blame to me. Told me if I didn't want him to cheat, I shouldn't spend two weeks being a miserable person to be around. And now, he refuses to speak to me and is threatening to leave me, telling me he's put up with too much over the last two years of dating and that my family sucks (they do, but my stance is that he is dating me and not my family, and I have defended him when they've been awful, even cut a couple people off.)

I understand that it's partially my fault he cheated, because cheating generally does not happen if your SO is making you feel fulfilled. I have boughts of depression, severe panic attacks, bad anger issues, paranoia, and a tendency to be violent at times (I havent hurt anybody, but I have a tendency to slam doors and throw things around when I'm angry or upset which I understand can be super alarming. This is also a very recent thing as I'm so frustrated by the things I'm going through that I'm beginning to act out.) I feel like I'm legitimately going crazy, I hate this city, my dad and I are no longer on speaking terms and he was all I had, my boyfriend is all I've got left. He is my best friend and the love of my life, just last night before I discovered the cheating I suggested we say fuck all this, get married, and go take a road trip that's being offered to us to mellow out and have a cool adventure. To see that while I was thinking over marriage he was sneaking around is a huge hit to my self worth. I do not know how to move forward from here because he refuses to have a discussion, just tells me he doesn't care what I have to think or say, doesn't want to talk to me about it, and is so full of anger that I've never seen in him before.

I just feel extremely lost and have had a lot of suicidal thoughts and I don't know what to do to better my situation. Still jobless, still almost entirely alone, still across the country from my family, still hate my city, and now my boyfriend flipped from loving to hateful practically overnight. I just don't know.",21Jan2018,6
34,"The SO and I are looking to buy a new mattress and stumbled upon this new M1X mattress made by Bedgear. There are next to no online reviews so, even though it seemed like it could be a great product in the store, we are skeptical of how it will hold up in the long term. 

Has anybody here bought this product or any other from Bedgear? What are your thoughts and would you recommend?",21Jan2018,1
35,"Back story: Roughly 10 years ago, my mother had a one night stand with this guy she met at a nightclub whom she went to school with. He then recently has a child a few months prior and a girlfriend. My mother was and technically still is his mistress know he even has a son that’s about two years older than I. They’ve since had three kids together with only one who is alive but she has been in and out of hospitals her whole life. She’s five now. Literally getting a small cold can hospitalise her. My mother and him are in an on and off relationship but she insists that they’re not together and I’m basically just being a brat in this situation.

This is long and I’ll try my best to shorten it. Pardon the grammatical errors.

    For over 10 years, I’ve had to endure the way he has treated you. In the beginning, I was naively happing for you because YOU were happy about being in a relationship. I would watch you make him dinner when you weren’t in the first place even going to cook for us, set your bed and clean your room  so can be objectified and pleased, I’ve seen you give him hundreds of dollars expecting nothing in return while you, a single mother was struggling to make ends meet and was in food stamps as well as section 8 as soon as you turned 18. You’ve picked him up at your most inconvenience of time and wasted gas because he didn’t want to take public transportation (which includes walking since he lived up the street from his job) and his actual live in primary partner (they are not polyamorous, just fuckin’ retarded) which in her own words, fiancé(e) wouldn’t lend him the car they shared. I’ve seen you first hand allow me to sleep in the same bed as you after you’ve slept with him, I’ve seen you be hurt countless times and take him back only yet for him to come and break the foundation your child have tried to rebuild to retain order in their household because:
* He’s the father of your child(ren)
* You have needs your kids can’t fulfil
* You love him
* Etc 
And so on with your bullshit excuses.  I have seen myself be pushed to the side to account for your boyfriend and last three children. The two dead ones I couldn’t care less about. But alas, he’s back and claims he wants to be in your and my little sisters life.
    Last year, I think it was around December 9th he was here speaking to you and you guys began to bicker. I must admit, I was out of line for he way I spoke to him but I will never apologise because after all those years I finally said, “Fuck you! Get out of my house!” And how’d I celebrate? I went to the bathroom and cried while you called everyone on your contact list to tell them. But what he said to me during this argument was fucked up. He continuously threw in my face that I’m a little girl, that I need to stay in my place, that the home we were in is t mine and I pay none of the bills. Understandable. However, he also said, “You probably can’t even clean yourself properly.” Now, I may be overreacting but that’s a very perverted comment especially as an adult who is 38 and me barely considered a teenager, 14. So now, he’s a deadbeat and pedophile in my eyes. The guy who has gone almost a whole day in the home I live in without even questioning his daughters whereabouts. The guy who held you back from picking me up from school when we live too far away. The guy who says he can’t function properly without being high on marijuana. The guy that blames all his issues on his mother leaving him at 18 and “the white man”. Never taking accountability for his own fuck ups. The guy that gets whatever he wants from you. Whether it be sex, money, food, shelter, and your car. Remember the time he took your car for almost a day and didn’t inform you of his whereabouts? Remember when he got jumped by those gang members and came to our house potentially putting everyone in the house at risk because they were following him? But whatever, we didn’t die. Oh and hey! Do you also remember he smokes in our house after everyone but you tells him to stop because his daughter has lung disease? No? Okay, that’s fine. 
    I don’t think you understand that for me as basically the youngest child that has been there through everything to witness you being abused by my father and emotionally abused by hers (my younger sister). In all honesty, it makes me feel angry and resentful because you fail to see how your choices as my only parent and basically mentor in my l fe affect me emotionally.but most of all, I’m scared. I’m scared that you won’t be able to handle him leaving you one day or you get pregnant again just to miscarry and take your life like you openly admit to thinking about constantly. I’ve come so close many times to you dying like when you had your stroke two years ago while driving, the labor complications, and my dad almost killing you when you guys were together, and you attempting to take your life. I’m aware that he won’t be leaving the picture anytime soon (unless he chooses to take another parenting vacation) and I don’t necessarily want him to. I don’t like him, but I do want my little sister to have a “Dad”. Lately, My grades and gpa are dropping (I had a 4.0 and now it’s like 2.4) because I’m really stressed out worrying about her well being and I bottle up my emotions so when I do express myself I get in trouble. I understand what some people might think:
* That I’m too young to understand her situation.
* Stay out of her business, this has nothing to do with you.
* Suck it up and stop being a brat.
* She’s not your responsibility.
* She has the right to be in a relationship and that I may not like it but need to respect and tolerate it.
* Etc
I acknowledge all of that but it’s hard to do all those things and keep them in mind whereas if she’s having a bad day, everyone has to as well. I also don’t try to deny her rights to be in a relationship because I want her to, I want her to be happy. The issue is him. I get that I’m a child and don’t have any choice over anything and apparently I lack cognitive abilities according to some people I’ve consulted with. So my options are:
a) suck it up and stop being a brat.
b) live with my dad, his gf who hates me and his kids who love me.
c) encourage my mother to find a new boyfriend 
d) wait to turn 18 and just leave after graduation and never speak to my family again. (Completely irrational but it’s an option)
e) distance and detach myself from the situation and give up because she’s never going to change or understand.
    It may seem like I come from a broken home, but I don’t. I get almost everything I ask for which isn’t much because I know money is tight. It all boils down to me basically not getting what I really want which is for my mother to drop him. Stop being with him and be happy in another stable relationship where the guy or whatever they claim to be actually loves and cares for her, her needs, and respects her kids. She’s always complaining but never does anything to fix it. It’s always just lies and broken promises with her.
    In conclusion, I feel like I grew up faster than I should of and I take on adult problems because no one is trying to solve them. 

Tl;dr 14 year old high school brat who hates her moms boyfriend feels neglected and unloved because her mother keeps taking her boyfriend back after he repeatedly fucks her over and pushes the brat to the side resulting in her working her ass off in school to get away from this bullshit and feeling depressed because she’s not getting her way. Yet still failing to redirect her anger to something positive.

37,"My sister has always had little discipline. She now got her phone taken away and I had to help get her off of our mother when she took her phone away. 

Every time my sister does get in trouble she goes to the extremes - she claims abuse when my mom doesn't lay a hand on her and does a million things for her, she says she's running away, she gets obnoxious and after my mom disciplines her, she sits out their and continuously puts our mom down - insulting her, calling her names, all kinds of things.


They're sitting out there arguing, my sister broke my moms door and my sister didn't stop following her until my mom threatened to break her phone with a hammer. That is the only way they stopped moving throughout the house. They're not stopping and my sister thinks she's invincible - she's threatening to just walk out the house and its 9pm at night. 

She never understands she's wrong, we do so much in terms of helping her and she claims the worst life possible the second she gets in trouble, like she's trying to guilt my mother into not punishing her. She's saying she wont go to school now and all types of wild stuff..


What should my mom do?

39,"Hey. 

I’m a college student at a great engineering school. I previously got a fake ID charge and alcohol possession charge (technically twice, once through the school once in the legal system) and promptly was put on deferred suspension. 

Well last night, my dumbass decides to use the fake ID again and I get caught loading the beer into my book bag. I have been charged with fake ID and alcohol possesion again. My previous charge was dropped. However, because of my deferred suspension status, once this gets reported to the school I will be suspended. 

I’m an out of state resident, so I pay nominally more. However, I do have a scholarship. I believe the scholarship will be revoked once I’m suspended. And because of that, it’s no longer economically feasible to go to my school. So essentially this suspension will turn into a expulsion. 

I plan on talking to an advisor and RA just so I can be sure that this is the case. 

I will probably just drop out now so that, first off, the suspension won’t get reported, and second, so I can save myself money. 

Back at home, my parents say they’ll keep me for a month then I’m out to get my affairs in order. I have no idea where to start. I believe I will succeed in life, simply because I’m good at a job that’s highly touted (programming) and I have SOME connections in that field. My issue is just starting off. I haven’t a clue what to do. I don’t know what to even do. 

Any advice is seriously appreciated.

40,"I'll try my best to keep it brief. I just had a, very, casual interview today for what's listed as an internship, but more of a ""we'll hire you as needed"" job for a small Defense Contractor company. I'm a junior computer science major at my college. Interview went well and I have a really good chance for the position according the guy who interviewed me. However, I feel it's a lot and it's causing unneeded anxiety. Out of everything the guy told me the company wants to do over the next 1-3 years, I really only feel I have the ability to do one, maybe two of them. I lack any database experience that he is looking for and cannot for the life of me remember how to write up a data flow diagram, let alone one big enough for the project he wants, and I can't do any modeling or simulation. Yet he felt I could be a good fit.

I'd be working alone, no team, and presumable from home in my on campus apartment other than the times I would meet directly with him. But he would want me to start during my current semester, and I just don't feel I have the time. Both my girlfriend and mother agreed that quitting my current job at our on campus IT desk would help with time (but I really don't think so since it only frees up the early mornings when I work and the occasion afternoon hours between classes on Tuesday). 

However, discussing this with my mother has brought up a good point. I really only knew that after graduating, I only wanted to do software engineering, but it doesn't seem like there are many jobs looking for that right now (at least that I can find so far). She stated that every job requires learning something at the start, which is not wrong, but I still feel worried about potentially taking this job with the contractor. I can't even really describe what it feels like expect for maybe confusion, maybe self doubt? I just really don't want to be afraid to take any new job opportunity I get because I'm afraid I don't have the knowledge.",21Jan2018,3

42,"Over the last few weeks and months I got to know somebody I really like. In the beginning it wasn’t anything serious, we were just fooling around, having sex.

That information hurt me a little but I didn’t want to stop seeing him anyway. By now, things between us got really serious. He asked if I would want to try having a relationship with him despite all that. I really really like him and I actually did want to start a relationship with him but I don’t quite know how to handle the situation with him moving away since we both agreed that a long distance relationship wouldn’t work for either one of us. So basically we’re having some beautiful months from now on and then we’ll have to break up. I don’t really know what to do about it since I’m a person who believes that in the end we only regret the things we didn’t do, so I don’t want breaking up with him right now and not seeing him anymore to be an option. But on the other side I know that I am a person who is really bad at saying goodbye and it would hurt me pretty badly to break up with him when the time has come. I can’t really wrap my mind around the thought that in the future he isn’t going to be here which makes it difficult and somehow painful to open up to him completely.

46,"I had considered myself bicurious for some time and always considered having a same sex encounter with someone to see if I'd like it. I never acted on it until recently though, as I come from a fairly conservative and religious family, and the thought of them finding out always scared me enough not to follow through. 

Recently though I decided to put my fears away and give it a try. So I set my Tinder to search for males as well. I matched with this guy and we got to talking, he said he was also bicurious, so eventually we met and hooked up. 

I kinda enjoyed the first encounter so a few weeks later (and a few days ago) we had a second. The second one however, I felt I really didnt enjoy and decided that maybe sex with a guy wasnt for me.

Today he messaged me, and I was feeling too anxious to respond so I thought Id put it off until I felt comfortable enough to deal with it. After a couple hours he started getting pretty pushy about me having to reply to him which didnt make me any less anxious. 

At some point he asked why I was ignoring him and if it is because he was ""friends with some of your family members"". At this point I was confused and alarmed so I replied and asked what he meant by that. He said, ""Well you look just like [insert my brother's and my sister's name here], Im friends with them. I didnt wanna say anything.""

I didn't make him aware of it, but suddenly my anxiety levels shot through the damn roof. I just apologised for not replying to him sooner, said I was currently in a bad space atm and will be away for a while. We wished each other well and that was that.

I searched him up on facebook, and saw that he was infact friends with my brother, my sister, my sister-in-law, and a handful of other mutual friends. I am absolutely terrified and paranoid about anyone finding out about this and I dont know what to do. 

He hasnt given me any indication that he'd tell anyone, and this is probably me just being paranoid, but I've been bullied and blackmailed in the past enough to the point that I can't deal with being in a situation like this. What do I do? How do I play this if he texts me again soon?

We both have eachother added on Snapchat and we look at eachothers stories, but he didn't follow me back on Instagram (I don't think it means much though since we didn't even view eachothers stories at the time I followed him). I've replied to his story once and he replied back, but I didn't say anything after that. He seems really cool (and my friend who used to go to school with him told me he was asexual, I am as well, so I'd love to finally know someone like me), and his friends also seem really neat. I've been trying to get to know his friends better since we share classes, but I'm not great with talking to new people. How do you think I should go about talking to him since we don't have any classes together? Now that we have eachother added on snap I catch him looking at me a lot more in passing periods, so at least I know I'm on his radar now. Some of my friends want to merge our friend group with his. Basically they are just the boy version of or group haha, but that also means both groups are socially awkward. It's pretty hard for me to just go up and talk to people so I feel like I'll always want to talk, but I never will.  My friend has cards against humanity in her backpack at all times, so I suggested we try to get them to play with us  at lunch. Is that a good idea? Everyday I go to school telling myself ""Today will be the day I'll say something"" but I never do. Any advice would be suuuuper appreciated! ",21Jan2018,8

69,"Hi there!

I've been studying abroad in Japan for almost five months now this time (I also studied abroad here freshman year due to scholarships and have been here for an internship as well) and am really loving it. While Japan has it's problems, none of them hold a candle to what I've faced in America and I've basically enjoyed every day I've been here. In fact, the longer I stay here and the better my Japanese becomes, I increasingly find little waiting for me back in America except for my boyfriend. 

He was my friend during an especially hard time in my life and shortly after we got together. It's been over a year since then, and even though we've been long distance for awhile we'll be visiting each other soon. I've never really felt anything close to love before due to those previous awful experiences, however with him I think it's different. On top of that he's graduating from a top school and going to grad school at that same top school.... I don't know if I'll find someone as kind and talented as he is again. The thing is, he doesn't know Japanese at all and definitely doesn't want to live there (he'll probably be living it up in Silicon Valley or something haha) so if I do decide to live there, I'd have to go without him. I do have a year or so to think on this (that's when we both graduate, me undergrad and him grad), but they way it's going we're becoming fairly serious. 

Do I live in the place I think I belong or stay with the kindest person I've ever met? Of course this is something best to decide for myself, but while there's time to plan for the future it'd be really appreciated to have some input from you all. This isn't as serious as some of the other posts, but thank you very much for reading!!

72,"So I am 13 and when I was a child I gave no fucks about my teeth. I tried to avoid brushing them but then when I turned 12, I kept brushing it at night all the time. They are really yellow and I have been insecure about them. Yesterday, I went to the dentist for the first time. They did this check up thing and when they were looking into my teeth, they saw that I had a stone. They took it out as it wasn't that big. They did say that there was a chance it would come back again and to tell them if it did. Well, last night I was laying in bed and texting a friend. She started saying that she had a chest pain and she claimed that she felt like something was wrong with me. So I thought that maybe her feeling was true and that maybe a little stone came back. So I started feeling under my tongue a bit and came with a little hard thing. I didn't know if that was supposed to be there because I never had done that before and focused on what was there and what wasn't. Since everyone was asleep, I decided to just put it off til later. This afternoon when we were at a store, I remembered about the little ball under my tongue and talked to my sister about it. When she looked under my tongue, she saw the little stone. She then told my mom about it. My mom then said that we already have a dentist appointment next month but that she might call them and a doctor but she wasn't too sure yet.

No offense intended - but I just wanted some inputs on what others did when they learned of step siblings. 
Did you talk to them or just look them up on social media? Did they talk to you? Or do people just act like their step siblings don’t exist to them?(I’ve never met mine, and I’m not sure they know I exist— I’m not sure my dad has told these kids of my existence lmaooo) 

I’m kinda rambling, and I apologize! I just needed input from others.. this is my first time dealing with this.

76,"I got a text today from my old college roommate and one-time close friend. He’s trying to find a new job that doesn’t pay minimum wage, but the catch is that he’s still on probation.

He went to white collar prison for some tax related felony. The short version of the story is that his family had been doing illegal shit and when the IRS came down on them he had been the head of the company for about a year at the time. I and another friend had been working for his company at the time, and we both smelled something fishy and told him about it before we both left for better paying positions elsewhere (we were fresh out of college then and only had entry level positions). We are pretty sure from what we’ve heard of the case and his account of events that his family knew they had overcooked the books and the card house was going to come down eventually, so they put him up as the scapegoat. 

Now on to the current problem. I am well respected at my company. I have a lot of varying responsibilities and my word is trusted in many different matters. I worked with this aforementioned friend when we were young adults, and I wasn’t impressed with his work ethic. He was constantly changing jobs, as well as calling off a lot, and would always give a reason why the unfair situations and events led him to seek new employment. 

That being said, after returning from prison I have seen him a few times, and his “too good for this shit” demeanor seems to have been wiped out, and he’s been at his current gas station job for a few years. 

Upon his inquiry into possible positions, I’ve told him that there are some publicly listed entry positions at my work and that he should apply, but how far should I go to help him? Do I trust that if I give my word and vouch for him he will rise to the occasion and do a good job? He did give me only a grunt position even though he knew that I had been in school for many years in several areas of study before dropping out (indeed I was retroactively awarded an associates degree later) though he was the head of the company and could have pulled the strings to give me a higher salary job. 

At the same time I believe he was railroaded and really do want to see him succeed and get this whole felon thing behind him. 

I just don’t know what kind of jeopardy I might put my career/status in if I go in and vouch for him on this. 

Thanks in advance for your help. ",21Jan2018,1

From what my inexperienced clueless mind can gather chocolates, a dinner date, and maybe a small gift are the way to go. Is that about right? I shouldn't get too elaborate for such a young relationship, I imagine. Maybe like a ~30 dollar gift?

86,"Hello. I am a junior in high school, and I do not like my current life. My parents are the type that believe in work only. So for them, I should be only doing schoolwork and reading everytime they see me. Any sort of enjoyment of ones self should be immediately cut out and replaced with work. I enjoy playing soccer and videogames. I used to be part of a club team and we were really good, winning tournaments, having fun, and were gettig to the point where college scouts were scouting us. At this time, my grades were slipping a bit and I got a D in math. Although this was a one-time thing, my dad decided to call my aunt in New York for advice and she said to take me out of soccer, so they fucking did. Soccer was my life, and I was having so much fun and reaping educational and financial reards from it. I play soccer for my school now, but I have seriously regressed in my talent and I don’t feel like I have the same chance to go pro now as I did before. Anytime I confront my parents about this, they blame it on me for getting one D that was a B by thr tume the semester ended. That shit pisses me off to no end.

After I was withdrawn from soccer, I picked up videogames, in particular Team Fortress 2. Soon, I became very good at it and was doing it competitively and was making a name for myself in the scene. As soon as my Dad found out I was playing videogames, he flipped his shit saying how I was “too old to be playing” and was “a waste of time”, even though I was alao making maps for people to play on and designing my own configs ro help the game run smoother, things that I feel are educational. I told him this and he doesn’t give a shit. Recently I built my own computer and when he saw me making a config for TF2 he dliooed his shit again, going on about how I “wasted” money to only be playing video games and how I again was too old for it. My mom secretly supported me due to the “in-depth” stuff I was doing in TF2 and Overwatch’s competitive scene but when she saw my Dad flip out she went on and stabbed me in the back and started also yelling at me. Another thing that my dad likes to do is note that he’a never seen me with a book in my hand. He works all day and I’m usually done with my homework and what I assign myself to read by the time he gets back home (I love reading, but I can’t do too much in one sitting or I get disinterested in what I’m reading and never want to pick it up again). I’m starting to really hate the time when he walks into the door because he starts to sweet-talk my sister (both parents “prefer” her over me because she gets good grades even though her teachers let her take tests home and post answers to homework online) and then wears himself out berating me often while eating.


Since I can barely enjoy my hobbies, the only thing left for me to do is do good in school. I try my hardest but I often burn out very quickly and this results in me missing many homework assignments at a time even though I record tem all in a planner issues by the school at the beginning of the year, being generally tired, and just having no zest for life. This reflects in my grades, which are starting to become average at best no matter how long I study or how hard I try. Friends have distanced themselves from me due to my radical change in behavior. Due to my grades slumping, I lost a two-year free scholarship to any school of my choice. My mom hasn’t told my dad because he would probably murder me on the spot if he found out. I am still in contention for a better four year scholarship to any school in my home state, though.


Due to these circumstances, anytime I try to have a conversation with my parents they always try to steer the comversation towards my grades or in my mom’s case, my lost scholarship. It’s become a get-out-of-jail-free card for them when I confront them about the frequent bullshit they try to pull, which has been becoming more and more frequent. Example:

Mom: Hey throwaway you have to go to your Dad’s office to work this weekend.

Me: But I planned to go to the park to play soccer with my friends two weeks ago.

Mom: I don’t care what you planned you will be going to the office. People with shit grades don’t deserve to have plans in this house.

Dad, out of nowhere: Yeah boy you had better come with me to get some job experience. You probably won’t be going to college anyways.


I get constant verbal abuse from them about my grades or how hibbies come after homework day in and day out. If this wasn’t enough, my entire church thinks I’m some kind of genius. When I was younger I was extremely good at school and extremely good at soccer. My parents would miss no opportunity to brag about me. Everyone in the church expects me to go straight to college and get a great job and single-handedly pay the almost $300,000 in debt that they have ammassed. Even after my grades dropped off they are maintaining this masquerade. If that wasn’t bad enough my parents are immigrants. They work vital jobs and pay their taxes but they came illegally and were relying on TPS to stay in the U.S., but now that the orange bastard for a president folded it, the pressure is all on me to get good grades as a requirement for my parents to stay in this country (yes, Trump called their country a shithole). 

I feel as if I do not get into a great college after high school or no college at all, my life is essentially over at that point. Next year is my senior yeae and I can’t even bring myself to enjoy it because after that I’m either in college or kicked out of the house with no place to go. Even the thought of not getting into a decent college after high school makes me hyperventilate and causes my throat to close. It’s slowly becoming a reality with my current grades. I think the only shot I have of getting into college at this point is my prowess in writing, which I scored a 90th percentile in in my last PSAT test.


Guys, all I want to do is enjoy my fucking hobbies, do well in school again, and go into a good college and eventually into the professional soccer scene.

So my main problem is, I **hate** working, which may sound stupid but I really do.

I’m 16 years old as of right now and work for like 4 months at a store, 8 hours a week, which isn’t even that much but I hate the ‘cleaning’ stuff at the end.

Now looking at this, I have NO ‘talents’ to begin with.

A few months and I’m ready to do my exams (and HOPEFULLY not fail) and I need to choose my ‘main’ thing I want to study.

The thing I do currently is ‘building’ etc etc, which isn’t even interesting but hey, choose it because it interested me. So basically those 2 years have been a complete waste for now.

I really have NO idea what I want to be later on and I need to know WITHIN a few months or else I have to pick up one random thing and probably think that it doesn’t fit, and waste a WHOLE year.

My only thing is I am decent in  ‘mapping’ and ‘scripting’

I’ve been making my own ‘mods’ in a horror game and have VERY creative map idea’s and lay outs.

I LOVE making maps, and as you guessed it, I would love to have a job of making maps.

So my only problem is, should I invest later on when I get the money in a powerfull pc and work on like ‘unrel engine’ on making maps and stuff, or what?

I know for a fact that I can also choose the direction of ‘map designer’ as a shool thing but IMO i’ve heard ALOT of how difficulty coding is, especially in college, and even know alot of peopel that thought the same but failed and actually wasted 2 full years.

So what do I do?
What do I do with my life, learning is something difficult for me because I REALLY can not concentrate no matter what, if I try to learn right now I’m just thinking about every stupid shit I can, even what i’m gonna do tomorrow.

I just don’t know what to do, I feel like my future is going to be something bad...

On the other hand, if any of you know ‘outlast’ that horror game, looking at the maps, I can do that, like if The makers of outlast actually want me to work on some maps I would do it like right now, I have the skill for that, but it just sucks that it isn’t as easy to enter.

But why don't I have the right to be left the fuck alone? I'm not harassing him, I'm not begging him for anything. I just don't want him or his new family around.

In my world they don't exist. When we're in he same room I prefer to think of him as a shadow I don't see. I don't hate him. I don't care about him. He doesn't matter to me. 

Why is he entitled to come to my events but not obligated to raise me 30 days out of the month?

Why should I care that I hurt his feelings by ignoring him when he hurt mine by leaving even when I was crying and begging him not too?

If he cared so much, why didn't he come to MY house to see me instead of separating me from my mother every other weekend.

He replaced my mother and me with a new wife and kids. I replaced him with my stepfather. But only I'm wrong???

HIS FEELINGS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT FUCKING MATTER. I never talk about the divorce because I know they don't care. BUT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO COPE HOWEVER I PLEASE. 

I don't know how to make myself heard. I uninvited my grandparents from my graduation when they threatened not to come if I didn't invite my dad. They clearly see I'm not bluffing but they persist!! 

It's not their business but I can't make them see that!

93,"Today while at lunch I received a call from my mom. 

My grandma was being life flighted to Shadyside Hospital in Pittsburgh and would be in the ICU. 
She was unconscious, severely dehydrated and starting kidney issues. 

I have the opportunity of driving 2 hours to the hospital tomorrow (Sunday) to be with my other family while they sit in the hospital room while my grandma is unconscious and then drive home for work on Monday. 

I have been preparing for this for years now. My grandmother has gad 3 different cancers: breast, lung and brain. She had been in multiple different nursing homes over the last 8 years. 
So I’ve come to terms more or less with it. 

My question is, am I wrong for not wanting to drive out there tomorrow? 
I do not want to be in a room really with all the family being gloomy and upsetting as she is still unconscious and has been for 12 hours. 
And I feel that if I don’t go I have the optimism that she will get better to see her again. 

I also am getting married in 2 weeks and really don’t know how to cope right now. 

Thank you for any insight. ",21Jan2018,2
94,"My wife told me tonight that she was raped by her high school music teacher while she was in high school, over ten years ago. Over a period of 3 months. I don't know what to do. My wife doesn't want to do anything because the rapist has kids and she doesn't want to ruin his life. He is still a teacher. I want to threaten him to make him quit, so that he isn't in a position to do this to other girls, which he, very likely, is still doing. Should I just be supportive and wait til she comes around to filing a complaint, or should I start covertly trying to get him to quit without telling my wife? Before me, she only ever told one person, her boyfriend at the time, who didn't believe her. Canada, so no statute of limitations, my wife would definitely be a reliable witness in court if I was able to convince her to tell the police and press charges.",21Jan2018,1

96,"Hello, (sorry for the wall of text)

I am planning (and have been planning) a career change. In the mean time, I held a sales clerk position at a local shop. The day before heading in for a scheduled test I needed to complete, one which I had informed and asked the day off for, I was abruptly fired by my manager. There had been high turn-over in the past three months, many employees walking out due to issues with this manager.

This struck me odd since it seemed random due to my lack of any problems while working there. I was the ""man friday"" of the place, often opening by myself or closing by myself, and more often than not standing in when my manager took vacations. The important detail here is his reasoning for terminating me was that he had received *multiple* customer complaints via email about me that he had never mentioned before. I only found out when he approached me mid-shift, in-front of everyone, and asked for my keys and told me to leave. He seemed hopeful that I would break down or argue with him. I just left.

My main concern is with my new job. I had taken the test, successfully, but they require past employment information and since working at that store had been my first job, I am obligated to provide it. This concerns me since my manager is very, very toxic about past employees and I have no doubt he will be the same about me. I am terrified he will say something to ruin my chances since he is well aware of my plans for it. This may sound dramatic, but I assure you I am not going too far out by being concerned by this. 

Should I be? Is there anything I can do or say to preface this to my new employers before they contact him? I would really appreciate some insight or general advice on this. ",21Jan2018,1

He says you ignored me and i said yes i did but i explained why there was reason and even after this he carried giving me abuse calling me so i thought i am not just going take his shit so i gave him alot of abuse back which in my eyes is fair, But that is not the worst part i couldent really care about him calling me but he starts calling my family who he has never met, His own daughter my GF ugly dumb for being with me so at this point i had enough so i ask for his number he gave it me and i rang the cunt and as soon as he picked up the phone guess what? his words where slurred and you couldent really understand what he was saying i knew he was drinking again so clealry he has lied to me and my GF and her mother that he dont drink, So the next day i go to my GF house show her family all the messages and now my GF dont want nothing to do with him and neither does my GF mother, after this my GF father does not message for weeks and weeks then he messages again saying im coming for you and alot of shit like that giving me aload of abuse once again so i gave him my adress he promised he was coming 2 weeks ago and this weekend and he has not shown up just shows what kind of a man he is, He is still a alcoholic and to me he clealry has some mental issues to start someone because they dident respond to message in the week there uncle died of cancer and to call his own blood his own daughter ugly and dumb, It makes me so mad i really want to go to his house and kick the living shit out of him!!

99,"I need to find a new system for my life. I'll explain it as clearly as possible, In my minds there are two worlds, I will call it world A and world B. World A represent a first world country mindset such as academic and communication, also it has same traits as B; Knowledge, IQ, Experiment, nerd and achievement. World B mainly represent Physical Strength and appearance. World B value Money than Knowledge, EQ than IQ, Experience than Experiment, Cool than nerd, Family than Achievement. Here's the yin and yang kicks in, A use knowledge to get money and B use money to pay for knowledge. A will become more of EQ person and B may not gains IQ. A prefer to do experiment rather than B want to experience it. A will become cool stereotype person overtime and B misunderstood the concept of being nice. A and B are values family more than anything, but world B would sacrifice a lifetime for a temporary solution. I may not describe it clear enough because the world we live in is more complicate than what I've mentioned. How can can find a right path for both world? I'll called it world C. I understand there is no perfect solution but I'll take my chance to create a world that balance A and B to the acceptable portions.

101,"tldr - my best friend got really mad about my boyfriend reading a very personal google doc he sent me and I've been having nightmares and panic attacks about it ever since

So longish story. I hooked up with my best friend while my boyfriend and I were on a break, was a little more personal than what I typically describe a hook up as but generally a hook up kinda thing. After that my boyfriend and I got back together I was very open about what happened and we've done a lot of work since to move past everything and we're now at a really great place with our relationship. 

My best friend and I aren't really. Recently he's been really down with money problems and things as well as he's very introverted and I'm his real only close friend and us hooking up kind of fucked him over a little and now he ""can't get over me"", which isn't really great for a friendship being that he gets upset when I talk about my boyfriend. 

So back to the main part, the other night when I was trying to sort through stuff with him he sent me a google doc about his feelings at the moment (basically how much I hurt him by getting back together with my boyfriend, can't get over me, really down). My boyfriend saw it. I went for a drive with my best friend around town to talk more about he doc and told him my boyfriend knew. He wen't off his nut and I was kind of scared he would hit me. 

Ever since I've been having nightmares and panic attacks (like 2 or 3 bad ones a day as opposed to my normal 2 or 3 a month) about what he might do. We've been arguing a lot because I've been asking for space so we can both sort out some stuff and get back to being really good friends without too many harmful remnants of the hook up. He's also said how vengeful he is before all this happened when we talked about other stuff and now I'm kinda scared for when my boyfriend goes back to see his family (5 hours away) for a weekend coming up. I don't have very many friends here and none that live overly close by. I just don't quite know what to do :/",21Jan2018,3
102,"sorry if there are text mistakes im just trying to get this over with

i just wanted to come on here to talk because i dont know where else to go so anyone just please listen ..

i dont really know where to start but im 17 yo and im very depressed because im home schooled and i hate it the only reason im home schooled is because i had bad grades my freshman year of high school and i was failing 3 classes so my mom and dad decided to pull me out in the middle of the year to fix my grades but i repeatedly told them i didn't want to be home schooled because i didn't really have close friends or alot of friends at school some days i would eat by myself at lunch and not talk to anyone but thats besides the point but anyway i knew if i was home schooled i would loose them because like i said they weren't really friends more like acquaintances that i was around so i would't look like a loser with no friends, so we would not talk on social media and stuff like that . but like i knew i would have zero friends and be lonely and i knew i wouldnt do work because i dont work well on my own i work better with help  so i told them it wasnt the best for me but like parents  always do my needs were ignored so when it was time to enroll me in home school they took MONTHS to do so  so that put me behind even more then i didnt start school untill the next school year i left in december didnt start untill october thats almost a full year out of school so now at that point i was way more behind than the 3 classes i failed but then the work they gave me when i finally stated was very overwhelming and i barley knew what to do and they acted like it was my fault the teacher i have for my homeschooling sucks and doesn't care if i pass or fail fast forward now and im supposed to be a junior in hs (11th) and just now barley finishing my 9th grade assignments because this work is such slow pace and its hard for me because im dyslectic so i need the extra help regular school gives but they wont listen and now im so behind in school i couldn't go back if i wanted to ad it really sucks they fucked up my education mostly my mom though my dad tried to influence her to let me stay in school but she insisted and when i bring up me failing to her she has an oh well not my problem attitude  and its just like fuck you honestly but this isnt even the half of it. remember when i said i was scared of leaving school because i didn't wanna be lonely well guess what all my predictions happened .. i haven't talked to anyone from my school since i left like 2 years ago.. of course i occasionally get a text  from someone asking why i left school but that died down after a few months . i have a friend that I've known since middle school that lives by me and is also home schooled and shes WAY more behind than me so i dont feel as bad about me basically being forced to be a high school drop out  but i feel like when i talk to her i feel like a bother i dont know how to explain it but i feel like i dont belong in middle school we had such a large friend group i wouldnt say i was popular but i knew alot of people you know i was so happy and not a care in the world until highschool all my friends went to one school while me and only me went to a different one so me and those friends grew apart of course but just thinking of how happy i was makes me sad now because i never would have thought id be so miserable now ... in my freshman year is when my dad lost his job which he made alot of money from my mom is sick so she is a stay at home mom so it was a big changed we went from 16k a month in our house hold to 0 a month my moms a big shopper also .. and we live in california so you know its not cheap living cost .the first year we had money saved up so we had no worries about paying bills ect but that time money started getting tight and my dad couldnt find a job because he didnt go to college so its harder for him and in the area i live its not many jobs unless you go to L.A county but thats 1 hour away and thats not including traffic so we had like no money and some days we didnt have alot of food we couldnt pay bills or for my moms medicine because she very sick  which stressed me out because like im sitting and watching this all happen but my dad recently got a new job and its not as much but its something and this new job is out of state and i feel like my whole life ive been blind to the truth about me family my moms an alcoholic and i dont see how i never noticed and this is WHY she has all these health problems i never noticed untill 4 months ago when i noticed she always has alcohol in her bed room when i was younger i thought it was because my sister was little and could get into it so she was cautious but no.. shes always drunk in the moring, afternoon, night  and i know its been going on for a long time because i have a vivid memory from when i was in the second grade her having alcohol and spilling it in the bed and my dad yelling at her saying if she keep doing this he would leave her and me being confused on why my dad would leave her just by spilling water in the bed but now i understand it wasn't water .. and if its been going on for this long how could i not notice i feel like im rambling and nun if this makes sense im sorry  ... i hate it when she drinks because shes sloppy and its disgusting . she picks on me and says fucked up things to me we always argue and once i slipped up and told her shes a stupid drunk and she hit me and told me to stay in a childs place . we fight sometimes to and i mean fist fight but shes not strong at all so its mostly me holding her down .. i dont like fighting with her and i dont hit her because shes my mom ! but i feel like i hate her because she never listens to me and its on purpose .. ill say one thing to her and shell treat my words insignificant and rush me along so im talking to slow hurry up ect so i dont talk to her unless sh e says something to me because im tired of fighting arguing i wanna live with my dad but i dont wanna leave california because i love it here but what would i be missing i have no friends no ones checking up on me why not go with him i love my dad but he has a very short temper so thats a con of going with him oh yeah moy mom and him are not separated just putting it out there but some times i wish they were so she could fend for heself oh did i mention i looked threw her phone months ago and found her texting a whole guy or should i say sexting and this man was NOT my father and she saw me and yelled at me that day i just couldnt get those text out of my mind i want to tell my dad but my mom is sick and she needs money for meds and i dont want him to leave her money less she needs her meds badly... and shes so smug about it i hear her on the phone all the time bragging about how my dad is superman because he takes care of her buying her gifts and giving her money whiles shes not faithful she even got him a superman themed ring and laughs about it ! she treats him like a joke its disgusting . i cant take her anymore i wanna leave but with what money what job am i gonna get without a hs education (thanks to her ) ... i feel so lonely i dont even have a mom to confide to not a friend it sucks so much sometimes i feel so alone that i just cant help but cry doesn't matter where i am in the store , in a car, in my room i just think about my life and feel the tears coming i cant help it im scared of what will happen after im done with high school i know my mos gonna

My skills and interests cross mathematics, science, and programming. I have no usable work experience in those areas.

The advice I am asking is where you think would be the safest bet to go with my A.A. My son will be born very soon, and I am simply worried about continuing past here.

- Do I get a part-time job for now, and transfer to a state university in the Fall? My A.A. should almost guarantee admission, and I can continue pursuing my degree.
 - I still don't know where I will live or what job I will have there, but this is a long-term pursuit towards a decent career.
- Do I move out-of-state with my family, where I will be able to live rent-free?
 - I no longer have to worry about food/housing/utilities, but I now have student loans to pay back. I also do not have a good enough history (GPA, enrollment) to get into out-of-state education on my own merit in the future.
 - In addition, where would I even try to get a job with a general education degree? The entire point of getting it was to transfer!

I live in California and am trying to attend University of Oregon; it's estimated to be about $15,000 a term.  Luckily I already have my associate's degree, so I only have to go for two years instead of four.  But still, it's so much.  I went to the school for a preview day thing and the majority of kids going there were from California as well.  Apparently a lot of Californians go there, but I just don't understand how with the cost??

Like I said, I'm a first gen, so my parents really didn't prepare me for this.  I have no college fund, but I have a 3.7 GPA (which I guess translates to a 3.8 at UO), so I was accepted into the school.  It's just, the money.

Of course I've filled out the FAFSA, but no luck.  My family isn't rich, we're basically just middle class.  So we're so average that my parents can't help much, but we're apparently well off enough to where we can't really get any help.  My only hope is scholarships, which I am working on, but it's very disheartening to think this might all be in vain.

116,"Hi so i've graduated from DP 2 (basically 12th Grade in IB board language) and now i'm going to be pursuing further education in the form of college.

However, I've been thinking about whether i really need to pursue further education for my career choice. I'm planning to go into film/video editing and from many articles and reddit posts that i've read, it doesn't seem really necessary to pursue a degree in the field that i'm going into. In the time that i'll be going into college, i could be focusing on trying to build up my portfolio and my knowledge on editing.

I'm a HUGE lover of editing, its basically my hobby these days, in my free time i'm usually on photoshop or making crappy memes using Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable in Sony Vegas and Photoshop as i've been using them for like 5 years now and i've only recently started learning Premiere but i've been getting the hang of it. 

A lot of posts on subreddits such as /r/Filmmakers have talked about whether a higher education is required and many people say that experience is more desired in the industry rather than a degree. I know that pursuing a degree might open up more options, but i feel that by starting now i could really build myself up and start making money doing what i love. My parents have pretty much completely turned against the idea of me not pursuing college but its my life and i'm old enough to decide what i want for my life at this point (18 years old).

119,"Without getting bogged down in the details, I've had several occasions with one passenger (now deceased) who put themselves, me (the driver), and potentially other motorists in serious or possibly fatal danger. It was a domestic violence situation, but I didn't really realize that, and didn't know what to do, so I... did nothing.

What might be an acceptable option in such a situation? What would a reasonable person do when faced with this sort of thing? (I don't anticipate getting into any such problem again, but still.)

The best thing I can think of (but I'm not sure if it's legal or morally right) is as follows:

* In an urban setting, pull over as soon as is safe (i.e. on a surface street, not a highway). If there is no significant weather or health hazard that means the passenger must remain in the car, give them their stuff and kick them out. If there is a hazard, demand that they move to the center of the back seat and keep their hands above their heads, visible in the rear-view mirror. Deliver them directly to a hospital or police department, or kick them out as soon as weather conditions improve.


* In a rural setting, similar to the above, pull over as soon as is safe, and demand that the passenger sit in the center back with their hands above their heads visible in the rear view mirror. Kick them out with their stuff at the nearest gas station, fast food restaurant, etc unless they must necessarily be delivered to a hospital or police station.

Hi everyone, I need your (100% honest) opinion here, I'm not gonna get mad if I get pushed down a bit, thats what I'm here to find out.

I'm 19 currently single and am sure that I'm gay. I know I am, I've been in a relationship with a girl before and whilst I appreciated her personality and we had a fairly strong bond, I didn't want her to feel like a part of our relationship was missing (wasn't sexually attracted) and her feeling down because of it. I told her discreetly and she said she understood 100% and that it would be best if we called it off (we still remain fairly close today.)

My opinion on this whole LGBT thing is that the reason there is such rejection is that people are trying to use their sexuality as something to be different. (Not that its inherently bad) but some people become uncomfortable around 'openly gay' people. In the sense that it starts to overwhelm their personal space.

Now I'm in the closet REAL BAD and hate it. I'm not feminine (not that its a bad thing, I wanna make that clear) and am just a normal blokey guy. I go to the pub with mates, have drinks, gone to a few parties and chilled with male colleagues. Essentialy I'm one of those people that you could never guess that I am gay (not that it matters anyway, its just my sexual preference.)

What do you think of a person like me? Right now if I 'came out' (again it doesnt matter) would you think differently of me? Be brutally honest, I would never 'hit' on any of my mates or anything like that, thats actually quite a disturbing thought.

Reason I'm asking is that I really need someone to love, and just appreciate without being obnoxious and pushing my attractions on other people
Idk what else to say, all help is appreciated. :)",21Jan2018,1

123,"I'm asking because obviously there's been upsurge in terrorist attacks in the last couple of years.

ISIS fighters returning or people still being inspired by them.

124,"So, I regret so much until now.  I'm a 14 year old girl living in a city in England. So, basically I lived in Korea for 4 years, US for 1 year, France for 6 years and moved to England when I was 10 (almost 11). I've lived here for 3 years now. I messes up high school(secondary school) life so much: it all started when I had a crush on a boy; now it's been almost a year since the incident and well last year his friends were very very nasty and mean and the majority of his class kind of as well. I don't think I can go on anymore becuse the boys in my class always try to find every single post and comment I say on Instagram and social media and they talk about it in a nasty way in their group chats and I can't help but feel self-conscious. This boy also can't stop calling me 'emojihead' and swearing at me and it really upsets me. Also, the boy I had a crush on really hates me. Also, I don't have a 'best friend' nd most of the time, I'm a loner and I don't relly hve tht great friends they're all slugg-ish and just dump all their social issues at me as if the world revolved around them and sometimes, I even skip meals so I can hang out with my friends who aren't even fun to hang out with because then, the boys in my class would be making fun of how I have no friends.
Also, there are no picture of me between the ages of 11 until now(14), mainly because I don't have a phone and not allowed one until 18. So I don't have anything to look back at. Also, my parents are so strict compared to others like they never let me to go out with my friends; I get their worries like I might get lost or raped or killed or attacked or gone but 99% of the time, these scenarios never happen and it's very uncommon! She just can't get over that so whenever I try to invite one of my friends over, she'll freak out and say 'no'. This is how I can't have a social life. 
I think this is mainly because I have Korean parents. 
Any advice on how to turn my life around?

I think the core of the problem is that I no longer have many friends.

Hence, I need to make new friends, but I genuinely don't know how to go about it after university. I would also like to find a girlfriend.


Whereas many factors in life are largely under your control (grades, success on the job, exercise etc.), meaningful relationships are inherently reliant on external factors, and I feel like I've hit a wall and can't move on no matter what I do.

It had to be me all time and she sometimes didn't respond. Also I had to look for her to hang out. I started to wonder if she liked me and started obsessing about it and her. I HAD to be with her.

135,"So basically my older brother, 30, 150kg, 6'2 and very wide, moved in with me about 6 months ago. He's been a hassle to my mum since he was a teenager. 

He drinks every day and has a gambling addiction but he does have a full time job (I'm not employed). The last place he was living at was a shithole. Mould allover his room and alcoholic flatmates, so my mother and I thought him moving in here would help with his situation. We thought maybe his living arrangements were making him depressed which is why he was drinking and gambling so much but he's continued the same behaviour here. 

When he moved in, I made a real effort to get his mind off of alcohol and gambling by trying to introduce new hobbies into his life. We found a computer for him and I thought him how to play League of Legends thinking he'd ditch drinking to play that. He ended up just drinking while playing which meant when he died, he threw a little tantrum and started screaming and banging his desk.

Next I tried to get him into play electronic darts with me. Problem is, the machines are at a bar which I know he'll use as an excuse to drink copious amounts. 

He also like to play narcissistic mind games with people which makes for a horrible flatmate. Anyway, the reason I haven't kicked him out already is cause my mother is worried about what he'll do to himself if he lives by himself. He has threatened to kill himself a few times in order to get what he wants from my mum (money usually) and has gone missing a few times. 

My flatmates and I have really had enough of his childish behaviour and our lease is nearly up at our apartment. We want to move into a 2 bedroom apartment and let my brother sort his own place out but my mums really worried about how he'll react. I don't know how to tell him because this guy is huge and always angry. To put it into perspective, he came 2nd in the strongman competition for my city (1.5 million people).

141,"This is going to be a long post because naturally it’s a bit complex and I want to give the right interpretation of this. Tl;dr at the bottom. Naturally I have certain biases because this issue revolves around me and I’ve only heard what my family has said.

I’m 21 years old, in university, on a full academic scholarship as CS major, and living on my own. I have had issues with depression, anxiety and abandonment that took control of my life at a very early age. (I was put in therapy at 8 or 9 for cutting my hands with knives, didn’t really understand what it meant at the time). I was a quiet kid with no siblings. I was the kid who thought his stuffed dog was the spiritual reincarnation of his dead dog lol.

 I have a very supportive family that loves me but my head falsely tells me that I’m the foreigner in the family. Anyway, not the point.

Before I was born, my mother had been dating a guy for three or four years. He had a one year old boy at the time. My mom got pregnant and my dad fell apart apparently. 

She told me the story of when she went to go get an ultrasound that he got so scared that he had to leave and left my mom at the doctors and my grandpa had to pick her up. Apparently my dad also had severe anxiety which leads me to think it might be partially a genetic thing.

Around this time, a friend of my mother had told her that she had seen my father hanging around at parties with another girl(s). He’d been cheating. I don’t know how bad it was or what happened from that situation. Nearly the same time as this she learned that he was a pretty big addict. Oxys, cocaine, definitely alcohol stuff like that I don’t know. (I also have an undying love for opiates that I must refuse morphine or painkillers whenever possible for fear of relapse)

They broke up after things clearly weren’t working. My mother told me that he said something along the lines of.. “It’s better for everyone if I don’t take part in his life.” My uncle, who was best friends with my father since high school and married my mother’s sister, said something like “man up and be a father or don’t ever talk to me again.” 

From this point I don’t really know what happened, but he didn’t see me be born and has never been in physical proximity of me as far as me or my family is aware. He lives in the city I grew up in so I often fantasize that we’ve probably bumped into each other before without knowing. lol

My mother married a man from her work when I was about six and he was great and I love him and I’m pretty sure he loves me, but he moved across the country when his job asked him to when I was in 8th grade. He was a step removed as a father figure for me, more like a really close uncle. We talk maybe once every two weeks via text now. One time in fourth grade I referred to him as “Dad” and it felt alien, perverse and embarrassing.

My mom never talked about my dad with me until I was 20 years old. I did not know any of the above info until a year ago. It was always a really hush hush topic in my family. I hadn’t even known his name. My mother asked me if I wanted to talk about him when I was younger (10 or 11) but something wayyyy deep inside me (that I still don’t understand) lead me to  developing this dreadful mash of anxiety and dread every-time he was brought up. I still get these cluster bombs of impending doom whenever I talk about him or someone says something about him. but it’s not as bad as it used to be as I gain more life experience. 

I learned from an early age that I have two half siblings, a 25 yr old brother and 15-16 year old sister. I’ve never met my brother and have only had one conversation over snapchat with my sister. He is presently in both of their lives, but I’m not really sure to what extent. I know my sister sees him on weekends at the least and that she thinks he’s a cool dad.

This is getting emotionally exhausting to write. But anyway, I have always been really upset that he could be in my brother’s and sister’s life but not mine. It’s awful really, it’s hard to think about. He’s always had the chance to reach out to me, so I don’t think its a case of my family trying to “protect” me by not allowing it.

I got really upset one night so I added my sister on snapchat and quizzed her about my dad, then asked for his phone number. She responded a day later with it after getting permission from her mom (and presumably my dad? Idk)

Since then I’ve gone through a heart wrenching breakup with my absolute best friend, who I had been using as support to talk about this issue for a while. I’ve lost most of my courage and I’m not sure if I’m mentally equipped to deal with it by myself. But on the other hand I feel that a lot of my problems stem from this situation. 

I suppose I’m afraid that he wants nothing to do with me and that meeting him will crush me because he doesn’t care or whatever.

Tl;dr: Never met my dad. He thought it was best to never be involved in my life. He has two other kids (one younger and one older than me) where he is an active part of their lives. I have his phone number but I’m extremely anxious/sad/hurt by the situation. Should I call him?",21Jan2018,6

144,"Hi guys. I'll try to keep this succinct.

I have a bad anxiety disorder, so I don't handle surprises, especially surprises about important life-altering things, well. So I tend to be an ""overplanner"" because it helps me feel like I have control over the situation. 

When my boyfriend and I had been together about a year and a half, we started talking about marriage, and I told him that while he didn't have to tell me the exact day he'd propose, it would help immensely if he could tell me when he'd propose by, so I could figure that into my over-planning nature. He agreed. On our third anniversary, he mentioned, in passing, he planned to propose before my birthday (8 months away). I accepted that. After the holidays and valentine's day passed without a proposal, I asked him if proposing by my birthday was still the plan. He said yes. 

After my birthday came and went, he told me he'd ""forgotten"", and had been planning the proposal for ""later this summer"". I accepted, and asked if he had a revised ""proposed by"" date, and he said ""christmas, just in case something comes up"". Well, Christmas has come and gone, and no proposal. 

It's gotten to the point that a lot of our friends are asking me if ""everything's okay"", because they'd assumed we'd be married by now. We're the only couple in our group of friends that isn't married, and now it's making me more anxious waiting and wondering.

I've tried talking to him about this, but he just says he doesn't want to feel pressured about proposing, which I get, but I don't want to feel like I'm wasting my time. How long do I wait for him to propose? At what point should I just cut my losses? I love him very much, and outside of this issue our relationship is wonderful. We work very well together. But this is a big deal and marriage is important to me.

TLDR: My boyfriend of 4 years set a date saying he'd ""propose by"" that date, he didn't, he gave me another date, and he didn't propose by then either. I haven't gotten a new date yet and I'm starting to freak out.",21Jan2018,0

I truly don’t know what to do.
I am a 29yr old female that has never (truly) fallen in love. I very rarely like anyone and even when I do it is either very toxic people or just something that I know one way or the other won’t work (even if its at a subconscious level)

The deepest desire of my heart is to have a family of my own. A faithful and loving partner that would challenge me and take care of me as well (as I would to him) 

However when I actually try to picture that with a concrete someone (even if its someone made up in my mind) it terrifies me. The idea of having one person for the rest of your life, terrifies me. It is so definitive, so... “this is it”. What if that person is not truly amazing? What if you meet someone better? Huge fear of missing out.

Even when my friends get engaged I keep thinking “my goodness, really? He/her? Are you sure? Because thats it, thats yOur “happily everafter” 

Now, I know... this is clear fear of commitment and inmaturity. But I would really like to know more in detail where and how this comes about! Because i have no idea how to address it! And I want to! I want to be able to love and settle down happily! Not in fear or always thinking that there might be something better right in the next corner.


The only time I ever was able to “pushed through” moreless through that was the one and only time I think ive ever been “in love” and I used quotations for that because it felt like love but I doubt it was. See, I subconsciously been doing this my whole life; I categorize people. Winners and losers. I do it with everyone, friends, acquitances, relatives, etc. Its like everyone has some sort of point counts in my mind, depending on looks, personality, social power (related to personality and can or cannot be related to social class too). When I date/see a guy, there is a point where I evaluate them in these terms... and most of them to me tilted to the “loser” side. The few that didnt, were actually the few that were not precisely the best influence (but were either attractive physically or personality/socially wise) and the one that I ever felt “in love” was somehow scoring “10” in all, he was a “winner” in my stupid mental categories.


I know, all this is immature, shallow, and terribly awful. I know all that and I want to change! I really do! But I need to know more of the nature of the beast to not only push a behavior change but also... work on the root of it all! If you have questions please ask!

162,"The situation: I'm in my twenties, and have a lot of experience serving throughout college and even post-college. I'm going back to school and had been looking for restaurant jobs around town with no luck. Finally I got an offer, but as a host with a promise to me moved to a server in the ""very, very"" near future. I wasn't really interested in hosting but desperate for a job, so I took it.

Of course, the second I accept that job I start hearing from restaurants I applied to over a month ago, offering me jobs as a server. I can't decide if I should stick with the job I just started or take the serving jobs now.

Here's what's making me want to stay: I love the managers and people at my current job, we vibe very well. It's in a beautiful location. It gets super busy in the summers and it's upscale so when you are serving, you can make good money.

What's making me want to leave: With the exception of Saturday nights and Sunday brunch, it's DEAD in the winter. Literally dead. So it's super boring and the days go slow. Plus, I hate hosting. It's boring and there's no money in it - plus I feel like I'm being underused, as I have a lot of serving experience and am stuck doing this job with 16/17 year olds. First they told me they'd have me serving by March, but yesterday when I talked it turned into by Easter. 

So should I jump into the void with a new restaurant job, or wait a couple months until I'm serving and can actually make decent money?",21Jan2018,1
163,"I've been with my current girlfriend for just over 12 months. Recently we've approached the subject of when we buy a house together. I'm 37 and have my own house with no mortgage (approx £150-£160k value) and earn approx £40,000 a year. She's 34 with about £50,000 equity in her house. She earns approx £25,000. The problem we see is how we do things fairly. Obviously we could both sell up and buy a new place with a £200,000 deposit and live with little or no mortgage. Hence me putting in 3x what she has and having to sell my already paid for house. I see keeping it as preferential. If we do this we basically have to take a new £200,000(ish) mortgage.

168,"Hello all,

I moved back to the East Coast last November after spending the year working in Oregon on a job contract. I work as a Registered Nurse. After having moved back, I quickly returned to a facility I had originally started out at. Here's where the issues arise.

The facility is no longer privately owned and is now run by a corporation that's running it into the ground for $$$

I was lied to when I had re-applied and was told that I wouldn't get any hours unless I picked up a full time position. This was a lie. I was seeking a per diem position for 3-4 days. This place is so fucking short staffed. The woman who is now the recruiter just fucking lied and still continues to lie to everyone.

I'm not going to air out any more grievances other than this place doesn't give a shit about the patients or the employees and I don't think it's worth hanging around.

I'm in the middle of interviewing for other positions and they might require me to start immediately. I know I should definitely have something lined up before leaving this spot and I think if I leave again, there's no coming back. But the problem is that I don't have the availability that I need to go interview at other positions as freely or I have to simply call out. I don't want to get fired for this.

I'm thinking of handing in my two weeks notice on Monday. I just dread coming in to work every day and feel like I should just spend my efforts towards finding something else. Should I just resign? I'm worried about burning bridges as some of the staff here are still genuinely sweet and caring but it's being ruined by a bunch of greedy and selfish fucking assholes (management and staff).",21Jan2018,3

I'm assuming she didn't mean to leave it behind, so I'm considering trying to get in touch with her and see if she wants it back.

One idea I had: if I come into contact with her, I would only offer the pictures/videos (and delete any sensitive data). I'm pretty confident that she doesn't need any of these bank statements, house purchasing documents, etc. And transferring that stuff would put her (and her deceased husband's identity) at risk for identity theft.

174,"I'm looking for advice on an issue that has been bugging me for several months now, and as I need to make a decision over the coming months I would really appreciated some advice.

I'm 28[M] and five years ago I graduted from University and like many others I found it difficult to get a job in the line of work I am interested in. So in the end, I landed a job but I had to move away from home in the process. 

Being an introvert I struggled for a good 6 or 7 months, I couldn't face the thought of doing anything outside of work. People suggest sports, groups, etc to meet new people. Instead I would just go to work, go home, sleep and then rinse and repeat the next day.

Fortunately I started to make friends through work and all of a sudden life just changed. I became best friends with a guy at work and it honestly made everything better. We would go travelling, partying, etc and both of our friendship circles grew through each other.

This was up until about 18 months ago when another trip was booked. I won't go into detail but it ended up with my so called 'friend' owing me money. I waited months and the excuses were continous. In the end, he turned around and told me that he didn't owe me anything (even though he had acknowledged it several times), and that he no longer wanted anything to do with me.

So now I am back to square one. Living in an area that doesn't mean anything to me, with no friends, and having no clue what to do with my future.

I am now contemplating about moving back home, but I would like some thoughts on whether I am doing the right thing. On one hand I would be happier outside of work as I would be back near my friends. I have always missed them over the past 4 years and people say to me, 'Oh you can see them at the weekend'. Or, 'they're only a couple of hours away', well yes they are, but that isn't the same as being able to call them and meet up spontaneously is it?

Then there is work, I am fortunate in the fact that I can work from home if I need to, or they would give me the chance to relocate to another office. However I would feel obliged to travel to the head office at least once or twice a week, which is a 2 hour drive in one direction. So that does worry me in terms of how much will it cost, will I get fed up of the journey, and does it reflect on me badly if I am only there twice a week?

It also frustrates me in that I am only away from home due to my job, I no longer have any other desire to live in the area that I am in. And yet at the same time, I really enjoy my job and I am contining to grow there.

I read this back and I know there are people in far worst situations than me, I understand that completely. I have friends that are in unbelievable debt and I feel guilty for complaining about loneliness. But at the end of the day I am not happy. When you dread the weekend because you know you are alone then it is a horrible feeling. I can wake up some days and think to myself that if I dropped dead tomorrow I really wouldn't care.

If anyone can give me some thoughts then it would be appreciated. Maybe you have moved yourself, or you know someone that has, how did it turn out for you? Did you push through or did you go back?

Thank you.",21Jan2018,3
176,"I came to a realization just now.

I used to feel anger, sadness when I heard or saw a video of an officer being shot/attacked/killed. I would feel sorry for the officers when I saw videos of them shooting them. Fast forwards after hundreds if not thousands of myself watching the same stuff, hearing about the same stuff, I've realized I feel nothing anymore when I hear an officer was attacked/shot/killed not anger or sadness. When I see a video or hear about an officer shooting/killing someone I'll either feel nothing or chuckle.
It's even leaked into my real-world interactions where I've basically stopped feeling empathy.

Idk if I should continue to aspire to join the Army and then the OSHP. I don't know if I've become mentally unfit to be able to conduct myself in a standard that would make sure myself and my fellows would be able to make it home, my new lack of empathy could cause problems where I may start trying to play God, valuing one life over another.

Hell, I feel nothing towards my mother who has liver failure, last year I found her in a pool of blood she threw up and I felt nothing, I almost didn't bother to call 911.

Recently, within the last few days, she came down with Pneumonia and the Flu on top of her other medical illnesses and instead of sadness or worry, I feel nothing.

I can eat food and consume beverages while watching people getting tortured on live leaks, I feel nothing...

I feel like a monster now.

189,"So I've had what you would call a very bad life and I don't like to say that, ever. 

It started when I was young, my mom was very immature and she was not ready to raise me, my brother or sister.

My first memory is of my sister playing in my mom's blood as we waited for the cops to show up, and foster care along with that. Since I was a child I don't remember many details about what happened after. 

My sister went into foster care, my brother and me went with our grandparents. This was the most stable point in my life. My mom was still messed up but I was away from all of it. Shielded I guess you would say. It ended when I was about 7 and started to visit my mom's house. (I wasn't supposed to be there but my grandfather had a weak spot for his kids and let us freely go there).

I remember multiple things from this time period during my life, the most vivid were the countless sleepless nights I had due to my mom drinking and doing other various drugs while blasting music so loud that the whole house would shake, or arguing with her boyfriend so loud that 90% of the time the neighbors would call the cops (when they arrived me and my brother would have to hide because we weren't supposed to be there) or they would burst out into physical violence. I can't tell you how many times my mom has been beaten right in front of me. 

Tons of other things happened but I don't particularly go into detail about them.

fast forward to the summer of 6th-grade year and my mom had now moved into my grandparent's house, who were selling drugs to make big bucks, where drugs were always a source of conflict in the home. My mom used to call the cops on our stepdad just so she wouldn't have to share pills with him. She would also steal money and drugs from my grandparents, which ended up in us losing money. 

Anyways, one day my drunk brother had gotten into a bad fight with our stepdad and my brother beat the living hell out of him. The barged into my mom's room while fighting and my brother trashed my mother's room (the one she had taken from me when she moved in lol)

Of course, my mom woke in a rage and called the police in a blind rage. What pursued would change my life, DCS showed up and after a painful two hours of investigation, they ripped me and my brother from our home. I was an idiot, I never went to school and I had 0 social skills, not only that but I also really loved my family because I had been brainwashed by a lack of understanding. After anything bad happens we all just go back to normal, ignoring what happened and never pushing towards progression.

Me and my brother were taken about 3 hours from our home to a foster home where we would stay for about 5 months. We would be staying with a nice lady but we would soon find out that she also had her son living with her who was 33 I believe. He was a felon with multiple sexual assault charges. Dcs did nothing to correct the situation and we eventually were able to go back to our grandparents.

not only a couple months later we were back in foster care, besides my brother who had turned 18.

This was the best time during my life as I finally got a grasp on social skills, became a social butterfly even, and brought all of my grades up to A's. I learned many things but I was also struggling with very emotional things, that lead me to self-harm and engorge my self on food. I didn't know how to handle my past and the things I saw, so I just accepted them and they became a joke to me.

while I was in foster care I began to get in trouble quite often. I would smoke cigarettes at some point, smoke weed and get caught with it at school on multiple occasions, I did pills, and I would steal shit, and get caught too. I never did anything too serious and eventually, i was able to go home again.

while in foster care many many bad things were happening at home.  My family could no longer pay the mortgage on the house and were dealing with my grandfathers progressing Alzheimer's which put even more tension on our already, breaking financial foundation. eventually, my grandfather would pass away and my family would move into the house they were in when I finally came home.

When I first came home everyone and everything was okay for a long time and that hasn't started changing until recently.

I gave up on highschool and wasted much of my potential due to the grasp that depression took on me.

During this time my grandmother would get married to a 17-year-old, and my mom was doing okay, working on her career while living with us and trying to get ahead of all the damage she did back in her 20's and early 30's.

fast forward and eventually my nana and her now husband were ready to move and due to increasing tensions with our landlord, it was time for my mom and nana to move apart. I and my brother would go with our mom to a trailer that was pretty nice and just continued life as we had before. 

We moved into my uncles house who had died a while back ago, and nothing bad really happened with my mom here but i did go through a lot of emotional development and finally came to terms with how bad my past was and had new found optimisim that my life would get better. I dropped out of highschool while living here, it was a stupid choice i know, but i had goals and dreams so vivid that i felt like highschool was a waste of my time. 

we would eventually move again, due to the way my brother had been treating the house. This time we would move into a trailer that didn't have enough rooms.  my brother was in the living room and i had my own room. I started working a fulltime job at this point to pursue the things I want to achieve in life. I thought things would be normal from that point on but life changes quickly when you have immature people at the helm of things. 

eventually we had more conflict with our new landlord and were evicted on the grounds that we had a cat and were not supposed to. The night we moved things went to hell for me very fast. 

my brother had moved out on his own but he had came to help us.

so had an overly pushy neighbor who thought he would help us. We all knew he had drugs, specifically meth, and my mom being the person she is thought she would try it to help her through the move. I exploded in anger, i threw the guy out of our house and told him id kill him if he came back, i told my mom she wasnt ever doing it again, but we spent a good 9 hours arguing over her wanting to do it again. It was disgusting and it made me give up hope on my mother. She didn't get addicted to meth but im going to fast forward to present day.

recently my cousin who is addicted to crack moved in on us until he can get the lights back on at his place (he was in jail for stealing a tv from walmart, which my mother drove him to do). Needless to say he did crack again and my mom decided it would be a great idea to do it too, she has also been doing xannax frequently and is getting pills from a friend who has been getting them from her doctor for her numerous health issues. I am sad to say that i was actually okay with all of this and apparently i just accept the way things are with my life.

today is what broke me though, i woke up, very early, walked into the living room and heard moans coming from my mom's room. My cousin wasnt anywhere to be seen but i knew he was in the house, i assumed he might have been tweaking on crack but about an hour later he walked out of my moms room. Im speachless, I dont know what to do or say but I know I need to get away from this mess. Im only 18 and I know I can't move yet. What should I do?

Eventually, I started roleplaying everytime I was on and I accidentally made friends there... now one of them was a guy playing a girl in the game but I didn't know that till they invited me to group chats and they referred to him as one. I was kind of nervous though because they actually called me one too. But could I just up and say, oh I'm a girl since I haven't said anything for the 6 months I was roleplaying my character?

I mean look at now, 2.5 years later with them and their like my best friends. We're mostly all over 18 now and I'm like 19 so they want have a meet-up. I really really want to go because I truly think of them as my friends but... how do I? They were already always bothered because I gave bad excuses on why I couldn't voice chat with them. Even on discord or pc. They also all have at one point sent pictures of themselves too the chat, not all full, sometimes just an eye or their face.

They suspect something is up with me and I don't know if showing up would be the best thing... They also assume I'm sometimes gay because obviously at times the real me will slip out. There is another girl in the group so it's not full on guys but she could also be creeped out by me...

I don't know, I'm just extremely worried. I also described my ""male self"" simlar to me, hair color, eye color, skin. But I lied about height, 8 pack abs, tall, attractive, etc... I mean sure I'd like to say I'm attactive but not how I described myself to them. I'm sure they don't expect me to be that when I show up but I'm sure they won't expect this... I mean again, I'd like to say I'm attractive but I'm short, skinny, and I look under than my actual age.

Should I meet-up with them? I really enjoy the group of friends but will me actually lying to them that I was a guy and showing up as a female ruin our friendship? Especially since they have really questioned why and I gave a bad excuse. I don't even know what we can talk about or if they will want to talk the same around me... I don't dress boyish or act like a tomboy so will they be even more weirded out by me?",21Jan2018,62
194,"Hello everyone,
First of all English is not my native language so forgive me for any spelling/grammar mistake.

So I was in a long term relationship with a girl for five years, four of which living together. We have decided to split in the summer and I am single ever since.

I live alone in an apartment, I work out a lot and I have a good job and salary for a 29 years old. I am not the most popular guy among women but I am not also the most unpopular.

So being a huge music buff I've started to chat with this girl who's also into music at work via Slack and last week we have been sending songs back and forth, teasing and flirting. Nothing sexual, just joking and laughing about stuff. 

Normally I am the one starting the conversation and taking the initiative, and from time to time she seems like she's completely uninterested on me/what I am saying but on the other hand she just sends me old songs that she's sure I will like even though she's normally not into those. What I'm trying to say is that I cannot read her :-). I've also tried to tell her personal things about myself but she doesn't seem very interested and she doesn't talk a lot about her personal life. But once we're talking we really get along and we can be talking for a full day of work.
So yesterday we were in a party and we acted both uninterested, she left a bit earlier and I was trying to give her space but I was a bit too drunk so not sure how it went on.

The thing is, I don't know how to react. She likes talking with me, she thinks I am funny but I am not sure if there's something more than that. I feel like a teenager I simply cannot stop thinking about her and that's impacting my life and work. 

I am afraid of talking to her about my feelings or ask her out due to the fact that she's my coworker and maybe because I am afraid of being rejected by someone I like.

I dont want to look needy and talk to her each day because that's really unattractive. 

Also, I get along pretty well with a colleague of mine that is really good friends with her and I know for a fact that she shares her personal life with him.
Should I ask him something?

What would you do in my position? 

Thank you

But now I want to tell my mom and dad. However I’m struggling about how I should tell them. I’m quite sure they think I’m straight. So should I just tell them casually, or take a more serious approach? And should I tell them when theyre not with eachother, or should i tell them at the same time?

198,"To start this off, I've been working at a distribution center for about a week now. The position I work in is completely different to what I was initially told by the training specialist. This was later confirmed by my supervisor. Anyway, everyone in the area feels the same, and as a result, everyone either quits or is planning on it. Not only that, but literally no one receives training in my department, so we all end up unloading trucks (even though that wasn't part of our job). The supervisor is split between us and a much larger department, so he spends almost all his time there. I feel as though I could be doing the company much better if I actually was put to use. 

The whole department is a mess because we have no leadership, and the few times we do need to do something important, we aren't trained to do so, so we inevitably mess it up. There's one guy that received a part of the training, but only after 6 months and after he complained to the higher ups, but get this, we're so undermanned that he's usually never around to help anyone. Plus, it seems like our real job is to unload trucks, so it makes absolutely no sense as to why our position requires us to pass tests. When I brought it up to my HR person (who is also the one that gave us orientation and mislead me about the job) he changed his stance from, you'll have to learn this and get that training, to the possibility to learn that and get that training exists.

I want to talk to my boss' boss since my boss said he isn't the one to talk to. I feel that if they didn't mislead people, and the training specialist actually knew what the job was, maybe it wouldn't foster such a negative environment. Plus the revolving door issue at the moment is costing the company more due to all the screw ups, and maybe if they had dedicated leadership they'd also save money.

So my question is, is it even a good idea to bring it? How should I go about it? I was told I could speak to any of the management if I desired. Should I ask for an appointment? Thank you. 

Will clarify or expand if need be.",21Jan2018,1
199,"(I'm new to reddit so cut me some slack if I mess up on something)

Last month I met a certain girl on an organized trip abroad, I'm from a very traditional and agricultural old town from the west bank (no politics please), so traditional to the point that we have nicknames like ""the guardians"" given to us by others, while on the other hand, you have her, a city girl from the northern part of the country itself (outside the west bank) she's a palestinian yet she's not too different than the average western person. My way of speach is casual and slightly offensive to the northern people, and having a very traditional Palestinian mentality doesn't seem too help much. There are many stereotypes that the agricultural people (even though they make up like half of the west bank) are uneducated and poor, and although it's true I'm not really the richest guy, I still have one of the best educations in Palestine, yet the way I act doesn't make it so obvious, everytime we talk, it's either my mixed accent or my mentality that get in the way.

So, if someone has been in a similar situation, could you give me some advice please? Maybe tell me how city people think? How could I show her the positive sides, or at least breach the gap between us?",21Jan2018,4
200,"I have never told this to anyone in my life but it’s been eating me alive. As a child, I was molested for years by family members. This made me overly sexual as a young child. 

When I was in 5th grade I did the worst thing I could possibly do. My niece was 4-6 years old at the time and she caught me touching myself. I then told her what the people who molested me would tell me. I asked her “do you know what I’m doing?” and “do you want to touch?” I didn’t touch her or do anything like that. Nor have I ever said/done anything like that ever again. 

Its been over 15 years and still to this day I feel guilty and like a monster. Sometimes I want to kill myself because of it. It’s something I can never erase and she will remember it forever. I know if my niece tells my sister or family, they will disown me. They won’t trust me around their kids. I feel like a monster and don’t know how to get through this. This is something I’ve never told even my spouse. He knows I was molested as a child but not that I said those things to my niece.

202,"I seem to have a thing for making depressed friends. One of them was diagnosed with critical depression a few years ago, but he has come to terms with it long ago. However, he says he still regularly has suicidal thoughts. I have tried to tell him to exercise more, but it doesn't help. 

I have another friend who started failing school, and was out of the football season right at the beginning. Since then, he has been out doing drugs and drinking to the point of passing out. I asked him if he does it because he is bored and he said yes. I have tried to find different things for him to do at home to keep him from going out and doing this shit, but the only thing he can think of is lifting. However, the friends he used to lift with he is now too different from to go back. To give you an idea, he almost broke his hand from regularly punching a brick wall. It is more than just that however. His mother was a nut so he lives with his dad and brothers now, but his brother threw him through a wall one time if that gives you an idea of what they are like. I was talking to him all night about what I could do to help him, and we are going to lift in a few weeks, but there is still more as he exercises a lot already. He says that he doesn't have any motivation to do anything, and that he is failing grade 10. I want to help him, and I have promised to do anything I can to help, but I am afraid that I can't do anything.

Another one of my friends did something really bad that I am not sure I even want to write about, and now all of my other friends want to cut him loose. I can't do that as I have known him since I was a 2 years old. What he did was awful but he has shown remorse and I can tell thinks about it all the time. I myself feel that we should give him a second chance as what he did doesn't affect us, but my friends disagree. I am afraid that if we were to cut him loose, he might do something self harmful. We are all he has, but now I guess I am all he has. The most annoying part of this is that he doesn't know that I know what he did, so I can't talk to him about it. All of my other friends have heard everything through the first depressed guy (who I think is a bit of a sociopath as I have never seen him show empathy for another person or even an animal, also very narcissistic), so I they can't fucking show some empathy for our really old friend.

The other one I am worried about has no problems in life. He gets AAA marks, got second in a regional tennis contest and also is amazing at everything he does. However, he is being influenced by the sociopath and doesn't understand how fucking hard it is for me to help everyone.

The point is, I am trying to help all of my friends who are in real shitty situations. However, this is taking effect on my grades too. My parents are thinking that I have no motivation and are constantly threatening to take away the things I need to relax me like my PC. They think that the reason I am having trouble getting shit done are the videogames but I can't tell them all this shit because they will tell me I need to stop trying to help my friends. I can't leave my friends to fuck themselves up. I am just really overwhelmed and don't know what to do to help my friends. I just want someone to give me some advice, thanks. ",21Jan2018,4

205,"A Dark Box, 

or, 

A short diagram of my mind, in the hopes that someone will understand and tell me how to get out

Imagine yourself inside of a small box with no light.  There is only blackness.  You think there must be something there in the blackness, so you start racking your brain over what it could be.  Eventually, you start thinking there must be worse and worse things in that blackness, and you self-petrify into a state of perpetual insanity.  This is the natural resting state of my mind.

My solution has been, ever since I was a kid, to poke a hole in the box, and watch what limited bit I could see of the outside.  If you cannot see the blackness, you don’t think about it.  If you don’t think about it, it doesn’t exist.  If it doesn’t exist, you can’t go insane.  So you watch outside of the tiny hole and observe the outside world.  

You try to interact with the outside world, but most of the time you’re simply ignored by those closest to you.  You are not sure why, but it hurts nonetheless.  However, those farther away react with curiosity and are mostly friendly.  You try not to bring them too close, for fear of being ignored by yet more people, but you also don’t want them to leave, either.  They are, after all, part of that tiny hole, and you need them to stave off the blackness.

Sometimes, the people closest to you will remember you are there, and talk with you.  Mostly it has no substance.  If you’re lucky, there will be a passing laugh, or a joke that offends nobody that everyone chuckles at.  Occasionally, however, those closest to you look at your box (but not inside) and ask you why you are in there.  You simply explain that you have always been in here and are not sure how to get out.  If you’re lucky, that line of talking ends there.  However, if you ask for help, you are laughed at and sometimes kicked over.  Your solution becomes telling them you’re not really in a box, and that you’re sitting outside right next to them.  This is easier for them to understand.  They have trouble seeing boxes where they exist, and trying to explain the concept of the box often makes the problem worse, but if you tell there is no box, they stop seeing it, and they stop asking questions.

So you sit inside your box.  It is your box, after all.  Those closest to you will tell you that if you are in a box, it must be a box of your own design and making.  Your box: your problem.  Your problem: your fault.  You doubt there is a way out, deep down, and that guilt becomes self-inflicted.  If you can’t bootstrap your way out of a problem you were born into, it’s entirely your fault.  All your fault.

Sometimes those closest to you will tell you how hard it is for them to take care of you while you sit in the inescapable box.  This makes you feel guilty, so you try to explain that it’s not your fault: the box always existed and nobody will show you the way out.  Again, you are laughed at.  The concept of the box is foreign to them, and it seems too scary to start to understand, so it must be a joke.  Ha ha, very funny joke.  It’s not real, of course.  It can’t be.  Life would be darker and scarier with it actually existing, so therefore it must not exist.

It’s so hard for them to take care of you while you, seemingly willingly, sit there on your butt.  So they say, anyways.  You realize at this point that explaining your predicament will only lead to more pain.  You’ve learned your lesson, and begin to just take the abuse.  They don’t realize it’s a sort of abuse, but of course that topic predicates the box, and understanding the box seems to be impossible for them, so they certainly won’t understand the pain that comes with the people outside of it.  So you sit there and take it.  It’s less painful to never speak than to speak and never be heard.

Your life becomes a system of pain management.  All you see is pain, and eventually all you are is pain.  You hate that pain and, by proxy, yourself.  

You have a small screen that lets you talk with people outside of your box, quietly.  You ask them for help.  They provide solutions, but, not knowing you, these solutions are never feasible.  Many of them equate to “just leave the box,” which is of no help.  You don’t look at a broken clock and say “just move your hands around like you’re supposed to.”  You don’t see a man with no legs and say “have you tried just standing up,” do you?
That screen was your last hope for removing the box, and you keep trying it, but it still hasn’t helped.  You think maybe someday it could, but there are too many people and none of them really know who you are.  So now it becomes another hole in the box.  You watch the outside and hope one day the blackness surrounding you goes away.

Sometimes, at night, the power goes out, and you can’t see outside the box anymore.  You’re forced to remember the blackness you’re trapped inside.

These nights are the worst.  They feel as though they will never end.  

I’m stuck here, in a box just like this one.  How do I leave?

But one of my friends, uses the N word regularly, knowing I don’t like it. Maybe it’s not fair to say she uses it regularly, but every time black people or racism is brought up into the conversation, she always says the same thing: “Black people and N****** aren’t the same thing. N****** tear shit up and stuff.” And I always respond with the same thing: “There are white trash people who do that? Do they piss you off the same?” And she always says, “No... but I’m *not* a racist.”  Very typical, and so disappointing.

225,"I'm a 28 year old female. During my puberty and early teen years - very formative times - I was not cute, and felt this very deeply. (skip to the last paragraph from here if you want a TL;DR)

I'm mixed race, Indian and caucasian, so at age 10/11 or so I became hairy, had really thick eyebrows, etc. I had ugly glasses, and I broke my nose when I was 9 or 10 so it had a huge hump that I didn't get fixed till I finished high school. I was skinny and gawky. I just was not cute, and while I do look back at old pictures and realize it wasn't *quite* as bad as I had thought, it's no surprise at all that boys my age didn't like me, etc. Once I realized this about myself, I basically just buried the part of me that wanted to be pretty and to date boys. To make matters worse, I was raised by the caucasian side of my family and didn't really identify with the Indian side at all, but visibly I looked more Indian, and was one of few non-white people in my community. It was all a lot to handle and affected me on a deep level. I just didn't even let myself entertain romantic thoughts.

Anyway, after high school I got my nose fixed, wore contact lenses, (very) slowly started to figure out how to manage my hair/eyebrows, and generally blossomed. My figure became much more 'womanly.' I basically went through the change that I think a lot of brown girls do after puberty, when suddenly they're pretty and ""exotic"" rather than just being hopelessly awkward. By the time I was about 21, I was getting a lot of attention from guys, which has more or less continued to the present day where I'm now 28.

The problem is, although I look at myself in the mirror and do, most days, think I'm attractive, it's hard to stop feeling like I'm ugly on some level because of the way I used to look. I think I'm having a hard time letting go of some self-loathing for my previous, ""ugly"" self, and a desire to just distance myself from her as much as possible which obviously causes a major dissonance, since we're both versions of the same person. I would really love to hear from anyone who can relate or who has any advice? I could talk about this forever but would love to hear what other people have to say :)",21Jan2018,6
226,"So I’m studying my A Levels, final year, 5 months till exams. And I’m a mess. I study English lit, French and psychology, predicted AAB with super high expectations for myself. That’s the issue, I don’t know how to not put this unbearable amount of pressure on myself. Every little thing I see as a failure, unless I get those grades I will consider myself a failure. My family is so supportive they say it doesn’t matter if I don’t and I need to relax more since there’s many more options if I don’t get the grades, which I understand but it doesn’t make any difference! I had mocks the other week and through stress and pressure on myself I made myself ill: migraines, constantly shattered, loss of appetite, didn’t want to do my hobbies or see anyone. If I wasn’t revising I was stressing that I wasn’t revising, if I was revising, I was stressing that I won’t be able to do it. Someone please help me get out of this cycle because if I’m this much of a mess over mocks, I dread to think what the real exams in 5 months time will be like. The thought actually makes me feel sick. I know I sound like a typical student and ‘everyone’s in the same boat’ but I would really appreciate the help, and hope this can help any fellow year 13’s too. Thankyou! ",21Jan2018,4
228,"When I was 7 my school bully, who was between 8 and 10, took me out behind the yard and whipped his dick out. He made me watch him touch himself. Don’t remember much else. All of these accounts are hazy, since I repressed them pretty hard until I was 15. I can’t remember if he ever touched me sexually.

On another, separate day I remember he wanted me to strip. I kept trying to convince him not to make me. In the end he gave me a choice, too strip bare on top or on bottom. And since I didn’t have breasts yet I took my shirt off.

Since we were nearly the same age, in most cases I’d say this was just children playing doctor? But he was someone I feared, because of the more typical ways he bullied me.

 Now a bit about me if this helps: I focus maybe too much on school. I'm in an advanced program and I want to go to a good uni like Yale. I doubt if I could get into a school like that on scholarships, and I'm not rich enough to pay for it on my own, so I was thinking of getting trained in a trade so I can pay for a fancy schmancy university and have a steady job until I can do what I really want to do.

Today he saw me talking to her and asked me if I'm okay with him also talking with her and I just said yeah sure.

I just couldn't bring myself to tell him not to talk to her. I feel like it would've been rude and selfish.

This was only a few weeks after the break up so I didn't make a big deal out of it knowing that this was her way of getting over me. Her friends still talked to me and hung out with me so it didn't bother me that much, but now things are taken too far. 8 months later she still isn't over me, I made out with a girl that is coming to our school and she found out about it. Even though it was just a make out, she is making a very big deal over it. Her friends have been telling me that she is telling them to not talk to the girl I made out with and to be mean to her (which they told me they won't do). However, my ex has been fucking my best friend for a few months now and I have absolutely no issue with it cause I have zero feelings for her, but she has the nerve to act like this when I only make out with a girl. I can't talk to her about it now because her friends will get into shit for telling me so I'm kind of stuck and I'm not sure what to do in this situation.

On January 6th I applied for a job at my local vape shop. They’re a pretty big name and a have a huge product that sells worldwide. I didn’t think anyone would contact me back, but the job I currently have has currently made me uneasy. But, I applied in hopes I’d hear back. On the 8th, I received a call and we set up an interview to speak on the 12th.

The interview went extremely well. The others and I really seemed to hit it off and I thought we had a connection. They explained the next steps and said I’d hear back with them. They said I would hear back with them in a week.

Well, it’s been nearly almost a full week now and still nothing. Without giving too much detail, I know one of the people I spoke to have been busy. Because of this, I haven’t budged him much until an hour ago. I shot him a text (because I know he’s been busy, I didn’t want to call) and kindly said that I saw what he was going through and to contact me because I had yet to hear from anyone.

241,"Hello, I really really need some advice here. I am a 16 year old girl. I feel like everything is getting too much and I am so stressed 24/7. I don't have time to go out or see my friends anymore, and when I do it makes my life 10x harder for the next week to make up for it. 

Basically my Dad is 85 years old and lives in a big house on his own. He's very alert mentally but he can't get around very easily and spends all his time writing articles and reading. 

I live with him every other week, and for the past 6 years the house was never cleaned or looked after, and I ate junk food all the time because no one was there to cook. My dad can't cook and when he does he does it very badly and is very unhygienic. I didn't do anything about it because I was too young, and I was miserable. 

The kitchen was covered in mould, I wouldn't bathe or change clothes all week because the bathroom was mouldy and dirty and my Dad never did laundry. And my Dad just used to tell me to do it myself, but no one ever taught me how. 

Well now that I am 16 I decided the only way to be happy was to do everything myself. So I've taught myself how to clean, how to cook, do laundry etc., but it's impossible. It's a big house and we have no money for a cleaner. I spent all of my savings (£800) replacing all the kitchen items (kettle, plates, cutlery, toaster, pots and pans etc.) and replacing all my old bedding, buying new towels and so on because my Dad can't afford it and didn't want to buy them even though it was so unhygienic. 

There's still so much left to buy but I can't afford it anymore. He thanked me for buying it but doesn't seem to realise how much everything cost. He was going to give me £200 (he's recquired legally) but keeps on putting it off. 

I spend every day staying up till 1am cleaning, and I still can't get everything done. The walls are mouldy in multiple rooms and everything is falling apart, and there's nothing I can do about it. I cook meals as well because that's the only way to not just eat microwave stuff. I'm also in full time education from home, so I fit in 8 hours of revision everyday as well. 

I still feel so guilty that I'm not making him more happy and looking after things more. Whenever I do something wrong or let something get dirty he tells me and seems disappointed, but he doesn't seem to realise that I'm trying my absolute best and it's impossible for me to keep up with everything. Regardless of that I still feel like a bad daughter for not being able to do all this correctly. 

He complains all the time that I never talk to him, we never go out anywhere or spend time together, but how am I supposed to fit in all the housework, cleaning, my education and sleeping (even then I'm getting maybe 5 hours) AND have time to watch movies with him like he wants to? I feel like he wants me to be magic or something. But I still feel guilty that I don't have time to talk much. I have to get a job in a few weeks as well and start working because I have no money left for myself. How do I fit work in as well????!!!!

244,"Hi there, 
16M here and I need some advice.

I don't really care much for school - I like certain subjects like computer science and math but hate the way it's taught at my school. I also run a video game development club at school where we've released 2 games on the iOS Appstore, but as far as accomplishments go, this is my list. 

I'm confident that life after high school/college isn't really anything like school and that you really do get to pursue your dreams without pesky courses like math, LA and chemistry to stand in the way between your aspirations. I have told myself that I *will* start a business after college (yes I know how hard it is to start one lol) and find a way to thrive in the technology world. However, I'm worried that I may just be living in a fantasy and that none of this will ever happen.

Just today, my father confronted me about my grades and told me that I am the source of his unhappiness and that he stops checking my grades because he doesn't want to be depressed. He also alluded to myself as an ""investment with worthless returns"" and that he doesn't spend enough time with my baby sister because of me. I have a 3.6 GPA and an SAT of 14200, which isn't too shabby but could be better.

He also made it very clear that I would only be attending a particular state college (one that he frequently looks down upon in every conversation about colleges we have) because he doesn't trust me enough to make the right decisions about grades and life in general. His reasoning is based solely on the fact that I don't tell him my grades, only because I know how negatively he'll react. Now he's enforcing more and more of his rules and regulations against me using my computer, Reddit, and the internet in general. 

I am looking for advice on the next steps, as well as your honest opinion on my views on the world from the beginning of this very long essay :)

Thank you very much for you time.

248,"I'm currently working full-time as a researcher for a labor union. It's a cool job that's challenging and honestly hard to pick up. It seemed competitive to get and I honestly don't know how I got it. Honestly. Although I did activism/organizer work in college and worked with unions, knowing how to do this shit, this job is still so fucking foreign to me. 

It's also important to note this is my first full-time job or actually first job in general. So, although that's not an excuse I think it plays a role in why I just am not performing. 

I was a leader on campus in some ways but I always doubted myself. Always. My boss noticed it. He said you do good work but I can tell your holding yourself back. In meetings I want you to take more responsibilities and contribute more to strategy. I'm just scared because I literally just think I can't. I used to doubt if I could in college because I always felt like my contributions missed the mark and now when it actually matters I can't muster up the confidence to perform. It's a small team of highly accomplished researchers and I just feel so lame. It has also been a tough year with my OCD flaring up and me I think dealing with bouts of depression, making me even more insecure sometimes. Although that's not an excuse I know.

My boss wasn't entirely mean he just gently hinted at me stepping up more and even said I want you to kick ass here. He is all about growing my potential in me because he see's it but to be honest I don't. I know that sounds self depricating but I also don't feel knowledgeable enough about the field! That's on me and I should be readings but I also was thinking that maybe I can pull my coworker aside and have a one on one with her about how I can do better. I trust her I feel because she has been affirming of my work before. But I don't know if that looks particularly weak. It's a small team of 4-5 researchers on this project (including me).

How do I do better. I can tell I'm slipping behind on work and I'm just not rocking this shit like I hoped. I was really motivated in school and I fucking put my mind towards shit but now I'm not. It could be the job itself which I've kinda figured out isn't my career path but I'm still interested in stay here for at minimum a year and learning as much as I can because this is a great fucking job and I'm luckily.

I""m scared they'll just get sick of me and fire me. I need to step up. How do I not get scared now and fucking show everyone what I got when I literally feel like and know I got nothing. I don't want them to regret hiring me.",21Jan2018,4

She won’t make eye contact with me at all. For example, when I’m having a conversation with the whole group, she won’t even look in my direction to acknowledge me speaking. Whenever I try to talk to her, she gives very short replies and one word answers, and she gives off a vibe as if I’m bothering her.

We have already had a discussion about children and so on and I told her I don't want any children *yet*. 
Now here is the catch: She has already been pregnant before and terminated said pregnancy (her ex-BF urged her to have an abortion), which led her to her current opinion of not wanting to have an abortion again.

So I was an exchange student in the US from July until January. I got off to a pretty rocky start, I was with a family that was a little messed up. They eventually got rid of me by accusing me of things I didn’t do, but that’s beside the point really. Fortunately, a great family was willing to take me in and from there, things started looking up. I met some great people and had a great time overall. I guess we had some cultural differences, that lead to some misunderstandings. I might have said some things that were offensive to them. Over the months, I got the impression that I was being looked down upon. I can’t really say anymore if I was right or if it was my paranoia about these things going through with me. Anyway, there was a girl in said group of people that I had a pretty big crush on. I now realize that I was being a **** to her, because that’s just what I do when I like people too much and when I’m too scared to admit it. Like I implied before, I wasn’t always treated nicely either, but I guess I really did deserve that. Eventually I just got really mad at said group of people, both for treating myself with condescendence (or so I thought) and for treating a mentally unstable friend of mine pretty badly (that part I still think I was right about). I could have brought all this up in a sober way, but I completely lost my cool and basically told them to **** off over text (which, admittedly, makes me even more of a coward).  Fast forward a couple of months, during which I had a pretty decent time hanging out with other friends, I got pretty sick during winter break and just lost all my motivation to stay in the US. I wasn’t even really homesick, just exhausted: My host family’s schedule was a lot busier than my family’s at home, I just couldn’t see myself doing that for another four months. And so I made a relatively “spontaneous” decision to just throw in the towel and go home. Of course I was happy to be back to my family and friends, but there’s a lot of things about my 6 months in the US that I won’t forget very soon.

I guess the main “thing” being that girl I mentioned. Even though I reflexively avoided writing much about her, she really is what this is all about. Pushing her away instead of fessing up to the feelings I had for her was really what caused all this mess in the first place. I have obviously blocked her on all social media after my tantrum. The moment I left the US she basically became a person I lost forever because of my pettiness. Even if she did ever like me in any way, I wouldn’t blame her for hating me now. I honestly hate myself too.

I have an older brother who, for most of my life, I idolized. He left to college when my parents divorced. I have had a few significant relationships in my life and only one real girlfriend. That relationship lasted 3 1/2 years. I have had many short term relationships over my life though, usually lasting about 3-6 months, one lasted for 9 months. I do not know why they don’t last longer, but that’s something I need to work on. 

I always have a problem where I cannot let go of my most recent ex girlfriend. I am constantly telling myself I should’ve done this or that different or better.

What is the best way to mourn and mentally deal with a relationship that has run its course and is over? She is never coming back to me but all I want to do is stop thinking about her, stop comparing females to her, and stop thinking that one day we’ll be together again. I have mourned this relationship almost twice as long as the relationship itself.  Also, as much of me wants to meet someone else is also afraid to meet someone else. Because that will just be my next infatuation. I think the following: maybe I don’t love myself enough to earn the love of another.

They called the home owner over and the neighbor did the same exact thing to him too. Is there anything that she can do? ",21Jan2018,2
262,Sooo on Thursday i shaved and i believe i probably accidentally nicked my anus because right after it was bleeding profusely and friday it was bleeding bad in the beginning of the day but at around 8 pm it slowed down and i thought it was over but nope then yesterday it was still bleeding but only vert lightly and today it is still very light bleeding but regardless it is still bleeding im looking for clinics to go to without having to use my insurance... anyway i had anal way back in october do you think that this could be another reason its bleeding? I doubt it but i dont think me shaving could possibly cause my anus to bleed for 3 days and i looked down there and it seems to be coming from my anus but when i wipe after i poop theres no blood where my anus is of course you and i are no doctors but ive been raised to wait things out before going to the doctor and i just also dont wanna tell my mom i was shaving my anus 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ im dumb,21Jan2018,1
263,"I'm 21 and am experiencing my first real ""thing"" with a girl. I only call it a thing because we only met a week ago. But (even though I have no prior experience to judge against) I feel like we've gone kinda far for just one week. Example, she already spent the night with me. Nothing physical happened besides some somewhat intimate cuddling. Last night, I was walking her back to her place and was going to ask for a kiss goodnight but it still felt like too soon. I know I'm looking way too much into this but is 1 week kinda fast to be making any moves? ",21Jan2018,7
264,"Hi, I want to have casual sex with girls regularly( every week maybe?) but I don´t like dating apps. I usually reserve 3 or 4 hours a week for my social life, that is, going to the cinema, theater, museums, bars, shops, conferences or even nightclubs( although I dont drink nor dance so that might not be very productive) .My idea is to chat with girls I find attractive in those situations and start going to dates with them, if things go well I would explain what I am looking for. For more info about myself: 20 years old, fit ,dress well, handsome, look too young for my age, not tall (5´8), introverted but forcing to be more open, I am generally liked by people but its hard for me to approach and break the ice but I am working on it, I think I am interesting, maybe a little too serious. Is this a good idea? Is it realistic?What are my chances? Any advice? Thanks.",21Jan2018,1
265,"I live with two other roommates (one guy, one girl, and I'm a girl) and we all met because of the same student organization we're in. We were all planning to live with each other next year. Roommate B wanted to live in an apartment that's about $550 a month. Roommate A then tells us he's living with his other friends next year which messed up all of our plans.

Now I'm with my other Roommate, Roommate B. Roommate B is sweet and nice but I was never really that close with her. Neither of us are ever home so we don't really talk that much. I'm honestly closer with Roommate B's friends than I am with her.

After A decided not to live with us anymore, I reached out to B on Facebook Messenger about what we should do. One of my close friends reached out to me and said she was looking for a roommate for next year. I talked to B about potential apartments we could live in and other people we could reach out to for roommates, including my friend (who B met before). B left me on read which annoyed me and gave me shady vibes.

My friend wants to live in a much less expensive apartment ~$440 a month and generally has a much less expensive lifestyle than B. Because B is unresponsive to my messages, I'm getting the vibe that she either doesn't want to live together next year or is just being a dick about replying to my messages.

I'm afraid of cutting it off with B because we're both in the same student organization and because I don't want to be on a bad note with B's friends or other people in this organization (which has about 500 people). B also told me a while back she doesn't know who else she could live with next year. I would honestly much rather live with my other friend than B.

I don't know what to do.

266,"I'm usually pretty confident and self assured, but i have been feeling down the last few days. I have a good temperament and can be pleasant in correct circumstances, but I've always had speech problems. I was plagued my recessed speech and a stammer until my late teens and was often tormented for being quiet by other children. I would only further hurt myself by speaking up, seeing as I could only produce about half of the sounds in the phonetic alphabet. My parents believe this habit originates to when I was an infant and cut my tongue in half in an accident. I have always been weary of oral communication and it makes me feel like there is something wrong with me. 

I have improved a lot over the years but my past experiences and my stammer leads to me being very quiet and standoffish in social situations. People often try to reach out to me, but due to my issues with speech I usually just smile and don't say much. I think this leads people to think I'm pretentious and cold. I know that this behavior has upset people before. Just a couple weeks ago I had a family member ask me why I ""hated"" them and never spoke to them. I explained my situation, but I don't think they believed me. I do not have any bad intentions. I have a lot that I can give others but I won't let myself out because I'm afraid to.",21Jan2018,2
267,"I skipped 9th grade and I'm currently in the 12th grade. My parents are very forceful when it comes to planning my future. ""You WILL go to a college or a university and you WILL find a career."" Except... I'm not entirely interested in anything you can learn at a college or a university. I want to be a YouTuber or a livestreamer. I've told my parents and they're not exactly supportive... My mom almost started crying when I told her. I want so badly to put out content because it's something I'm passionate about, it's something I'm interested and quite frankly I am good at it. It's my dream to pursue that as a career, but it seems so impossible and stupid. I want to go into this extremely luck-based job because it's what I love. I'm just so terrified of failing and disappointing my family and friends. I also don't want to be stuck in a career I have no fire or passion for.

269,"I had a few friends over last night. One of them was my best friend. We were all drinking and at the end of the night we were all just watching tv. I passed out and woke up to my best friend kissing me, i was a dazed at the time, so i looked around and asked where our other friend was. i ignored what happened and went to bed. I cried about it all night.. i was so upset, i trust this guy so much, and im in no way interested in him that way and he knows it, ive made it quite clear over the years that we are best friends and thats it. And in fairness that doesnt even matter you still shouldn't kiss someone when they are unconscious. So i confronted him the next day.

He seemed shocked, he said 'i did what??' and apologized profusely. He had no memory of it and just remembers falling asleep on the sofa. I should explain that things have happened in the past where ive woken up and hes been cuddling me, and said that he did it in his sleep. and im not the only person this has happened to. He has even undressed in his sleep in a room full of people. So he does seem to have some sort of sleep issue..

He was very upset when i told him, as although he has cuddled up to people in his sleep before (and made some quite uncomfortable) he had never kissed anyone. He was saying how he needs to get help, and feels like he cant even sit beside people anymore, incase he falls asleep and does something. 

Now heres the thing. I trust this guy so much, so when this happened it broke my brain. I really want to believe him about the sleep stuff. But part of me wonders if he is in fact aware of what he is doing...Especially the kiss since he was awake when i woke up to him doing it, then he fell asleep a few minutes later after briefly talking to me. which he also says he does not remember. I dont know what to think.

He is my closest friend and the one person i talk to about everything, i really need someone like that in my life right now as things have been very tough.  I want to believe him, but something doesnt feel right about the whole situation. I cant afford to loose him either. but dont want someone around that i cant trust either. 

Any advice would be great, do you guys think that someone could actually do that in their sleep? or is he just trying to cover his tracks for his bad behavior?",21Jan2018,2

271,"Next month on the same weekend I have two options and I just do not know which I want to do more. 

First, I'm taking a handbuilt bicycle class at the college I go to and I have the option to go with my class to the National Handbuilt Bicycle Show in Hartford, CT. I don't have a bike to display and I will be going as nothing more than a spectator. But I do love bikes and hope to be able to get into the industry as a designer one day. I know they're will be probably plenty of opportunities to talk and make connections within that industry there and I am graduating in December, so this would be a great time to advance my knowledge and get things to talk about. It's also in a part of the country I've never been to and I always enjoy doing something new. 


The other option is going to the UP of Michigan with a group of student engineers that make up a Baja Car Racing team for a race. There, the first day, we will go skiing at a resort there, and I've never been skiing.. The race is something very cool and in a beautiful part of the country. I've raced it twice before but without the skiing, this is the first time we've done this for fun. I'm also not the greatest fan of the people on the team but they are tolerable to be with for a weekend. 

Both will cost about the same amount of money. They both seem so fun to go to.",21Jan2018,2

What do you think is the best option?

277,"Not sure how to handle my friend. We used to be best friends..we were friends since high school and would hang out every weekend. As we went through college, we would often hang out every weekend then too and sometimes numerous times a week when we would have breaks from school.  We've been friends for many, many years. She was close with my boyfriend (now fiancé) at the time too and has been friends with him for years before him and I began dating. 

This year, recently, she has completely dropped off the map from me. I graduated college and my life has changed a lot. I graduated, started a career, and got engaged. She is still in college and had broken up with her boyfriend of 2 years about 6 months before we got engaged. She now has been partying a lot more and sleeps around with different guys (which I don't care about, but it's just not my thing). She seems happy with her decisions anyway. The bigger thing is that she has this new group of friends that she literally is with every day (not in her major in college) and she snap chats them all together every day. I ask her to hang out and she'll ignore my texts/me. She'll only hang out with me once every several weekends and only for like an hour because she says she has homework. She didn't get me a Christmas or birthday gift this year and I got her gifts like we usually do. She said she bought something, but it's on back order, and this was like over a month ago. She didn't wish my fiancé a happy birthday this year either (sometimes they exchange gifts even, but she didn't even text happy birthday). I've said something to her on it in passing, but she basically blew it off and was saying that I'm her very best friend and she's just super busy with school. 

What is a good way to handle this? Should I just ignore it altogether and let it go? Should I move on from her? Should I actually confront her? 

TL;DR: Friend hasn't been replying to me, not hanging out with me, not sure what to do",21Jan2018,2
278,"I just graduated in December of 2017. I’ve been working really hard my whole life to make myself happy, but most importantly to give back to my parents - who’ve given me so much. My life has always had a plan!

I know people say you shouldn’t live for other people, and so I took the advice. I had a job lined up to please my family and I went to start after graduation. A week into the job, I left. 

I just came back home and I’ve been meeting up with a few old friends. Nothing’s changed at home and I’m feeling sort of lonely. 

Everyone’s always looked to me as the guy who has his shit figured out - but right now I have no idea what the hell i’m going to do with my life. It’s a very bittersweet moment - like I’m happy to be free, but I’m also stressed about figuring out what to do. 

I can tell my family is worried by the way they speak to me now. I too am also worried about my future. 

In addition to all of this, all of my friends are in these relationships and I’m still single. Most of my boys girls don’t like me... &amp; vice versa.

Idk what it is that I’m truly asking for - but I just don’t want to be left alone. I have no plan for the first time in my life &amp; I’m just looking for what’s right for me, but I feel hopeless. 

Advice please?",21Jan2018,2
279,"So here is the situation

*I touched the surface/lips of my girlfriends vagina with the tip of my penis for a sec or two, no ejaculation or penetration.
*i might or not might have had some precum on the tip of my penis
*we did that on the 13. Dec and she got her period as normal on 19. Dec

For some reason we are panicking right now, she is supposed to get her period now and we are interested, with all of the above conditions, is there any *risk of pregnancy*

280,"I've never really been a talkative person. When I was little I rarely spoke to people and still wouldn't speak a lot with the few friends I made. If a friend moved or I didn't see them much I would simply cut all contact, even if I started seeing them around more regularly both in and out of class; I would do my best to avoid them. This has continued for as long as I can remember but I have no idea why it started or why I keep doing it (habit maybe?).

I am currently seeing psychologists and psychiatrists at my university to figure out what is wrong with me. At the moment, they don't have a clue. They first thought is was depression and or schizoaffective disorder but through many many sessions and some tests, they found that it was not the case. One doctor was looking into PTSD for violent nightmares and a lack of closeness with any members of my family but there's seemingly nothing there; no abuse, sexual or physical, no odd behaviors from them, and plenty of happy memories as child.

I have plenty of good friends currently but none I can open up to. There's nothing wrong with them; they're not bad people, they don't spout off peoples' secrets to others. I just can't seem to find the ability to have more intimate conversations. This has also led to issues with relationships. I either can't start one or they simply to short (a few months short).

With me leaving college soon (a year and a couple months) and from what I've heard about how hard it is to meet people as an adult, I'm worried that I've past the point of no return and will not be able to have things like a family and life long friends or being able to live a normal life and I don't know what to do.

281,"He asked me why it got hard. I explained it to him and tried to make him not feel awkward, because I could tell he was.

He told me to not tell anyone he asked me questions, but I don't know if I should tell my parents so maybe my Dad can help him more, or if I should try to give him resources to questions he might have, or if I should just do nothing and let it be.

283,"The past years, I’ve noticed that games and movies I’ve bought have gone missing without a trace. I’ve torn rooms apart and accused everyone in my family of taking them, but with no proof, I resigned myself to being clumsy and losing everything. 

A month ago, I was hired at a local gaming store, that sells movies and games. You can trade stuff in there, and when you opt for cash, you have to give your ID number on your license. This ties everything to you, so anyone can search and find out what you’ve traded. 

I decided that I would search for my family, as I was bored and wanted to see what they’ve traded. I searched for my brother’s name and when the transactions came up, my heart dropped. There were about 20, and I just knew what they were. I clicked through each one and it was full of my stuff. Amiibos, games, movies, anything I owned. 

At this point, I don’t really know what to do about it. I’m leaving the state in a week, so I’m not sure if I should confront him. I want to talk to him about it, saying that I know, I’ll move past it as long as he doesn’t do it to my brother. It just sucks to have confirmation and feel so betrayed. ",21Jan2018,2
