One fo dunkin donuts and one for safeway i didn’t think neither of them would call me but both did. I only really wanted the safeway one but now both have pretty much hired me. Dunkin wants me to work early mornings, and safeway wants me to work late nights. I already have trouble with sleep and feeling tired all the time even when i do get enough sleep. I’m practically a student so i don’t need 2 jobs. I accepted the safeway one after dunkin hired me so i don’t think it’s fair to just leave dunkin. I accepted safeway because i thought i mightve not gotten another chance to work there because its close to wear i live. I just got these jobs so i dont want to burn bridges with either one.

8,"Ok so I am in my first year of high school and I was thinking about paying a few old friends a visit ( a boy and a girl ). I have known them ever since kindergarten and until like 6th grade we were very good friends. In 6th grade we stopped really hanging out. Now a little backstory to why i would like to see them again.
They are one year younger than me which means they are in their last school year. Right now they are going to the same school i went to which means i can find them easily, next year, not so much. The boy had been my best friend for more than 5 years and we hanged out everyday. The girl had a crush on me and me on her but we only found out after we stopped meeting eachother.
We used to rarely see eachother in the neighbourhood or in school and trade hellos and hugs but now i was thinking i would pay them a visit. I need advice if it would be a good idea considering we haven't seen eachother in so long but we were very good friends. Any advice is appreciated",07Apr2018,1

10,"Went to visit a friend of mine back in December. She lives in a different province, different time zone. She happened to be 5ish weeks pregnant at the time. No big deal, I won’t complain that she can’t drink. 

Things did not go well, ended up crying a lot, losing a friend of 10+ years and spending a lot of money to fly home early. 

Thing is that now she is telling everyone that will listen that I told her I hoped her baby would die. 

I have no idea what to do about this. Do I let my name be dragged through the dirt like that? Do I leave it alone and hope she eventually gets over this ridiculous story she made up about me in her head? Or do I say something to her? I’ve sent her a few messages after finding these insane stories. So far I’ve replied to anything and everything I can find that she’s posted about me.

It’s just so tiring to constantly be worried about what she’s saying about me. I would never wish a miscarriage on my worst enemy. I personally do not want children and have never been in a positing where I need to worry about this. But I know several women who have gone through this tragedy. It changes people. I can’t begin to imagine what they went through.

Yesterday one of my friends preceded to go on one of our snapchat groups (had about 7 people in it) spam the N word 4 times and then send a picture of me. This made me feel like crap tbh. One of my other friends told me that when I'm not around they say the N word all the time and that it
Shouldn't matter. Today me and my other friend got into a argument. He said that black people shouldn't be offended by the N word because other races get called worse words and the don't make a
Big deal about it.

20,"My husband and I have lived in the same apartment for 3 years now. Our landlords are a nice elderly couple, and we get along very well. We live in one of the nicest neighborhoods in my town, and my husband and I each live about a 5 minute drive away from our workplaces.

2 years ago, our best friend, we’ll call her Sarah, was looking to get a place, and we had been considering adding a roommate to our lease to give ourselves a bit of a break on rent. She was over almost  every  day anyway, so it wasn’t a stretch to just add her to our lease and have her move in. 

So Sarah moves in, doesn’t have any furniture of her own, but we’d had our second bedroom functioning as a guest bedroom, so she just claimed the bed in there and moved her clothes and trinkets in. 

Over the course of our 2 years of living together, Sarah has broken several of our personal belongings. Every single one of our dishes is chipped, and she’s broken about 6 glasses because she haphazardly throws our dishes around. She broke a few sentimentally valuable bowls, and I just removed my more important dishes from the kitchen to avoid it. She jumped on our bed when she was talking with me once, and snapped our metal bed frame down the center. She’s very inconsiderate of our property, and is fairly rude otherwise.

Sarah isn’t malicious; she’s just oblivious and a bit of a klutz. I’m just getting fed up.

My husband and I decided to ask her to move out, and they had the discussion while I was at work one night. She replied something to the effect of, “I’m not just going to move out because you asked me to. I like it here.”

She has a point. She’s on the lease, and she hasn’t neglected rent or anything, but my husband and I would really like to keep our apartment. Location aside, we have two cats, and it’s really difficult to find a place here that allows pets at all. Since we own all of the furniture, it would be extremely difficult for us to move out, all things considered, and it would be much easier for her to just leave.

We’re at a stand still. What do I do?",07Apr2018,1
21,"I’m a junior in high school right now, and I’m starting the whole college app process. In stereotypical Asian fashion, my parents are pushing me to become a doctor. Honestly, I feel like a medical career would be a good fit for me, since I like science and want to do something meaningful with my life. The problem is that I don’t know if I’m capable of becoming a real doctor. I’m a decent student, but I’ve always gotten the impression that you needed to be outstanding to become a doctor. My grades are mediocre (3.5 gpa uw) and I don’t have outstanding extracurriculars, so I probably won’t be able to get into a top college, which means that I don’t have a good chance of getting into med school. (apparently 60% of applicants don’t get accepted into a single med school.) Also, I’ve never been the kind of student that studied super hard (In fact, I’m procrastinating right now with Reddit) and I’m no genius. I think I’m capable of being a great student, but I have bad study habits and I have a tendency to be lazy. I’m not sure if I have the motivation to study like crazy for the next 10 years. To top it off, I’m rather shy with strangers, so I’m worried that my bedside manner would be terrible. I’ve talked with my parents about becoming a nurse or a PA instead and they expressed their disapproval. (Poor wages and hours, not dignified enough for them, etc...) 


Idk if I just have low self-confidence or what. Also, my school is kind of competitive (11% of graduating class had a 95+ average, unweighted) so maybe I just have a warped sense of good and bad. I do tend to overthink things and think they’re worse than they really are.

27,"I'm a PhD student, just over 1 year into my project (so 2 years to go) and this year a new PhD student joined the lab. That makes 3 of us (there was a PhD student already in the lab when I started) sharing office space. For easy of understanding I'll just name each of us by seniority, so I'm 2, the new guy is 1, and the senior is 3. 

1 is constantly making sexist, transphobic, or racist jokes. Constantly. For example, 3 and I were discussing the possibility of going on a lab visit to a nearby lab that works on similar things, when 3 said they probably wouldn't like him because he just published a conference paper showing their work was bunk. 2 decided to chime in by saying we could go to the lab and he could sexually harass the female PhD students there to 'cause a distraction' so we could 'sabotage the lab.' I have no fucking idea why he said any of that.

Another example, just yesterday I was sitting at my desk doing some data analysis and 2 walks over and asked if I know ""Sam Davidson"" (I've changed the name, but whatever.) I did - he was a lecturer i had in undergrad -, so i said yes, and 2 goes 'Its Sammie Davidson now' with a laugh. I honestly had no idea what he was talking about so i asked him and he mimed castration and laughed. 

He is doing shit like this, making sexual assault/transphobic jokes all the fucking time. When he found out I was doing some undergrad teaching this year his first question was if any of my students are hot and told me if i need any help with the girls i can ""get him to cover them.""

I don't think I can go to my Supervisor, because he clearly knows and doesn't care much. 1 is not shy about making these jokes around our supervisor, and our supervisor often laughs and simply says it's not 'lab environment appropriate' - but there has been no kind of further action. The only time our supervisor has showed any kind of concern is when some undergrads were coming to spend a few weeks in the lab for research placement, and my supervisor pulled me aside and told me very clearly that i was to *never* let 1 be in the same room as a female student without supervision by myself or 3, under any circumstances. I don't really think it should be part of my job to babysit an adult so he doesn't sexually harass someone, but apparently It is. I *think* he has sexually harassed a student in the past, because last year while 1 was doing honours in the lab a female student suddenly decided she didn't want to be involved in our lab any more, and later that week our supervisor gave us a talk about appropriate behaviour around students and placed special emphasis on the idea that sexual jokes were not appropriate. I don't actually know why she left or what happened, but i can't think of anything 3 or I may have done. 

Even apart from the sexism, he is constantly bugging me while at work by coming to my desk to show me crappy right wing memes or youtube videos, to showing me someone on tinder and asking if i think they are hot. He spent about a week trying to get me to watch a video of some Japanese game show with some girls eating a cockroach or something dumb like that . Honestly if he had been here when I started, i would have done my PhD somewhere else. Confronting him about it changes nothing - ""its just a joke"" and I ""need to stop being so sensitive""

Its a very small, tight-knitt lab and I'm afraid of rocking the boat because my supervisor clearly doesn't see much of a problem. At first i thought I might be over-reacting, but when my supervisor decided it was my responsibility to keep an eye on 1 around female students, I decided that was clear proof it's not just me overreacting. I'm pretty sure if I say anything to anyone else It'll be obviously traced back to me (especially given I have asked him to stop this shit before) and the truth is, i'm slightly intimidated by 1 because he is about 10 years older than me, bigger than me, and an ex cop who has on multiple occasions bragged about using the corruption in the force to get his way. 

I don't know what my best course of action is at this stage.

Edit: Also, I know he uses Reddit and i'm slightly concerned he will find this, but i dont know what else to do.

28,"Long story short, matched with this girl on tinder, we started talking and hit it off. We discovered that we both have an interest in video games which was cool. 

Yesterday we met up and went on a date. First thing we did was watch Ready Player One (awesome movie, highly recommend) and that part of the date was fine, we laughed at the funny bits and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. 

Afterwards we went out to eat and this is where the date went downhill fast. I’m trying to make conversation and literally everytime I asked a question, I’d get a one worded answer or a super short reply or just a head nod/shake in response. It got very frustrating after a while because that boring personality she gave off made it seem like either she wasn’t enjoying herself or she just didn’t give a crap and was there for a free meal. 

So after dropping her off at her house, I get a msg from her a few hours later saying, “it was nice to meet up.” and, “I really enjoyed myself.” and while it’s nice to hear she had fun, I didn’t and have decided it’s time to pull the plug.

31,"So, this is a serious question, and I ask you to bear with me through the backstory.  

I recently was slammed with emails for a regional congressional candidate.  I asked to be unsubscribed, but kept receiving the messages.  I wrote back to them with a message expressing my frustration and suggested that if the candidate can't honor a simple email unsubscribe request, they don't deserve my vote.  

Someone, presumably a staffer, wrote back as the candidate, apologized, and claimed they were in the process of changing email providers, and assured me it would be resolved.

The messages stopped.

Now they're back... In abundance.

So, I have a two-part question...

1.) Am I wrong to be as irritated by this as I am?  I feel like this is such a simple thing, especially in the current online privacy climate.  If you can't manage a simple email campaign in an ethical and effective way, honoring opt-out requests, how can you be trusted to handle matters of infinitely greater consequence?

2.) This candidate isn't even MY congressional candidate.  He's from an adjacent district.  So, he's been spamming me and I can't even vote for him.  I'm sufficiently convinced that he has no business being elected that I now want to work against him.  Assuming that the consensus on the first question is that I'm not being unreasonable, what can I do, ethically, to have the maximum impact on his campaign?  

.....
Side note, I've deliberately not mentioned his name or party affiliation, because I want an honest answer based on the circumstances.  I'm proudly independent and think each candidate and issue should be thoughtfully considered.  Thoughtful responses appreciated.  If you're going to be snarky, please at least be funny!",07Apr2018,7
32,"I am a 17 year old girl and a junior in high school (first year of IB). For the past half a year or so, I feel like I’ve grown increasingly sadder. I am not satisfied with my life.
However, I wouldn’t say I go long stretches without feeling happy (ish?) because I do. I know it’s normal for teenagers to get mood swings, but it’s never been like this before.
Now, I get sad and demotivated very often, much unlike I have ever been before. 

Some context:
I am an academically strong person and I have always taken school very seriously, gotten good grades and been very engaged in schoolwork. I still am, but now I often find myself completely demotivated and without reason to go on (if that makes sense). Like everything is pointless.

For anyone familiar with the IB system, it stereotypically is stressful, which I can attest to as I am doing 4 HL subjects (3 is the normal). I feel stressed out. A few weeks ago, I had a panic attack in the middle of class, which really scared me, as I’ve never had one before and it was such a bad experience. I feel very stressed out, and I’ve even gone down in work hours as a result thereof. 

At the same time, I feel used by my friends. As I’ve said, I take school seriously and I am a hard worker.
My friends don’t have the same attitude towards school, apparently. 
Right now, we are working on our TOK presentations (important presentations that count ~3.5% of our final grade), and I felt left alone with all the work. I contacted my group members (who also happen to be two of my close friends) several times about completing their parts in the group work, unsuccessfully, and I was left with it all. This is not the first time I’ve felt like I’m being taken advantage of, and it hurts a lot more since it’s by my close friends. I think the only reason they want to be in my group is because they know I am very anxious about failing and I will work hard, and not because they actually want to group with me. 

I also often feel left out of the friend group and straight up undermined at times. All friend groups do light roasts of each other, but i feel very attacked at times. Before, I’d just brush it off, but recently it seems that it doesn’t take much to ruin my whole day.
And whenever I do want to talk to someone about it, I realize that I don’t really have anyone to talk to.

However, I am not at all suicidal. In fact, I often lie awake for hours at night because I am afraid of death and what comes after. 

Now, I don’t want to make a big deal out of nothing, and I certainly don’t want to make my mom worried about me without reason.
Am I depressed? If so, how do I go about treating it?
Thanks in advance.",07Apr2018,1

I do jiujitsu, and I've noticed a slight decline and increase varying in my skills, from not knowing what to do to knowing exactly what to do going back and forth, playing with guys  above my level in one moment and then getting destroyed in another. In everyday life, I feel almost stuck in my head, can't focus that well, I feel unfulfilled, unhappy, my short term memory is not good and I feel more anxious than usual and I'm unsure what's causing it.

About 2 months ago a group of my friends all invited themselves to my house.

36,"I’m just gonna type this out in the shortest way possible because otherwise I’d sit here and write a book:

There’s this girl who I snapchatted for a bit a year ago but I fucked up because I had no confidence and she ended up just getting a boyfriend. I though she was super attractive but I got over her in a few months 

Fast forward another few months, I notice this girl in my English class; she seems quiet and doesn’t have many friends. She turns out to be the first girls sister, despite being seemingly polar opposites. She’s super attractive in my eyes and the main thing I noticed was how smart and insightful she was in class discussions. Due to my low confidence and the thought of my friends roasting me for talking to her, I went months without talking to her. I was so obsessed with her too and my life revolved around trying to talk to her. Finally, about a month ago, she for whatever reason, just isn’t in my school anymore (her sister is tho). I missed my chance and unless she comes back I’m probably never gonna see her again. 

Fast forward a month later to like two weeks ago, I get drunkenly convinced to Snapchat the first girl and I basically got rejected. She just ignored my “hey” Snapchat. I’m not mad about this because she doesn’t really know me and the only contact I’ve had with her was super shitty cuz I had no confidence in myself

Around the same time, I notice her sister made an Instagram. I was thinking about dming her just to start conversation because it’s the only chance I have but even if I do that I’m afraid I’ll look desperate and weird since I just hit up her sister

Am I fucked? Do I have any chance of talking to this girl? After some consideration I would want to at least talk to her so much more than her sister

So I've been dating my girlfriend for almost 10 months now and I'd say this is my healthiest and best relationship I've managed to cultivate with another person. Theres just one issue that's really been persisting as of late which I need some unbiased opinions on. 
So to start with I'm a person who feels love with not only emotional intimacy but physical intimacy it's a big part of how I convey my feelings. I feel that physical intimacy is a big part of a relationship for me and I always try to find someone who feels the same way. 
Now when I met my girlfriend we were intimate fairly often. We seemed to have a very steady pace for everything and it was great. However recently things have been off. 
(To preface my girlfriend has severe anxiety and depression)
When senior year of college started for us our pace of intimacy continued fairly unchanged despite the stress my girlfriend had to deal with being an RA with a very unruly floor. However, this second semester shes dropped her RA job and moved into a apartment by her school which is a hour away from my own.
So the issues that have arisen are that we haven't had sex in 6 to 7 weeks, I can hardly get her to do more than peck me on the lips, and I have to ask for her to cuddle for her to do it at all. Our emotional connection feels great but our physical connection is suffering.
Now on the front of sexual contact it's somewhat understandable because theres been bad timing such as a procedure with her OBGYN which meant no sex for a few weeks, after that ended she was on her period and now she has a  Hemorrhoid as well which further delays things and her having some body issues that make her uncomfortable with intimacy but it doesnt excuse anything else such as not really even kissing me all that much. ( I have to ask most of the time to get her to do it and even then sometimes she'll say ""no thank you"")
This situation is causing some paranoia for me on several fronts as I'm trying to find a good reasoning for all this. She could no longer find me attractive, shes a bisexual woman who hasn't been with a woman before so she could be desiring that (though shes said that's not the case) and she has all Male roommates in her apartment which makes me a bit nervous. 

So to conclude all this leaves me feeling unsatisfied and nervous. As I previously stated I like most people I would assume need physical intimacy with their partner and I'm just worried something may be going on other than health issues that's haulting our intimacy. I'd appreciate any advice that can be offered on how I should deal with this/approach it. You can also tell me what conclusions you draw from this like if I'm being silly or if shes somehow not doing enough in this scenario. I'll read all answers. Thanks!

42,"I am a female in my early 20s and lately I've been feeling SO stressed whenever I talk to my dad because he always puts down my opinions/ideas. I'm not disregarding the fact that he obviously has more life experience, but he acts like he knows more about everything and that he's always right.

Well guess what, everyone in the family except him knows that he lacks common sense but he is SO closed-minded he refuses to believe us. So whenever he asks/talks to me about his next big idea to make money (first it was a restaurant, then it's working as a home stay host for his boss's kids, then in the future maybe getting involved in a real estate business), it drives me up the wall how he blatantly ignores my strong disapproval and continues to ask for my assistance. If I refuse to help, he gets upset because ""family is supposed to help each other"".

I've told him to try to get hired at a normal full time job but he says it's too difficult (he's tried before but could only get a PT job in his field), and won't even attempt it this time. **He has never had a successful business but he has the nerve to tell me, someone with more common sense than him, that I don't know what I'm talking about (""you don't know about business"")** He also talks this way to my mom, who has a similar, sane perspective like me.

I was able to gain access to a teachers account to a website called Kickboard(a terrible points system designed for schools).I gave people multiple referrals(2 or more referrals is seen as a suspension) and set everyone to 0 as a joke knowing I could immediately remove it.I then screenshoted and sent to my friend(gonna call him Jeff for security purposes) to see how he would react.He immediately gets mad that he has a possible suspension on his record but I alert him that all of the behaviors are remmovable and that no one would track the suspension in his record(before spring break so the teachers don't look at the points of the students).While removing the behaviors fast as I can,I get a text from his sister saying that I shouldn't get in trouble and that both her and Jeff's mom know now(this is extremely important to the story).I immediately send screenshots with the behaviors fixed and that there is no suspension.Jeff immediately says he's going to tell the school about what I did.I then try multiple days to get him to stop about what's he's going to do.He first states how his mom was deciding about the situation but the second time states that HE'S not going to change his mind about  the final decision to tell the school

48,"Hi all, thanks for taking the time to read my post. I understand this is a tad long, but I really need help. I've tried asking my folks but they lose their crap anytime I ask about adulthood and tell me to figure it out on my own. I have comorbid anxiety/depression on top of ADD and OCD, and this is really eating me alive.

Been with my fiance since were barely 18 and 19.5, so nearly 4 years. Known each other since high school, and were close friends for a long time. We are crazy in love with each other, and he’s a sweetheart who treats me like a queen. He is a very loyal and puts my needs above his. We know we want to spend the rest of our lives together. That was determined within months of us dating and never changed.

Anyhow, that’s where the issue begins. He is 2 years younger and we come from VASTLY different lives. I grew up in an upper middle class house with hardworking, college educated parents who loved me and gave me everything. Most of my family has a college degree. On the other hand he grew up living under the poverty level. His parents are dropouts, jumped factory jobs, smoke and had substance issues, lived off the system at times, and he grew up in a very dysfunctional family where CPS was called numerous times. Most of the family ended up with substance issues and smoke with little education, repeating the cycle. He almost died at the hands of his mom when she refused to get him treatment for a deadly illness that almost killed him, so that kind of gives a picture of it. He dealt with a lot of major depression due to his upbringing, which is understandable. As a teen he didn’t know any different, and was following in their footsteps. However, he cleaned himself up when we got together, and I can’t even think of him as the same person he was in high school. He is very loving, hardworking, and smart.

The issue took root at the beginning. When we started dating, he was extremely depressed, passively suicidal, and didn’t know there was a life outside of that horror. Didn’t work, slept and ate all day, and just was apathetic although he showed me how much he loved me from day 1. Meanwhile I was in college, working ¾ time, building a life, etc. I had my own car I paid for. He didn’t have a license. I made him get help at wit’s end, and he changed everything. Got a car and license, full time job with OT, bought me a ring, and was very happy finally. I know he would give his life for me if it came to it. Now he wants to get an AA soon in a tech field, and is very excited to start that career, but I feel resentful at times and I don’t know how to process these feelings. 1) I had all that by 18 and my future planned out 2) I don’t see ANY reason why we aren’t married with kids yet.

When I was 20 and he was 18-19 conversations about serious future topics came up (marriage, kids, etc) and continued for the next year. He, too, does not want anyone else and all of his friends even told me how he is very attached to me. We get along great otherwise. In my mind, I thought he would marry me then and start having kids with everything sorted out ASAP. That didn’t happen, I became depressed/resentful, and told him I was ready to marry and have a family, and give up all the freedom the early 20s grant.

He explained our different backgrounds put us in different situations/points in time and wanted to take time for us to have fun, travel, spend some time with friends, grow and learn together, maybe me get another degree or 2 (he knows I am serious with education), and generally deepen our relationship. Rent an apartment and cohabitate together for a bit, then marry in 4-5 years. Enjoy our marriage for a bit, and have kids in our mid-late 20s. I told him that was the absolute DUMBEST thing I've heard yet. We’ve been together fiveever, known each other for 8 years, very close and loving partnership, and I am the type of person who’s consistent and knows exactly what she wants. Everyone comments on how well he treats me and how much we love each other and I would not trade him for anything, so breaking up is not an option at all, nor something that has ever crossed my mind.

He thinks that we are far too young to jump in and start doing adult things like marriage/kids when we barely have our feet wet and a solid foundation in this grown up world. He also didn’t have a teenhood and wants to experience some things in life he never had a chance to, but I did. He wants to get married for sure, but thinks it’d be best to wait so we can have fun and grow together, making memories. I am frustrated because 1) We didn’t get to do much/travel the first 2 years when he was coming out of depression and getting things together and I wanted to, though he has always showed an immense amount of love for me and at some points emptied his bank account to make me happy. 2) All my friends are married and have kids. Heck my 2 cousins are 19 and both have kids. I don’t know if it is because he is younger than me and guys mature slower or what, but it really upsets me.

In fact, we stopped using protection and I told him I didn’t care if he did the “deed”, and he did 3-4 times in a week. So there’s a small chance I could be having his baby now, and I asked him if that concerned him. He did this consensually, and said it would not bother him a bit as I am the only woman he wants…but it should have happened years ago.

Can someone please take the time to give me some advice on how to handle the differences in when we want to marry/have kids? My grandma thinks I am completely irrational and selfish. I can’t see things from another perspective so I’m asking reddit for help. Thank you for reading this and helping out, have a great weekend!

Tldr; My 20 year old fiancé wants to wait to get married so we can have time to have fun and grow together whilst experiencing life, especially because he grew up in an abusive home, dealt with bad depression, and didn’t have the privileges to do things I did years ago. Meanwhile, I am 2 years older and very upset he didn’t snap out of it sooner, marry me, and have kids years ago.",07Apr2018,1
49,"As the title says, I have trouble making genuine romantic connections with men. I have plenty of platonic friendships with both men and women, I am very extroverted, and I would say that I can get along with most people. However, when it comes to romantic relationships, I have always struggled to form romantic connections. Because of this, most of my relationships have been fairly casual, with a good level of sharing and respect, but no feelings of strong attachment on my end (and often none on theirs either). Over the past 3 years, I have had relationships with several different men, ranging from completely open, causal relationships to longer, more serious monogamous ones. For all of them, I genuinely enjoyed their company and the conversation, but never felt strongly attached to them. When each relationship ended for one reason or another, I was able to get over it pretty quickly. 

For the most part, the lack of emotional/romantic attachment has been mutual. There have been a couple occasions where feelings existed on his end but not on mine, and generally those relationships ended soon after we found out we didn't feel the same way about each other. 

Recently, I have had a string of 1 month flings, where we hit it off at the beginning, hang out fairly frequently for about a month, and then the initial excitement seems to fizzle out and we are left without much of anything. I feel uncomfortable initiating highly emotional conversations, but I have tried to break out of this in an attempt to make deeper connections. I have tried opening up about deeper topics (my childhood, religious/political beliefs, my hopes and dreams, etc) but it doesn't seem to help much with how romantically connected I feel to them. This isn't to say that I don't respect or care about the men I date, but I have yet to feel a deep attachment/romantic feelings. ",07Apr2018,7

53,"I'll try to sum this up in as few words as possible while still providing the best possible description of the scenario. There are many problems rolled into one here.

I met a girl at work a few months and she has been dropping hints right and left for months now. I became attracted to her mostly after she expressed interest in me. But I remained hesitant about making any moves because we're so different as people. She likes country music, I mostly don't. She's a holy roller, I'm more of an agnostic. She's more conservative and I'm on the Bernie side of the political spectrum. I could work with all that, I guess, but there's more to this story.

She just got divorced. I heard through the grapevine it was because she cheated with a dude I pretty much hate. Have ever since high school. And this was his girlfriend all throughout high school.

Furthermore, someone in my immediate family acted like a real creep a few years ago and caused a lot of jealousy issues and as a result someone else in my immediate family resents this girl's family, and this girl by extension. And it has already caused very bad conflict just because I've expressed interest in this girl around them. And bad is the understatement of the century.

Furthermore, there's a chance we might be distant cousins.

I've put making a move off so long that I think she got as direct as she would get about a week ago and now she pretty much just ignores me anyway while chatting up the geriatric Casanova of the office.

Maybe I just talked myself out of pursuing her at all. But I'm fickle, so chances are I'll rationalize away every bit of it. Life is hell right now and it's making me sick.

55,"Hi. I'm in tenth grade, and I plan on majoring in Criminology. Problem is, my mother doesn't really let me leave the house. At all. I can't get a job, I don't have any extracurriculars, and I can't play sports because she thinks they're 'too violent for girls'. I have afterschool classes from 3-9, three hours of art class, dinner, and three hours of Chinese Monday to Friday, with three hours of Chinese on weekends. 

She plans on me somehow getting into the best university in our area (UBC), and then staying at home and working at her business. I'm trying my best to give myself the best opportunities possible - applying for weekend volunteer opportunities at my school, joining our school's 'Peer Listening' program to receive training in helping those with mental illnesses, and I plan on taking Law 12, English 12, and Bio 12 next year so that I can have as many credits as I can get.

However, the 3-9 afterschool class schedule is really getting to me, and my grades have dropped to mainly B's, with one or two As and a C in math due to the fact that I *simply don't have time to do homework* and I end up staying up till 3am most days trying to complete it all, occasionally staying up till 5. I usually spend two hours after class translating her emails and helping her with work documents because she can't speak any English. Asking her for more time to do homework and less time in after school classes is out of the question, because she doesn't want me wasting time and I already am because she used to be able to finish her homework in two hours, unlike me.

58,"So. First time poster, occasionally lurker, though mainly on other subreddits. But all my normal advice sources haven't helped me out. 

I need advice.

My best friend (BF) got married a year ago to a trans- identifying person (S). I didn’t know S well but they seemed ok. Except. Now S doesn’t have a job. And has claimed all the rejections (they’ve only applied to a handful of jobs in the last 6 months) were due to discrimination either for being trans- or being disabled. This is certainly not the case in at least two of the jobs. One, they simply did not have the required skills. The other, they refused to turn in paperwork proving certification. 

S also has a habit of turning every type of criticism into attack on themselves. Uncle suggests you revisit your financial choices so you can afford a [expensive but necessary item]? Poverty shaming and saying that since S is poor and disabled they don’t deserve to live. 

BF loves this person. BF is dropping family members who love and support her because she is taking S’s side of things. S is pushing her to go full No Contact.

I don’t know if S is knowingly abusive. However, their behavior is abusive and is isolating BF. She is supporting them both on her part time salary, yet S doesn’t contribute anything. Doesn’t clean the house (it is a shithole), rarely cooks, buys takeout all the time. Is super financially irresponsible. Doesn’t seem to be trying to get a job. 

Like, I get that disability is a real thing. I have one. But I do my best to support my spouse. When I have good days, I spend them cleaning up the house and cooking. 

I’ll be visiting BF in a few weeks. (I live thousands of miles away). How do I talk to her about this? I want her to see that S’s reactions are not only inappropriate, but they are insulting to her family and friends. S needs to take some responsibility for themselves. Yeah, they’ve been dealt a shitty hand. But life isn’t going to get any better by sitting on their ass and having a pity party. And by doing so, they are actively making things worse for BF and themselves because they are pushing away anyone who would be in a position to help them both. 

I want her to see what S is doing to her, even if S isn’t doing it out of malice. And I want her to have some boundaries. Yes, marriage is about supporting your spouse. But it is also about calling your spouse out on their shit when they need to be called out. I just don’t even know how to begin.

63,"I’ve been feeling really down and lonely lately, and I made the regrettable decision of visiting a massage parlour for sexual services (I live in a country where sex work is legal).

The woman I was with was very nice and accommodating and used a condom when we initially began PIV sex, but I went soft and she took it off. Later, when I was hard again, we had a minute of unprotected sex before I got worried and put on a condom and came inside later during PIV.

The woman I was with reassures me that I shouldn’t worry about pregnancy or any diseases, although the thought of the chance of either event occurring kept slipping into my mind.

When I visited the parlour again the day after, I was told that all the women who worked in the parlour were safe and maintained safe sex practices (they assure me that my brief incident of unprotected sex was a one off, and told me not to do it again). The lady running the parlour informed me that I had nothing to worry about and called the woman I was with to take a contraception pill. 

Despite these reassurances, I still have my doubts and I’m worried sick. I have booked an STI test in a week and a HIV test in three months from now as a precaution.

 I feel that I cannot share this event with anybody in my life for fear of judgement and it hurts having to deal with the anxiety and fear I feel alone. I wish I could confide with somebody about how I feel, and my mother or my best friend seem to be the best people in my life to confide into, although I am unsure of what their response would be.

Registration at the door is only $10 extra, but I'd rather not pay more than I need toI could also take my chances and miss a few panels and events to work, but I don't foresee myself being able to attend the convention next year for academic reasons (I'm currently home taking the semester off) and I want to maximize my time with my friends.

66,I have these two friends. Friend A suffers with autism. He has a terrible relationship with his father and wishes harm upon him with good reason the man was awful. Then there is freind B who suffered with depression and I don't really know what place he is in in his mind because hides it well. Now freind A is not talking to his family about his problems anymore and he seems to have developed drug and alcohol misuse. He was holding his head over the toilet crying and saying how he has to worry about other people all the time. Freind B has been sleeping with a girl on and off and kind of having a strange affair whilst with other partners. Another girl is now involved in with this strange relationship and freind B seems more interested in him and she is jealous. I don't know how true this is but freind A ended up losing his Virginity in a threesome with both the girls. Freind B claimed not to care about him doing this but one of the girls is apparently really annoyed by something. And some how both friends are becoming distant and one is freaking out and not talking to his family and looks to be depressed. I really want to help but there are so many piece's of the puzzle that need filling in. Any body understand the situation ,07Apr2018,6

Okay, so, I've always been way more comfortable and happier in busier and more active environments. Big cities, yknow? But I've lived in very, very small towns my whole life here in Michigan. I've decided I wanted to move to Chicago because it's a beautiful Midwestern city that I've seen multiple times before, and if I get homesick, Lake Michigan is right there! But (and again, this is stupid) I'm really worried about what 'native born' people in Chicago would think. And I know I shouldn't care at all, but since I've been in a small town my whole life, I'm afraid I won't fit in, yknow? Is there any way that can prepare me for a much larger city, or a way that I can feel more assured that I'll be fine?

I usually never have had a problem with self-confidence, and don't really feel a need to compare myself to anyone, but I mean it when I say that she is better at literally everything. She's prettier than me, skinnier than me, has a perfect GPA, and everyone loves her. In all the time that I have known her, all of these things didn't cause any jealousy and they were part of the reason why I loved her and liked spending time with her. Things didn't start to become a problem for me until recently. We are both a part of a research lab and are co-lab mangers. Because she is so good at everything, people usually turn to her for help and I feel as though I get little to no recognition for the work that I do there because she is always doing more and doing it better. She is obviously the preferred option for our mutual friends to hang out with, as all eyes are on her the moment she walks into a room; everyone is always really happy to see her. And recently, she has been awarded a very prestigious grant that is basically going to set her up for whatever she wants to do in the future. I am THRILLED for her, and so proud because she works her ass off for everything that she does. And I know I sound whiney but there is truly no one else I can talk to about it. I feel like my sprint is the equivalent of her jog. I have tried multiple times to come somewhere close to her level of achievement in everything but she is always 10 steps ahead of me.

K so I’m going through puberty and I have a “full bush” and everything and I need help on how to shave. It’s really stressing me out cause my mom is awkward about these things and doesn’t want me to shave and prefers that I use cream, but I’m not going to.
I legit just use water. I don’t use lotion or anything. And basically my main question is, where do I shave? Like I know I’m supposed to shave the big part of your vagina, where most of the hair grows, but what about the area where you like pee and stuff? I have hair there. Is that normal? Am I supposed to shave that? K honestly I sound really gross, but I don’t know who to ask. I have a really awkward family who are very modest and don’t talk about these things. My mom also never told me about sex, and she never explained periods. She just showed me how to use a pad and gave me a box. She assumed I learned everything at school or from friends, but I’d rather learn from the woman who gave birth to me... it’s easier to understand when she’s there.

83,"Sorry if this is a bit rambly.

Growing up with just my Dad (now he is 60 years old) he has always been an outdoors fanatic.  That is his main passion in life. We hunt in a group with 2 hunt camps on lots of property and only crown land around us for miles.   Both camps are owned by 80 year olds.  When they die there is most likely no more opportunity to go out to this spot. The one 80 year old is willing to sell his camp with 100 acres for 30k.  I will get 23500 back from my taxes this year because I put so much into my RRSPs. As well they will buyback my diesel VW SUV for 25.5k to 32k. 

I am 37 and do contract work and my wife still has a great job too when she goes back to work after a few more years. I feel like spending 30k is a minimal life setback. We have a 5 month old son and still are able to get a mortgage with only 5% down.  
I feel like time is running out to get this hunt camp so if that is ever going to happen it has to be soon and I will never be able to do this again as I now have other savings obligations.  My Dad has mentioned to me several times over the last 10 years if I ever bought the camp we could do such and such and blah blah blah, if I did buy it he would be over the moon happy and I would have a place to take my son and we would always have a place to go.  Even now for fun he goes out and cuts trails and stuff 3+ times a week  and its not even his place. He just lives this stuff and I know it would make his life to have our own place

The alternative option to spend the money on is to stretch hard and get a 4plex as a rental property or some kind of main street commercial store front with a couple apts above it.  This is the long slow wealth accumulation route.

The other possibility is to buy a run down place and reno and resell it.  We would repeat this reno resell process a few times and hopefully grow our nest egg until we are required to settle down in one location for my son to start school in a few years.  Most likely then buying a house to live in. 

I know if we just go and buy a dream house to live in will be a very long time before I can get get enough equity in it to buy an investment property.  The hunt camp is a now or never thing and the fourplex or big investment property will lock us out of buying a dream house for 7 to 10 years.  

I am really not sure which option is best.  Any advice is appreciated,  thanks in advance.

I saw these comments, even though these comments weren’t towards me i still saw them. He had said something racist but in a joking matter. So i screenshotted what he said and sent it to my other friends. I showed them what they said and told them to go about roasting him in school. As i didn’t go to the same school. 20 min after i sent the text. We will say brian (the person who commented on the post) saw that he was being exposed and roasted at school. My friends we will say jack and will both showed brian what i sent them. They started roasting him again. But this time like 10 other people saw. The other people were a little shocked by what brian had commeneted. Brian claimed it was photoshopped and not real. But before he could delete the comment other people saw. When he came home that day he was so stressed out. He immediately texted me saying how could i do that to him. Keep in mind me and brian were great friend that told eachither everything and had been best of friends for 3 years. Brian was really mad and devastated of what i had shown his other friends. He told me he said it jokingly and ik then that i had fucked up big big time. I kept pleading Brian that I was sorry and would never do such a thing again. And time and time again he rejected. Still shocked i had showed everyone what he said. But since this was on instagram everyone could have found out but nobody cared enough. Except me. This one thing Brian had said started the biggest drama I will ever experience. Everyone by now had pictures of what he said so no matter what happened we couldn’t go back. I kept and kept saying I was sorry. Trying to come up with an excuse to tell his friends what had happened. Like photoshop or something. Or that i had actually said it. I would do anything to go back in time. And i mean anything. But that can’t happen. If the teachers find out about this he could very well be expelled. But brian is a really really really great guy. He always has your back. And now i didn’t have his. What brian said is spreading like wildfire. And i just wish it could stop. Brian Deleted his deactivated his instagram. And doesn’t respond to anything I say anymore. And i feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world. I showed everyone what he had said. I don’t know what to do. Everyone is blaming him and not me.

My friend from high school says he's a friend but I almost always have to initiate with the texting, and he only visits me once a year. We live 5 miles from each other.

Another friend from high school never answers when I text. But when I come see him he acts like I'm the coolest guy in the world.

One of my friends from college I have to initiate texting always and more then half the time she doesn't answer. She hasn't visited me in two years. She invited me to her wedding next year but I feel like it was more out of pity.

The other friend from college I had problems getting a hold of: but then she got on meth and you can't ever get a hold of.

My oldest cousin was my best friend in the world and we were inseparable. But she died November before last.

My second cousin and I are close friends. But he lives in Memphis and is a teacher. So I barely get to see him or get to hear from him. And we weren't as good of friends till the oldest cousin died. I feel like it's more out of pity.

My therapist is a great listener but I pay her.

Dated a girl for 4 years, and she moved in for 3 of them. She had issues like bulimia and separation anxiety. However she was also codependent on me to make her happy. So not a very healthy relationship.

I pretty much had to drag her out the door to go on a 3 month trip, by herself, so she can find some independence. I was very happy cause it was what we both needed. 

When she returned to my surprise she left me the day she got back and I was blind sided. She stayed at a friend's and I packed everything of hers out of my house. I was very mad and upset about it.

A week passes and realize I don't get what's going on and that there is no need for this all. So we met up and talked about everything. I figure out she is finally confident and feels like herself and has her own voice. I was very happy. She left me cause she didn't want to fall back into her habbits. 

Now after seeing each other we agree to go on a date in about a month from now and we don't talk right now. She basically wants to do what she always wanted do which i never had a problem with. 

I know she wants to be with me by listening closely to her. She says like can we have a date sooner? And also says I wish I could just go to the gym with you and have a normal day.


Now did I deserve this all? Why was she so quick to leave and not just say I need to move out not break up? Should I wait for her or is it cause I have no self respect? I like to believe I'm doing the right thing cause I love her obviously but I don't like being a doormat. Thanks for your time.

99,"So a little bit of back story... I've been married to my husband for over 2 years now and we have a one year old son. We met online and it was a bit of a whirl wind romance. Five months after we met, we got married and then three months later we found out we were pregnant. We didn't plan on having kids so soon but it happened even though I was on birth control. My family has loved my husband from day one and my husband's family loves me. Our parents get along so well, they are the best of friends. His family lives in New York and he is in the military stationed here in California. My parents live about 4 hours away so they come here and visit us about once a month or so. My son is my mother's first grandson and she is so happy because I always said I was never going to have children. 

So anyways! My husband is pretty liberal and my parents are both conservative. We always try to avoid political discussions, especially when we are drinking. We've had political discussions in the past and it's always been fine and everyone does their best to behave and respect eachother's opinions. About 4 weeks ago while my parents were here for the weekend, everyone had a little too much wine and my husband also decided whiskey was a good idea too. We got into the discussion about guns and the conversation went from civil to argumentative pretty quickly. My husband and my mom were pretty heated in their argument and kind of in eachother's faces and my husband ended up calling my mom ""fucking ignorant"" and I was just crying and didn't know what to do. After he said that, he kind of snapped out of it and was confused about why they were yelling at eachother and they hugged it out and we all went to bed.

That was Friday night when they got here and they were staying until Sunday. The next day, Saturday, my husband felt terrible and didn't even remember calling my mom ignorant. I could tell it was really weird and awkward for my mom the next day but it was my birthday so I was just trying to enjoy the day and we hung out and we had cake and everything seemed ok and my mom even joked about the night before and how we can just move on. My husband tried to apologize to my mom but she just shut him down. 

On Sunday morning I was up with our son and letting my husband sleep in a bit. Usually my parents leave around noon when they spend the weekend with us. I noticed my parents were packing and getting ready to go at like 9am and I knew exactly why. Before they left my mom pulled me aside and told me that they almost left the day before and that her feelings are hurt and that she feels disrespected and how she feels like this incident is going to change her (extremely close) relationship with my husband. All I could do was apologize and cry. I mentioned how I know he tried to talk to her about it and apologize and she basically said she won't accept it. I told her that it will only effect her relationship with him if she lets it. She said she just needs time. 

My husband is a good man and he is about near perfect in my eyes but I know that no one is perfect and everyone makes mistakes. Him and my mom have been so close from day one... he even calls her Ma. My husband feels terrible about what happened and he was pretty upset that she just left without talking to him or saying goodbye. He's really easy to talk to and has no problem owning up to his mistakes. Unfortunately my mom has a history of holding grudges and not being able to let go of things. There's a reason we don't talk to most of our family... she harbors so much resentment over every little thing and can't get over anything. It took a long time for me and her to have a close relationship and part of it is because of this. I've ended relationships with family because of her issues of not being able to let things go but my husband and my son are my number one priority and I have my husband's back. I've talked to my mom a few times since this has happened and I can tell it's awkward for her when I mention my husband's name. My husband still sends her pics of our son and he doesn't hold anything against her. I'm worried about how this will effect future visits. Recently when I talked to her, I felt like she was asking me and my son to come visit without saying out right not to bring my husband. I feel like she's going to hold onto this so hard that it's going to be too hard for her to come visit again. I feel like it's effected our relationship and I'm afraid she's going to miss alot of time with her grandson. I just don't know what to do at this point and I'm so bad at dealing with confrontation. Send help. 

tl:dr my husband called my mom fucking ignorant during a political argument after everyone had drank too much wine and I don't know how to deal with it. ",07Apr2018,6
102,"So this is a long complex story I’m going to try my best here to condense. I made this account as a throwaway because I remember showing my friend my main account a long time ago. So I’m a 28 year old male and my friend is same age but female. I’ve known my friend, “Tara”, since summer 2013. I’m autistic and was home schooled. I lived a very sheltered life. My brother and my cousins were raised separate by my grandma. I was raised by my grandmas sister who was like my real mom passed away in 2016. My bio mom died in 2017 of terminal cancer my dad was mia my whole life. I got my ged in 2012 and started going to school in 2013. I’m still in college, since transfered to major university and have struggled with math. I’m majoring in English, want to be a writer and am just starting my fiction novel. I also want to be a blogger and podcaster. Only ever had one job, 5 days as a telemarketer in 2012. Don’t have a car. Live at a house owned by my grandma rent free, same house I’ve been in my whole life. Since my great aunt died I’ve been the one using my studen load money to pay utilities. I’ve donated my plasma since 2008 when I turned 18 for money. I don’t have disability or food stamps, not on meds either. I live alone and it kills me. My grandma wants to now sell the house and is telling me to get on disability. I want to get a job at Walmart or Sams Club doing backroom loading like my brother did. Semester ends on May 1st and I plan to apply for jobs using vocrehab set up by my case manager and hopefully work all summer long and plan on returning to school in fall. Have 30k in student debt and also need to pay utilities, phone bill and food/clothes. My grandma is over here everyday now clearing stuff out and yelling at me. My cousin came over and stole 3 months worth of prepaid phone cards and my grandma is mad that I accused him but who else would have taken them? I’m scared to leave my only home I’ve ever known but soon I’ll have to move out and get an apartment. The other thing contributing to my depression is the loss of my very best friend Tara. She is getting married in 2 months with her fiancé who she lives with and has known since high school and they have a young daughter. In 2013/14 we hung out allot and she helped me get over depression from a sexual assault and a loss of a therapist. Was the only friend who showed up to my birthday one year. I met and lover her family. But since early 2015 (past 3 years) she now only hangs out if we are with her sister and the sisters boyfriend. There have only been 3 or 4 such meetings. One time I saw Tara for 5 minutes at Walmart. The other times now I can see her is when I have to pay money to eat at the restaurant she works at. She loves it when I come by. I always make sure to bring her her favorite flavor of Powerade and leave as best a tip as I can. We have fun but we can barely talk because the restaurant is always busy. It’s expensive for me too. I miss being able to hang out with her one on one. I think her boyfriend thinks I like her in a romantic way but I don’t. She’s like my sister. Now that my aunts gone it’s Tara and my grandma who are my only family left. I can’t talk to my grandma about anything really. Anyway I need to know how I can learn to live independently, get my best friend back, get and hold a job and find a way to overcome the writers block and finish my novel. Any advice would help and again I’m sorry this is so long I’m just a very messed up person. Lots of anxiety and fear and procrastination, eating disorders, lonileness and lack of social skills. I’m terrified of ending up homeless and fear I’m going to get cancer like my mom did. ",07Apr2018,1
104,"Right now I’m in college, barely scrapping by with C’s. I used to be a straight A student but as I went deeper down the major it’s become too hard for me. 

Unless a miracle happens, I (along with almost everyone) will have to finish college to get a job. But it’s become too difficult and I’m not passionate for any subjects, I chose my
Major simply because I found myself to be good at it, well, up until now. 

But my GPA is shot and I have nothing else going for me. College is the only
Option I can see. There has to be more choices, more routes to take. 

I feel lost. Don’t know what to do. There is no plan B C or D, just plan A which is College, and I suck at it.

105,"I have 4 friends. A, B, C and D. Lately I've only hung around A, B and C. Mostly because D really hurt my feelings. The other three tell me they don't want to hang around with her anymore since she's just not that fun to be around anymore. And she hurt my feelings.

A few days back I asked A, B and C if we could hangout on Friday. I got some really lame excuses but thought nothing of it. That was until I heard that D was hanging out with A, B and C.

I don't mind them hanging out but why lie? And why tell me you don't want to anymore and still do later on?",07Apr2018,0
106,"16/female 

As of yesterday, I was informed by my school deputy wardens (they’re second to the principal) that a group (they don’t know who or how many) of my friends have gone to the principal and made allegations that I write sex stories about myself and a teacher that I’m quite close to (platonic relationship only) and that I’ve made a sims family where I’ve killed of the teachers husband and then got married and had kids with the teacher. All of which are lies. 

Now after hearing all of that, the teachers told me that I have to go to school next week and pretend like nothing has happened. “Business as usual” they said. 

However, it’s not even the fact that someone’s made these allegations that is eating at me, it’s the not knowing what one of my so-called friends has said these things. Especially now, having to go back to school and hang with them and just pretend like my life hasn’t just gone ass over tit. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to act around people, I don’t even know who to trust anymore; I need some advice.

My parents are really not supportive at all, and right now I've found myself with pretty much only two people I can go too; which is A) My really close friend who I can tell anything or B) My boyfriend, which I'm so afraid to tell him even though I *really* need to talk to him and let him know how I feel. I keep reverting back to when I first met him, it's like I'm scared too get to close because I'm scared of getting hurt! 

My friend already knows about how I feel. But I feel like a nuisance to my boyfriend lately. He hasn't displayed any annoyance towards me though, so I'm not sure why I'm freaked out really.

108,"I can get into the details if you like, but im trying to make this accommodating and bite sized for the Reddit audience;

Following a minimum wage increase which landed our temp workers making the same as Mcdonalds workers, the factory i work at restructured its wages and left alot to be desired- the employees with the greatest seniority were told they are on a wage freeze for at least the next two years, while others were told their work wasnt satisfactory enough and were placed on the bottom of a new system, putting people with 1 year experience on equal footing as people with 10 years. 

As far as i can tell, no one was rated above satisfactory in the entire plant.

We were told we would basically have to learn another department before we would see another raise, and since we didnt achieve something we were never asked to do, we were merely baseline. Also, we werent given the resources to learn another department. Or the time. But its our fault.

And so, with a company constantly leaving us shorthanded and forcing us to balance multiple jobs at once, and with the temps going from 3 dollars over minimum wage to 1, there isnt any time to wander over to another department, bother the people working there, and ask them to do something that isnt their job(since our company has a crew of trainers)- and since failing to achieve this is OUR fault, we will fail to see a pay increase next year.

Needless to say, alot of talk is going on about unions. I hate the idea of an union- but clearly were being hoodwinked here, and we need to force a change.

115,"My English is not my native language so I'm sorry if my writing is not very good and there are sentences that don't make sense.. 

Right now I feel so guilty and ashamed of my past because I was a bystander when someone in my class was bullied 3years ago. 
I'm living in a different country now and I wasn't really close to that kid, I never interacted or even had a conversation with him at school so I can't find a way to contact him to apologize.. I just wasn't close to my classmates in general. 
He was that 'creepy kid' in school. He often said or did weird things in class and he didn't really listen to teachers, so other kids didn't like him very much, including me. 
I remember the time when he suddenly fell and lied on the ground pretending to cry loudly when the bully only touched him slightly, so I laughed a little, because I didn't expect that random reaction. But then the bully saw me and said "" look even she is laughing"" cause I was that shy kid who's always quiet and don't speak in class. so I felt bad that I laughed. The bully kicked that kid who was on the ground. I feel terrible now because I felt like I was siding with the bullies that time. What if the bullies thought I mocking the kid so they decided to bully him more..?  Did I become a bully too?
It also seemed that the kid was also bullied by other boys from other classes. It was painful to watch him getting beaten from them. 
I know that him being creepy and weird doesn't mean that he deserve to be bullied and the boys beating him was just wrong, but I didn't ask teachers for help or report it to somewhere anyway because I was a coward and didn't want anything bad to happen to me. I wanted to report it. I wanted to somehow help the kid but I was such a coward. I didn't want to get involved. And that was wrong. I really should have reported. 

I keep telling myself that I can't change the past and I need to move on and should try not to make the same mistakes, but then again why do I deserve to live a happy and comfortable life when that kid could still be suffering over his memory of getting bullied? What if he even committed suicide without me knowing it..?  Isn't it unfair to him ?
Why should I be having fun watching TV right now when I deserve to be punished ? Why should I want to acheive my dream when he may have not acheived his dream because of my selfishness ? I just can't seem to forgive myself. It feels like it's unfair to him for wanting to make myself happy.. 
The spring break is almost over and all I was doing for the entire week was laying in bed regretting my past. I can't focus on my study, my hobby, nothing. I can't even wake up in the morning without thinking about this. I always stop in the middle of doing something because I'm distracted by the fact that I was a bystander to bullying. I don't know how to survive this. I want to live normally but I feel like It's wrong to think like that... Do I really deserve to move on from this guilt ?  ",07Apr2018,1

We did the nasty and she stopped it early saying her stomach hurts. Later on in the day we got frisky again, she said it’s fine and we had sex again, this time I came in the condom. 

She said her stomach hurts again, she felt uncomfortable and wants to take the morning after pill. So to be safe we bought one and she took it. 

Her stomach got progressively worse during the day and then at 2am I get a text from her that she is in serious pain (worst she has ever experienced) and is at the hospital.

So I'm friends (kind of) with this girl. I've never had a face-to-face conversation with her, but we have many mutual friends and I see her everyday. Almost once a week, she has a panic attack. I try to be a decent person and give her space, help her clean up afterwards, etc. but the entire thing stresses me out. How am I supposed to know what to do?

I feel like I always have to play adult and make sure she's okay. I don't know why I'm always doing all this when her actual friends just ignore it for some reason? Like, I don't even know her. What am I supposed to say? Not only that, but people told me she's suicidal so I can't exactly be irresponsible and just leave. 

All this makes it impossible to work with her. Every time something becomes even mildly inconvenient, she'll start panicking. Every time this happens, it's awkward and no-one knows what to do. We lose hours because of this, and honestly it wastes everyone's time. People including me are there to work, not deal with this. And if she walks out, I have to spend hours looking for her because I feel like that's the normal, responsible thing to do. I'm so exhausted doing all this for someone who I don't even know. 

I feel like she should get actual help, but it's not really my place to say. No offense, but I don't know how she's going to get through real life or hold a job if she breaks down over every little thing! It's not like the rest of us don't have issues.

126,"I've always been interested in programming and software development. So much so that I taught myself how to program at 14 years old. I got my first job straight out of high-school helping to build mobile apps for a big software firm. 

In my job I realised that the one other developer that I worked with had a pHD in computer science, and to me at least, it didn't seem worth going to uni to study a bachelor of computer science if I could end up with the same job as the dude I was working with. So being that I preferred the idea of management and business, I opted for doing a commerce degree majoring in marketing and entrepreneurship instead of comp sci.

In my first semester of uni I was in a group with a guy freelancing and making websites. He noticed that I could program (as I brought my work into uni), and we joined forces and started up a web development and app business together. 

We're two years in, and have 8 staff in total (including my business partner and I). I'm making $45,000 a year, and we're growing super fast. I'm still at uni as I've been afraid to give it up in case the business doesn't get quite as big as I want it to. We've gotten some big clients, and I've met a lot of good contacts, and I know that I could find another job very quickly if I needed to. 

All while building my business, I've still been pursuing my university degree. It has taken the backseat and I've often skipped classes in favour of my career. I've constantly switched from part time to full time, back to part time. Lately my business has gained a lot of momentum and I've had to put in night hours for it too which is usually when I do my uni work. Between uni and my business I don't have a whole heap of time to myself. These past few weeks I haven't even had the time to cook, or do groceries since I've been that busy. 

Throughout my whole time at uni I felt like I haven't gotten any education value out of it, and I'm more just doing it for the sheet of paper with my name on it. Is getting a degree still worth it, is my experience running a business enough? I'd much prefer to focus on my efforts on building a business rather than half-assedly doing a degree that isn't teaching me anything, but I'm afraid to take the leap in case uni degrees are still respected, my business fails and I need to find another job.

""Oh so that way you know how I felt. I don't like the idea of you two together because I think she deserves better but who am I to judge. But if it doesn't work out I wasn't kidding about being her rebound guy I'll gladly make her happy.""

130,"I am a 17 year old female from the US. I’m on my alt account because my other account is well-connected with my name, face, and athletic career. I don’t want to say what sport I do because I’m semi-famous/well known within the realm of that sport, particularly for being ranked 3rd in my position in the US. I’m sorry if that’s confusing but I can’t really afford to let a family member, coach, recruiter, etc see this.

I started doing this sport when I was a freshman in high school and now I am a junior. I got good at it abnormally fast and I’ve been competing on the National and international stage for the past 2 years. My freshman and sophomore years I went to a normal public high school, which is where I started playing the sport. While I was perceived to be a promising athlete with a supportive family by my friends, the school, community, etc, my personal and home life was hell. 

In the past 3 years since I’ve started this sport I’ve been seriously injured multiple times, been raped by a teammate, gone through racist verbal abuse from members of a different team, attempted suicide and have been in inpatient care 3 times, been suspended from school for displaying mental health issues, been mentally and physically abused by my father, and been emotionally abused and neglected by my mother. Both of my younger siblings (f15, m11) hate me and I have a older half brother who abandoned me as a baby who I didn’t know about until a a year ago. Obviously all this is causing me enormous amounts of stress and emotional turmoil. I also have a serious fear and disdain for going to therapy. Imagine being handcuffed and being forced to do something you don’t want to do and decide if you would do that particular thing voluntarily if given the chance. Yeah, inpatient sucks ass.

Like I said, I did the sport at regular school freshman-sophomore year. In my junior year I was sent to boarding school in a different state by my parents so I would get better at the sport. That is where I faced racial discrimination from my teammates and was forced to go back home for three weeks for displaying signs of depression aka I didn’t have any friends and I was often sick from stress. I went back for a few more months but in January of this year I decided I couldn’t take it anymore. When I was on winter break at home, I decided I wouldn’t go back and forced my parents’ hand to dis enroll me from boarding school. 

I didn’t believe that I was mentally stable enough to go back to public school (my rapist would be there, and I everyone there hated me). So, I enrolled in a home school program that would let me take online courses. Great, right? Wrong. In order for me to take these online courses, my parents (dad in particular) made the decision to force me to keep doing the sport at a rigorous pace or else he will force me to go back to public school. I can’t keep it up. I love the sport but I am mentally weak from all this stress and turmoil from the past 3 years that I don’t know if I can continue. I have an athletic college scholarship but I might lose it because I’m failing at doing my homeschool courses and I’m not currently training. 

I’m at a loss of what to do. My parents plan on kicking me out as soon as I turn 18 and because I don’t have a GED or job or even a drivers license, I’d be helpless. I’m already so behind in course work that my dad has told me that I have no hope in graduation on time, as there’s some sort of deadline in 3 weeks to turn in my work for junior year. No graduation=no scholarship and I will probably get that yanked anyways because I haven’t been competing in the last few months and my ranking will inevitably drop from #3 to possible out of the top 15.

I honestly really just hate my life and I hate myself because I have caused most of my problems and can’t seem to do anything right. I have zero emotional support from my family and I quite literally have zero friends because I don’t go to school or get any socialization. I spend my days doing coursework (which I’m horrible at) and browsing reddit. I’m getting fat and out of shape and I’ve completely let myself go. Please help me reddit.

Lately that girl has been really mean, saying things like I’ll end up in the gutter (I want to study games, 3D visual arts) that I’m a know-it-all, that everyone thinks that and that no one likes me. And that I’d be nothing without her. 
It’s just been shitty.
What bothers me the most is that she, or my entire class/school for that matter. Thinks is acceptable to threaten someone (she said over text she wants to punch me in the fucking face) or say hurtful things.

I can’t escape them, I want to leave that place so badly, I don’t agree with those ideas and I just have no back up at all besides teachers.
I’m really really scared to go back to school next Monday. I get shaken en sad whenever I get vocally attacked, and she seems to enjoy getting mad at people and confronting them.
It feels like the entire class is against me and I just can’t anymore. All I want is just follow my studies in peace and I really don’t get what I did wrong.",07Apr2018,3
133,"I'm a junior in high school thinking about college not knowing what in the world I'm going to do so yeah ""computer science"" like I know what you can do with computer programming in general and that they're branches of computer science like web development, data analysis, etc. but when I get hired by a company what kind of work am I expected to be doing?

134,"I've been a bicurious guy (I'm 19) for many years now and never knew whether I was actually bi or just sexually curious. I have had a girlfriend for 2 years now and I love her more than anything and we rarely have problems or argue. But about 5 months ago it was getting way too much in my head and I had to know if I was bi or not. I couldn't live the rest of my life not knowing. And as I plan to spend the rest of my life with this girl I thought it would be best if I got it out the way and found out what it was like to be with a man.

Now I have always been very against cheating and for some reason I never thought of experimenting with a guy to be cheating before I did it. I would never ever cheat on her with another girl so I'm assuming I thought because I've never actually been attracted to a man it was more of a disconnected experience similar to watching porn, if anyone understands what I mean.

So I posted an ad on Craigslist and met up with an older guy who replied and I thought sounded like a decent guy. I went to his house and I did some stuff with him, we didn't have sex but did other things, and I was on the verge of tears the whole time, but I just forced myself to continue with it I don't know why. It made it worse that I found out he was married and had kids etc. I felt awful. I hated the experience. I had betrayed my girlfriend and I had only just realised it. I've felt awful every day for 5 months and want nothing more than to take it back. Nothing good came of it besides obviously realising I'm not bi, but at the price of betraying my gf it was not worth it.

I've debated telling her but I decided I shouldn't as breaking her heart just to alleviate my guilt is so selfish and I've already been selfish in doing this. I would never ever do this again but it I did happen to then I would have to break up with her as this definitely wouldn't be fair, but life isn't so black and white always so at this stage I will stay with her and try and forgive myself for a mistake I will never do again and keep it a secret. I don't think there's any way she will find out as I asked the guy to delete any emails etc and not speak of it to anyone and he was like yeah sure and same with you, neither wanted the other to be exposed so he said not to worry about it. I also used a fake name and email and phone number etc. And she's never asked about it as I did it when she was out although she's wondering why I've been so down the past few months. 

I can't have anybody find out. Not her. Not my family. Not anyone as I'm from a strict religious family and my gf is also strictly religious. I did some online therapy to get this off my chest and they said that obviously this was a mistake and I shouldn't tell her if I want to stay with her and  that at least I now know I'm not bi and that now I can keep her happy as I have been all this time but without having these bicurious feelings in my head any longer. 

I'm just worried he might tell her if I ever bump into him. But I have his address, phone number etc and he has no reason to tell her. He is married anyway so I don't think I have anything to worry about? 

And how do I forgive myself and stop feeling bad for this? I can't eat or sleep. I'm not a bad person, ive just been wondering for years and had to find out before I were to get married in the future. I want our relationship to go back to normal but obviously no one can find out about this?

135,"TL;DR: Long time video game addict, loses College enrollment due to video games (Going on third time), bottles up feelings, has to work to financially support self, no clue for career path, never has been in a relationship, and completely lost.


So, I'm not entirely sure where to start. But I guess I'll explain to the best of my abilities. Currently now, I am in a state of depression where I'm becoming overwhelmed with my life and life choices, as well as what's revolving around me. I'm currently enrolled in College and haven't been going to classes and will end up failing and having to redo the semester, and this being my third time with an Academic Dismissal only hinders my chances of actually graduating from a program that I'm not totally sure I want for it to be my career path. Also not telling my parents or my friends of my education problems is causing more and more feelings to be bottled up creating anxiety. I'm participating in a Collegiate Gaming team for the same College and feel pressured to stay enrolled just for the team, even though I know I should quit for my sake. I was a long time video game addict throughout and life, and now realize that because of this, I have messed up my path of success to only make a maze for myself towards a better future. I am currently working a part-time job, and  was recently hired for a full-time position else where and have to decide whether to work both jobs or to quit one and be either stuck in a financially poor position for god knows how long, or to be in a miserable environment working full-time not knowing if I'll be at that place for the rest of my life (which I don't want to happen). Myself being a loser who bottles everything inside, and appear to not be depressed on the outside, is now breaking apart at 5:00am in the morning. I really need a hand.

137,"So I’m 21, and I live in Maryland. I have 2 jobs. One that is 40 hours a week which I just got promoted at actually. The other I work about 25-30 hours a week. Both jobs are in hospitality, and I am constantly praised for my people skills and ability to talk to people and my upbeat attitude. 

Ever since I graduated in 2015 I’ve noticed myself slowly becoming more reclusive and staying to myself. All I do daily is go to work, got to my 2nd job, come home, sleep &amp; maybe play a video game for a hour IF I have the time. On my one day off a week (if I get it) I just sleep all day because it’s the only day I really can. But even on days when I’m well rested; I find myself not wanting to message friends to hang out or anything 

I use to be the complete opposite of this person; and after turning 21 two week ago I really want to branch back out and be social like I use too.. I honestly can’t remember the last time I thought I had a “active” social life.  Or even be happy for that matter.

138,"I've been lost lately on what exactly to do with my school situation. Just a month ago I transferred over to a school for pregnant teen mothers but in some situations they allow kids who need to get their credits back, in my case I'm there exactly to get my credits.

 It's a very laid back school, easy work resulting in good grades, just in general a good system, if I stayed I would graduate  with a 4.0 gpa even though I don't plan on going to college that seems irrelevant. At most there are 50 kids total.

The thing that is making me wonder/question if this is a regrettable decision or not is because,

I missed out on a lot of school, making friends, and social situations growing up due to medical reasons involving a family member of mine so, as you could imagine I have been homeschooled up until my freshman year of high school which I just enrolled 3-4 months ago. The thing is I want to be able to experience the ""normal highschool experience"" but I feel the transition from light homework/tests to working my ass off everyday is kinda scary and stressful sounding, but yet I want to make idenible memories, go out and do things with friends, and just in all have fun and be wild like all the other kids my age.

I’ve always been the person to care for him, give him advice and offer or make plans to cheer him up and just to create a better bond with him. I just didn’t know that he was such a self centered asshole. Actually, I have always known. Everywhere I go he loves to put me on spot and whenever we are in public and I talk to a girl he will always without a doubt butt in and try to make himself stand in the spotlight and try to make everyone laugh at me.

I’ve always been the trendsetter, people have looked up to me and after I met them my confidence and self esteem just disappeared. We have created art together for other people’s entertainment. It’s never even been a “We” thing either, it’s more of a “we thing” for his other friends who I happen to be friends with also. He never gives me credit for the shit that I do with him, I show him music and he tells other people that he has great taste in music and has never let anybody show him anything before. He wants to center everyone to just admire the shit he does and everything as if the world revolves around him. I don’t want to live my last year of high school with this prick. But at the same time there is nobody I could grow with unless I stay his friend. I really need advice. I need new fucking friends, new ideas.

144,"Ok, first of all, I'm sorry for my bad English. 

I started talking with a girl in Tinder and I liked her and she liked me. The conversations we had were about mutual interests but nothing too sexy. A few days after we started talking I decided to finally ask her on a date. I got extremely nervous before the date because I thought everything bad would happen but I though it went incredibly well for my first date. A few days after (probably 2 days?) I tried to invite her to a new date because I wanted to at least kiss her and know her more (we just hugged in our first date) and she seemed evasive (saying stuff like: 'I don't know when I'm going to be available next week'). In the same day I tried to talk with her about this subject again to understand when she could go out again and we got a deal where she would tell me when she would be available any day and I would check if I could fit a date in my agenda during that day. Then I decided to talk about our mutual interests again (again, almost no sexual content, just casual conversation) and in the middle of the conversation she started bringing up sex out of nowhere and we had virtual sex (she showed me everything and I showed her everything).

I mean, after this I don't even know what to do. Considering that I know very little about how relationships work I feel like I'm being played or something. I started having a lot of thoughts on my head. Is she playing me somehow? Is she too easy? Does she does this to everyone? 

However, this gets better, during the end of our virtual sex (yeah, this was the easiest term that I could remember to summarize the experience) we started talking about BDSM and she said she likes and that men already came to her asking her to be like the girl from 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and paying her money but she said she didn't like because she felt like a whore to them.

153,"This is sort of a 3-parter since I always ask for advice on this girl but I always come back. Or she always comes back... Basically I met this girl online and we were in a group together with friends. After a year they argued a lot until finally she left. And that's when me and her got close, we started as friends online and got further enough to actually meeting and... she smelled terrible. Her hugs, her breath, her pussy, her ass... she smelled so bad. But yeah, I liked her and she's super cool online so I banged her.

Now here we are again with her coming on to me, she wanted to come over so I agreed. Luckily she doesn't smell as bad with clothes on. Well by the time I was ready to sleep and take her home, she offered a blowjob... the best bj of my life... literally came twice. And yes she fumed up my living room but the only part of it that bothered me was when she wanted to 69... made me eat her pussy and ass... And I almost threw up eating her pussy... Super hot, but just disgusting... next thing that bothered me was her sleeping in my bed. I took a bath and came back, she didn't take any. Didn't even go to the bathroom and then we went to sleep. Morning, she wakes up trying to be sexy... hugs me around my neck when her armpits burn my nose and then a kiss... No brushing her teeth... only time she went to the bathroom was with me when she sat on the toilet and blew me off.

So. Why am I telling you this? Well I think she's crushing on me.... she says she loves me, she gives me bj's without asking me to eat her out, the kisses and hugs... she's acting weird. I don't know what to do because honestly I feel in love with her online, but...I feel like she's not the girl for me.

I know that doesn't make since but listen, she's so great and cool when texting, but she just talks about sex, sex, sex, she fucked so and so and sucked him... etc. But when her sex life slows down she comes to me wanting to play... I'm worried she may not be faithful...

Another thing is how smelly she is, I like her but she is just nasty. Her room is a mess, panties on the floor. Flies and bugs in her room. Bathroom dirty... She even stayed with me and left her stuff (food, cans, underwear) just laying around and I had to clean some of her stuff up after she left. Another thing is she seems like a hoe. Because my brother saw her topless and she didn't cover up, it's almost as if they smiled at each other... but that's just me being so fucking paranoid right now of what comes with going further with her.

Should I give it up and stop? Should I keep going and chance her wanting to date? I don't know but it's eating me up. Please anyone give me some advice... As the second women I've been with I want to stay but I don't know tbh.",07Apr2018,5

157,"Hi guys. I just have a few questions

1. Is it weird to be almost 21 and have never been in a relationship/had sex before? It really bothers me. I’ve kissed a guy before but it never led to anything and I think that’s a good thing because if I were to have been in a relationship with that specific person, I think i would’ve gotten pregnant very quickly honestly, like, teen mom quickly. But sometimes I just feel like maybe I should’ve gone for it? Because I hate my life now. I have no friends, no boyfriend, I’m overweight, and I feel like I will never ever be in a relationship, I’m afraid of being lonely.

2. How do you get over a long term crush? I’ve had a crush on a guy since I was 18, when I started college. I was a high functioning autistic student in a group for autism where neurotypicals would coach us and help us with basic life skills. He was a coach. I felt so in love with him. I found out he had a girlfriend but was still “in love” with him and couldn’t get over him. I felt like he liked me back. Idk but when he looked into my eyes I just felt it.... anyways fast forward to last year I found out they broke up. I think they’re still friends tho so idk if they will rekindle that. Basically I haven’t seen this guy since 2016 and I still obsess over him, wondering when/if I’ll ever be with him. Do I need to get over it? I’ve just never felt this way about someone before and don’t think I ever will with anyone else. We stay in contact occasionally (not very often. Quite rarely actually) but only in a group text with another girl that was my coach. I know he’s still out there Being his old cute self. It kills me to know that. Just thinking of what could’ve been if I had stayed in school and Talked to him more. So How the hell do I get over him if I haven’t been able to even when I haven’t seen him in two years.

3. Kind of related to 2. This is for all the neurotypical males out there. Would you date a girl with a disability? I’m autistic and have pulmonary hypertension. No I’m not going to die early (as long as I stay healthy by exercising and eating right) and I’m high functioning. I just feel that I will never have a chance with any “normal” person because of the labels that define me. When I say high functioning I mean very high functioning. Most people can’t tell that I’m autistic. But I can. My family can. And I just do certain things that fall under the spectrum. Again, im Afraid of being lonely and I don’t think anyone will ever love me.

4. Last one. How big of a deal is it when a thin guy is liked by a girl who is big? I’m 5’5 200 pounds and I’m pretty heavy in my stomach area. I have a lot of backstory to this but it’s not like anyone would know my story when they first lay eyes on me. I don’t feel attractive or confident in my own body. I know that is essential in order to build relationships but for me, I feel like I won’t love myself until others love me, and it should be the opposite. I’m 21 in August and never had a boyfriend and I’m just worried it’s going to stay that way forever and I’m definitely not an independent woman who don’t need no man. I definitely want someone in my life. But it’s so hard for me to even get friends because I’m so fat and unattractive. 

HELP",07Apr2018,3
158,"--- LONG READ AHEAD! ---

I (19/M) have been into an online friendship with a girl for about 5 years now, but I am uncertain of what I should do at the moment, so I have decided to come here in search of advice. Here is my story...

I met her in a game (she will be called Natties and we are both of same age) back in 2013 and had some great memories then, and her appearance in my life has greatly shaped my teenage days... She appeared to be a strong and mean girl on the outside when talking in public, but I was able to get close enough to her to know that even though she was the strong girl outside, inside she was just a sweet and delicate girl who is just as vulnerable as any other human being... I had real life friends to play with as well, but my teenage days had always been going on the computer to talk to Natties. As I was an introvert, I prefer to be at home and not hanging out with my friends too much since it tires me.. and my teenage days would be me spending time with her. At an almost everyday basis.

We got close by sharing our life experiences and just playing games together, she would tell her stories about her life and I would tell her about mine, over time our friendship grew close, closer and closer until we've reached a point to engage into an online relationship; later on however, we found that we are just not ready for an online relationship because of our major time differences (9-10 hours difference). It wasnt because we didnt have feelings for each other, we just didnt want to hurt each other's feelings if we stopped playing the game for whatever reason, so we just dropped the relationship it and continued to be close friends. We continued to have fun over the course of 2013, but by the end of it, I started to play the game less because I've started to lose interest in the game.

As time passed (2014, 2015 and 2016), I would come play the game less and less, yet somehow despite the time difference we  would somehow be online at the same time and still have time to update ourselves and catch up. As we both grew older and older, our interactions became more scarce, until Ive decided to exchange social media details, so that we can continue to chat even if I stop playing the game entirely.. 

After that interaction however, its like as if a new flame was sparked and we continued to chat on a regular basis, it may not have been daily and even if both of us were busy and replied slowly to each other (although I am usually the one waiting for her replies because I wasnt as busy as her), we would still make effort to talk to each other and had fun doing so.

Eventually however, we completely stopped talking to each other. She had finished high school before I did and has told me of her circumstances regarding to her military duties and her leaving home, it was going to be a major change for her and I told her that I will always support her in what she does because I know that deep down, outside the strong exterior shell of her, she is the sweet Natties that I know and care of. We were meant to stop talking to each other then (because she said that she will be too busy with me), but despite that conversation, we still manage to have conversations on a quarterly basis (yes, once every 3-4 months), we still continued to make efforts to talk to each other despite the circumstances standing in out way. Sometimes she would start the conversation and other times I would start the conversation, so it was fair play from both of us and it felt more of an equal friendship. We may have stopped playing the game that we once played, but we still continued to chat on social media. Even if the chat was slow and she only replies once every few days, I didn't take her slow replies into offence because I knew that she was busy with her life... and I let her live her life and be herself.

More time has passed, I finished high school and have entered university (2017), Natties and I have stopped talking for months. I felt that it was long due for a catch up session, so I have made some attempts over the past of few months to try to talk to her. I noticed that it would take days and sometimes weeks before I get replies, but I still didnt care because she still replied in the end.
2017 was a year where there would be empty months where we didnt interacted, but when we did, we will have weeks of chat blobs that float around and we will still somehow catch up, maintaining the friendship.

2018 came, our chat came back alive when she told me what she was up to. Ive learnt that she has became a gamer and has started to mingle with online communities more and more and has begun to left hersocial media to death. So we both exchanged Discord information so that I can go talk to her there since she is more active there. However, the few attempts I have made to chat in Discord with her always end mid conversation because she would go off and play with her friends or be busy and be doing other stuff. She would however at least tell me that she is going and we will always promptly end the conversation with a goodbye. I knew that I was just overthinking when she cut off the chat, so I obviously respected her decision and left her be with her life. Unfortunately though, as I was busy with examinations that can potentially change my life, I literally reserved almost no time to talk to her. If she did reply, I would reply in a few days to wish her well.

Bit more time has pased, its March 2018, my hard work has paid off... all the time I studied for my tests has paid off and I am now studying at a place where I am enjoying myself. Although I am working hard to keep my spot in the school I am in, I know that at least now I have more time on my hands now. Ive moved to another country to attend this institution by using my own money and skills and I am now living a solitary life. Because of this, I can now spend more time with Natties and catch up with her and rekindle the friendship I have with back... or so I thought.

April 1 2018 was the date I started to talk to her again since I have moved. I was trying to talk to her again, but this time her replies are broken and I can tell that my interactions with her was one sided. I was the one talking, but she only had short replies to whatever I was talking about and it would be days before I get a reply. It hurt me a little because I knew that if she really wanted, she would have replied to me. But at the same time, I was being realistic with the situation, we both are adults now, shes 20 now and is now living a different life. Even though I saw some changes in her, she is still the sweet Natties that I know and care about, and I know that if she needs any help, I will definitely be the first one to come pick her up and help her out of any situation. Even if the world goes against what she wants to do and represent, as long as it doesn't go against my Morales, I will support her. Unfortunately, I was overthinking of her late replies on me because I was too excited to see her after all of the times not online. It went to the point where I was thinking about her every minute, I know that it was more of an obsession at this point and although it has not changed what Ive been doing with my studies, it does get to my mentality every now and then. 

Yesterday was a very tense momen Ive had as I saw something that proved her ""being busy"" was more of a joke. I thought that she didnt care about me anymore. I didnt know what to do so I asked around for advice, and someone told me to unfollow her on social media to see if she still really cares about me. I didnt want to do this to Natties, although reluctant, I still ended up doing it because I just really wanted to know what she will do if I do this to her. I've already been on the receiving end of the spectrum by waiting for her replies only to get cut off mid conversation without any indication so that was the reason I ended up doing it. (to make what she did to me clear, this will be an example. Imagine you both exchanged greetings, and she said how are you, but when you answer, she will not reply until a few days has passed)
After I unfollowed her, she noticed it insanely quick and ended up half begging to me that she was sorry for what she did and she wanted this friendship with me. I was hurt from doing this as well, so I apologised to her as well. Her response was ""): , don't hurt me, good morning ;-;"" and I have not received a reply since. (However the reply has only been 6 hours long, so Im not going to come into any conclusion)

Now I am here making this thread, I have a lot of questions I want to ask myself.

Did I overthink too much and made her sad out of my selfishness?
Did I rush myself too much and force herself to be with me too much?
Is this a form of obsession? or is it just me being too excited after all this time?
Is she really busy or is she just throwing me off?
and so on....

I wrote this to partially vent my emotions out, but I am also looking for the general perspective of the redditors here and will take in consideration to what I will do next.

Thanks for reading this long post. I look forward to what the people here have to offer for me.

159,"I have a friend who is really a nice person but the things she say are just really, really dumb. At first, I thought she might have high-functioning autism but now, I think she just lives in her own world (I'm not saying all people with autism are dumb; it's just that she wouldn't get the social cues). The comments she make are so dumb and she would talk about unrelated stuff to the topic (because she misunderstood the topic). For example, she would say stuff like ""your eye color looks different in this photo"" when I was clearly wearing colored lenses. 

I have a YouTube channel and she's mentioned that I should stop laughing/grinning in my videos because it shows lack of confidence. She's said this several times and I already told her it's not welcome and it's stupid to expect YouTube to be like TV. She would say stuff are just really annoying and she just doesn't understand why saying such a thing is bad.

Girl 2: close but not like bff close. We get along and we have many in jokes plus there are rumours we like each other. Sold 10/10 as far as looks go

162,"Hello,

I am a regular poster at a few computing forums (this account is a Reddit throwaway account). One of the forums I post at is missing a prolific poster - he was popular and profoundly knowledgeable. He had posted for a long time and was well-respected.

Last year he and I got into discussing our computer-related interests over PMs which eventually turned into personal matters as he began to disclose details of his life. He told me that he was ill, the specifics of which I will not go into. Over time it became clear that this was a terminal illness.

He left his main computing forum last year, no longer posting because he felt the quality of the forum had deteriorated, after which he and I exchanged over a hundred emails and PMs discussing his health and his past, but mainly we discussed computing. He was very intelligent, one of the greatest minds I've had the fortune to converse with. He was something of a genius. Nevertheless, he always kept his identity a secret and I am still left with very few clues as to who he actually was. I did ask, but he said it was not necessary for me to know.

Towards the end of last year his health deteriorated rapidly. At the end of December I got the feeling that he didn't have long left and wrote him a 'goodbye' email to thank him for all the help and inspiration he'd given to me, and to the software community in general. He wrote to me to say he had read my email, and he wrote me one further email in which he addressed various points I had raised in my 'goodbye' email. He said he would address more points in a further email - but that further email was not forthcoming. I wrote to him three times after this but he did not write back.

I can only assume that he passed away at the end of last year or the beginning of this year. Of course, he could just not be replying, but he generally replied without fail within 24 hours, and to have not heard anything from him for over three months - given the circumstances - indicates that he has indeed passed away. Given the fact that I do not know his real name - and can only guess at his location - checking the obituaries is pointless.

The main forum he posted in is wondering where he went since he was very active there and he just disappeared. I am pretty sure I am the only one who knows what has happened. Seeing as he was a respected contributor I am wondering if it's worth making some kind of memorial thread. I hesitate for two reasons:

1 - he did not want anyone to know of his health condition, specifically the details of his illness.
2 - I cannot be 100% sure that he has passed away - and I will never be 100% sure - but it is highly likely that he has.

However, I feel that his memory should be noted in some way since he made such a difference to this forum he posted in. Should I make some kind of thread and if so, to what effect? Or should I not make a thread and leave it forever open/a mystery? I want to respect his wishes but on the other band he had such an effect on the community.

He helped me a lot with learning computing, he was an inspiration and I'm sure he was to others too. His (potential but highly likely) passing has greatly saddened me and I have not spoken of it to anyone online. On one of the fora I post in I have a quote from him in my sig so I don't forget him. 

This is something of an ethical dilemma which involves both him and the community. I wonder if there is some sort of mid-ground that could be struck, both respecting his wishes but also allowing the community to say their own ""goodbyes"" in some way or other?

Thank you.",07Apr2018,5
164,"I have severe self-esteem issues, which eventually lead to anxiety. Initially I thought ""it's just a bad day, the thought will pass and stop as I grow older"", but apparently it didn't, it only got worse and worse. I finally reached out to a councellor in campus (because I can't afford an actual psychiatrist and my insurance doesn't cover that medical area).

The councellor basically told me to ""think positively about yourself, know that you deserve better"" and all that bullshit that basically anyone can throw at you. I find it funny that he thinks insecurities and anxiety can be cured just by thinking ""i'm pretty and badass.""

I expected something more hands-on like ""if you don't like how you look, take a look at yourself in the mirror more often"" or whatever HELPFUL activities I can actually do to help me fix myself. If I asked for ""think positively, live with positive vibes"" I could just go on Google and look at stupid girly quotes.

169,"Hello, Reddit. Im writing this text with the little power that I have left inside of me, so I apologise for any gramatical errors that may come along the way. Please bear with me.
Im 18.
I have been with this girl, my girlfriend, for 2 years now. We were happy, we loved each other... We did everything. Everything together and we loved it. I have Never loved somebody so much. Rn, my heart is just torn to rags, I feel as if I've been eaten alive. I just can't make you all understand what I'm going through. I'm crazy unstable when it comes to her and I would literally amputate my whole arm right now if it would bring get back.
Anyway, 2 days ago she told me we should break up. I was in shock. I was dying. I couldn't breathe. I asked why and she told me that she has had enough of me. Enough of me. All of a sudden, she has had enough of me. Literally a day before she told me that we should break up we hang out, we laughed, we had dinner and we LOVED each other. And 2 days before she told me that we should break up, she came over, we had sex as per usual, I made her reach orgasm twice, and then we started watching some series on Netflix, shortly following asleep after a few minutes.
In my honest to God opinion, the sex isn't a problem, and neither is the fact that we don't hang out. Because we do.
I've always spoiled her however I could, I always bought her flowers and I always paid when we went out to eat. Except for 3 or 4 times when I literally had no money on me. I even stole money from my step dad to buy her a husky puppy that she always wanted... 200 dollars, but she doesn't know. And, overall, many, many more things. (Chocolate, teddies, make-up, etc.)
That's about it, long story short. I feel like I want to die right now, as I type these words. The only thing keeping me from not slitting my troath is the fact that my mom would be sad and she wouldn't be able to cope with the pain. I've been calling her, writing to her, nothing. She wouldn't pick up, she wouldn't type back. She just sees my messages.
Please give me some advice. Literally anything you can would be good.

173,"--- LONG READ AHEAD! ---

I (19/M) have been into an online friendship with a girl for about 5 years now, but I am uncertain of what I should do at the moment, so I have decided to come here in search of advice. Here is my story...

I met her in a game (she will be called Natties and we are both of same age) back in 2013 and had some great memories then, and her appearance in my life has greatly shaped my teenage days... She appeared to be a strong and mean girl on the outside when talking in public, but I was able to get close enough to her to know that even though she was the strong girl outside, inside she was just a sweet and delicate girl who is just as vulnerable as any other human being... I had real life friends to play with as well, but my teenage days had always been going on the computer to talk to Natties. As I was an introvert, I prefer to be at home and not hanging out with my friends too much since it tires me.. and my teenage days would be me spending time with her. At an almost everyday basis.

We got close by sharing our life experiences and just playing games together, she would tell her stories about her life and I would tell her about mine, over time our friendship grew close, closer and closer until we've reached a point to engage into an online relationship; later on however, we found that we are just not ready for an online relationship because of our major time differences (9-10 hours difference). It wasnt because we didnt have feelings for each other, we just didnt want to hurt each other's feelings if we stopped playing the game for whatever reason, so we just dropped the relationship it and continued to be close friends. We continued to have fun over the course of 2013, but by the end of it, I started to play the game less because I've started to lose interest in the game.

As time passed (2014, 2015 and 2016), I would come play the game less and less, yet somehow despite the time difference we would somehow be online at the same time and still have time to update ourselves and catch up. As we both grew older and older, our interactions became more scarce, until Ive decided to exchange social media details, so that we can continue to chat even if I stop playing the game entirely.. 

After that interaction however, its like as if a new flame was sparked and we continued to chat on a regular basis, it may not have been daily and even if both of us were busy and replied slowly to each other (although I am usually the one waiting for her replies because I wasnt as busy as her), we would still make effort to talk to each other and had fun doing so.

Eventually however, we completely stopped talking to each other. She had finished high school before I did and has told me of her circumstances regarding to her military duties and her leaving home, it was going to be a major change for her and I told her that I will always support her in what she does because I know that deep down, outside the strong exterior shell of her, she is the sweet Natties that I know and care of. We were meant to stop talking to each other then (because she said that she will be too busy with me), but despite that conversation, we still manage to have conversations on a quarterly basis (yes, once every 3-4 months), we still continued to make efforts to talk to each other despite the circumstances standing in out way. Sometimes she would start the conversation and other times I would start the conversation, so it was fair play from both of us and it felt more of an equal friendship. We may have stopped playing the game that we once played, but we still continued to chat on social media. Even if the chat was slow and she only replies once every few days, I didn't take her slow replies into offence because I knew that she was busy with her life... and I let her live her life and be herself.

More time has passed, I finished high school and have entered university (2017), Natties and I have stopped talking for months. I felt that it was long due for a catch up session, so I have made some attempts over the past of few months to try to talk to her. I noticed that it would take days and sometimes weeks before I get replies, but I still didnt care because she still replied in the end.
2017 was a year where there would be empty months where we didnt interacted, but when we did, we will have weeks of chat blobs that float around and we will still somehow catch up, maintaining the friendship.

2018 came, our chat came back alive when she told me what she was up to. Ive learnt that she has became a gamer and has started to mingle with online communities more and more and has begun to left hersocial media to death. So we both exchanged Discord information so that I can go talk to her there since she is more active there. However, the few attempts I have made to chat in Discord with her always end mid conversation because she would go off and play with her friends or be busy and be doing other stuff. She would however at least tell me that she is going and we will always promptly end the conversation with a goodbye. I knew that I was just overthinking when she cut off the chat, so I obviously respected her decision and left her be with her life.

187,"To start off, I live in a 3/3 in Florida. If you live here, you know what the heat is like. There's like three combined weeks of winter and spring total, and those are over now.

To start, both of my roommates seem to prefer our apartment with no AC and windows locked tight. Every time I turn the AC on, within 20 minutes it's turned off. Sometimes when they know I'm awake and close enough to hear the thermostat click off, they'll just turn the AC up to 90+ or worse, TURN THE HEAT ON. I've done literally everything I can think of. I went all three weeks of winter with the heat on blast constantly without complaining because they preferred it, now this happens.

I've tried to just deal with it, discuss it with them, compromise and leave it on at 80, asked them to shut their vents, asked them to get heavier sheets, asked them to wear something other than their underwear around the house, left polite notes, left passive aggressive notes, tried leaving my room's window open, and bought MULTIPLE fans. Short version is, none of those worked.

My family owns a business (a window manufacturer) in central wisconsin. The business is very succesful, and my father he founded it always wanted one of his children to take over the company one day.

Halfway through my degree, I decided to pursue passion over my families desire to have my run their company. I transferred to another school and got a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Game Design and Development with a business administration minor.

I graduated in January, and my art portfolio/resume just isn't quite enough to get my foot in the door in the industry of games or entertainment yet. This week I toured the Savannah Coolege of Art and Design and applied for a M.F.A. in Visual Effects. This opportunity would better enhance my skills as a digital artist, provide me with more portfolio experience, and hopefully build some excellent networking opportunities. 

The problem is, I am still conflicted.

My parents suggested again that I take over the company, and told me that I could make a $100,000 annual salary. If I attended SCAD I would spend $100,000 alone on my two year masters program. 

Do I pursue a very safe and stable financial future, sacrificing my desire to live and experience other parts of the world, or do I continue my passion and go to graduate school?

It's a difficult decision to make and I'm torn.",07Apr2018,2
189,"she and i met playing volleyball when we were 7/8, and ever since one day of practice that we met we literally became best friends ever since. we never went to the same school growing up which i feel like was in our favor because maybe it kept us together without all of the drama of other people. although we never went to the same school we hung out as much as we could, at least 2 times a month. we never fought that i can remember or our friendship never hit any rough patches. fast forward to freshman year of college, she decided to stay in our home town for school and i decided to go to a school 3 hours away. we were just as close if not closer the whole first semester, and i decided to transfer to the school in our hometown because i missed my boyfriend and her and my family. during this time she had a boyfriend who just hated me without reason, he honestly had problems i believe because any time sam or i would confront him about his problem with me he would say i was “a bad influence” which couldn’t be farther from the truth. i’m a good stable person, and she wasn’t any different from me so i don’t understand where he was coming from. the reason i mention him is because i truly feel like he was a big reason that we don’t talk today, even though they broke up years ago. anyway, i moved back home in december and she was supposed to be staying with her bf during christmas break, but he randomly broke up with her (which is not the first time this happened) and she could either drive 3 hours away home to her parents (they moved after she graduated) or stay with me, and of course i let her stay with my family and i. she stayed with us for over a month and we even worked at the same place together. we had the best time together, we always have. we’re both virgos if that tells you anything haha. anyways we decided to move in together in the summer of that year. in between i took her to colorado and florida with my family, took her in when she needed a place to stay, was there for her for how shitty her bf was to her. i was very much there for her, even during this time she wasn’t the bestest friend that she had used to be, but i figured it was bc she was going through a lot. fast forward to us living together, her bf and her got back together but he still hated me, so whenever he came over to our apartment he would be very rude or just wouldn’t speak to me, and it made me feel hella uncomfortable. because of this i would stay with my boyfriend a lot, which developed into almost every night. i feel like i should also add this is the time that i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, had lost all of my friends that i had made back at my old school because of distance, and my boyfriend and i were going through hell and back because of some decisions he had made. i was going thorough a lot and it didn’t help that i didn’t feel welcome in my own apartment. although this was happening my friend and i were still as close as ever, at least i thought so. she never had a problem that i was staying nights with my bf because so was she and i continued to pay rent and utilities. so fast forward 2 months or so, her bf decided to go to school in italy randomly the week before the fall semester. she was crushed obviously, and he wanted to get her a cat for how much she was going to miss him. he came to me and asked me if he could, and i said no because we weren’t allowed animals at our apartment and could be fined $50 a day for it being there and i just wasn’t ready to have an animal at that time i didn’t want one. he cussed me out and said many nasty things to me, and just got her one anyway. she wanted one so she backed him up on this. she promised me many things that never happened, she let the cat scratch up all of my leather furniture, never cleaned up the cat shit, and never got soft paws like she promised even tho she worked at an animal hospital. 3 days into his semester in italy he broke up with her (which i saw coming) and she was crushed. she then started getting upset that i wasn’t staying over at the apartment so i tried to stay every once in a while. things just went down hill from there, we ended up having to end our lease in december and she moved 3 hours away to where her parents were. I realize i should have been there more for her, but i was going through hell too at that time i wasn’t in any place to bring her back up when i was lower than i had ever been at any point in my life. i’m trying to keep this short i’m sorry... anyways we haven’t spoke since december and it’s been almost 2 years. i miss her like crazy, i mean she was my best friend for so long. she has my number blocked because she owed me money whenever she left in december. am i crazy for wanting to talk to her? i know she was shitty to me but i was shitty to her for not being there for her, even tho i was going through hell. i definitely should have tried harder, even tho i feel like she is more of the reason our friendship ended. i forgive her without an apology, i just want her back as my best friend. i’ve never been able to find someone that i click with more than her. i’m sorry for how long this is, but i need your guys’ help. should i try to reach out or should i leave it alone. she hasn’t made any effort to message me, but i don’t know where she is in her life now. this friendship break up was harder on me than any relationship breakup. what should i do?

190,"19M 19M So recently I just had the best academic quarter of my college career! I aced some of the hardest classes I’ll have to take. Also, I worked a job that usually went to 2-3 am on the weekdays. During this time, I smoked a few times a week. 

This is a drastic change- for a while I just didn’t care/couldn’t get motivated. I’d always end up about 2.7-2.9. Now I’ve found something I’m passionate about and that is practical. 

This quarter I dropped that job (weird hours) picked up a volunteer position, leadership position at school that pays, and couple more classes that are pretty difficult. I’m also applying heavily for internships this summer. I smoke a bowl or two a day this quarter. I want to say it doesn’t affect my performance because my overall gpa trends have no correlation with my frequency of smoking. But there’s part of me that feels like I’m not performing to my potential. Am I in denial? ",07Apr2018,1

I'm so pissed off and angry at the moment, I just woke up..

I've posted about it before but I'm just so consistently unhappy, I hate college I have no friends, I'm in a course I don't like and can't change, and if I drop out I'm just stuck at home listening to my parents tell me how much of a failure I am.

I've tried and failed to meet anyone with remotely the same interests as me, fashion and music.
Fashion is a bit more difficult but music shouldn't be that hard.
I've joined societies, clubs, went to open mic nights..
Everyones a DJ, nobody is interested in anything other than techno, which is fine but I'm not and nobody plays an instrument, nobody I've met.

My college is situated in what is essentially a town, despite it being technically a city and one of the top colleges in the world.

The system is different here, you can't change you just go into a course and either stick it out to the end or drop out and maybe reapply.
You've very little in the way of options, maybe 2 modules out of 12 every year.

I'm not that good of friends with the guys I went to school with either, some have gotten into drugs, some have found other friends and the guys who are left just get really drunk, one in particular gets obnoxious, he just becomes cocky, arrogant and aggressive..

I have no one, my parents think I'm a waster who's just not applying himself, who's just not trying.
So I'd have that to look forward to if I reinforced their opinion and dropped out, I'd just be moving back to rural Ireland with no friends, no prospects and a family that thinks I'm a failure.

The sad thing is that that is looking appealing, I hate college, I have never been more unhappy or quite frankly suicidal in my life, I'm a bitter, frustrated, self loathing, hating, pessimistic asshole on the inside and just some weird lonely guy who plays guitar, sings and is into fashion.

Little things like going bald at 20, being 5'7, not having any success with girls in over a year despite having no problems last year are minor now.

I had friends last year, soon became apparent I was just a friend of their's housemate who tagged along, wasn't added into group chat's told about any plans, invited anywhere or even replied to when I asked a question.
Everything I said was either funny or wrong, usually both in their eyes, but despite this I got shitfaced and talked the pants off a couple of girls, I ignored and scrapped by in a degree I detest, and now that I'm commuting from home with no friends, even the ones who didn't really like me, in a year where course work is piled on, I don't want to be alive anymore.

What can I do?
I've been doctors, I've been referred to psych, and they just pushed me to counselling, probably didn't help that when I'm sitting there in their office I can't talk to them so I just avoid the fact that I don't want to exist.
I don't see any point, any recovery, or any reason.
I went from being unhappy at school and thinking 'ok just get into college, that'll be better' to being in the exact scenario I dreamed of despite the minor detail of feeling empty inside at a first year house party.

I must be doing something wrong.

I am 18 and in college, living with my parents. My dad does not want me to leave him until I have finished college, so just saying, “help me move out” with no reason won’t work.

Then I switched to half caffeine coffee, eventually quit the coffee and thought it would help. Sure enough it didn’t. 

Then this past week I went to the doctor Monday for a physical, everything came back good. Aside from my vitamin D3 being a little low. Went to work tuesday. Then Wednesday went back to the doctor on my way to work having to turn around who prescribed me blood pressure medication because my
Blood pressure was fluctuating a lot anywhere from the high of 161/107 right when I would wake up. 

Then Wednesday same thing on my way to work, turned around and went home for fear of passing out. Then Thursday went back to the doctor then the psychiatrist who prescribed me serquel (for anxiety) which is sort of helping. But Friday I took too much and started falling asleep at the wheel so I had to get picked up at my van. 

I cannot figure out what the damn deal is! I don’t know what triggered it. Why I’m freaking out.

This morning a woman, who happens to be a member of a very important family in our town, fell through the walkway and into the well. She is safe now and didn’t suffer any injuries or anything. 

My boyfriend and his family are afraid that she’s going to sue. 

The well is on their property, but they had no idea it was there. There is no documentation on the well. The damn township didn’t know about the well. Could they still be sued? How can I comfort my boyfriend?

196,"I've been lost lately on what exactly to do with my school situation. Just a month ago I transferred over to a school for pregnant teen mothers but in some situations they allow kids who need to get their credits back, in my case I'm there exactly to get my credits.

 It's a very laid back school, easy work resulting in good grades, just in general a good system, if I stayed I would graduate  with a 4.0 gpa even though I don't plan on going to college that seems irrelevant. At most there are 50 kids total.

The thing that is making me wonder/question if this is a regrettable decision or not is because,

I missed out on a lot of school, making friends, and social situations growing up due to medical reasons involving a family member of mine so, as you could imagine I have been homeschooled up until my freshman year of high school which I just enrolled 3-4 months ago. The thing is I want to be able to experience the ""normal highschool experience"" but I feel the transition from light homework/tests to working my ass off everyday is kinda scary and stressful sounding, but yet I want to make idenible memories, go out and do things with friends, and just in all have fun and be wild like all the other kids my age.

However, when they aren't around I tend to sleep for hours more than I should. The problem isn't that I can't wake up - I wake up for all of my alarms, I even wake up to turn off one that I positioned all away across the room so I'm forced to get out of bed. 

The problem is after I wake up, I always fall asleep again, no matter how much sleep I've had the night before. There have been times when I've slept for 12 hours or more. Most of the time I don't get out of bed immediately so I fall asleep again within minutes of shutting off my alarm, but there have been times when I've gone to a different room and ended up falling asleep on the couch or in a chair.

This has been going on for a while and it's really starting to worry me.

204,"Hello guys. 

Need your advice from people who may have been through the same situation or similar before. I know everyone treats these things differently. 

So me and my girlfriend of two and half years. We moved in together around 6 months ago and everything has been fine. I have never had a reason not to trust her. Everything was good up until about 3 months ago. She quit her job due to personal circumstances. And during this her mother passed away. So for the last 3/4 months I’ve been supporting her (paying all the bills, making 400 mile journeys so she could be with her family. Taking on her problems to help her through.) and during this time she took a job in a night club serving drinks. And she did some bad things. Like she went out with her friends all night and didn’t let me know and when I took her to her mums funeral and burnt myself out driving 200 miles after working 6 days; she really belittled me in front of her family to the point her family told her to stop. And we worked through these issues but they are part of the build up. 

So we get over this life goes on. I have burnt myself out to support her through this with work, her issues my issues. Maintaining everything. We have an up and down relationship but we are very strong for the most part. So last month she goes out with her friends and they have a bit of wild night when one of them starts a fight and the bouncer throws her friend out and my girl and the bouncer talk. The bouncer then follows her on Instagram and they are friends at first she tells me she is talking to him. I pay it no mind cause I trust her. 

Well she starts acting differently with me and I knew there was something going on I know her to well not too. And her and this guy were getting very very flirty in messages I’m not gonna say what but she had crossed the line of cheating in her mind. 

So last weekend she went to work in an outfit I didn’t approve of. I have never stopped her from wearing anything so I didn’t that night either. But she knew I was not happy and she had sent pictures of her in that outfit to this guy (she never sent nudes). We didn’t speak we had a poor communication and she decided to sleep on the sofa. 

He then flirting offered her a bed and she played along with it and said things “yeah we can share” (this really hurt and still does). She has met him a few times but only outside of work so nothing happened. 

I get drunk cause I knew something was going on. I broke up with her telling her I knew about that someone else. Stupidly pushing her into another mans arms. She tried to go to another mans house that night but was unable to for irrelevant reasons. She was more than likely planning on sleeping with him. 

Anyway she came that night. I was asleep on the sofa she woke me up to move me I told her to fuck off and leave me alone she then attacked me hitting me in the head with a bottle of perfume. Eventually a domestic lead to me being arrested and spending 15 hours in jail. I was released without charge. 

I didn’t go home for a few days to avoid any more confrontation. and was not speaking to her cause I was upset. She invited this man into our house but he never showed. 

We then spoke and tried to resolve our issues to no avail. I left the house and went back to where I was staying and I was alone in a house so I went to see one of my friends and one of her friends was there who told me everything about this guy. I confronted her she denied it at first but I logged onto her instagram and read everything. 

It broke me down I felt like I wasn’t good enough. I was down. And hurt by the one person who swore to never hurt me. 

We met again and discussed this. We resolved a lot of the issues and we decided to try and give it ago and try to see if we could come out stronger the other end and we know these things take time. 

We argued every day about it since but for the most part we are good.  I sat down with her and went through every message with her and said why did you say that. That was too far. 

She broke down in tears and begged me to forgive her. She even went to the point of asking me to hit her cause she felt she deserved it (this knocked me sick. No woman should ever be hit and that is manipulative way that men who beat women make it seem ok. I told her to never ask me that again.)

She said she would never do anything like this again I.e get the police involved in our relationship or go to another man like that. 

I spoke with friends. And in their honesty (which I like) some told me she is taking the piss and will do it again. Other told me due to her mother dying and me not giving her enough attention she found it elsewhere. 

Now the man she spoke is a vulture coming at her when she is vulnerable but she is not innocent. She started this job and her work colleagues were her only friends since moving to my area but it was not a good environment to be in. 

I know this is a long story the thing I need advice on is... I still feel hurt and a level of anger and self doubt in our relationship; will this ever change? And how do we get through it? 
I want to fight this man Legit who she was speaking to but only in the boxing ring under Queensbury rules. I am not going back to jail anytime soon. 

She has quit her job at the club cause I asked her to. She has given me access to her phone and all her passwords (I don’t use them cause I’m not controlling). I do not fully trust her yet but I will not imprison her. She spent all last night crying screaming sorry after we had a few drinks. She knows she has done wrong so it’s all on me to work this out for myself now. I am a very deep thinker and I keep replaying it all in my head and keep getting myself mad.

209,"So, my parents recently moved into a brand new house in September (2017) - the house was finished about 10 months prior. The house is termite protected but (obviously) hasn't been pest control protected yet, (even though the home builder has a deal with a dual protection company that already installed systems in every house, my parents, in the midst of moving in and traveling constantly, ~never activated~ the pest control service.)

Anyway, I suppose given the above information, it isn't *that* (?) surprising (?) that this situation has arisen, regardless of the fact it is a new house- however, the reason I am absolutely losing my mind is: I spotted the little demonic heart-stopper in my bedroom. Now, I do not live with my parents. I have my bedroom here, but only visit it frequently between September- March. As I mentioned earlier, we moved into the house in September 2017. 
- *Now, what is absolutely freaking me out is*, I never unpacked, I left nearly a dozen boxes in my room, (along with a lot of other clutter, - clothes, bags, everywhere) and then left. I never got around to unpack because I never came home long enough. Now I'm back, and I spotted it about half an hour ago, first just in my peripheral vision, and then completely directly. I wanted to cry. It's taken me 30 minutes to not absolutely lose my mind and calm myself down, but I am still freaking out. 

I started reading online what attracts mice, how they nest (god I hated writing this), how they can carry fatal bacteria and diseases, and then found out my room description is their ideal heaven (a cluttered room with lots of cardboard boxes and clothes everywhere.) To make everything worse, after reading left out food attracts them, I started looking around the room to make sure nobody left any food in here that I wasn't aware of that may have invited them in- and viola, i discovered mice feces near my humidifier that I believe I accidentally left some water at the bottom of, months ago, and also an old, almost (.. almost!) empty bag of chips I think my brother mistakenly left in here about a month ago, right next to the humidifier. 

I believe they've been feeding off the water from the humidifier (somehow?) and the little chips crumbs. 

However, the issue is, I last saw the mouse running behind a bag of clothes I had leaning against a large dresser, across the room from where the humidifier is. I've started cleaning up the room and have gotten rid of almost all the boxes, but the thought of even inching close to the dresser and moving the big bag it ran behind, is killing me. I'm having the absolute worst nightmare inducing thoughts about 1) what kind of home/nest it might have built behind the bag or dresser, 2) whether or not there are more of them back there (God, the thought of several makes me hyperventilate) and 3) how it could have built its nest *inside* my clothes (??) after having eaten through the plastic bag, from the back. 

My panic is revolving around the entire situation as a whole, but specifically the following questions, which I'm hoping someone who has experienced similar or knows better could hopefully help me answer: 

Did I cause this, by having a messy, cluttered, unpacked room? And by having food lying out like that? 

Or was it inevitable for them to have found a way inside the house somehow via a crack, or through the walls (?), and it isn't my room's fault they somehow found their way inside our house? 

I also wonder how much of a factor having the attic door in my ceiling is. About a month ago, my parents decided to get solar panels, so during the day-long installation, the attic door was open, with the ladder coming down into my room, and the roof was being drilled into, for about 12 hours straight - does anyone think that could've been when they crept in? 

I am just in such disbelief still and freaked the absolute hell out, but, more than anything, 
d r e a d i n g having to alert my parents. 

Sigh, I feel like it's my fault, while at the same time, I kind of know it's *not really* (?) and don't want to get in hot water for this, but.. alas, I feel like the lecture and disappointment will be inevitable. 

Any advice would really help. Thank you if you read all of this. I wasn't sure which sub to post this in, so thought I'd (cross-post) and also take a chance here. ",07Apr2018,9
210,"I've been a California resident ever since I was born in 1991. Loved the weather, the ability to go to the beach, the mountains and the desert all in one day.

However, as of recent the financial and *especially* the political climate (sky-high cost of living, gun laws) are having me reconsider my plans to graduate community college next year and to temporarily put it on hold while I move to another state and then try to finish it there.

If I stay here, not only will I be inching closer and closer to homelessness because of increasing rent, utility fees and other rising taxes, I'll more than likely become a felon for owning certain guns or accessories (that I will ***NOT*** give up or surrender, no matter what). 

It is slowly but surely eating away at my psyche when I have to turn on Reddit or the local news to find people supporting more tax increases and gun laws that I can neither afford nor comply with, so I decided that it was best for me to just drop everything I'm doing (for now) and move out.

Once I've settled in my new state, then I'll get back to finishing school.

That's no good reason"") and I've been told that by some folks, so I'm used to it, but these are 2 issues that matter to me *very* personally.

It pains me in my heart and soul to just pack up and leave (most) of my lifelong friends and family behind, but I feel that this is something I've gotta do when it's obvious that California state politics isn't going to get any less tax and ban-happy. If I stay here much longer, I might wake up a felon one day.

Would community college credits carry over out of state? If not, no big deal, I can always redo the courses on my own time without these socioeconomic monkeys on my back.

211,"Long story short, due to poor choices in my life, I did not focus much on what direction I want to go with my education or career. I somehow graduated, I had different jobs, I moved to different cities, got married. Right now I am working a job that pays quite well, although I am putting a lot of hours in and there's not much time left for hobbies. Pays well but not well enough to buy my own place and start a family. I have an overall feeling of being useless and depressed with the place I am right now. After work I am too tired to do anything else, I don't want to go out and hang out with people. I simply want to sleep all the time, watch a movie or play games for an hour or two and pass out on the couch. So yeah, pretty sad. 

As for hobbies, I like movies, reading, gaming, hiking, playing guitar. The problem is, working sucks the life out of me, nothing makes me happy.

I understand that changing things must come from myself first. If I don't take action, my life won't change. The problem is, I am scared of change. Also I got used to good pay, however due to my poor numeracy skills, I don't see myself improving and I guess I will be stuck forever, with no chance for a promotion, as I am simply underskilled.  

That's why I want to turn my life around somehow, but I don't know how. First thing that comes to my mind, is to go back to school and study something useful, but I have absolutely no clue what to study. I thought of something to do with computers, maybe even programming, although I suck at math so bad, I can't even imagine studying anything math related. I often imagine myself as someone else and I am having those weird dreams where I am living other life somewhere else, to the point that when I wake up, I feel depressed that I am back to my miserable life. The feeling of wasted time, wasted years is overwhelming. I had suicide thoughts as I thought no one would care if I died or lived. I am married with no kids and sometimes I feel that my wife is the only thing that keeps me going. 

I wish to think that IT IS NEVER TOO LATE to turn life around and become a happy person, but I can't find right direction, I just can't. I hope for a big change, I think of leaving the city behind and instead of working a desk job, I think I'd be happier chopping wood.

Yes, you read that right. My F comes from a “class” called “Planning for Future Career Success” (PFCS). All it entails is the school forcing kids, to do real world hoopla such as building your resume, applying to colleges, and working things out with the armed forces, if someone chose that career path. 

The kids planning on enrolling in college were required to take a campus visit, apply to at least 3 colleges that align with your desired career path, and attending a couple college rep visits to the HS.

225,"General advice about this subject is super helpful

 But, if you're interested here's my situation and what I've tried so far... 

Some context: 

* They've been overweight nearly all their life (however over the last 3 years they got much bigger)  
* I do not currently live with them
* We are sisters (they are younger) 
* We are both in our mid 20s

What I've tried so far: 

* Explaining the health problems of being overweight (there's a doctor in our family)
* Creating a diet and exercise plan for them
* Going on a diet with them
* Talking about my diet and exercise plans and asking if she'd be interested in me making one for her (she's not)
* Sending them videos I like of people talking about their weight loss journey and how they did it
* Buying all their food and healthy eating equipment (like cooking gadgets, lunch boxes, water bottles, etc)
* Offering to pay for their half of a holiday if they lost a certain amount of weight (this worked the best but the weight loss was short lived)

I'm really worried about them and feel like I have tried everything. I just want her to be healthy and happy. When I talk to her about it in person she cries and (sometimes literally) runs away - when I text her about it she often ignores me for days and then gives a very short reply. I'm really at a loss of what to do next. I just haven't been able to make her *want* to change her ways.

234,"So I’ve come to terms with the fact that I have a huge fear of rejection but I don’t know exactly why. I was really outgoing and open from kindergarten to sixth grade and had a great group of friends, I never made any enemies and I was fairly friendly with people I wasn’t that good of friends with, and I was kind of the ringleader of the group. After sixth grade I moved to a different state in a totally unfamiliar environment. So naturally I was a bit quiet in seventh grade but I still had a solid group of friends and everyone more or less liked me and I never had any issues with anyone. In eight grade I started to be outgoing again because I had made even better friends at that particular school and had a solid relationship with almost everybody. I moved again in eight grade to a different state where I wasn’t exactly outgoing but I wasn’t exactly quiet. I had a decent group of friends at that point and I was sort of friends with everyone and no one had a problem with me. Now I have a huge group of friends and I’m not afraid to talk to new people and I’m constantly making friends in different “cliques” or groups. But I still have that major fear of rejection.

 I have a job, but have to resign after 6 months because my income interfered with my “parents” health insurance. I make $8.75/hr and have a little over 3k in the bank right now. My hours have been cut and aren't consistent anymore, so I’m not sure how much I’ll have by the time I quit. I have now until May 2019 to make enough money to leave. I’m okay with renting a room/having roomates/etc but I want to be able to afford living and buying necesseties. Of course after I move I’d be able to work any job I can. For now though, I need a job that pays cash, or a side job that would be off the books.

I have some skills/stuff I like: writing (poems and essays), I like making art (painting), I’m good at being a therapist to my friends but def not qualified to be an official one yet, I have clothes I don’t need, I like being my photographer friends’ subject, I like taking simple pictures, I love to edit videos (on imovie), I enjoy psychology, and probably the least important one, I can interpret peoples dreams? Weird, I know. 

I don’t want to get into it, but I went through a lot in my childhood, leading me to planning a future without the parents I don’t even consider parents. My siblings are straight up demons. I’m the oldest. 

I’d need to change what I look like just in case, so I want to get a nose job (I never liked my nose anyway) and dye my hair. That of course is costly. If you’re wondering why I need to change the way I look, its because they would try to find me, my features are distinct so changing would make it easier for me to feel safer. (It would be too hard to leave the city so I’m moving about 50 minutes away). I’ll try to change my name and ss security number, that has a cost as well. I have my documents. I have to get a new phone number, I’ll get cheap data. I’ll change emails, social media, etc. 

Trust me I have it all planned out. My struggle is money. My boyfriend suggested I make a gofundme but I’m not sure if I should, other people might need those donations more than I do. There’s small things I can do like submit stuff to magazines, try to sell stock photos, sell art, sell clothes, sell books, maybe sell snacks at school? I have tarot cards maybe I can do something with that.

242,"I've know her for four years and we hung out with mutual friends during high school. During high school, she would mainly talk with me, my male friend, and her brother, though our group was around seven people. Even in high school, I rarely saw and talked to her because we never had the same classes, and the only times I was able to talk (with our mutual friends) was during assemblies or if I'm lucky, in the halls. To describe her briefly, she's socially awkward in the sense that she has a hard time making conversation flow and can sometimes not be revelant to the conversation, and she falls under the ""extroverted bheart but introverted mind"" personality trait. But there were times where she's able to talk with my other male friend without any awkward pauses in a conversation, which lasted for nearly half an hour.

Anyway, in the third year I knew her, we didn't talk at all because I was unable to get her number and we had graduated and went on to our respective schools. In May of last year, I reconnected with her via text and we've been talking since then, so for eleven months. So in that time, I don't know if she wants to be my friend.

Things I noticed that are positive that she sees me as a friend is that she reciprocates conversation well, and sometimes it doesn't seem like she is uninterested in me, and she texts a lot in her responses when it's about our mutual interests or just life. She texts kinda dry but sometimes I can tell when she shares interest or excitement in something. She's very polite to me and thanks me fairly often in our conversations, though I do admit that I expect them. When I bring up hangout, she tells me that she like the idea of binging a series with me or going to the museum with my mutual friends. She also helped with my depression and gave advice, and tips for that.

Things that I noticed that are negative is that she never initiates text with me. Though we talk weekly, she's never once went to me to statrt a conversation. I also noticed that she talks a lot about herself and her responses become very short when I talk about myself. I also feel like I'm typing more than she puts out (ex. I'll write a paragraph and then I'll get a short phrase or one answer response from her -- this has happened many occasions). Though I don't do this often, I feel like if I wanted to talk to her about something I'm passionate about that she doesn't know about, she won't make the attempt to get to know what it is, or she won't respond back. She also rarely ever asks how I'm doing in our conversations, and only does it I specify that this is a catch-up. Sometimes, I feel like I have to force her into a conversation about myself. 

Things that I've noticed that I'm not sure that are positive or negative is that she ends the conversation differently now. Instead of just not responding back or reciprocating a good night text I send, she says talk to you later. There are times where I feel like she wants to say that she cares about me, but doesn't it or says it in a very implicit way that is open to many interpretations. The last thing is that she's shared her personal life with me -- earlier school life, family life, and on one occasion, her insecurities, while I haven't told her much about anything regarding my family and tend to focus on myself rather than those things. Beside my depression, my family's birthday phenomenon, and about rare times I talk about my sister, I don't open up much.

Some people say to ditch her because it's clearly an one-sided friendship or she's just using me for attention, and others say that she's just awkward (which she has told me explicitedly) and she likes me more than texting shows. So I don't know and I need help with this.

She is on a week trip in another city and will be back tomorrow evening. Should i wait until she arrives or already make a hint that we need to do a serious talk - which would be way obvious that it leads to something unpleasal.",07Apr2018,0

250,"This may be the wrong place to ask this, but I figured I’d give it a shot… I grew up in an ultra-conservative anti-science Christian household. I’m now 26 and studying astronomy, which my parents disapprove of after they found out I no longer believe in their literal interpretation of the Bible. My friend asked for book recommendations for a friend’s 16 year old sister, who is super into astronomy. This girl’s family is ultra-conservative, and she doesn’t think their parents will let anything with references to the Big Bang into the house because they didn’t let their kids read or watch Harry Potter. While brainstorming possible book recs, I tried finding resources on how to help kids who live in ultra-religious, anit-science households but I couldn't find any. 

I’ve seen tons of stories and op-eds from adults who were raised in this type of environment, but I can’t find resources for kids who are still in that environment (or tips on how to help them).

254,"I had inserted into conversations with my parents hints about trying weed for my anxiety because I thought they’d be chill since they have frequent experience with weed &amp; CBD oil, and they took the pipe before I even got to use it, expressing that they didn’t want me to get into trouble or have it be a gateway for something worse, despite that they’re stealth weed users themselves (this was under my nose until I was like 14, and they know I figured it out, we’re chill about it). Understandable. Like any other 16 year old, I snooped around trying to find it. I just found something much more interesting. I found an unused syringe in one of those sealed plastic containers that keeps it sterile before medical use. I’m really concerned. Neither of my parents have diabetes or any condition I know of that’d require a syringe just laying around... and it isn’t one of those dental things that looks like a syringe used to whiten your teeth either, we have one of those and it is quite different. Should I be concerned? Should I do something? I don’t think they’re the type of people do use heroin or anything... they’re super nice for the most part and are usually sober, sometimes they go out to smoke and I pretend I don’t know they’re stoned and they pretend they aren’t, and they both work in professional environments and have their stuff together. So I’d like to not think that there’s anything suspicious going on... but... is there any other reason they’d have that? 
My mom’s brother killed himself because he was super mentally ill and dabbled in drugs to see if it’d help, and to my knowledge he was never a frequent user, only tried weed and pills and never liked them... maybe when she went through his stuff she found it and took it?

256,"I'm 22 and she's just turned 23. We knew each other in high school, afterwards I moved away to a bigger city, we started talking when I lived away and got together when I moved home at 20, we've now been dating 2 years and living together for about a year.


When I was away at college I used/sold drugs which I’m quite open about. Selling weed got me in some sketchy situations where I was living and someone I knew even got shot. When moved home I had quit but was kind of a mess mentally due to some baggage so was drinking very heavily (shakes). She got me to cut back significantly which was a big change as I had grown up with heavy alcoholics. She didn't make me I was just busy with her all the time, so I wasn’t drinking. I got a new job as I lost my old one for drinking, I met an old friend on this job and smoked with him a few times which she didn't seem to care about. I soon found out my old buddy was a bad addict with morphine, valium and everything else and noped out of there. I quit that job because it sucked and got one at a restaurant. Coming home one night I ran into a different old friend and we went to smoke a J, this is where the problem started, this was my old circle from high school and I hadn’t made new friends since moving home so I went back to hanging out with them all the time.


 We smoked a lot of weed and smoked them as poppers( ripped of bit of cigarette packed into a one-hit tube with weed on top and smoked it in a bong) I went back to my stoner ways as I was hooked on the tobacco and enjoying the weed so I was smoking all day every day when I wasn't hanging out with her, unfortunately while I was living away all these friend had started moving large amounts and doing quite a bit of stuff, very occasionally id do some blow with them and a couple times I had shrooms but for the most part I just stayed a pot-head. after about 6 months everything had gone nuts, one of the guys was doing insane amounts of coke and would be up for day and his girlfriend at one point ran him   as he was trying to pick a fight with her while she was driving with another guy (he was geared up so didn’t get hurt), another dude owed the local bikers 70k for “losing” a shipment and then losing the one that was meant to replace it, the third became a run-of the mill crackhead who pimped out his gf. So yeah, fuck that, she wasn’t comfortable hanging out with them any more and eventually neither was I, so I stopped seeing them and only really had contact with text.


 Then around this time I got a windfall of 160k when I turned 21 (My sister and I were run over by a dump truck when I was young, she died and I broke 37 bones in my body and got PTSD, survivors guilt, depression and a Brain Injury) , I quit my job and bought a reno-house and started a hobby farm and she moved in, I tried really hard to quit poppers as it was expensive. Tobacco made it very hard and distressing to quit (panic attacks, ptsd nightmares) and I wanted to quit weed at the same time as I didn’t want to just lean onto one habit to quit the other as I figured then id end up just smoking tobacco again. We made the resolution that id quit for 6 weeks and then re-assess if I needed or wanted to smoke weed but id make the decision without any in my system. The 2 weeks of quitting was hell and she stood by for all my cravings and was super supportive she even tried to get me to smoke a bit of weed during one panic attack just to ease the transition, but I said “no”. 
The 6 weeks came and went and I was far too busy to put time towards weed, (fun fact: my new house was robbed of electronics during this time and it was likely one of the addict buddies so since I didn’t know which one I fully cut them all off), when I got home my best friend even quit so I was back to not having any drugs in my life. I drank occasionally but we had lots of money to blow through going out to eat all the time, buying stuff for the house and planning renovations so we plowed through all that stuff eventually slowing down to a crawl due to some funding issues when the insurance company tried to appeal my payment (still fighting this but winning). During this time, she graduated and got a job at our local hospital, our ability to work on the house slowed to just keeping it clean and doing a job every couple weeks. I had a lot of time sitting at home on my ass bored so I wanted to start smoking again, I told her I was going to start smoking once every couple weeks that way id know I had the ability to smoke weed on and off which we agreed on.


 After doing that for a while the two-week thing became less of an idea and more of her rule. After a few months this became problematic as it felt like she was timing my smoking frequency and made me kind of resentful of “the rule”. She ended up picking up more hours, my friend started smoking again and we’d smoke when we hung out. We had a couple days of arguing and towards the end we got on the topic of resentment and I light-heartedly approached the topic of weed and told her I didn’t like the feeling of her having control over my weed consumption and this caused resentment which I didn’t like. And that since cutting off my social circle due to their drug use was my idea, the decision that smoking poppers was something I wanted to quit was my idea, I was the one who quit, and after a year when I considered picking up weed itself again and my idea to try  to keep it every couple weeks to make sure I had control, it was also my idea and not one I planned on making a permanent rule. It was my body and if I wanted to smoke that was my decision, if I wanted to quit that too was my decision, if I’m enjoying myself and its not interfering with other responsibilities then there is no problem, if it starts to interfere she can let me know and if she thinks its becoming a habit she can ask me about it and ill address and appreciate her concern but ultimately it is and always has been my decision and only one aspect of my life.


 Me smoking doesn’t mean I care for, love or respect her any less it just means I’m 22 and sometimes enjoy smoking weed when I’m working on the farm, watching documentaries while she is working or when I’m around the house cleaning up. And that though our preconceived notions of weed are different there is no reason that should come between us any more than our disagreeing notions of weather bacon is good.
 

So, the larger argument that was a part of dissipates and we kiss and make up and make a talking stick for future arguments and I assumed its just been left as we’re more important than our arguments and we can just agree to disagree on the virtues of weed and carry on. Slowly I start smoking more and every time I do I try and keep it out of her face, I don’t smoke in the house and whenever I smoke I try and pair it with a productive chore like doing laundry or something. If I smoke at night I smoke in the driveway in the car and air it out, so it doesn’t smell in the morning.


 Then we go on a trip and hang out with my old friends who live there like 10 days on the trip, among thee friends is a buddy of mine she loves and has his life together and thinks is a good influence the whole time I’m there he wants to smoke for old times sake and she doesn’t really mind at all, were even smoking out the apartment window while she sits next to us drinking with other friends, we smoke about every second day when we are chilling at home and not going out.


 We get back from our trip and I’m still at a similar frequency but still trying to pair it with chores and taking a few days every now and then off to make sure its not becoming a necessity to eat/sleep.  One day I get some edibles and she gets high with me and enjoys herself, at one point she sees me smoking in the car and got weird about it but I didn’t think anything of it because she was stoned. The next day she acts pissy until I confront her about it, she flips out over the car as I told her months back I wouldn’t smoke in the car when a friend and I were about to when she said she wasn’t cool with it, but I had forgotten the deal. Then I started apologizing and say I had forgotten but its been where I’ve been smoking. All of a sudden the fact I’m smoking again is new news and she gets pissy and tries to shut it all down, I tell her I don’t want her thinking she can control my decisions and if she has a problem we can talk about it and ill address any concerns but ultimately I should be able to control my own decisions and take that responsibility and she should trust my ability to be responsible for myself. She starts crying again and I promise to uphold the agreement of not smoking in the car I had forgotten but since I should be able to smoke on the property I own so if I’m not smoking in the house ill smoke in the barn. We agree on that but its getting late, so we agree to disagree on weed usage itself and just go to bed. 


She has a few days off and everything becomes hunky dory again, she starts working more again and after a week we are back to the status quo. Then a couple nights ago I ended up in the hospital because I hurt my neck badly lifting one of our goats. None of the pain meds we have really help but I smoke weed and it fixes it mostly and I’m not in agony which she’s cool with the next day were at the hospital to get scans and they prescribe some stronger meds which I tell her I’m going to avoid and smoke green instead which she begrudgingly accepts, we get home, I smoke and wee go watch tv and cuddle, we fall asleep and when I wake up I start hurting again so I take out the dog have a puff and go back in, she asks if I smoked and I tell her I did and she gets low key annoyed but doesn’t seem to want to discuss it the night winds down and I think were going to bed except when I wake up in the morning she’s slept in a different room (first time ever as its accepted no matter what we don’t go to bed with unresolved shit and we go to bed together) she’s pissy and says she’s mad all day but as usual refuses to confront me. 
This is driving me nuts what do I do? I really feel like there’s nothing wrong with my habit, I stay on top of my shit and it doesn’t interfere with my life. I can’t get her to explain why she hates it or what wrong with being someone who smokes weed. How do we make peace with this?


Some background info on her: she grew up mirror opposite to me with a strict Pentecostal family that doesn’t drink, and wont even talk about drugs. She’s a nurse so she understands medicine as well as addiction (in a clinical sense). She drinks herself once or twice a week (usually with me) and had times when she was single where she partied a lot with vodka. She’s never been a smoker but had smoked before we met, she’s smoked on a handful of occasions with me and didn’t used to seem to have a problem with it even now shell do edibles every couple months when I have them. She used to want to try acid but I scared her off it talking about bad trips but she has been with me when I’ve done shrooms (like twice a year) and never tried to talk me out of them, we both dislike stoner culture  and she hates people who try to make weed out to be a miracle drug  (though we are both excited for legalization to see how its researched and controlled). One time during an argument she started crying because she wants to have kids with me one day and doesn’t want me to be a dad who smokes any more frequently than every couple weeks/months. She sucks at confrontation, arguing and cooking but is amazing in every other aspect and is the girl I one day plan on marrying.


I’m 22, I have a house and I have an income, I don’t need to work and I have little on my hands right now aside from keeping the house from falling apart and feeding the livestock while she works, my hobby does not get in the way of my responsibilities, how do I convince her weed is okay? It’s just weed. I cut all bad influence out of my life for her and I quit tobacco for me when it became too much, I should be free to control my intake of weed in the same way. I have bad depression and anxiety, I grew up in a really rough family, moved out as a teenager and over the years have cut some really bad stuff out of my life. So when I have something I enjoy wholesomely and whole-heartedly I get defensive of it and I don’t want to become me and who is otherwise the woman of my dreams and I'm trying to handle this whole thing as maturely as possible so id appreciates some external opinions. Also i keep an eye on my own usage, prioritize other responsibilities and have promised myself not to go back to smoking cigarettes or ""poppers""

Tl;Dr: I used to be addicted to tobacco, i have a rough past and took some time to change myself for the better and get my life in order. I want to smoke weed when i feel like it, my girlfriend is against weed for some reason and its getting between us. Shes trying to be controlling of it and wants rules, i want full control over my own decisions and wont settle for feeling like i don't have control but i also want my girlfriend and i to be on the same page again.

258,"I just recently left my job since I'm in the process of moving back home to be with my family.

TL:DR; Is this a sign that he might be interested again, and should I drop him a message?  ",07Apr2018,1
261,"Let me give you some context about why I'm not a fan of this guy:

My friend met him when she was a junior in high school (back in 2014) and he was a senior. They were all in the same friend group so that's how they got closer. She really fell for him at first and he was being quite flirty, so they started up a thing around january 2016. Fast forward to prom, and he DIDN'T ASK HER. I just found that weird, but she brushed it aside because ""the ticket was too much money anyway and she wasn't even a senior yet, so it was fine"". 

Anyway, that night at prom, I heard he was seen spending a lot of time with this girl who also went to our school, I think they were friends but they were dancing together and stuff, talking, etc. I didn't tell my friend this because she was really into him and maybe people overassumed something, maybe it was innocent dancing/hanging between them...idk.

Anyway they started officially dating summer of 2015 but things fell apart around September/october. She would come to me almost weekly with some issue: mainly he was pulling away and she was barely seeing him (then again, he was off in University and she was still in high school)....but they lived in the same city, about 15 mins away....he wasn't really putting effort in and she was getting tired of it.

So she dumped him and they didn't talk for like a week. He texted her and was apologizing and said he believed they could work out and to give him another shot, so she did &amp; they got back together like after 3 weeks. Suprise suprise, this also went south fast. He started doing the same shit (being distant, little effort, etc) and they broke up again at the end of January 2016. 

(I'll add in here that I'm friends with the ""girl from prom"" on facebook, because we went to the same high school). Literally a month later, she has a status update saying that she was now dating my friend's ex!

My friend was heartbroken but I kind of had my suspicions when I initially heard about him dancing with this girl months ago at prom...like they clearly kept in contact while he was dating my friend, seeing as they started dating just a month after she dumped him. And they lasted a while....almost 9 months. 

Around september of 2016, my friend got a fb message from her ex (still with his new girl) asking how she was/general small talk. She was pretty happy he reached out but would literally insist that she had no feelings/they were just friends. They started messaging again and kept it up for about a month.

Lo and behold....early Novemeber 2016, this dude and his ""new girl"" break up, and he goes back to my friend saying he messed up and he misses her and wants to try again. 

My friend went back to him! I honestly cautioned her that it could end badly but she said she believed in at least giving it a second chance (even though they technically already broke up twice before....). 
THey barely lasted long, like 4 months. They ended it because things weren't working out like they had expected and once they got past the honeymoon phase, he started to disappear AGAIN!

So they ended things mutually and this time my friend actually moved on a  few months later started casually dating a guy from her program at school. I liked him way more (didn't really get to know him well) but I could tell he was mature and treated her so so well. 

I heard rumors that this ex of hers was hanging out with ""prom girl"" again, because a mutual friend saw them together at a movie theatre in the summer last year. I obviously told my friend this and she got pissed as fuck.

Okay so here's the part that has me fuming: my friend ended up dumping her new boyfriend because her ex was back to talking to her (not sure what the case was with '""prom girl""), and she told her ex that she was single again, wanted to see him (WHY??). He agreed, and come christmas break, they were casually dating again.

They're still seeing each other now but oh god, I'm so worried he's gonna repeat his mistakes and hurt her again. I do NOT trust this kid, seeing as he seems to like floating between girls whenever he wants. She still idolizes him and thinks that they're meant to be and all of that. 

Reddit, am I overthinking this? Should I intervene or at least tell her I think she's making a bad mistake? I don't know why she's so obsessed with her ex but she keeps letting him come back over and over (i think this is their fourth time dating??) Honestly, I feel like my friend doesn't even see that she's likely his fall-back option. I'm almost 99% sure he had a thing for ""prom girl"" while he was with my friend but he's just a selfish asshole, so he kept quiet about prom girl, so he could get attention from both of them.

He knows my friend is literally obsessed with him so of course he keeps going back when he gets dumped by prom girl...but my friend only see's him coming back as ""he really does like me"". If he really did like you, why did he have his sights elsewhere in the first place?!

It's gotten bad to the point where I sometimes can't even talk to her if I know she's with him. I just know he's no good for her and I'm shocked that she still hasn't realized it.

264,"I have this recurring problem in all kinds of relationships (friendly/romantic), where I fall *hard* for the person if they seem to show any interest in me at all. So there are two issues I face because of this:

* I get offended if I feel that the other person does not show the same kind of love and attention to me and get slightly anxious about if they like me or not. For example, even in a friendship I am pissed if the friend frequents another friend circle that I'm not a part of, or seems to be more chummy with someone else.
* Because I trust them so much, I open up and get comfortable with making these semi-insensitive jokes and confessing certain things that I've done in the past that I'm too proud of (not criminal or anything, just being a reeeal dick to ppl anonymously on-line) that turn ppl off because apparently they aren't ready yet for that level of sharing.

Also it hurts really really bad when I realize that the other person was just not that into me (but I guess that's universal). 

I feel that I have a deeper problem that I can't really *like* people if I don't trust them at this level...like I can talk with them, have a laugh and what not, but it always feels fake on some level to me and somehow I can't reconcile with that because I **hate** being fake myself.

I’m the only employed person in my house (5). College is $315 monthly and I have a car loan of $227. I was not uncomfortable with the idea of living paycheck to paycheck as I was investing on my education and I will have paid my loan off by the end of 2019.

The other people in my family were aware of that and knew that I wouldn’t be able to pay the house expenses anymore. They encouraged me to pursue my degree. 

My parents are divorced, but my sperm donor doesn’t give a flying fuck about me.

I shower maybe once every 3 weeks (that includes both hair and body), and almost never brush my teeth..
I'm not ugly, I'm not fat, I work out, I go out a lot, but I just don't smell bad? So I don't shower out of laziness and because I don't feel the need to.
It's been like this for the past 4-5 years and it bugs me, I basically shower because I start to get grossed out by the idea that I haven't showered in so long, and feel bad about it..

273,"I got accepted into the University of Arizona, where I plan on majoring in Agronomy. I fell victim to senioritis this semester, sort of, I’m still doing ok, but my lowest grade isn’t even in a class. 

Yes, you read that right. My F comes from a “class” called “Planning for Future Career Success” (PFCS). All it entails is the school forcing kids, to do real world hoopla such as building your resume, applying to colleges, and working things out with the armed forces, if someone chose that career path. 

The kids planning on enrolling in college were required to take a campus visit, apply to at least 3 colleges that align with your desired career path, and attending a couple college rep visits to the HS. Basically, I’ve shirked my responsibilities, I only applied to one college, and I called it good. Then, I skipped everything else this hour required. 

Anyways, the situation is this: my highest grade is an A in my Chemistry class. This is what’s kind of bugging me about my imminent acceptance being revoked, because my STEM course throughout HS are all A’s.

My expectations around my birthday are always wildly high and I'm never satisfied with what my SO plans. I don't communicate anything I want beforehand and then spend the day upset with what I get.

So, as you can see in my original post, I have had suspicions that my husband is still seeing the woman I found out about a month ago. Well, last night he said he was at the gym and I used ‘find iPhone’ to see if he was really at the gym and of course he was at her house. He’s been telling me that I’m paranoid and driving myself crazy but I knew he was lying. Now that I actually have proof, I’m just sitting on this information because if he knows I know then I’ll either have to leave him or I’m sending the message that what he’s doing is ok and I’ll keep forgiving him. I know I probably sound desperate and weak, but I’m not ready to give up hope yet. I know the man he once was when he was loving and caring and he’s changed, I’m still holding onto hope that he can be that man again. I’m starting to accept more and more that we may end, but I won’t give up this easily. I talked to someone that works with them and he said he’s had his suspicions and would talk to him. So he tried talking to him today, but my husband flat out denied anything was going on. My husband has been talking about wanting to play poker tomorrow so I think they’re planning on spending the day together. I don’t know if I should ask him to stay with me or let him go, check ‘find iPhone’ again, and have someone ‘run into’ them. It’s at the point where he needs someone else to talk to him, so it’s not just coming from the crazy wife. To make matters worse, I had a huge scare with my pregnancy on Thursday night and ended up in the ER. Both babies are fine, but he still went to her house the next night even after that. 

I know I have to accept that our marriage may be over, but until then how should I handle this? Also, I’ve been really positive and loving with him lately and not starting any arguments. I’ve been the ‘ideal wife.’  But what now?",07Apr2018,8

279,"I don't want to tell my whole life story, but basically I have a deep, enduring resentment toward my parents (a lot more so towards my mom) because she constantly dismisses the things that I say. On top of that, she has an idea of what she wants my life to be like and keeps trying to push me into that direction though I've made it abundantly clear that I don't want that. For example, even after expressing to her how much it hurt my feelings that she never acknowledges my passions and persistently pushes me down a career path that I don't want to do. I get that a career she wants me to do (in medicine) is more practical and stable (than writing as well as other creative endeavors), but even after landing a job and trying to work on my creative projects on the side, she still takes no interest in that. It's only questions about how I will advance my career. Again, I get it but I've told her that my job is meaningless to me. 

In addition to that, both of my parents are religious Christians while I am an atheist. They don't respect my beliefs or even an “agree to disagree” situation but are up in arms when I express something that conflicts with their beliefs (a common theme I find amongst many older Christians). While that doesn't necessarily bother me more than dealing with anyone else, it comes into play with the trajectory of my life. Last year I had cancer and they came at me with all their religious nonsense that I quietly endured and didn't fight because I physically didn't have the energy. Now, I recently found out that the treatment might not have been as effective as we thought (making for a poorer prognosis) and the first thing my parents think about is getting me “saved” if I end up dying, though I've been very vocal about how I don't believe in that. 

These things have caused me to develop a deep resentment towards my parents and specifically my mother. I know they mean well, but I feel like everything I say is dismissed and the lack of respect for me as an independent young adult is incredibly frustrating. I'm trying to let this go because it's not good for my health, but it seems like something new always comes up and they're always right back on their bullshit as if my protests meant absolutely nothing.

280,"My mum has recently started her menopause, and gets medication for it from the doctor. I've done some research and oestrogen is commonly used as a medication during that time.

My parents have recently got some coffee and alcohol off a relative and left them out in the kitchen.

Days after I returned home my parents started to identify that I drink a lot of alcohol and started referring to me as an alcoholic. They left the alcohol out on the counter for a few days. I asked to try some but was put slightly off by a weird smell I've not smelt before.

One night after everyone had gone to sleep I decided to drink some. It tasted slightly different from normal alcohol but I downed it anyway and felt drunk for a few hours.

I asked my parents why it smelt that way and they told me it came from a country in which there's a lot of sugar cane.

The coffee was a present for me and the alcohol was rum.

A few weeks later I was about to make a coffee but was turned off by the same smell.

I've recently become pretty sure my mum is taking her prescription menopause medication and putting it in my food and drinks.

I think this because I've recently experienced - A massive drop in libido, I used to have an incredibly high sex drive - A more feminine outlook on life. I felt that I was gay for a few weeks. - Trouble having errections

I've ordered a menopause test kit online which tests for the presence of the chemical oestrogen, but I'm just wondering what else I should do, or if it's even valid.

281,"A bit of context. In this class, we have to do a presentation in a group at least once throughout the class. I missed the presentation date I was given, so the professor gave me another date, next week. This class also uses blackboard, if anyone is familiar with it. Each week there's a new topic, and a group has to do a presentation on it, but the class as a whole has to write brief essays on two of any of the four weeks' topics. I'll explain this part later.

My last group was on blackboard, so I expected by this week the group I am now in would have been updated. Nothing. I reach out to the professor, and he starts getting slightly hostile about how I need to ""move on"". I send him screenshots to show him that i'm not in the correct blackboard group, and he tells me to stop worrying about what's on blackboard and get in contact with the people i'm presenting with. How am I supposed to know this? He doesn't announce the groups in class, and the only source of information in this class is the syllabus, which has no information I can use. As far as I know, this other group doesn't even know i've been moved there. 

Right now my only hope is that by chance, one of the first people who posts their essay on blackboard will be one of the people who's presenting next week. Thing is, most of the people in the class wait for these last two weeks to post their essays, so chances are there's going to be some 20 essays posted all at once.

The other friend, let’s call her good friend, is someone I care for dearly, and somewhat “lived” with for a couple of months. 

Recently they both have became roommates and my intimate friend has told me that she wants to stop what we are doing and that the only outcome that will come out of it is that we would have to stop being friends all together. For me I feel like she was basically saying “I’m done with you and I don’t want to see you again”  I vouched that we work things out for the better. 

The thing is is that a couple of weeks ago we had sex and that’s when everything started to go complicated. I should mention that about 6 months ago she for out of a very serious and committed relationship. Now that I write this I realize that I might be a rebound. 

Oh did I mention we are all coworkers... yeah. 

My good friend always made it clear that she had no problem with me staying at the house and actually wanted me there. Intimate friend moved in and that changed. Intimate friend started being very rude and disrespectful towards me, i am sensitive but it was too the point where she was just being rude to be rude. I got the message and left. I haven’t been back since. 

This is when everything has shifted. We all went from texting, calling, and hanging out to nothing. Neither will text me or ask to hang out.

This also transitioned into the work space. Intimate friend would get increasingly annoyed and be rude while we worked together. And today good friend gave me a very cold shoulder, only talking to me when necessary and when then she’d talk though me, not at me.

I should also mention that they got a dog together which made me feel as though I was being replaced. By. A. Dog. 

I don’t know how to interpret any of this. They both are obviously mad or irritated at me, but why? I’m trying to be as mature about the situation as possible but I don’t know if I should reach out or not. 

I do feel very hurt that I’m left in this situation to begin with and i want to repair the relationship but im not sure how. 

I did reach out to intimate friend and said we should talk, she said that is fine but has not gone any further to express that she want to talk about the situation. 

Should I text them both, implying that we should all sit down and talk and try and figure what’s going on. Or should I wait for them to talk to me. 

I don’t want to lose them as friends. Not to mention is makes me feel like shit on how it’s two against one.

-Ive known them for over 4(?) Years and have met them IRL. 

-I was an admin on the old server they migrated to Discord from so they had a level of trust in me.

-I joined their new server after being invited by one of them and got banned immediately. All I did was join the AFK channel.


-None of my friends seem to be mad at me except the one who banned me who has also blocked me and won't speak to me.


-None of my friends know why I was banned and the ones who do won't tell me or anyone else why. I don't know which of my friends these are.


-I got wind that ""I wasn't getting along with [person]."" I messaged them apologizing and they had no idea what I was talking about.


-The other nonspecific reason is that I was complaining about something. If I were being insufferable enough to warrant a ban they would have warned me first or banned me right then and there. Not 8 months later.

-I was told that the guy who banned me ""already talked to me about it"" which is simply not true. I haven't spoken to him and months and HE BLOCKED ME. It would have been almost a year ago.

-I hadn't been on their server for literally months as I'm busy with school.

-My friends who have asked for me get shot down and told to drop the subject. It's like someone wants to erase me from the planet.


The good side in all this is most of my friends are still my friends but don't know how to help me. I created my own discord to talk to them and got a few to join and hang out.

 I have people I know, people I hang out with on a regular basis, but outside of our scheduled hang out sessions I don't hang out with anyone. 
The last time I had a steady friend that I could talk about anything with was in high school. We were very close and, even though I probably wasn't his best friend he was mine.

298,"Up until now the process at my company was that every April you would have a performance / salary review. As an outcome of that, your salary for the following year is decided. Barring anything major, most people at the very least get a pay rise in line with inflation. All these pay rises are paid as of the end of April, but are backdated to the 1st of January. E.g. if you got a pay rise of £1000, then your April pay packet would have an additional extra £250 to cover the arrears (before tax, of course). My employer also offers matching 5% pension contributions, so that would also be an extra £12.50 in this example.

However it's now been announced that as of next year, these pay rises will not be backdated, your pay will (hopefully!) increase in the April pay packet and that's that.

I purchased a Dell Inspiron 15 5000 series gaming laptop on eBay from Best Buy. I used PayPal credit to purchase it so I could pay it off in monthly payments, because $700 is quite a lot to pay off in one lump sum for me. Anyway, eBay predicted it would take about a week and a half to arrive, so I sat around and waited. 

Being the impatient person I am, I began brainstorming any way I could get around waiting for this laptop. And then it occurred to me that I could probably just go to Best Buy, buy the same laptop with my credit card, play it until the new one arrives, then once the new one gets here I could return the one I ordered on eBay to the Best Buy store but use the receipt from the one I payed with my credit card. That way I still get to keep my PayPal credit monthly payments instead of having to pay for the one I bought at Best Buy right away. Not the most honest thing to do in the world, but I figured if I returned the eBay one, the box wouldn’t be opened and then Best Buy could still sell it like a brand new laptop instead of discounted as an openboxed item or whatever. 

Anyway, it turns out there’s something wrong with the audio on laptop I bought at the store. I won’t get into the problem too much, but having noticed the issue, I decided to open the eBay laptop once it arrived and see if all of these laptops had this issue or if it was just the one (Oh well, I guess Best Buy will have to make due with getting an open-boxed laptop no matter which one I end up returning anyway).

Upon opening the eBay laptop, I notice that the screens are slightly different. The computers are identical, but the eBay laptop’s screen is obviously of a lower quality. I later read online that the laptops used to be made with those worse screens and that they had updated the newer ones to having the better screens like on the in-store laptop. 

To me this appeared instantly problematic because I’m not sure if it would be safe to return this laptop as the other one if I were to be able to fix the audio issue. 

*My question is: Would I get into trouble returning the eBay laptop to Best Buy as the laptop I had bought in-store. Is there any way they could figure out I returned the wrong laptop and would they contact me to correct the issue or would they prosecute me?*

My other option is that if I am not able to fix the audio issue on the in-store laptop, I will have to return that one to the store for a refund and then stick with the eBay one with the bad screen. 

And my third option would be to return the in-store laptop for a new one of the same model and hope the audio works on that one, while at the same time returning the eBay one and canceling the PayPal credit payment option. This way I just take a hit by having to pay the $700 straight up, which will hurt a bit but is doable. The only reason I feel the need to do this is because Best Buy has some strict return policies on laptops; I only have 14 days to return one for a refund. 

*My other question is: What do I do? Please help! I need some insight into how returns work and if I can work around any of these issues. Also just some basic guidance from someone other than myself would be appreciated!*",07Apr2018,1

A few days ago I saw the person who did it. He didn’t see me, but I saw him. I got a very long look at him. I recognized him like I know the back of my hand. It is a face I will never forget. He had not changed at all over these years. Not only that, but I saw the same vehicle from that fateful night. He’s been driving the same car all these years. He lives in the development next to mine by some strange coincidental luck. I didn’t see which building he went into, but I know he’s there. The memory of that night and seeing his face and the same vehicle I was in at one point, once again, has driven me beyond the point of pure chaotic madness. I am in serious financial debt and seeing him just made me feel $600 poorer all over again. I need that money and I am willing to do whatever it takes to get it back.

Then he will walk out go make food or go back to his room for 5-10 mins and then walk back into my room and start talking again.

306,"Background: I moved to a new city 6 months ago for great job opportunity that came quickly without a lot of planning, leaving my boyfriend back in my old town. The plan has been for him to move up here once he receives clearance from the state certification to practice in our new state. The process would take about 6-9 months so we knew we'd have to do long distance for a little while, which was daunting but we were up for it.  

For he most part, we've done fairly well. We try to see each other about once a month and talk constantly throughout each day. In the beginning, the adrenaline of the new job kept me occupied and it didn't feel like the distance put any strain on us. 

Lately, things have started to change from an emotional standpoint. Work is starting to feel more routine, so now instead of the hyper-vigilant focus on one area of my life, I'm starting to notice what's absent way more than I used to. Our monthly visits are starting to feel nearly impossible to wait for. I'm constantly anxious and wanting to book flights to see him, which is not exactly responsible given the costs of living on my own in a fairly expensive city. BF and I seem to trade off bouts of depression for our situation - he was in a pretty bad place about a month ago and now it seems to be my turn. I cry to him on the phone, and though he's incredibly patient, caring, and understanding, I can tell he feels as helpless as I do. 

As with everything, this too shall pass, but for everyone else who has dealt with a LDR and stayed together, how did you handle the day-to-day? What kept you focusing on the future and not dwelling on the present? We have a time table, I know he'll be here sooner than later, but it's moments like these when I'm down that perspective can go a long way.

307,"I've tried so many calendar and list apps that I've driven myself insane.  Here's why I need organization:

I work full time as a digitization project manager, where I oversee 9 part time and one full time employee.  I organize them into teams for each mini-project that comes up and use Trello for that and our projects.  Trello has been a LIFE SAVER.  I use it as a white board for team management, and as a Kanban board for projects.  I also use it as a daily to-do list for myself, so I can move over anything not done on Monday over to Tuesday.  

All that being said, that's not what I need organized.  See, I'm also a full time grad student graduating in May, and I also have 2 presentations at 2 different conferences in May.  What I need, is something to organize my thoughts when I sit down at a computer to do schoolwork, write a presentation, jot down ideas for work projects, etc.  I'd like to be able to work on one thing at a time, but my brain just goes all over the place.

308,"Hello Reddit,

I need some perspective about moving because I am considering two vastly different options and can’t decide which is the best fit.

Some background: I am 31 years old and have been living in an isolated desert/mountainous county about 45 minutes from Los Angeles. Originally from the Midwest, I moved here 4 years ago to go to an art/film school 15 minutes south of my current home. I am graduating next year with my Masters Degree. I have 2 roommates who are also graduating next year as well and have expressed that they will be moving to LA upon graduation. 

I am considering renting my entire house to myself when they move but can’t decide if it would be in my better interest to move to LA. I love my house. It’s definitely not “nice” and is old, dirty and janky but It is also light and airy, homey, and very peaceful. It has been passed down through art students since the early 70s (including one of my favorite filmmakers) who have left artwork, furniture and little trinkets that “belong to the house”. It just has a great vibe about it. It is literally at the base of a mountain.

I am an artist and musician and have always dreamed of having a small house in a very remote location in which I can have a lot of space to work in as well as live. (Although ideally, it would be in a different region, but that is not going to happen right now.) My current house has 3 bedrooms, 2 full baths (one with bath tub - have always wanted one), full kitchen, central heat and a/c, washer and dryer in a shed. 

One of my major interests is growing a lot of my own food (I spent some time living on a commune and have carried over some habits from there) and over the past few years I’ve built up a garden in the massive backyard as well, with the ability to expand it. The landlord is very laid back, and we have a fine relationship. As long as I pay rent on time, I can pretty much do whatever I want. There is no phone reception but there is internet.

As far as moving to LA, there are obviously many pros. It is an exciting city with great energy. It is also absolutely necessary to network, in my field. I will be close to other artists, musicians, etc. and I feel this could be helpful to further my career. My boyfriend of 2 years lives in LA, and I spend every Thurs-Sun at his apartment, as I work at a museum downtown on the weekends. He is a professional musician and has had so many opportunities because of his ability to go to shows, meet people and work with them. 

Just to be clear, I am not interested at this time in moving in with him, or in having roommates again. I really want to live alone. 

I lived in a major city for most of my life and always enjoyed it, as I love food/restaurants, art and music. I like LA as well, and know I would like living there. The thing is, the rent of my whole house is equal to the cost of a very small 1 bedroom or studio apartment in LA, in any of the neighborhoods I would want to live in. It is hard for me to justify spending that much money on such a small space. It is also likely that I would spend more money on food and drinks, as it’s easier access. 

I know that a major concern of mine is proximity to work. I have been working managing a recording studio at my school, and once I graduate will not have that job. I do have the museum job in LA, and have been given an offer to work at a former faculty member’s recording studio on some film mixing and sound design projects, once I graduate, also in LA, however I know I will need additional work. There aren’t any job opportunities by my house, as there is only a grocery store and a few small, terrible restaurants nearby. 

Is it worth paying the same amount of money for a tiny space and not having to commute, or having my “dream” setup and traveling 45 minutes to work? 

Many of my friends think I am nuts for wanting to live in such a remote place when there is a huge city so nearby, but I have always been interested in living in a more alternative, calm and Self-sustained sort of lifestyle. But, I also don’t know if I am challenging myself by staying in the same place, when I could be pushing myself harder and accomplish my career goals. 

Any input would be wonderful, thank you.

TLDR; should I move from the middle of nowhere to the city or rent my whole house to myself and set up an art studio? ",07Apr2018,3

Well this afternoon while coming home from work she called and asked what was I gonna wear. 

Bare in mind I was tired when I agreed to go, and just wanted to go to bed. 

Anywho, I told her the dress I was gonna wear and then when I got home I took a picture of it. 
All this time I'm  telling myself 'I will go I will go'; knowing damn well I don't want to go, that I'm tired as fuck, and I have a homework due 11 PM tonight.

I see my mom and my sceond sister getting ready. 

My mom is already bitching cause my first sister is constantly calling and telling us about these damn hats she's making for us to wear at the tea party. 

I ask my mom what time are we leaving. She say 3:00. So I told her it's quarter to 3. Then she said well 3:30 then. 

From 3 to like 3:20 my second sister is in the bathroom and I'm using that time to hurry eat. Then my mom comes downstairs all bex and miserable cause my first sister is constantly calling and bothering her, and then she sees that I'm just heading in the bathroom to bathe and gets even more upset.

That just change my hold attitude about this thing and going. 

So I told her I'm not going because she's acting a way. 

I ask what's the price for the ticket?  She's like ""the price isn't important I already pay for you"" 

I ask again what is the price for the ticket?  ""$25"" I give her the money knowing later when they scold me for not going, they will though it in my face that they had already paid for the ticket for me.

And I told her I'll call my older sister and tell her I'm not going, because I known my first sister will start acting up too like my mom and be bex that I'm not going.

I go in my room and call my sister.

""Hey I'm not going again.""
""Why""
""Mommy in her thing and acting miserable, and I never bathe in time""
""Why didn't you bathe?""

317,"So I have an interview coming up which is for a job in a health care environment (NHS) and I want to prepare a good example for the question 'a time you faced an ethical dilemma', as I know this is a common question they like to ask! 
An example I've thought of is when a coworker of mine confided in me that she was being sexually harassed by someone else we worked with, she promised me not tell tell anyone as she didn't want to get anyone in trouble and was worried she was just being sensitive etc. So my dilemma was if i betray her trust and report the issue, or keep the secret and allow the harassment to continue. 
In the end I decided to support her through it, help her comply evidence, advise and encourage her (without pressuring her) and eventually go with her to seek proper advice from a senior member of staff. 

Now is this a good example?! It would probably be classed more as a moral dilemma because I don't think breaking a promise is really unethical, but i think it still shows the inner debate for trying to work out what to do for the best. However I'm not sure if it's better to pick an example where I've taken an action to actually tackle or challenge someone acting unethically? Like the standard 'i saw someone cheating on a test, I didn't want to get them in trouble but i also thought i should report it' scenario. I've caught people cheating before and directly confronted them and tried to encourage them to come clean etc. 

I'm just not sure what angle to come at this from! Does anyone have any tips?! Many thanks :)

To start, I'm a 24 year old female that works in customer service. I feel like my coworkers look at me like I am a joke. I definitely don't feel respected as a person (I am decent at my job, so I do not think it's due to my performance.) I wish I did not have to interact with them at all, but they all really push to interact with me constantly... and not in a nice, I-want-to-get-to-know-you way. In the way when someone can sniff out the insecurity in another person and jumps to attack it. For example, an older girl that I work with snickers at and sneers at me when she sees me. And EVERYONE has some stupid shit to say when walking past me. Everyone asks me ""What's wrong? You ok?"" in the kind of in the way where you just want to point out someone quiet who looks like they are hurting inside. I wish someone was *genuinely* interested in how I am, if they are going to ask that. I wish I was more intimidating. Leave me alone, please.

I find it stressful to have my GM (someone I've known a long time in gaming) and other guild members be disappointed in my lack of activity and I know if I quit outright it will end those relationships. They want me to be around to run content and raid, and I feel like I'm annoying them when I'm not able or interested in participating. I've been heavily considering quitting MMO's altogether, but don't know the best way to approach this with the people I've met online and have made friendships with. Should I just quit? If I do, what would be the best way to approach this with people I know won't like it? Looking for any advice or opinions, thank-you!",07Apr2018,1
