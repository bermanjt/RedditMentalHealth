0,So I was doing laundry in my communities laundry room and this lady walks in while I’m folding and she casually talks to me you know hi how are you small talk. And then she goes into conversation about a music thing that’s happening sometime in September (she kinda promotes music things (?)) and she invites me to her BBQ and stuff and I’ve only just met this women and she asked for my phone number and lied that I don’t have one and have her an email that I’ve had since kindergarten maybe and she just seemed very I don’t know unstable and desperate asking random teenagers. she gave me her address her phone number and invite and the music thing flyer and I want to burn them so badly but what I’m asking for is what should I do? I think I might end up blocking her email but I don’t known if I’ll ever see her in the laundry room again and if I do it’ll be very awkward. Have any suggestions?,28Jul2018,1

2,"Hello 

I’m a 22 year old male. I just graduated college two months ago. Computer engineering. I haven’t been able to find a job yet. I make little money by tutoring. 

I’ve been having anxiety attacks since highschool. But nothing as bad as today. My anxiety attacks are caused by my father. He pushes me really hard to do well. I don’t blame him since he works hard to provide. 

My siblings are also pushed very hard. They are both on very heavy depression medication. One attempted suicide a month ago. 

I am not on any medication. But this week has been really bad for my dad so he’s been pushing me even hard. Insulting me constantly to find a job. 

In the middle of these insults I started having anxiety attacks. I would get shortness of breath and start to blur, about to faint. But the difference today is that my whole body starting becoming numb. I couldn’t move whatsoever. Which was new. I was numb for about 5 minutes. This was while I was driving him. So we pulled over 

The second one happened within the same hour, after more insults. This time I collapsed, I’m still having a hard time breathing. I’m now typing this after the attack.


I don’t know what to do. I did not think I would need to move out, so all little money I’ve been making has been going towards paying my student debt. I don’t have enough saved to just get out and move. But I really don’t want to go through another attack soon.

3,how do i greet her with a kiss without it being weird.. she said she wanted me to kiss her last date he day after it ended. It’s the second date so should i go for her cheek or lips when greeting her? or go for the hug!!,28Jul2018,0
4,"I have an anxiety disorder and often take more than 30 minutes just to make a single decision. It eats up a lot of time. I tend to overthink things. Overthinking leads to more anxiety, and it just becomes an increasing cycle of misery.

  
This time my issue is this: My parents' storage unit flooded in during the last monsoon rains. Some of my childhood things are in there. My uncle has volunteered to clean the storage unit, but I don't trust his wife from stealing an item or two. She has taken some of my mom's blouses before. So I said I would help in the clean up.  Thing is I have an upcoming board exam this October, and I haven't been able to study for it. Life happens. I recently took leave from my teaching job so I can focus the next two months on really studying.  Cleaning the unit is slated for tomorrow afternoon. It's a four-hour bus ride to the location. I would be traveling alone. I know for a fact that it would drain me since I will be staying with extended family in the area. I do not want to start August tired.

Any general advice on decision making or pertinent advice to my current issue is welcome. Comments are reactions just as welll.",28Jul2018,1
6,"I’m such a fucking idiot. I was running to get stuff from my car when I dropped my phone on its screen. The whole screen is shattered and I’m such a fucking idiot. I shattered my phone screen just a little over a month ago and I BROKE IT AGAIN!!!! My dad payed to have it fixed the first time, but I know he won’t handle this well.

8,"We became friends and a few months after that  he told me that he has feelings for me. I don't feel physically attracted to him and he wasn't really mature back then (didn't want to get a job nor do anything besides of drinking).
Then he needed space, ok no problem because I kind of broke his heart. A few days later he texted me that he was sorry, I told him that I understand the whole space thing and we were back to being friends. This went on for a while.. really an on-off-friendship. Then some day I realized that we ain't gonna see each other often because school is going to be over for us and I wanted to stay friends with him, he didn't take that seriously so I was upset. This and his attitude towards anything that required work just let me blow up and I told him to leave me alone until he had put his life together. A few weeks later he had applied for some ok jobs and was doing well, he contacted me and we were friend again. Then we hang out once, I told him something very personal and this thing really hurt me and after I went home I received his text which basically was saying ""hey you're crazy and if you don't wanna fuck with me then we won't be friends anymore"". I was crushed and really pissed but I thought about the fact that we were friends, he had feelings for me and was probably desperate because I was about to move to another country.. I just texted him to leave me alone and never tell anyone what I told him that day (because this thing didn't involved me alone).
A year later (now) I met a friend of him and he told me to get in touch with him.. I refused and he kind of begged me, told me that he has a stable and real job right now. I texted him and we've got in touch again, he apologized for what he had texted me back then and guess what.. we're friends again.
I can't talk with him about romance stuff because I'm not sure if he's over me, I can't talk with him about random stuff because he told me that I talk to much and he really tries to listen but just can't because I'm talking about stuff he has no interest in, I can't talk with him about personal stuff because I struggle with trusting him. 
I didn't move back then but am now and idk what to do, idk if we are even friends.. I'm not his girlfriend so he doesn't have to listen to everything I say but sometimes I wish he would just tell me when he can't listen anymore instead of just spacing out. I'm not sure but I feel like we're not friends anymore and if I won't end it now then this will die after I moved away.
He told me he gonna miss me and wants to hang out more before I move but idk if I should invest in that any longer.

9,"Hello everyone, I know this isn't a big deal compared to some of the posts you get but I honestly don't know where to start looking for this.

So I wanted to buy something online from a pretty reputable website. Wanted to check their shipping rates but couldn't because it was covered from view by the standard box that won't go away unless you agree or deny some privacy stuff.

Now according to new laws I should be able to decline the website permission to use my cookies. Only this website mysteriously had a broken Revoke Consent- button. Don't worry, the button to allow them to use my cookies was working just fine :)

Is there anything I can do to report this website? Surely they aren't allowed to do this. Maybe there's a different subreddit that'd know more on the subject?

10,"I’m majoring in computer science and I have 3 semesters left. The classes I’m taking this semester are really hard and I have to get good grades (at least a C) in  all of them and have to get a C in one particular for sure or else I won’t be able to take classes next year. I’m also going to be graduating a year and a half late.

I want to stay off campus but it’s expensive and will cost $700 a month. I can afford it with student loans and help from my parents but barely. I don’t want to get private student loans as my government loans are already at $22,000. If I take more loans out this year, the total will be around $30,000. I’ll have my own room in a shared apartment that’s about 10 minutes from campus. However, I haven’t met the people that will live with me. Also, I either stopped talking to my friends or they graduated so not sure if it’s worth staying off campus. 

If I commute, I’ll save a lot of money. However, the commute is 70 minutes each way. I’ve commuted every semester so far and I’ve been able to slide by with mediocre grades with bad grades sprinkled in.

We had a discussion today on this issue, which went really rough. Apparently, it was merely an idea that she was throwing out. I disagree with this entirely. MY support for this is I was having breakfast with my best friend that morning when she called me about the trip to China for her to teach, in which she gave me more details. Let me start off by saying this, I appreciate all the traction my post received and the advice therein. I read every comment and considered everything. I read some comments saying I was suppressing my gf's wants and needs to travel. I have taken extreme care to consider this part of her. My family and friends can attest to the lengths I go to please her, whether it be spontaneous travel or planning for trips we can't afford to allow her that outing. A little history on me, I used to be like her, super go-getter and very sporadic. I would just go places, throwing caution to the wind. However, a massive downside to this was I wouldn't follow through on anything, I would start projects and drop them, moving on to the next. My gf back then noticed it's impact on my friends and family and my finances, all which was true, but I was exactly like her. She encouraged a more ""Logical and Realistic"" lifestyle, one with planning and direction. Foreign to me, I had no idea how a optimistic extrovert was to do that. Over time, and many arguments later dealing with this, it happened. I became more logical, more realistic. Hobbies became chores, passion became burden. I used to write poetry and novels, back to back with ease. Now, I can't get through a few sentences without my brain interjecting a more constructive and logical task for me. It's pitiful for me to realize this, and because I was asked to look at life in a way I never knew how, and in a manner and volume that was exhausting. I was constantly asked to change things about myself, like bedroom things, money things,  behavior things. It was too much, my family and friends noticed me changing radically, to better fit how she needed me. Soon, she wanted the ""old me"" and I was always side by side to that version of self. Today, I have been told I am too logical, too realistic, by my GF. She is right, I hate it. She said ""Oh my god, this is my fault. I did this to you."" Question now is, do I change AGAIN, to go through these hoops once more? One person cannot change this much without permanent mental problems or a negative-view of their SO. I understand she is an outgoing person, that's why I love her. We did a lot together, but over time, at her direction, I moved away from that to a more inward version of me, and now, that's wrong too. I'm writing this as someone who hasn't smiled once today, who has looked in the mirror at someone I don't recognize anymore. This me? If you ever met me 3-4 years ago, you would wonder if I had a stroke or something. I don't know what to do. Internally I am done with this relationship, externally, I don't know how to have that conversation with someone who has, all day, approached every point I would try to discuss as an avenue for me to separate.",28Jul2018,3

16,"Okay so, ever since I was a child I did this thing. I would kind of blank out but not really? It’s really hard to explain. But, I would kind of disconnect from my thoughts and emotions as a coping mechanism when things were happening to me when I was younger. I would feel disconnected from my thoughts and feelings and I’d feel like I wasn’t even connected to them in any way. Even several years later, I still do that. When I get triggered by something or when I’m talking about something that was traumatic from my past, I just disconnect. I feel almost like an alien in my own body. I’ll look in the mirror and not even recognize myself. I’ll look down at my hands and I don’t even feel like they’re mine. And, I don’t know what’s going on with me honestly. It’s been happening ever since I was really young. And, the best way I can describe it is that I’m watching myself life through a tv screen, that’s what it feels like.

Also, I feel incredibly emotionally disconnected to people. I never ever emotionally connect to people because if they leave, it won’t hurt as much.

I am still in that point in my life where I'm figuring a lot of things out. What I'm happy with about myself, all that stuff. I admit that I don't usually do what I set out to do, but I'm working on it. Small goals for the day lead to larger ones once the feeling of completing tasks is something I'm used to.

I'm not sure if it's due to my environment, or how I was raised, but I'm still able to shrug off if someone doesn't do what they claim. It doesn't anger me. I don't think negatively that the let down will happen. I just live by the term ""free to be you, free to be me"" or ""bygones be bygones.""

27,"I was speaking to her for 4 months. We spoke from when we woke up till when we went to sleep every single day and she was one of my best friends. One day I was trying to give her advice about her feeling depressed. She told me ‘I just want to feel loved’, so I told her I was in love with her. I was lying, I have feelings for her but I’m definitely not in love with her. By telling her how much I ‘loved her’, I seemed to cheer her up a bit. At the time she had feelings for me, but they faded away eventually which I was unaware of, so after a while it stopped making her feel happy and just made her feel uncomfortable. She would never tell me though, she always bottled everything up. She pretended she still had feelings for me and ended leading me on for about 3 months. I shared everything with her, which turned out to be a mistake, because after I shared with her that at one point I was obsessed with a girl I’d barely ever spoke to, she got the idea that I was obsessed with her. She blocked me but again, continued to lie to me, and told me it was because her friends weren’t letting her speak to me anymore. I didn’t know this so I assumed she missed me just as much as I missed her, which turned out to be completely untrue, and yesterday I went to her house to put a card through her door to say happy birthday. She’d never told me where she lived and I’d never been to her house (I knew where she lived because I used to check her location on the time on snap maps to make sure she wasn’t at another boys house), so this combined with the fact that she’s scared of me didn’t go well. I thought she’d appreciate the effort and the gesture of going through all the trouble of buying a card, getting the bus for 14 miles, then walking 2 miles to her house, which she may have if she didn’t want to block me like she’d said, but that turned out to be untrue. She got a friend of her’s to message me saying she thinks I’m stalking her and is considering getting the police involved, which is also how I found out the truth about why she blocked me. 

In hindsight I can see that it was a huge mistake to do something like this, but I didn’t know how she felt about me. I knew it was a little weird but I thought she still had some feelings for me and would think it was sweet. She lied to me about why she blocked me, she told me she still wanted to be mates but her friends wouldn’t let her. If I’d have known she was scared of me I wouldn’t go near her. Obviously I’m not going to go near her in the future but beyond that I don’t know what to do. In the past (about 3 years ago) I was obsessed with another girl and people were just starting to forget about that, if people found out about this I’ll be right back where I started. I’m only 16 so I’m still in high school, so the social consequences of something like this would be pretty bad if rumors started going round that I was stalking her. She blocked me two months ago and in all that time I never made any attempt to contact her, believe me I’m not stalking her. I’m not worried about the police because I’m pretty sure it’s not illegal to shove a card through someone’s letter box. Apart from that I just feel bad for her. I don’t think just telling her I was in love with her and telling her about a girl I was obsessed with is worth jumping to conclusions like that but she can’t help being cautious I suppose, when I was obsessed with that other girl 3 years ago it was pretty bad. I don’t want to hurt her, she was one of my best friends, but sometimes I do want to hurt her and I don’t want to think like that. She treated me quite badly for most of the time I was speaking to her and after I found out she thought I was obsessed with her I just wanted to strangle her until she stopped breathing, and if I was alone with her at the time I would have. It makes me sick to think that I felt like that but I know I’m going like that again. I just want to let her go and not be angry at her anymore. ",28Jul2018,1
28,"I have reached the point where I'm simply accepting it. Absolute fatalism. I just don't care about myself enough, nor see any point to even try to get better. I am very okay right now, actually ( Not in a crisis, not suffering, I genuinely feel good and my days are working out ) but soon school will be over, and I'll have to try my luck at becoming an adult and living that life. I think I'll just finish the stuff I want to do now ( bunch of games/stuff to read,watch/stuff to write/maybe take a drawing course I guess ), and then after I have no unfinished business left ( my interests are really the only thing that matters, even if they're all just entertainment ), I'll just try to steel myself again and try to end it. I failed multiple times BECAUSE I still wanted to do things. Hopefully I won't fail this time.

I just don't care. I hate living. I figured that it's just Fate that decides whether you're a person with a good life or a troubled one. What's even the point of trying to battle all these problems, and search for...something(?), when other people do not even care to trouble themselves like I do, and their lives just seem so simple and set. Since I'm faithless, and very pragmatic in this aspect, I just can never absorb any stuff about 'motivation', or all those pretty talks and texts people share all the time about life and dreams and whatever. I also can't believe the saying that 'everyone has some problems'. That's just not true. Some people have it way easier, and won't have any difficulty in life. And they \*want\* to do something in the first place.

I don't even want anything. I have no goal. Why go searching for one, and try to face my problems, when it's all just so agonizing? I'll just stay right where I am, try to have a good mindset and keep myself in a good mood so I can be happy ( for now ) and do the things I wanna do, and then, after I'm backed into a corner again ( this time is the last ), and pressure keeps rising up, I'll have nothing more to keep me here, so I'll just leave.

It doesn't even matter how much I post in here, no one even gets me. They just assume that I'm asking for help. I tricked myself into thinking that too. But everytime I try to 'reach out to help', I just get bitter and push everyone away. The truth is, I don't want 'help', because I don't want to put any effort in anything really, because there really is no point in doing it. I just don't care. I just wish that I could go away from everything, forget all about my troubles and reality's issues, and stay in a perfect world with everything I could ever wish for, for eternity. And if I can't do that? I guess I'll just die. Everyone just dies anyway, so whatever. I'm not trying to put other people down. It's just that others still care and want something, I just don't.

31,"I live at home with my mother and grandmother, who are both disabled and I care for.

My brother, 21 and sister, 19 also live with us.

Running a house with 5 adults is difficult to begin with, but my brother is making it impossible.

He's suffering from depression and anger issues, which he's seeing a doctor for, but he's getting worse.

He's abusive, physically and verbally, he doesn't help out in the house. If you ask him to do the smallest task he'll sit in his room all day until it's either been done by someone else or his friends come for him. He's so attached to his friends, and resents being at home.

He doesn't work, and claims benefits. I don't know what he spends his money on but he's always asking for money for petrol and cigarettes. 

He gets so angry about nothing, and had the attitude that he doesn't care whether he lives or dies, and ""fuck you, I'm 21 I'll do what I want"". His latest threat is ""I'm bigger than all of you, if I wanted to kill you right now nobody would be able to stop me"". 

Honestly I'm frightened of what he might do. There's been times in the past he's had his hands around my neck telling me he's going to kill me. My mother refuses to get police involved.

He takes us shopping in his car for food every Monday, my mother can't get the bus and I can't drive so he's our only option. He drives like a lunatic and takes risks, and if I ask him to slow down or take corners more carefully he threatens to drive off a bridge or crash us into a wall. 

I'm totally at a loss what to do about him. Nobody seems to be doing anything, and he's going to end up killing himself or us. 

I really don't know what to do. 

To top it off, I'm in a long distance relationship, and my husband is coming to live with us very soon. He has no idea my brother is this bad, he's good at hiding it when he's here, but if anything happens while my husband is here I know he wouldn't just do nothing about it. I'm so worried about it.

I can't just move out, not only do my family need me, but I can't afford it. I'm totally stuck, I can't keep living like this, it's making me ill. ",28Jul2018,1

33,"Hey guys idk if this is the right sub for this but it’s the only one I know that can probably help me.

So I have a dilema in my hands: I recently got hired for a job (let’s call it McDonalds) after looking for employment for almost a month. Before I get officially hired, a background check needs to be completed by a third party company , let’s call them Sonic, within the next 48 hours. 

So I did the whole consent forms and everything online through Sonic’s servers, but I couldn’t do the  “verify my identity” part online cause I’m too young to have any kind of specific record. So they tell me I have to go down to a post office with a form, two pieces of ID, and proof of residence. 

Here is the problem: I recently moved to a new town so the address I gave Sonic is my new address, but on my lD I still have my old address  (I know, stupid move)

Even though I have a lease form signed by my landlord with my new address on it , the lady behind the counter insists that the address I gave sonic HAS to match the one on my ID. 

I tried calling both sonic and McDonald’s but both of their HR offices close throughout the weekend, which is the 48 hour period I have to get this done. 

Here is my question: it’s obviously me, I have two pieces of ID AND proof of residence that are required only to make a background check. How do I persuade the post office lady to help me out and just verify that it’s me?

40,"I'm going to be 21 this year, and I've been working at the same job for almost a year. My boss flips from one mood to another; usually from very sweet and nurturing to bitchy and extremely cold. We used to get along great until I got promoted and then everything changed (when the fire nation attacked). She's very set in the idea that everything she says is brutally honest so people shouldn't get offended, and (she would NOT describe herself this way, but alas it is true) it is very obvious that she is someone who peaked in high school. 

I've been noticing my bipolar swings to be much more down trending lately, and saying as how I've never really contemplated suicide and now am, I know something is absolutely wrong. Every day I've gone to work in the last month, I've come home sobbing. My motivation coming home from work is insanely low, and my self esteem (which took me YEARS to build up) has been demolished. Lately, when I'm at work I get these pings where things just seem to warp and not feel genuine and it's always when she's around. It's almost like everything shifts one direction and vibrates for a few seconds. I'm fully aware that I shouldn't let her get to me, but she pokes at me with extremely personal insults about how I'm socially awkward (which, again, when I first started working there, I had just finally broken out of my mold), weird, and weak-willed. And, since we were actually amazing friends before I got promoted, I had already let her in on what my fears are, what I dislike about myself, and a lot of intimate details about who I am as a person. Being around her has just felt so sharp lately that I don't want to go and come home and suffer knowing what she's always thought of me; she, having helped me build a very good friendship when we both needed, and then crushed it when she didn't benefit from me anymore.

He would text me and spend more time with me and he would at least try to make an effort to get to know me. However, he's a total womanizer and within three months of my parents being separated (not even officially divorced) he already found a new girlfriend and he moved on. As time goes by he continually puts her before me and my sister. Just tonight he started watching one of my favorite movies with his girlfriend and he never once asked me if I would like to join them, even though I'm literally in the next room.

I tried confronting him about this and he just gets mad at me and tells me I have no reason to be mad at his girlfriend. I'm upset with both of them, my dad more though. His girlfriend knows what he's doing to me and she doesn't care. She wants him all to herself and my dad just goes with it. Every time I come over I feel like I'm just third wheeling on their date. All they do is sit together and stroke each others arms and legs and make out and I sit their awkwardly. I just want my dad to love me, but I know he doesn't. I know he never will, as I can't do anything for him. He wants to use people and I have nothing to offer, so he just pushes me aside. When I'm not at his house he never texts me or calls me and when I'm with him he doesn't truly make an effort to get to know me. I don't know why he even bothers having me over anymore.

He dumped me when I tried talking to him about this, all I said is it was stating to feel like gaslighting...I didn't even directly accuse him and I stressed I didn't think he was doing it intentionally (possibly communication issues and emotional immaturity making him very sensitive so seeing personal attacks that weren't even happening).

I started working for Panera Bread last week and one of my managers has it out for me, I swear. Other coworkers have assured me that she does in fact hate me. Coworkers have said she plays favorites and that most of the associates get treated like shit.

She makes these asinine rules for me  and refuses to listen to anything I have to say. If I confront her with an issue she yells over me until I stop talking... and then keeps yelling at me.

The worst conflict I’ve had with her was over my shoes :/ swear to god. The dress code is black non slip black shoes (doesn’t specify anything else! Black! And non slip!) and when I wore my black doc martens to work, she yelled at me. Had no intention of listening to me when I explained that they were not only non-slip, but resistant to fat, oil, and petrol. She stuck her shoe out at me and said because the treads are cross hatched, I needed to get new fucking shoes. I tried to explain to her that I’m 19, my family is poor and I moved 8 hours away from home alone. I tried explaining I recently lost 65 pounds and I haven’t had money to buy the exact pants she wants me to wear and I won’t have money until I start getting paychecks. She looked me dead in the eyes and said that if I didn’t show up with the proper shoes next shift she won’t let me work.

I don’t really know what to do. Working at Panera is pretty much scraping the bottom of the barrel for me but I NEED this job. I haven’t eaten in a few days and I’m on the verge of being homeless if I can’t work. I’m scared to confront her, I’m scared to go into work. In addition to this she hazes me every day and makes my life a living hell. She has never once smiled at me and demands I make her smoothies and such multiple times a day for her every day as “practice”, but they’re just smoothies she wants to drink. She doesn’t let me make one for myself. And she barely does her job! She pretends to work when management comes, but when they’re gone she just follows me around, directly staring at me with hate in her eyes and the worst bitch face.

It’s these small things that all adds up and really fucks with me. I googled if I could contact HR and I saw a lot of people saying that HR is a joke.

this has started to give me insecurity outbursts during the day. and i am a pretty confident person, high self esteem and no insecurity, but this is pissing me off.

I started college a couple years ago and last summer I got a full scholarship, in which I will also be employed with who my scholarship is through when I graduate in December of 2019. I still have my first job to this day and after several years of working there I have ""fallen in love"" with where I work. I like who I work with, they like me, and it has been an amazing experience. When I started, I just thought I was going to be part of the machine but as I've grown and started to more and more for my restaurant it's more like I am the machine. When I go away to school I know it adds some stress to my managers because they know how much I do and mean to them. It also adds some stress to my coworkers because I'm extremely efficient and I do a lot to help them out. The other night I was talking with one of my managers and she said, ""I wish we could make you a manager but you have to graduate first."" Then she asked me about my plans after college and I told her about my scholarship and what I would be doing. I know she wasn't necessarily mad/upset with it but I could tell that it's not exactly what she wanted to hear. I have been thinking about this a lot lately and sometimes I feel like I'm not doing the right thing. I don't like disappointing people and this is becoming a stressor for me. I don't know if I should A) drop out of school and keep working at the restaurant to become a manger or B) keep doing what I originally planned, which is the route through school with my scholarship and future employer. I truly enjoy the job I have now and it has had a huge impact on my life. On the other hand, what I would be doing after school is also something I am interested in and it feels like a calling of sorts. Sorry this post is so long but I thank anybody who read it all and appreciate any/all advice.",28Jul2018,2
67,"So I used to have this crush in middle school, as most young girls do, but I never admitted it. Now with that being said, it was well known that he liked me but couldn't date until high school. We used to constantly text but I would always friend-zone him because I was too embarrassed at the time, and eventually ghosted him (I know, pretty ridiculous but hey I was young and shy). Anyways, flash forward to now (junior in college) and I have been dating this wonderful guy for a year and half.  Today I randomly looked him and kept thinking about messaging him and stalking him and how nice it would be to meet up. Is that wrong? I know I don't have feelings for him, I think it is just leftover resentment from not having done anything and thinking about what could have been. I am not sure why, but I still feel uneasy.

70,So for the past year or so my family and I have been dealing with bed bugs. We thought we finally got rid of them but a few weeks ago we found out they were infesting my second bed. I haven't seen any since and I'm really worried because we cleaned out my room and I'm getting my new bed put in there in a few days. What should I do to make sure there aren't any more in my room?,28Jul2018,8
71,"I can’t really talk to anyone about this because it’s a tense subject that carries a lot of weight with it. My close friends might hate my mom if they knew, and I have no family members I can speak to about this. They’re all biased one way or another or they don’t know the truth. 

My parents have been divorced since I was about 11. But I never really understood why. I got fed bits and pieces and a few years ago finally learned the truth. My mom cheated on my dad for completely selfish reasons. I confronted her about it today because I finally got over my anxieties about talking to her. She said she regretted it and admitted that she cheated but didn’t seem to really understand the weight of her actions. 

Her cheating destroyed our family and now we’re all broken because of her. My sister and I have had so many mental health issues, and so much heartbreak because of her decision. She never even apologized for it to me or my dad. Speaking of pain it obviously tore my dad up even more than it did my sister and I. 

And on top of all the pain she caused, she admitted she’s still in contact with the guy she cheated on my dad with bc he’s “been a good, supportive friend.” There are no words to describe how angry I am. 

I don’t know how else to feel besides angry. I tried to be rational and tell myself she knew she made a mistake, but I can’t believe it. I wanted to but I sure as hell feel like I can’t forgive her. 

Anyone been through something similar? Or could you tell me how you’d feel or what you would do in this position? It’s really painful and I have no idea where to go from here. Right now I’m giving it space and time but I’m so incredibly angry and hurt. 

Thanks in advance for your help. ",28Jul2018,1

73,"After I was dismissed and sent home by my supervisor, I texted the office manager who called me shortly after. During the phone call, he stated that my supervisor doesn’t have the authority to fire me and he instructed me to return to work the next business day. I had a conversation with the office manager later on who explained that the supervisor has to go through proper forms and authorization by him before she can fire anyone which she neglected to do. 

Does this classify as wrongful termination? 
Are there discipline protocols for terminating employees without authorization? 

I’m going to the higher ups. I have evidence, emails, and testimony from other coworkers that I am being bullied and targeted by my supervisor. I am going to mention this to the higher ups but I’m trying to get more input about this specific event before I go to them. Any advice would be appreciated!",28Jul2018,2
74,"I don’t know what to do, I’m crying. I’m trying to calm down but I can’t stop, I hate this feeling. I’m hoping that if I tell someone then maybe you can help or tell me why this is happening to me.

When I listen to certain songs, I get the most awful panic attacks. It only happens when very specific criteria are met. It has to be sung by a boy with a feminine voice. But it’s only a little bad if I just listen to the song. It gets worse if the person singing has very specific facial features. I can tell when the person will have the face, I don’t know how to explain it.

The worst one I ever had was about a quarter of the way through ‘Just Fine’ by spookyghostboy, I saw his picture on the Spotify banner and I had the most awful panic attack I’ve ever had. I never get panic attacks in any other way, only when I listen to music with this criteria.

It just makes me feel so disgusting and gross and dirty and I can’t help but cry I just feel so awful, like someone is sitting on my chest. It’s like a sexual thing, I don’t know how to explain it.

I don’t understand. This has been happening to me since my early teen years. I don’t know why it happens but I hate it, I hate it! It feels awful! Oh god, now I’m crying again. Please will someone just tell me what’s wrong with me! I feel so disgusting!",28Jul2018,1

I just avoid them or sometimes yelling for everyone can hear me: what kind of the parents who put your kids on the street like this?""

79,"I’m going to be a sophomore in college this upcoming fall and my school requires you to live on campus in a dorm unless you are married, have children, or live with a parent within 40 miles of the school. 

This is fine for the fall semester but in December my boyfriend of almost four years and I are moving in together. Since I don’t have any children and currently don’t have a permanent address (especially not one within the mile range), it was brought up that we could get married to save the room and board costs. Otherwise the dorm would sit vacant yet still cost me over 7,000 dollars. 

It’s always been a vague belief that we would probably marry each other, but it kind of feels wrong to get married like this. I know a lot of other couples get married for tax and other benefits, but I always hoped for a spontaneous and romantic engagement. This would just feel like a business deal.

Anyways we were talking non stop for a few days and all the feelings came back and we confessed a bunch of feelings to each other. Basically saying that I would be willing to give things another shot if they were willing. They shut down any talks of saying it would never work. All of a sudden I’m ghosted.

84,"The short story: HP laptop screen went out. Sent in for repairs. Came back with busted mic, lines carved next to the power button, and a strangely washed out camera picture. They want me to send it back in. My warranty expires in 1 month.

More details: My laptop is still under warranty. Recently I began having problems with the screen flickering which progressed into the screen only working with the lid open just a few degrees. If it was opened too much it would totally go off. I contacted HP support who told me they would ship me a box to send it in for repair. I shipped it off on a Monday and got it back on the following Friday. I was impressed that the process went so quickly. I immediately noticed two deep gouges next to the power button. It looks like tallies carved with a knife. There is no way these were an accident. I was a little upset about this because my laptop is my baby. I saved up forever to get it, I use it every day, and it never moves from the spot on the desk where I keep it. I turned it on and proceeded to get on discord only to find that my microphone wasn't working. After troubleshooting and trying different fixes with nothing working I contacted HP support again. They remotely accessed my laptop and went through several different things to try to solve the problem until they came to the conclusion that it needed to be shipped in for repair. After hours of trying to fix the mic I realized that the camera looks washed out too. So my concern is I don't know if I should send it in and hope they fix the problem they caused without causing further damage. Both times they noticed my warranty was about to expire so they're trying to sell me the extended warranty. I'm starting to think maybe they're messing it up to make me  get the warranty extended. Should I send it back in and trust them to fix it or are they just going to mess it up right when my warranty expires so I have to buy the extension? Also what is up with these deep lines carved next to the power button?! Does anybody have any advice on what I should do next?",28Jul2018,1
85,"I (m) was tasked to train this new girl at work one random day about 2 months back. We hit it off right away, we had a lot of fun together. We were able to have great conversations and share our stories.  So i liked her from the start, but i knew if i got myself in a work relationship it could end terribly. So i waited a while to see what would happen. Sure enough a few weeks later her mother comes in and introduces herself and explains who her daughter is and how much she knows about me. I wasn't sure what to think of it in the moment so i let it go by without hesitation. Then about two weeks after that, i was working with her and i walked up to where se was working, because i was needed there, after i was finished i looked over to see another coworker with a smile on his face and he asked the girl if she liked me. (He did it on his own) she immediately smiled then blushed  and said no. Things were said after that but its not important to the story. After our shift i asked her out and she said yes. We went to the movies a week later. It went great. As we walked out of the theater i asked her why she came on the date with me and she gave a few bs friendzone reasons and then she saud quietly that those weren't the only reasons. So i stopped her and said i liked her too. I then said that it felt good to say that out loud and she agreed. I asked her if she wanted to go out again and she said yes. She then told me that she has 5 exs and 3 of them are girls. I had no problem with this and i said that i have an open mind. We hugged and sent our separate ways. This brings us to around now. I asked her about finding a day for date 2 and she said that she would be going out of town for the rest of the week she said she would be back saturday (it wad tuesday at the time) and that we would discuss it then. When she was gone i was talking to one of my fellow co workers and he had told me that he talked to her about me and her.  He said he knew how both of us felt about each other and he told me, without me asking him to, that she has a girlfriend right now and doesn't know how to tell me. I trust this coworker and i know he wants to protect me. Thats why he told me his info. I was hurt for a few days then i came to the conclusion that the next time we work, after the shift i will tell her what i know. So when i talked to her i told her that our coworker told me about what she and said coworker talked about. I was looking in her eyes the whole time and i could tell she was being genuine when she said that she was single and what the coworker and her talked about happened in the past and that the coworker must have been confused, and she was also dealing with the death of her best friend, that us 100% true btw,  Two days later i talked to the coworker about the talk we had and he insisted that he was sure she was talking about this girl as if she was with her at the moment. So i don't know who to trust. I feel conflicted. Do i go for love and possibly get played? Or do i abandon it and move on? I feel like i should wait for her to come to me.

88,"I’ve like this girl that went to my high school for about a year and a half now, but I started to fell stronger feelings for her in the past 6 months. We went to prom and used to talk every night. Then I think I messed up and did something g wrong, but i’m not sure what. We barley ever talk and she is going to a school a state away in less than a month. I pretty sure she rejected me, but she did it nicely. It seemed kinda open ended, but could be assumed that’s she wasn’t interested at all in pursuing a relationship. I really liked everything about her she and I can’t seem to forget her. I’m reminded of her everyday and when I am I get depressed and disappointed. Some times I get ambitious and ask if she wants to do anything in which she always replies she’s busy. Can anyone tell me what I need to do here?


Also I think my friend has an interest in her as well. He knows well that I like her, but i’m not sure if he likes her. He went to a movie (with a larger group) with her in which she invited him. He lied about going to the movie with her and her group (I knew because I asked if he wanted to go see the same movie on the sam day and he said it was his “day off” and he was going to go home a chill) so when I found out the hard way, through a investigation into how he had the wifi password if he has never been to her house, it pissed me off. At a party she and him spend the whole time talking. And recently he invited her to a game of DnD. I know I should care because she doesn’t like me and my friends has the rights to do what ever he wants but is just pisses me off. I feel like since we are friends he should tell me that he like my crush or if he is seeking a relationship with her. This whole thing has made me hate his guts though. I haven’t shown him I hate him. I just keep it hidden on the inside with a fake smile, but i’m ready to punch him in the face and strangle him. I haven’t talked to him about it, but I want to. The only problem I don’t know what to say. I don’t even know if he likes her and I don’t want him to get mad if I assume  he does. Can anyone please help me with what to do.",28Jul2018,1
89,"I'm currently a college student, so I can't work more than 20 hours per week. I have two job offers for the fall (I'm currently employed at both places this summer), and am in a real deadlock in my mind. There are pros and cons to each, and neither is really what I would call ""following my dreams"", but I'm being pulled in two directions regardless.

Place 1: I've been working here for almost two years. I planned on working here for two more years. I'm not particularly passionate about the work, but my coworkers are... dear to me. I don't think I've ever liked a set of people so much, and I'm not really ready to let go. I don't really have the option of ""hanging out"" with these people after I leave because I'm a female college student, and they are all married men. Odd. I know. But I sincerely look forward to going to work here every Saturday so that I can talk to these people. Bonus: I get my optician license if I stay here two more years (not related to my college major, but gives me options). I make decent money here.

Place 2: I'm quite skilled at what I do here. We make software, and although I'm bored out of my mind, I have a really strong understanding of quality user interface and have seriously improved the UI of the software since starting here. It feels good to be making such a big impact on the software. Even though I'm just a paid intern, they've started trusting me with customer projects and they really want to keep me. High potential for $$$. My coworkers are nice. I'm not particularly attached to them, but they're nice. This job pertains to my major. Downside: I get really bored at this job. Sometimes it's mind-numbing. I have a hard time focusing on the work, and most of what I get done is in bursts of energy. I suppose there's the possibility of me moving out of the coding process and more into the sales side, which I think would be more interesting. But I had really wanted to leave this job at the end of the summer so I could get an internship in another subarea of my career field (technically, this is a co-op, and usually if you stay for part-time work, you come back for another co-op). I'm hesitant to box myself in by staying here.

As you can see, I'm a really having a hard time deciding what I want. My reasons for staying and leaving at each company are very different, and it's hard for me to compare the two. If you can provide some advice/perspective/food for thought/anything, I'd greatly appreciate it.",28Jul2018,3

91,"TL;DR: My friend makes me fear for my life because he’s such a bad driver, and I want to tell him that he should try to start driving safer.

Here is the whole story:

Since my friend and I go to school at the same place, we trade off days for who is driving us. Plus, we live together, so we’re constantly trading off who is driving to different places. 

However, the way he drives gives me so much anxiety that I feel like I need to confront him about it.

He does things like:

1. He says “Fuck it” when he’s driving and doing something he’s not sure is safe (and he does it way too often), but he’s been doing it less and less recently.

2. He doesn’t use his brakes enough. He’s always pressing on the gas and speeding up, even if the car in front of us has their turn signal on and is about to turn. Even if the car in front of us is braking, he won’t brake until he’s a car length away from the car in front of us (which means he is constantly slamming on his brakes and I’m constantly worried he’s gonna rear end someone).

3. He doesn’t know how to handle emotions very well. When someone behind him honks, he will curse about them in the car (half jokingly, but it’s still nerve wrecking when he starts to speed up or something while calling the driver behind us a “fucking bitch”).

4. He’s nearly gotten into an accident a few times, and it honestly scares me! He unknowingly drives in people’s blind spots for long periods of time.!He used to forget to look before he turns right on a red light and wouldn’t even stop (but he’s done better, recently at least). He doesn’t stop at stop signs that “aren’t legally enforceable”. He even jokes that he only follows the laws when he forgets to bring his license with him in the car.

5. When he parks very slanted or not all the way up into the parking space, he just leaves the car and doesn’t care all that much, as long as the car ends up in park. He’s generally careless and unobservant and has poor judgement (or decision making) skills.

6. He doesn’t slow down when going in between cars parked on both sides of narrow suburban streets. Our neighborhood has tons of cars that park on the street. These cars barely leave enough room for a car to fit through, but my friend often speeds through the neighborhood faster than is safe with all the cars parked on either side. He’s nearly scratched a car or two.

Overall, I’m constantly scared of driving in his car, but I suck it up because I don’t see any other choice. We are very close friends, and I’ve hinted at how his driving makes me nervous, but I don’t know how to say: “I’m actually very nervous driving in your car! It scares me so much that I hate anytime I’m in the ca with you. All I can think about is “are we gonna get in an accident”. And I’m constantly freaking out inside.”

Maybe I’m being too harsh, but his driving makes me fear for my life sometimes. I could just be an anxious person. But he makes excuses for not braking soon enough, like: “my brakes don’t work that well”. But he just jokes around too much for it to simply be a technical problem. And I just don’t know how to get it in his head that he should try to make his passengers feel comfortable rather than afraid. He sometimes thinks it’s funny or entertaining to do stuff that’s dumb and dangerous while driving.

How do I tell my friend he needs to start working on driving safer and making his passengers feel comfortably without being an asshole about it and just calling him a terrible driver?

Thank you to anyone who gives any advice!",28Jul2018,0
92,"For a bit of back story, his sister is a twin and they were both adopted around age 8 and came from a pretty rough and abusive past. She recently has been in and out of mental health wards for about a year for self harm and while she was there recovering she met her now boyfriend. She also has been a pathological liar and likes to stir up drama. 
His family has been trying to help her for awhile with her mental health and tried everything they can but she just wasn’t responding to any of it. 
About a month ago she decided she wanted out of her family’s house to go live with her boyfriend and his mom. As sad as it is, it was a bit of relief because she constantly caused chaos. 
After a few days of her leaving she came back with the mother of her bf (who would be her new guardian) and police officers saying she wanted to get all her stuff. At this point it’s revealed she’s been lying to her bf’s family about how she was treated in her home— saying things like she was raped and beaten which are both ridiculous lies. I’ve known her and his whole family for over five years and there was never once a finger laid on her. After that, my boyfriends family cut ties with her and no longer wanted her in contact with them anymore. 
Her twin sister, who happily lives at home, has been in contact with her though and tonight found out she’s been continuing to aggressively lie about what happened to her when she lived with my boyfriend’s family. She told her current family and boyfriend that her brother (my boyfriend) raped her. Now her boyfriend (who was also in a mental institution) has threatened to beat him up.
I am very concerned about the safety of my boyfriend and his family now. She obviously knows where he lives and with a threat from someone who has been unstable enough to need medical help I don’t think it’s something that should be taken lightly. Because of her need to tell lies and start drama my boyfriend is questioning whether or not this threat actually happened and is viable but I don’t think he should even take a chance. 
What do you think should be his next step? Am I being over dramatic about this? He doesn’t want to communicate at all with her. 

tldr; my boyfriends mentally unstable sister has been lying about him raping her to her mentally unstable boyfriend who has just threatened to beat him up",28Jul2018,1

96,"So my three year contract of $85 a month for unlimited talk and text and 1GB of data is finally over! I've already gone ahead and ordered an unlocked phone from a trusted seller. The company I'm going with has a free sdcard deal this weekend for new customers so I was thinking about going to my local Walmart and buying one but I'm not sure if I need my new phone to get it, or if I can buy it then wait for my phone to come in. The one thing I'm trying to figure out is the 3G/4G LTE speed thing. Does that only apply to when you're using your data? So let's say I get a 3G plan and my Wi-Fi at home is 5G. If I'm on my phone at home do I still get the 5G speed but once I get off the Wi-Fi at my house my phone uses 3G? Once I figure this out I should have a good plan in mind.",28Jul2018,0
97,"For a bit of back story, his sister is a twin and they were both adopted around age 8 and came from a pretty rough and abusive past. She recently has been in and out of mental health wards for about a year for self harm and while she was there recovering she met her now boyfriend. She also has been a pathological liar and likes to stir up drama. 
His family has been trying to help her for awhile with her mental health and tried everything they can but she just wasn’t responding to any of it. 
About a month ago she decided she wanted out of her family’s house to go live with her boyfriend and his mom. As sad as it is, it was a bit of relief because she constantly caused chaos. 
After a few days of her leaving she came back with the mother of her bf (who would be her new guardian) and police officers saying she wanted to get all her stuff. At this point it’s revealed she’s been lying to her bf’s family about how she was treated in her home— saying things like she was raped and beaten which are both ridiculous lies. I’ve known her and his whole family for over five years and there was never once a finger laid on her. After that, my boyfriends family cut ties with her and no longer wanted her in contact with them anymore. 
Her twin sister, who happily lives at home, has been in contact with her though and tonight found out she’s been continuing to aggressively lie about what happened to her when she lived with my boyfriend’s family. She told her current family and boyfriend that her brother (my boyfriend) raped her. Now her boyfriend (who was also in a mental institution) has threatened to beat him up.
I am very concerned about the safety of my boyfriend and his family now. She obviously knows where he lives and with a threat from someone who has been unstable enough to need medical help I don’t think it’s something that should be taken lightly. Because of her need to tell lies and start drama my boyfriend is questioning whether or not this threat actually happened and is viable but I don’t think he should even take a chance. 
What do you think should be his next step? Am I being over dramatic about this? He doesn’t want to communicate at all with her. 

tldr; my boyfriends mentally unstable sister has been lying about him raping her to her mentally unstable boyfriend who has just threatened to beat him up",28Jul2018,0
98,"Ok so at the end of this past school year i (16yrs M) finally was able to ask out this girl i had been spending a lot of time with throughout the the year. She said yes and things were great for about 2 weeks. Unfortunately, then summer started. Her parents do not want her in any relationships at all, and because neither of us can drive we haven't seen each other in almost 3 months. (she lives out of town) The only way we'd be able to is if we went to ter same party/scheduled a big group meet up with a bunch of our friends. Sadly this has yet to happen and at this rate it doesnt look like it will. We used to text exery day but recently we've been falling off that schedule because of just a lack of things to talk about. We used to talk for ages about making plans and how we miss each other but recently we've been falling off just due to a lack of stuff to talk about. I really do like this girl and me not being able to see her isnt exactly making me happy. I guess i sorta took seeing her almost every day during the school year for granted because now i just cant stop missing her. I honestly dont know why I'm typing this because nothing is gonna change. Its just feels good to vent i guess. I just wish there was something i could do but i just cant. Thanks for reading anyways.",28Jul2018,1
99,"I was giving this prostitute (third time seeing her) a ride home and she starting feeling delirious and panicking and asked me to take her to the hospital. So I did and she wanted me to stay with her there. That was 4 hrs ago. I am still at the hospital. I am not sure what to do. I care for her as a human and on that level I don't want her to be alone becuase I wouldn't want to be. 

To add more background, she is a herion addict. 

Anyway, without getting into detail she is still at the hospital becuase they are running tests and there appears to be an actual medical concern (nothing life threatening). Not to mention it took them over an hour to find a good vein to draw blood. 

Notable incidents while we have been here, I called her dad to let him know and he just asked ""is it the drugs?"" And when I gave her the phone he just yelled at her. So I really feel she has no one.  She told me and the nurse how she got addicted to pain pills and moved to herion. And also general talking about how she is depressed and feels like she is scum. Also saying she wants to get off herion and but can never fight the withdrawal symptons.

So now to the advice: How much effort should I put into helping her? What can I do or say to her to help most? I can't stand seeing another human in such awful state. And I know if I don't at least try to do something, and then something later happens to her, I will blame myself.

Any advice apprieciated.

100,"26M  Quit watching porn several months ago after realizing the negative impact it's had on my life.

Up until fairly recently, the only way I've experienced my sexuality is through a computer screen. I've always felt ashamed of my porn use, and I'm getting the impression that these feelings have bled into how I feel about sex in general.

The fact that I used to get off to people having sex on a screen and was ashamed of it has conditioned me to see real life sex as contemptible as well. It's like I don't know what is acceptable and what isn't anymore.

Are my sexual kinks a result of my porn use, or are they perfectly natural? It's almost like I feel ashamed of being sexually attracted to and objectifying women, because these are things I've been shamefully doing in private for so long.

102,"I am married, unhappily so. My spouse is not always a nice person, they have told me that I am the worst thing that has ever happened to them, that I make them miserable, and that all of their problems would be solved if we weren't together - they've said this on multiple occasions. And then on the other hand they say I'm the only one they love, they love me more than anything in the world, they're so lucky etc. They believe I should do everything in the house (cook, clean, take care of the animals) and pretty much anything else they say, all while working full time on top of that, I'm exhausted. 

A few months ago I met someone on Facebook, we started messaging, which turned to talking on the phone, which changed to video chatting. My spouse is aware of this, and does not necessarily approve, and says it would never work out. I feel an extreme need for this person I met over Facebook, like love at first sight, I feel like they're my soul mate, everything seems brighter now that I know them. But they have their downfalls as well - they are extremely jealous/insecure/needy, if I need to go out to do something and take longer than they believe i should we will get in a fight. Essentially any situation that takes me away from them for a chunk of time will lead to a fight. They also hold resentment about my spouse as they had not been aware of my marriage from the start of our ""relationship"". 

they person I met over facebook lives in another country, but still very close to me and wants to come here. My spouse is gone for for about three weeks and I invited the person to come here during this time (my spouse is aware of it) - but the problem is that he is expecting me to leave my spouse to get a place with him and completely uproot my life. And at first I was so blinded by love that of course I would! But now that the time is coming closer (like two days) it seems like a terrible idea. I've been having anxiety, and I dont know what to do - I need help, please. I know I love the person from Facebook - but the closer the time comes the more I realize that I haven't put any effort into my marriage to even try to make it work. 

I had never had a second thought about this, I was always 100% sure that I wanted to be with the person from Facebook, that we're soul mates, they ignite a fire inside me that nobody else has. Once they come here there is no turning back and I have to leave to be with them. Why am I all of the sudden getting cold feet when I had not a single doubt before? I know it is a complex issue, but please help.

To top it off, neither of us have a lot of money, our own place, a vehicle, and they won't be coming here *ahem* legally, which is why there's no turning back. I just don't want to make a mistake. Please, any advice would be appreciated, up until now I've been so 100% certain that I just NEEDED to be with them, and I still feel like I love them, and am meant to be with them - but I don't know why I am feeling so doubtful suddenly.

109,"Hey guys.

Wish you all a good day and hope you all are enjoying your lives, I wish I could like you guys do but I find it a bit hard.

I'll start explaining as to why I'm asking where I should start.

Recently I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety by my doctor and psychologist, I also got a blood test as well as a testosterone test just for a general checkup. I don't exercise or work out either, I gained 25-26kgs (45lbs+) within the past two years because of depression, I started eating fast food everyday to the point where instead of eating out of emotion, it turned into a habit. Currently I jump between 85-90kgs.  


I feel like I have no motivation, no energy and no drive to do anything. I sit at home behind the computer screen and I play games. I don't work, I don't study and I'm not in training, so pretty much I'm a NEET. I eat, shit, play games and sleep. This has been my life ever since I was 18, ever since i finished high school. I did go to University/College but I dropped out half-way through the course, did other courses and dropped out again and again, I didn't feel any motivation to do it. I tried doing an apprenticeship but that failed as well because I was told that I'm not fit for ""hands-on"" type jobs which is odd because I'm naturally strong and tall, coming from employees and family members too.

Recently I had a mental breakdown where i hit such a low to the point where I legitimately felt sorry for myself and told myself that enough was enough. I understand that I have depression and anxiety, but I can't let that cripple me for the rest of my life. I've considered suicide but I never went through with it due to the fear of surviving the attempt.  


The skills that I have acquired and know that I'm good at is I.T, I'm good with building computers, fixing computers, dealing with general hardware/software and I also do a bit of coding however coding turns me off pretty badly due to the amount of strenuous thinking I have to do.  


I don't even know what careers to go for, I don't have a passion, I don't have a ""drive"" for something or to be something. I would go ahead with studying in I.T and making a career out of it but I'd need to have a job and I can't really do manual labor jobs anymore, well, at least not for a long time due to having a bad lower back from an incident that happened during my time as an apprentice..

Where the hell do i start?

Basically, he says he is a gay furry. 

I swear to god this is true. I am not homophobic, its just the furry part. I don't know how to cope with this. After I called the cops he said he realized that 'we do care' and that he was just  scared that we could make fun of him for being a furry and a homosexual. I am fine with all of that it is just that I am not sure how to cope with that. The good thing is that he is not a faggot, flaunting his sexuality and shit like the dumbfucks nowadays.

Do i just tell them because i don't feel like i am enough for them? Do i feel like i need something to prove to them? 

I am reluctant to get specific, but some examples include such variety as; lying to my sister about preheating the oven, lying to my friends about how i am feeling, lying to myself that i can do it.

121,"Right now I work second shift, 3pm to 11pm. I love the hours, I get to sleep late and have nights to myself. But lately I have been considering moving to third and I might have an opportunity to do it. I'm really sitting on the fence though and I would love outside perspectives.

There are a couple of big upsides. I'd actually get to see my husband more on third shift. He works normal hours and is getting ready for bed when I come home. I might get to talk to him for fifteen minutes before he goes to sleep, and when he gets up in the mornings I'm several hours from waking up. If I worked nights I'd wake up when he comes home and actually get to spend time with him. 

The other plus is our third shift manager. He is amazing and I love him. My supervisor on second shift is shitty and I'm getting sick of dealing with his crap. I'd much rather work for Jimmy at night. 

The downsides: I have actually worked overnights in this place before, when we were short staffed in the winter a couple years ago and a few of us did 7pm to 7am days for a couple months. I know from experience that it can fuck up your weekends. Like, waking up at 4pm on a Saturday kinda sucks, half the day is gone. Also hard to wake up for 1pm football games on Sunday. Plus in the winter, waking up to the sun already being almost gone is a downer. 

There's also a dude on third shift that I really don't like. He's in his 50s and must have some kind of condition because he has major social problems and is incredibly creepy. He was actually the subject of a huge HR sexual harassment investigation last year. Nothing came of it, which is a rant for another day, and somehow he still has a job. Now I've stayed late occasionally and he seems to be somewhat better behaved lately, but I don't know how much I trust that it's going to stay that way. 

I don't have a problem sleeping during the day, so that's not a concern. Doesn't affect my pay, I get the same shift differential either way. I'd love to hear from others who have worked these hours, if there are any other unexpected pros or cons I'm not thinking of.",28Jul2018,1

I work at a local grocery store where everyone knows everyone, in fact I’m friends with a lot of people there. Not long after I got the job did I met one guy in particular who would become a good friend of mine. He, who we’ll call S, eventually starts telling me about this girl, who we can call N. Essentially she’s cheating on her own boyfriend to be with him. The first guy (C) she dated (who I also know from school) doesn’t know this at all. Keep in mind they are all 15 maybe 16 year olds. So, fast forward a week or two to today. My brother tells me he’s now dating another younger girl, my age, yet again. He’s about to turn 18. And who would have thought? It’s N. I even told him the story, and he doesn’t care at all, he just sounds like having a girlfriend at all is a huge accomplishment, no matter how awful she is to other people. This is the second time he’s dating someone with a lower class background, who (I feel) only dates him to have a senior boyfriend (she’s a sophomore, same as me). And on my side, he’ll push me to the backseat and focus all his attention on his egotistical gf who makes me miserable. I don’t want to go through this again.

Sorry for the rant. 

I need advice on if I should tell one of her boyfriends the deal. Not C or S really deserves to be cheated on, and honestly I don’t like the position I’m in at all. 

On one side, if I tell one or both of the boyfriends then who could tell what would happen? I feel like I’d lose some good friends, or they’d turn on each other. On the other hand, if I don’t tell anyone at all, and both S and C find out I knew all along about this girl they’d definitely be pissed at me, and never speak to me again. This is the first job I’ve ever had and the situation is turning it into a stressful one when I’m around any of them, and I honestly don’t have anyone else to turn to for advice.

Thanks so much for any advice you guys can give.

Tl;dr

Two good friends of mine are dating the same girl, the second guy think she’s only cheating on the first guy, while actually she’s cheating on both of them with my brother. He think’s its an accomplishment and a big ego boost to have a trashy sophomore girlfriend as a senior in HS and she thinks she’s the above everyone else because of it. My brother knows all of this.

127,"Hey there,

I have no idea what to do with my life. I've recently dropped out of my college engineering degree due to lack of interest to pursue something completely different: A career in the trades/manual labour. I've spent the most of this year getting my trade education and certificates and just recently landed my first job. Guess what, I'm not that happy with it. While I seem to enjoy this trade as a hobby, I dislike it as a job. The hours are terrible. I'm working nightshifts. The pay isn't all that great. I can barely relate to my colleagues (mostly bad mannered uneducated immigrants who barely speak the local language). The list goes on.

My family disregards my lack of interest in my college degree and doesn't support me getting into this ""dangerous"" manual labour job, which also doesn't help on a motivational level.

Right now I have two options:

* Disregard all my friend's and family's advice (and my own feelings, kinda) and continue pursuing this manual labour career in hopes that in the near future I would get a better paying, better quality job;
* Go back to university and finish my (mostly) worthless degree for another year or so.

If I finish my degree... Sure I'll have a degree and everyone will be happy but what will I do with it? The degree is in a very competitive niche field of engineering and everyone I know who has finished it is either: Working below minimum wage in a dead-end trainee-type program (internship) or got inserted in a decent company due to family connections or whatever.

td;dr. I have no idea what to do with myself.

I was a bit taken aback, I wasn’t sure if I was mishearing or if she was just jabbering nonsense, I looked to the people behind her in line and they looked just as confused as I was. This awkward transaction consisted of me trying my best to be understanding while desperately repeating “I’m sorry I can’t understand you.” All while this lady was repeating “Ashuba” as if I should be able to understand herI finally got through all of her items and got her to swipe her credit card. All that was needed then was her signature, and I turned the screen and pointed to where she needed to and made a “signing” motion with my hand. At this point she shook her head and grabbed my arm and pleaded “ashuba.” I was pretty spooked by now. Anyways I called my manager and we got her to sign and she walked out. Does anyone know what this could have been? She wasn’t foreign or anything, which would explain the strange word. Was it medical? Like a stroke or something? I need to know what was happening with her, it shook me up a whole lot. Thanks!",28Jul2018,1

131,"My fiance (20) and I (19) have been indecisive on where to move, but have recently come to a solid decision. My dad flew us out to visit him in a state I used to live in. It was a paradise compared to where we live now, and he offered to help us out a lot of we were to move up there. Not only is it a logical next step in our lives, but we also greatly want to be there specifically. Great employment, environment, and people.

When we came back, we were both instantly a bit depressed (as is expected when coming back from vacation). It's just so much shittier here. But at least we have moving to look forward to! We decided to move in late December, so that we could finish one more semester of school before we leave. It also matches with our September wedding date (people are traveling for it). I can use the money I make in school (especially if I have a work study position) to get just a little bit more money saved up before we leave.

Then, some issues came up...

I've been noticing some things about the place where I live that seem...odd; tiny details, maybe, but impactful, nonetheless. Stuff like having the ant infestation spread to not only our room, but our bed and dresser; ridiculous road construction events; very strange weather (for the state I live in, at least); not getting financial aid for work study, and less than I usually get for my classes; etc. Call it superstition, but I feel like life is trying to push me into moving right now. As much as I want to leave this instant, I want to stay for our wedding, because it'd be a dick move to just abandon our wedding location after all this planning from us and others. However, the only other thing keeping me here is being able to use the school's welding shop. Besides, they have a great welding program up there, and if I have to work for a year to get in-state tuition, so be it. It'll help me save up anyway!

Is it worth it to wait? Every day is harder and harder for me to wait. I feel taunted. I feel this strong urge to move now, and I fully well can. My fiance agrees with me that she hates it here even more now, but I don't know if she's fully on board for leaving right after the wedding. What should I do? How should I assess what I need to do?",28Jul2018,1
132,"This is a throwaway account because I'd rather not have anyone know my identity. There's something I need advice on, but this post will be half asking for advice and half confession.

I've been dating my significant other for just over three years. Things are great with us, and I really have nothing to complain about. We go to graduate school and take classes together. 

However, at the start of my grad program in 2017, I met a classmate (let's call them R) that I developed feelings for. I have been very confused about these feelings: exactly how deep they are, what they mean, if they're real or not... Long story short, I've had periods of my life where I can't tell if what I'm feeling is real or not. According to my therapist, I'm not mentally ill; rather, I'm quite sane. However, I know I tend to block out my feelings without realizing it, so I think that I blocked out these feelings for R despite knowing deep down that they're real.

My significant other knows about these feelings I have for R, but I didn't come clean about them until recently; I figured, ""why talk about them if they're (probably) not real? I'm not sure why I'm feeling this or thinking about R anyway."" What my S/O doesn't know is that I had a slip last semester when I stopped taking my medication cold turkey (Wellbutrin XL) where I told R that I was ""very attracted to them"" through e-mail. R and I take classes together as part of my program, and they know I'm dating my significant other, so this made things extremely awkward. R confronted me about my e-mail after class shortly after I sent it, telling me they were bi-sexual, that they were seeing someone, and then stated, ""I thought you were with (my significant other's name here)?"" I replied telling R that I do love my S.O, but I trailed off after that, as if I had more to say, though I didn't know what to say at the time.

I had also gone through a traumatic experience just before I stopped taking my medication; R would only know vague details about this due to some class activities where I've briefly mentioned this issue, but they wouldn't know exactly how much it affected me. I have depression and anxiety, and depression is what I was taking the medication for, but this traumatic, family-related incident is what really sent me spiraling down a path where I couldn't tell what was real or not---in short, I found out that my father isn't my real dad, that my family had been keeping this fact from me my whole life, and one family member (the person who raised me, not my ""supposed"" dad) rubbed this in my face suddenly to hurt me when I confronted them for the first time about the horrible mental and emotional ways they treat my siblings and I. At the time, I wasn't sure how to handle this news, so I shut down pretty hard, and I'm sure that, along with my sudden cold turkey quitting of hard meds, that this is the reason why I messaged R.

I've been in constant debate with myself over whether my feelings for R are real, and if so, just how deep they go. I don't think it makes any sense that I have these feelings about them because we haven't talked much or spent any time together outside of class. Things to get fairly personal in our tight-knit program because of class activities at times, but I only know R from that distance. And I do love my significant other, but it makes it even more confusing that I think and have dreams about R: innocent dreams, where I go visit R in various places, but at times we've held hands and walked together in them, or R would be sitting on a couch watching TV, and I would go sit by them in a mutual, comfortably relaxing way. Lately, I've had on and off dreams about R, but I'm not sure at all what to gather from them.

I did message R one more time after that first message, a week later, asking if they wanted to text me to talk (there were things I wanted to say but couldn't muster up the nerve to in person). They replied saying they would be uncomfortable doing that, but that I could talk to them after class if I wanted. I never did try to talk to them again---I felt so awkward about the situation, still do feel awkward, and don't know what to do about it. We've had summer break between us, which has been nice for me, but I still find myself longing to see R, even if we don't speak. The program R and I are in (not the same exact one as my S.O, but closely related) requires that we take a couple of the same classes together, so we will be seeing each other a lot over the next school year.

What I want to ask is: What should I do? I don't think I can properly assess my feelings, and I don't know who to talk to or what to do about it. I don't see a therapist anymore or take any medication for insurance reasons. My S.O seems okay with these feelings because they know I want to stick to our relationship and that I have been loyal and faithful. When I messaged R, I'm not sure what I was doing, but I didn't want to cheat or hurt my S.O (I have never cheated, nor would I ever cheat), but I still wanted my feelings to be known. Talking to R, even if R may not feel the same way, makes me feel like I'm not being loyal to my relationship because of these deep feelings. How should I handle this situation?

I should add that the first week of the first semester of grad school, there was a sort of orientation that people from my program had the option to attend, and it felt like R and I strongly connected there. I felt sure that they were attracted to me then, though I don't know if they were in a relationship at that time---and I could be entirely wrong about this, but I've never asked R or brought it up, so I have no idea how they feel. When we spoke, R only mentioned they were dating someone, not that they weren't attracted to me. This is all so messed up and confused in my head, and I've literally had no one to talk to in deep detail about it. In fact, I feel ashamed of all of it. Does Reddit have any advice?",28Jul2018,2
133,"As long as I’ve known about it, I’ve been highly averse to anything sexual. I only had sex ed in 4th grade when I couldn’t get out of it and did know to and hated it. For all of middle and high school, I opted out. My aversion was made worse in 9th grade when I had a sexually abusive boyfriend. 

In middle school, I learned about asexuality and realized what it was. As my peers grew increasingly interested in sex and sexual pleasure, I had no desire for any of it. Despite my 6-9th grade “friends” explaining stuff I didn’t want to know to me, I kept away from it as much as I could. I’m still a romantic person but I was never found anyone physically attractive unless I was dating them. And I never had any desire to be sexual with them. I hated all of this. I was made fun of for and desperately wanted to be normal sexually. 

The no sexual desire changed with my now fiancé. For the first time, I was interested in sex and wanted to try it with him. However, it took months, an amazing relationship, complete trust, and deep mutual love to get there. Finally, we became active. That had its own problems as it was painful for me. We continued and it’s mostly better but my sexual desire, or lack thereof, isn’t. I want to meet his sexual needs. And I want to want to have sex with him on my own. Sometimes he can get me to want it with not much, other times I consent to him trying to get me to. But I only ever want it on my own once a month, if that. This really bothers me. Since I don’t really need anything sexually, it’s easy for me to say no or not get turned on. 

I know I’m no longer completely asexual since I want it at times on my own and consent to it (I’ve consented every time we have) but I still feel I largely am and I hate it. I want to be normal sexually. But I don’t know how. Everything that’s been suggested to me (porn and masturbation) gross me out and I refuse to do it. I want my fiancé to be my only sexual aspect. But as I am now, I’m not enough to be what I want to for him. 

What do I do? How do I fix this?

P.S. he didn’t pressure me. He accepts how I am, even if the increasingly infrequent sex gets frustrating. ",28Jul2018,2

135,"I got fired

Sorry, this is extremely long. Not like anyone will read it anyway.

So, I'm having a hard time writing this as I'm upset and angry. I got fired Friday afternoon. I'm not fully sure why. I was told it was due to ""a lack of communication and initiative."" When I had my 6-month review, my supervisor mentioned she felt I was too introverted. If you ask anyone I know, I'm pretty sure they will tell you I'm not introverted; just shy and slightly awkward due to anxiety, but I've always put on a good front and seem talkative (in my opinion) with new people.

My supervisor also cited she felt I was introverted because my predecessor was a huge social butterfly who would go to every person's office and have long talks, and often eat breakfast with them. My view on that is there is a fine line between being friendly and neglecting your duties to gossip. I have no problems with being friendly in the workplace, some of my current closest friends are people I've worked with previously, but I come to work to do my duties and earn my paycheck as first priority. 

As far as lack of communication goes, my supervisor didn't like me forwarding emails or documents without a long paragraph in the body explaining. I'd always been taught to be concise and keep it simple, so I would normally forward something with the subject in the email and something like ""see attached"" in the body. After that review, I changed my communication style and went into extreme detail with my emails and sent my supervisor updates on everything I was working on once/twice a week. 

I have a feeling the true reason for my dismissal is due to an incident that happened recently that I was worried I would be blamed for even though it wasn't my fault, but because I'm the lowest on the totem pole. We had an issue with equipment in the building that I was not aware of, as I don't handle issues with the building. Another employee forwarded me a voicemail she got from a company stating they had come in and looked over the unit, determined what was wrong, and had gotten the replacement parts. This, to me, signified the worker had been given permission to come in and look around by another employee (there is only badge access to the building unless buzzed in). This was presented to me in the late afternoon and I didn't manage to get in touch with the worker before I left for the day. I knew there was a possibility the repair was on a pre-paid contract, so I was planning to try to track it down as I didn't have the contract in my files.

When I got in the next morning, workers were in there tinkering around on the unit. I didn't give them permission to come in, so I assumed another employee had found that we didn't have the contract and let them in. I talked about it with another employee and we both figured a third employee who wasn't aware of the situation let them in and authorized the repair. The bill came in last week, and it was quite high in the thousands and out of our budget. Turns out we also had a contract I didn't have access to that would have made the repair free. I'm pretty sure I got thrown under the bus for this. It seems like it came down to me, a 9 month employee, versus the employee who authorized it, who had been there for close to 20 years. I was sacrificed. Office politics suck.

This couldn't have happened at a worse time. I've always been miserable and had severe depression, but I had been feeling slightly more positive lately. I was finally at a job I liked, making okay money. I had exhausted all my savings to mostly pay off my debt. I was in the middle of buying my first house that would cost me significantly less that my current rent each month. I was mostly debt-free. Now, I'm jobless and just spent $1300 on dental work (my insurance wouldn't cover it) and don't have enough savings to last more than a month, and finding a job is a lengthy process. 

I've dealt with depression before in the past, and even self-harm, and have tried to kill my self before when I was younger. I'm at the point where I'm thinking about killing my self.  It would be easier for everyone involved. I don't want to be a burden on my family. I have no job or future.",28Jul2018,2

My mother is afraid to not have me at home, to let me go, even if I'll be 19 when I'll *probably, hopefully* move.
Yes, she's overprotective, wayyyy too much, she won't let me stay home alone at this age and never stops to call me when I'm out.

My father said that it's better to wait before telling her that I plan to go there by myself, because she needs to understand first that this is the path I want to take and something that could be better for me, since here I could never find a workplace for what I do. Yeah in the US there will be LOTS of competition but I'm good with it.

I would like to tell her today, even because waiting is wasting precious time. I know that it's in 2 years, but isn't it better to make plans and to make her understand that it's my life and I decide what I'm going to do with it?

If she doesn't support me, I really don't know what to do. She's the only person in my family who always was by my side.

147,"Hi Advice.

First post here but this is the first time i have felt I needed it.

A little backstory first. My dad and mum split before marriage when I was 2 they have always had a good relationship since but 99% of the time i was with mum. If it helps the reason they split is mum didnt want me growing up around his anger and abuse towards her as well as the ever present drug use.

Fast forward 25 years and im an adult or atleast have learnt to pretend to be. So recently he was let out of his fourth prison stay on parole dependent on him completing an 11 month stay at a rehab. He completed the rehab was let out and needed a place to stay until he could get government housing in 4 to 6 weeks.

I dont really feel that familial connection with him and so was a little uncomfortable with the idea. My mum believes he deserves another chance and that it is the right thing to do. I speak to my so and she tells me she doesnt really want him to stay but in the interest of my relationship with him will support whatever decision i make.

I decided to let him stay with us for the 4 or so weeks. Once he gets there we find out he is in a rough patch with a woman he has been seeing (first red flag as women are a big trigger for him). He starts with his usual emotional manipulation i just want to die blah blah blah it hurts more than anything blah blah I have nothing blah. Whatever, he goes to bed and sleeps. The next day (now three days out of rehab) I get a call from him and hes been caught shoplifting a pair of jeans and has been given a date to appear in court.

At this point in my life I expect this dissapointment and am somewhat his emotional hostage because deep down i still think he might start caring about me if i treat him well and ""do the right thing"". I know he wont because he is very self centered and he has never shown affection past his obligation as a father.

Two weeks in now and after my 46 hour work week its starting to be too much to go home and deal with whatever his emotional state is. Things with my so are tense because we live together and she is finding it hard to not explode on him as she is lucky enough to objectively witness the pain he puts me through and it hurts her to see it but she also doesnt feel its her place to say something.

I don't want him here but i have never had to parent something and im finding it really hard to have the conversation. I dont  even really know what I need advice on. How do i get him out of my life without hurting him or risking him going back to drugs?

1. im worried not everyone will go, 5 of us said 100% they are going but i dont know if all of them are serious and 1 of them i feel is taking it as a joke the other 3 and me are taking this very serious though and all of us have the same reason for doing this, because if we dont we all know we wont be anything in life, i dont have many friends to begin with so this is really my only chance to be with people
2. im extremely shy and i cant talk to people that well in person but i can talk to people over the phone and text messages but i have trouble talking in person and i have trouble looking at people talking to me so i usually look at the ground or to the side
3. scared my mom wont really want me leaving, i personally think she will be fine with it as long as im visiting ever so often so this is the least of my worries
4. worried about being on an airplane by myself, this will also be the first time on an airplane (not the only one in the group with this issue)

155,"after years of shitty therapists I've finally found one that's great. he's extremely smart, extremely chill and we have a very nice relationship going on. I feel completely comfortable with him and so far we've been making good progress. thing is, I think I'm kinda starting to develop a crush on the guy. he's way older than i am (he's 40, I'm in my early 20s), but is basically just the kind of guy I've always fallen for in my life so far. I'm not thinking at all about actually pursuing anything, it's just a thing that's there. I do just fine, it's mild and doesn't interfere with anything said or done while I'm at his office, if anything I think it makes me feel more capable to talk to him about stuff. 

guess my question is, has anyone ever gone trough something similar before and is it really reason enough for me to drop him? I've told a friend and she insists I should find another one, but that's not really an option for me as my city has a very limited amount of psychologists, let alone ones that are good, and this guy is by far the best one I've had, ever, he's really helping me.

159,"Someone mentioned to me that I should post this in in an advice sub, so here I am.  

I fell asleep like normal tonight. Went out last night and grabbed a beer with my brother and a few other friends, made my way home to my dogs and passed out in bed.  Just now, about thirty minutes ago, I woke up having a full on panic attack.  Even my two dogs were in bed fully awake watching me, so even they knew something was up.  

Now I’ve had nightmares about ghosts, creepy two headed dogs in the woods, etc (you know, more normal “scary” 😝), but this was different.  It felt so real.  I dated this guy a few years ago for about a year.  This guy was a real piece of work and I stayed with him far longer than I should have. When it ended, it did NOT end well.  I ended up having to get police involved when he showed up at my home and strangled me on my front porch.  But he also began threatening my life and my family members’ lives and harassed me daily for months.  He was coming around my home and even sending me emails throughout the days saying things like, “I’m outside next to your car” and “I see you at the gas station”. I’d usually end up running from wherever I was when I got something like that. I even heard from him as recently as four months ago, using a fake FB account.  (I’d blocked him in every aspect of life, but it didn’t matter because he would always find a way of contacting me.). I’d filed reports on everything and was eventually I was able to gain a no contact order.  Regardless, this guy really did a number on me (I promise this is going somewhere).   

The anxiety that I’ve felt since my time with him is crazy and I thought I’d made good progress on overcoming it, but I’ve been having a lot of nightmares about him lately involving him trying to contact me, but he murdered me (clarification: had me murdered) in my dream tonight.  

In my dream, I was out with friends and happened to see him.  I don’t know what transpired between the moment I saw him notice me and later in the dream, but apparently something set him off.  I knew that myself and my family were all in danger, so I began calling them, but they already knew because he was harassing them as well. We planned to all meet at this hotel in Atlanta and stay there/meet there with police to file reports.  I remember being overly concerned about my dogs and knowing that I should NOT go home alone to get them, but I did anyways.  (He threatened my animals on several occasions as well.) I grabbed my dogs and left there fine, but then drove over to my parents house to follow them to the hotel.  When I got there I spoke with them for a few moments when my dad said he thought he’d just seen someone in the front yard, so he and I went outside gun in hand  while my mom called 911.  But when the person he saw reappeared, it wasn’t my ex, someone else.  I said, “oh nothing to worry about that’s not him”, but my dad was still uneasy.  Just after I said that, the man pulled out a gun, pointed it at me, and just before he pulled the trigger he said, “this is a rouse” (????).  

He shot at me and it’s like I could see the bullet coming at my head in slow motion. It hit me and I knew it had blown off the left side of my face. It was insane how REAL it felt.  It’s like I lost hearing and feeling on that side of my head., even in real life while I was sleeping.  Right after he’d pulled the trigger, but before I was hit, both my dad and I shot him and he died instantly (it was never said out loud, but I “knew” in my dream that this man was hired to come kill me by my ex).  I started stumbling forward and I knew I was dying.  It was so real that I feel like I got a small glimpse at what death looks like.  That sounds strange, but it’s the best way I can describe it.  I lay there on the ground, looking up at my parents’ crying faces and just kept saying “I love you”.   Then I woke up crying, sweating through my clothes and panting (while my two dogs are licking my face trying to wake me up 🤣🐶).  

Is this some kind of PTSD or anxiety disorder? Should I see a therapist? The dreams of him are happening more and more, but NEVER has it felt his real or terrifying.   Needless to say, I’m up now.  I’ll just lay here and sip coffee until the sun comes up.  

It’s been almost two years since I’ve even seen him, so I’m just wondering if anyone else has ever been through something like this and what you did to help?  ",28Jul2018,1

163,"So I’m a guy and I’ve known this girl for bout 4 years because we went to the same acting class, however we never really got close and started talking much until about 3 months ago. 

Now we play fortnite together 2 or 3 times a week and have lots of fun and we talk regularly and spend most of our time at acting class together

However our acting class finished for the summer and we both expressed interest in meeting up over the summer to do something, possibly with other friends

So. About 3 weeks ago I asked her if she wanted to go to a comic con like event near where we live and she said it sounded good but she would have to check the date first

3 weeks later and I still haven’t heard back from her. I’ve mentioned it a couple of times over fortnite and she just says ‘oh shit sorry I forgot to check’ every time

So 6 days ago I messaged her about it and she read and ignored my message. I messaged her the next morning again because I know she is quite busy and may have just forgot to respond. No response. I then waited until later and sent her another messaging saying ‘I’m assuming you are busy. Just message me when you get a chance’. Read but no reply

I then waited 4 days because I didn’t want to constantly bombard her with texts but yesterday I sent her a message asking if she was okay. I also messaged her on snapchat to ask if Facebook was working properly in case that was the issue. Both read but no reply. I haven’t been able to play fortnite all week because I’ve been away 

What’s the next step? We don’t see each other in real life anymore so our only way of interaction is over text. We don’t have any mutual friends because she goes to a school quite far away so I can’t message them to ask if she is okay

The thing that really annoys me is that she is on Facebook pretty much every hour and can be on for 15-20 minutes at a time

We have never had any sort of argument or disagreement with eachother so I don’t know why she would suddenly be ignoring me. She is a really nice person and in the 4 years I’ve known her I’ve never got the impression she would act like this

Just to confirm I’m case anyone misjudges the situation. There are no romantic feelings between the two of us, at least that I know of.

So about 4 month's ago I lost my job then my gf broke up with me. We were leasing a place together but she managed to get off of the lease by getting a restraining order on my over completety false allegations but, you don't need any evidence for a restraining order apparently. 

So while being out of work, I've been paying all the rent and all the bill's, plus she abandoned her dog with me so I now have two dog's.

Basically I'm about $20,000 in debt.

Do you guy's think it would be worth moving back into my parent's to get out of debt? My main reason for not wanting to go back apart from obvious reasons are, I'd have to rehome both of my dog's, which will break my heart but I might just have to do it I guess.

I wasn't around for the beginning of it, so I don't know how it started, but after hearing a lot of yelling I ran over to where everyone was and saw my brother basically screaming at everyone. I ran up to him to try to calm him down. I'm his only sister and I know him better than anyone, and I knew I was going to be the only one he would talk to. After a whole lot of convincing, everyone in the family left him alone so I could talk to him. I even had to scream at a lot of my family members to get the fuck away from him and let me talk to him. They all seem to think I'm still a child and can't handle myself or my only sibling. We talked for hours and I held him in my arms and we both cried about how shitty life is, and he was so belligerent he didn't really understand that he was talking to me. He kept talking about me like I wasn't there, saying stuff like ""I just want [insert my name] to be happy,"" and ""I don't care about anything but [insert my name]"".

I was also deemed unable to have a child this year in feb; a hard pill to swallow but I never thought of myself as a maternal being.

For the past months during summer, I've felt myself slipping into a very bad sleeping schedule that's been interfering with my work and studies. I'm a high school student about to go into twelfth grade--homeschooled as well. I've gotten into the habit over that summer of staying up insanely late(past 5am)and waking up in the afternoon(2-3pm).

176,"My family has always been very close. My mom came from a very broken home, and my dad was excommunicated from the church he grew up in because he disagreed with their teachings. In 1995, they both got married and decided then that their kids wouldn't live the same lives. 

It wasnt perfect, no parents are. They decided early on to homeschool us three kids, me the oldest, my sister in the middle, and my baby brother. I was the rebel, my sister the obedient and my brother the ""meh, whatever"". I made it difficult on them teaching us, but even through it we all loved each other. Family vacations, field trips, meeting friends from church, etc. We shared it all together. Almost my entire life my family has been my own group of best friends. 

My parents were strict when I was younger, but they softened up over time. I think the church told them to ban certain things from us that they honestly hardly cared about, so when the church was out of the picture, they were a lot more lax. I certainly had some fights with them, with dad about school, and mom because we are essentially the same person. But it was never destructive, it was never spite or hate. I have to say, I had it really good as a kid and I am infinitely grateful for my upbringing. 

The issue started the last week of last year when I announced I was moving out, packed my stuff and moved. I was only a couple miles away, but it was a big deal because I was the first out, and was understandably more distant from the rest of the family. I would meet up with everyone once a week for food and chat, and it went well like that for a good three months or so, but I began to notice changes in my sister. She was becoming so much more distant, wouldn't talk about life anymore, with me or my parents. She began ignoring us whenever possible, and purposefully keeping us out of the loop. It was such a 180° from where she was before, in a short amount of time. It wasn't long after that she told us she was making plans to move out. We all kinda saw it coming. 

The date for her moving kept changing due to the circumstances, so she stayed with my parents for months past the announcement, only becoming more distant. My brother as well has been becoming more distant. Not nearly as much, but he only asks us if he needs something and doesnt inform my parents of where he is going until the last minute (hes still 17). He was especially vague about any goings on withmy sister that he has remained close with because they go to the same church (me and my parents no longer attend any church and I am now agnostic). 

I moved back in a couple weeks ago following a breakup, and needed somewhere to stay while I recoup, and I came back to a completely different landscape. We used to have friends over every Friday, now they avoid my parents house. My sister almost sprints through the house just so she doesnt have to talk to anyone. I've been getting sorta close with my brother again, but he also feels different. My parents are closer then ever, being married for 23 years, but you can tell that they are saddened. 

This morning my mom woke up early with me. And was talking to me as I was getting ready for work. After a few minutes she broke down crying and asked, ""Why is this part so hard?"" Apparently my dad broke down last night, and my dad has cried maybe twice in my lifetime. It was so hard hearing that they are struggling so much with my family that is becoming distant. 

I am going to move out by spring, I'm staying home to save money for a down payment on a house and go on some vacations, sk soon the house will be empty (my brother plans on being out about that time too) and I dont know how to help them.

First of all, it's scorpions I'm terrified of. I can be in the same room with a spider and be totally fine. Anytime I see a scorpion however, I get very anxious, worried, jumpy, panicky, etc. I have trouble getting close enough to one to try to kill it. I'll inch forward then scream and jump back if it even flinches. Even when I get close enough, I hesitate before I strike because I've had a few bounce off what I hit them with and land on my clothes still alive (resulting in stings). I've been stung in my sleep. I've had them fall off the ceiling onto my head and face (resulting in stings). I've had ones brazen enough to crawl onto my bare foot and sting me. I've had ones sting me, I throw them off, then they run back and sting me again. My  house is plagued with the evil little creatures. Seriously. Sometimes I'll see 2-3 (or more) in one night.

He also got kind of happy and turned on by the thought of her actually looking for him in church because he texted her And said “So you were looking for me” he also had asked her what she was doing and she told him that she was going to breakfast with a friend and he joked and told her to bring him some food back and she played along and told him to send her his address and he just said ok but slickly added in that he was gonna eat her vagina as well when she dropped the food off. 

From the messages she laughed it off and told him he can do that with a bunch of girls bc no girl is gonna turn down oral sex and he said “hell no lol. I just want to do that with you.” I remember the messages so well because I’m hurt and I really believed he cared for me more But we’re all the way in Missouri she’s in Chicago maybe I can talk to him about all this and how it’s making me feel.

188,"I have a very unusual scenario and I really need unbiased advice from strangers to help me figure it out. For the past 5 years (now 20) I have been seriously contemplating changing my gender. I feel as though I was meant to be a women. I have basically had gender dysphoria all my life and don’t feel comfortable on my own skin... I feel as though to be myself and to continue my life in society I need to transition and become a women. 

However, recently I have become very interested in Buddhism and have started to feel a calling towards monastic life. I have researched heavily and feel that this conflicts with a gender transition. I feel that becoming a monk will help me to realise that there is more to life than my self and my gender identity and that I won’t feel these same pressures once I isolate myself from society. 

I can’t really do both as to feel confident as a women I will need to go through many surgeries to fit into society and get myself into more debt, meanwhile, if I become a monk I can be debt free... which is a requirement for most of not all monasteries. 
I also can’t just try out becoming a monk for a while and see what I feel as that would require you to shave your head in ordination... and I have been growing out my hair for 2 years... so if I make the decision to be ordained i will have to be certain. 

I know this is quite a strange predicament but would love any advice. Thanks in advance to anyone who replies. ",28Jul2018,1
189,"I'm 19F for reference. This family problem is with my uncle Paul (26M) and cousin Sean (12M). If you can't tell from just the age gap, Sean is not actually Paul's son. He was adopted by Paul after his mom died. And this is important because I think they have a gross and abnormal relationship for who are supposed to be father and son. They act like a clique or frat bros together, and they often even pretend to be gay lovers as a prank only little kids find funny.

The two of them talk about sex a lot referring to other family members, and I think it's sexual harassment at this point with how much it happens. My two brothers get the brunt of it. One is 16, and he's very shy and awkward. Paul and Sean talk about how he's overweight and has a micropenis the size of a toothpick that got sucked up by his fat, and they make fun of him for being afraid of tame stuff four years ago when we were on vacation. He hits them and tells them to stfu and they just laugh and start saying it later.

They like to embarrass my baby brother (13) too by talking about sex and jerking off. He's very tiny and might not even be developed enough to learn about that the natural way, but they're starting early in bullying him. Sean was talking to him about male ejaculation and pushed enough buttons that my brother yelled a lot louder than he should have in public, ""white stuff only comes out if you have a disease, moron!!"" He was SOBBING when he realized he was wrong and is still so embarrassed a month after it happened. Guess who won't stop bringing that up?! He starts crying when he gets set off over this incident and others that have happened. 

The excuse Paul gives is that we shouldn't let our baby brother be too ignorant to live. Our brother is a little dumb, but that doesn't excuse bullying him. He doesn't use computers for anything but Fortnite material and doesn't Google his personal questions like everyone else. Instead, he asks me questions about his scrotum and when I tell him I don't have one, he talks to Sean about it. He trusts a 12 year old bully and liar to give him medical advice.

Everyone else in our family including our parents are quick to say that they are only teasing etc. My dad used to play the same kinds of pranks on Paul as a kid so of course he thinks it's all fine. Our mom just says ""don't fight with them"" and then doesn't want to get involved at all.

It's getting old and I'm wondering if this is sexual harassment",28Jul2018,2
190,"Tl;dr at the bottom

I work at a local grocery store where everyone knows everyone, in fact I’m friends with a lot of people there. Not long after I got the job did I met one guy in particular who would become a good friend of mine. He, who we’ll call S, eventually starts telling me about this girl, who we can call N. Essentially she’s cheating on her own boyfriend to be with him. The first guy (C) she dated (who I also know from school) doesn’t know this at all. Keep in mind they are all 15 maybe 16 year olds. So, fast forward a week or two to today. My brother tells me he’s now dating another younger girl, my age, yet again. He’s about to turn 18. And who would have thought? It’s N. I even told him the story, and he doesn’t care at all, he just sounds like having a girlfriend at all is a huge accomplishment, no matter how awful she is to other people. This is the second time he’s dating someone with a lower class background, who (I feel) only dates him to have a senior boyfriend (she’s a sophomore, same as me). And on my side, he’ll push me to the backseat and focus all his attention on his egotistical gf who makes me miserable. I don’t want to go through this again.

Sorry for the rant. 

I need advice on if I should tell one of her boyfriends the deal. Not C or S really deserves to be cheated on, and honestly I don’t like the position I’m in at all. 

On one side, if I tell one or both of the boyfriends then who could tell what would happen? I feel like I’d lose some good friends, or they’d turn on each other. On the other hand, if I don’t tell anyone at all, and both S and C find out I knew all along about this girl they’d definitely be pissed at me, and never speak to me again. This is the first job I’ve ever had and the situation is turning it into a stressful one when I’m around any of them, and I honestly don’t have anyone else to turn to for advice.

Thanks so much for any advice you guys can give.

Tl;dr

Two good friends of mine are dating the same girl, the second guy think she’s only cheating on the first guy, while actually she’s cheating on both of them with my brother. He think’s its an accomplishment and a big ego boost to have a trashy sophomore girlfriend as a senior in HS and she thinks she’s the above everyone else because of it. My brother knows all of this.
Should I tell my friends so they don’t waste their time with this girl?

191,"So, I (15f) have some explaining to do. I started talking to a guy (14-15m)back in april. I had people telling me that he was toxic and that I shouldn't talk to him but I didn't listen and talked to him anyway. Looking back on everything now he was emotionally manipulative and had heavy emotional baggage that I was trying to fix, which was damaging my own mental health. I decided to cut him out of my life after he asked me out again (this was a common thing) and a few hours ago, I told him to not talk to me, or contact me in any way. He asked what he did and I explained why. Then at 3AM he started going off on how he was nothing but nice and how I'm ""just copying my friends""(in terms of beliefs I would assume) and how 50 years from now when all of us will be working at McDonald's, he'll pull up in his BMW and not even be surprised. Anyway the part that really freaked me out was how he said everything. It all had an unnerving tone that I was kinda aware of the whole time I've been talking to him but it all really exploded in that moment. He, imo, is not mentally stable. Now this kid has always been a bit weird at school and considering in his message he was saying that he didnt care if everyone in the school hated him, I feel like he may try and shoot up the school. And I'm 99% sure I would be on his list of people to kill. What do you think? Am I being over the top? I really hope I am.",28Jul2018,1

So my older sister is not a very nice person. I tried to put up with it for years but after a big fight a year ago I cut ties with her. Being around her drains me so much and she doesn't understand how she can be really insensitive, so I set that boundary because my therapist recommended I distance myself from her. Anyways I love art and my art supplies have been getting a bit costly to keep replenishing so I want to switch to digital artwork. I lent her my drawing tablet a few years ago, and I want it back because I can't afford to buy a new one. However she's using it for school now and I know for a fact she can 100% afford to purchase her own. She has a shit load of money from a settlement she received, so money is no issue for her. Anyways I asked a close relative to talk to her and see if I could have it back. Am I being immature by not asking her myself? I don't want to open myself to her toxic behaviour, but I really really wanna pursue my artwork more. Should I just suck it up and save for a new one? Sorry if this is stupid. I don't have many people to talk to. I can easily see her saying something like ""Why are you being such a little bitch, just ask me yourself instead of forcing other people to do shit for you.""

194,"I’m going to LA next week and the flight will be 4.5 hours long. I’ve only ever been on hour long plane rides so this is intimidating- mostly because I spend the entire time with my stomach in my throat, on the verge of panic from anxiety. It is absolutely sphincter-clenching and I can’t stand it.
The thoughts definitely revolve around an explosive being in flight or crashing, even though I know statistically it’s not gonna happen.

On top of that I get plane sick, so I have to take Dramamine. But even after the medicine, I can’t read, write, draw, or watch a screen for too long without getting nauseated. So listening to music or a podcast and staring at one spot on ceiling is p much all i can do.

195,"This may be long and I apologize- also people with PTSD surrounding sexual assaults, this is a trigger warning. 

I never told anyone when it happened because I wasn’t really sure it had happened. My “friend” invited me to his frat party and left me in a place full of strangers. Somehow in the mix this man found me, drugged me, drove me home, and raped me. The only reason the cops were ever told is because I got drunk and mentioned it to my friend who also happened to be an RA. She had to call the cops and it went on from there. I won’t go into too much detail. They found videos on his phone of him raping me and another girl. My case was dropped. 

I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome so it takes more drugs to knock me out than the average person (like when I got my wisdom teeth out). So I guess in a drugged and still slightly intoxicated state of mind the video he took made it seem like I was ok with what was happening once I woke up from whatever it is he had given me seven or so hours before. I was not. I was told the jury wasn’t set up to understand my circumstances yet. He took a plea deal for the other girls case and his sentencing was so minor. I appreciate all the effort the cops put into this case as well as the attorney. I will also be forever grateful to the women that was able to finish what I, unfortunately, could not. 

I’m fairly open about what happened when people ask  because I want other people to release the stigma surrounding it. I want it to be something that’s ok to talk about and come forward with. I just don’t know how to get my story told or if that would even be helpful. So what I’m really asking is, what do I do with this? I feel like a hypocrite because few people know unless the topic arises. I don’t know how to make a change, but that’s what I want. I want a change. Because the ways I used to view rape to how I view it now have shifted dramatically. Please give me advice on where to take my story or what I have learned.

My grandparents live in s.korea. my grandpa has been sick for some time.

A few days prior to my departure to s. Korea with my girlfriend, my mother informs me that my grandpa is terminally ill. 

I feel guilty as I feel sad, and feel even more guilt from feeling like I have ruined the purpose of the trip for my girlfriend.

A day after my grandpa passes away. I grief and my gf is left feeling terrible.
I assure her that everything is going to be okay and that we're going to have a good trip.

We arrive in korea and we have a good time. We go back In a few days.

My mother insists that I visit my grandmother and say hi to her. I feel uncomfortable doing so for following reasons:

1. I have never experienced death around me before. I do not wish to know what it feels like, and want to forget this as it never happened.

2. I feel rude to my gf for feeling like I have ruined the trip. I know she feels really strange about the trip and I don't want to make it worse.

3.my mother is making me feel guilty. I told her that I dont want to put my gf in an uncomfortable situation and that I feel unsafe leaving her in a foreign countrys hotel for hours.

200,"(26M) I quit watching porn several months ago after realizing the negative impact it's been having in my life.

Up until recently, the only way I've experienced my sexuality is through a computer screen. I've always felt ashamed of my porn use, and I'm getting the impression that these feelings have bled into how I feel about sex in general.

The fact that I kept porn to myself and never talked about it conditioned me to see real-life sex as disdainful as well.

It's not that I'm not able to or don't want to have sex, it's just that I have difficulty expressing that side of me after years of doing so in complete isolation.

Just putting this into words is already helping, but if anyone has any extra tips on overcoming this, I would like to hear them.

Let me just say that he is a guy who I haven’t even been dating that long (about 3 months).

We had three separate incidents.

First incident happened when he got pissed at me when I asked him to not tell me lustful comments about other women anymore. So he gets pissed at me, swears at me, then I get angry and I go off on him, then he threatens my life. I told the police, they took a repport down, a detective contacted me, but I didn’t full go through with filing charges because I was in love with this man.


I left him but I ended up taking him back because he would not leave me alone after that first argument. I know: stupid.

The second argument happened because I told him that I didn’t trust him and he got pissed again, of course. I left him again and then he proceeds to call me and email me frantically, sending me emails, and coming up to my job at the post office. I have lost my job at the post office because he trespassed on federal private property at the post office, which got me in trouble. I was working the dock one night in the back of the post office and he came to sit on the dock in a far off slightly darkened corner and I did not see him. He said he was watching me the entire 30 minutes. My boss spotted him, of course. And then I got fired.


The third argument was really bad because harassed me for 4 days straight until I finally answered him. The reason the third argument happened is because I finally had came to my senses and I decided to leave him for good. Well, one day I just stopped answering his calls and texts. I didn’t feel he deserved an explanation because of what I had already went though with him, and seeing how he would stalk me and bother me despite me telling him to leave me alone then I thought it was pointless in telling him that I really don’t want to be with him anymore because he clearly won’t take no for answer, anyway.

So when I ignored all of his texts and other messages, he went into a rage and sent me all kinds of abusive, evil hateful voicemails, text messages and emails for 4 days. I finally answered him and went off on him and this is when he threatened my life AGAIN.

I have all of this documented.


I went to go file a restraining order but I didn’t go through with because my sister talked me into thinking that it was a waste of time to get one, and she told me that they don’t really protect you. Plus I was scared to face my ex in court, too.

All of this happened near the begging of 2018 between the months of January 2018 to early May 2018.

Fast forward 3 or 4 months later to today:  I just got a very long love letter from this guy telling me how sorry he is and how much he still loves me.

This guy clearly doesn’t know what the words “leave me alone” means.

He is asking me to forgive him and take him back. He says, “It was my ego that got bruised when you would leave me, an that’s why I got really angry and even threatened your life. Can you forgive me?”


Since I didn’t go through with the restraining order, isn’t it too late to file for another one? What if they don’t take me seriously? I mean I already blew off the detective who wanted to investigate what was going on and I also blew off my court hearing the for restraining order.

226,"Copied over from /r/relationships 

My friend Morgan and I have known each other for over ten years and became friends in first grade, and we have since graduated. Morgan has always been one of my best friends, but she was always the problematic one. She has cut out two supposedly ""toxic"" friends in our friendship's duration, and then immediately worked to ruin their life. That sounds dramatic but it is literally true, she had tried to break up friendships and relationships before.

Why did I remain friends with this person? Because I love them and I have known them forever. Surely it couldn't happen to me?

I messaged Morgan two weeks ago about how I haven't seen her in a while and would like to meet up, she didn't respond for a week and then last wednesday responded and told me she didn't want to speak to me ever again.

I was really confused, and asked what she meant, and what I did. She didn't respond?

That alone hurt me deeply, I cared about this person and they threw me away like I was nothing, without an explanation.

Fast forward to last night, I was with a few people and my good friend Mark, who works with my best friend Thomas, told me that Thomas told him at work that he has been ""Hanging out with Morgan and her boyfriend, and sees their point of view now"", and also doesn't wishes he had to speak to me.

This just broke me and I started crying, why do my friends suddenly not want to be my friend anymore, and why can't anyone give me an explanation?

Did I really do something awful and I genuinely forgot? I am so confused and frustrated and heartbroken.

Please someone help, I love these people and have known them my whole life and I am hurting so much right now.

**TL;DR** One of my friends cut contact with me, and is influencing my other friends to do the same. I don't know what I did.",28Jul2018,3

I'm willing to pack up and relocate and I am willing to travel up to 80-90% I don't understand why I'm not being scooped up immediately. The few companies which did respond to my emails either did not want to take the chance of hiring someone out of state or were fully employed.

I wouldn't mind it going somewhere but neither of us are pushing/initiating plans to see each other so I'm taking this as a form of disinterest from both ends. I honestly don't mind taking the lead once in a while and I do like him but I'm used to the dynamic of being the one pursued. 

I'm not in a rush to get into a relationship and it's still far too early to tell/ask where this is going but I can't help but feel as if this is going reaaally slow.

234,"I’m a [19F], and I thought I’d post here since I just want a straightforward answer on the actions of this guy I thought I’d have a developing relationship with.

I met this guy through social media being a friend of one of his friends. I’ve been friends with his friend for a few years, and he has been friends with him for many years. I saw him tagged in a picture and found him attractive (let’s call him T, 18 btw if that matters), so I friended him and we made some small talk together through PM. My friend and T actually live out of state, and I so happened to be traveling on vacation to the state within a few days.

We planned to hang out once I got there and we did. He drove 20 min to come see me and we hung out at a park late at night when I arrived that day. We ended up making out, however it stopped there because it was getting pretty late. Before that happened, we had some basic conversation to get to know each other and I thought we had a lot in common and I really liked him. He also expressed to me that he really into me and that he found me very attractive.

The day after, we hung out again. This time was pretty late as well due to being busy in the morning, and we meant to go to a beach but decided to go to his place instead. We had sex and I thought it was great, other than the fact that his A/C broke and we were sweating like crazy which was kinda gross (lol). Afterwards, we had some fun singing along to some songs, he took some pictures with me (on Snapchat so I could save them) and he drove me back to my hotel. 

The next morning when I texted him  and he seemed pretty normal, but was busy. The next few days remaining on my vacation he said he was also busy and seemed kind of sad about not being able to hang out any more than we did (we had planned to go to many places together before but couldn’t because he was busy).

After I arrived back to my home state, he started only giving one worded replies to my friendly texts. Sooner or later he stopped replying to some. I then saw him post a picture on social media of him taking some girl on a dinner date so I got the message that maybe he was interested in another girl and gave him space, thinking we could just remain friends due to having so much in common, but then he deleted me off most of his social media accounts after.

I clarified while we were spending time together what both of our intentions were. I asked if it was just hooking up or getting to know each other, and he said both. I took getting to know each other more of something like being friends and staying friends.

I’m honestly hurt after seeing he deleted me after what happened between us, especially since we interacted in a way where it seemed like we were really into each other. I almost feel like I was fooled into being an object for sex, and that our conversations about our interests and life stories meant nothing and was all a lie as well as him telling me he wanted to take me to places around his city. 

I can’t build up the audacity to message him and ask why, especially since it seems like he found interest in someone else so quickly and since he deleted me off of social media. It’s been a month since this has happened and I think of him from time to time and feel really hurt. Please help me figure this out and give me advice. Thanks! ",28Jul2018,1

237,"So back in May I started a new job as a salesperson in a department store. The department I’ve been assigned to hadn’t been performing up to standard (sales wise) in the last few months and I could tell why; the stock room was basically piled up on the ground, it was basically impossible for a customer to find what they wanted on the shelves as they were so poorly organised and frankly, it seemed like the staff just didn’t care. I have a real passion for this department (have worked previously in similar jobs) and I really wanted to make a change. I spent the last few months clearing out the stock room and organising the shelves and displays into smaller sub-departments (to make it easier for customers to navigate around). While doing this, I have also managed to help the departments earnings increase by up to 35% from last year, which I’d say is a huge accomplishment. 

My only issue is, I don’t think anyone’s noticed the changes, everyone’s just kind of been like “yeah that should’ve been done ages ago’ etc etc. I just want to be appreciated for the effort I’ve put into this department (bc lemme tell you it took a couple sweaty and frustrating weeks to sort everything out). I don’t want to be cocky about it or anything, but I feel like writing a feedback email about myself  from the perspective of a customer I’d maybe see some recognition?

241,"I don’t seem to understand how my girlfriend processes stuff.She has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and yes I understand how it can impact a relationship but how can it be that she is so full of contradictions is beyond me.

For example, last few days she kept saying how she doesn’t feel good that she is lonely. That I need to do a better job of introducing my friends to her.How she needs to feel welcome by my friends. I find this utterly amazing, since we did go on a trip together with my friends to the mountains and they were cordial to her. 

She also isn’t okay with one of my coworkers who I presume has a crush on me. That would be okay but what can I do about it. She seems to blame my behavior for her actions. All this while she is completely okay with being close friends with this guy overseas, someone who she has cheated with while in a previous relationship. Someone who came to visit her and flirted with her even when he was dating someone else.

To top it all, she keeps making accusations that I don’t spend enough time  with her ( we meet at least 4 times a week and she calls up multiple times everyday). Last couple of days one of her guy friends is in town and at her place. I haven’t heard a word from her. 

All this honestly makes me feel like this relationship is nothing but an addiction. I’m supposed to fulfill her needs or she throws a tantrum. On the flip side she can do whatever she wants and has a hard time taking a no from me.I’ve tried to break up in the past but she simply doesn’t let go. I don’t feel wanted in this relationship, I only feel needed. I honestly don’t know what to do. I started to develop anxiety about this relationship and nowadays have full blown panic attacks.

It has ruined my life until now, and I fear it will ruin my future, career and especially marriage too! 

* My stomach makes growling sounds often, and often in class during lecture my stomach *vibrates and growls* loudly making me so embarrassed. 
* I have a distinct bad body odour too. I shower daily, clean my body properly but after some 5-10 minutes out of shower, my underarms start smelling bad. 
* I sweat a lot. I sweat like I just came out of the shower in summers. Sweating is so serious that it's often a subject of embarrassment for me. 
* I believe I have a slow digestion. I didn't count the times, but I can go 3 to 4 days without poop. I keep eating but I don't feel the pressure everyday. 
* I'm overweight, with a 27.7 BMI. 

My bad breath had me have a severe emotional breakdown in front of my mother once when I told her all the humiliations I have faced in my life. My best friend passing a joke that I don't brush my teeth, professor in college passing a remark that someone wouldn't like to go movies with someone whose breath smells, a classmate saying *""you'll sit here (on my bench)? Uh, now the foul smell will come""*, classmates in younger classes pointing at me saying *""your breath smells"".* I can't recall how I managed myself in these situations. All I remember is that I tried to act like I didn't hear them and I didn't notice it in my body, but, everyday, everyday, I do notice and my life is ruined. I envy my friends who speak so close to each other, I envy all the confident people talking to anyone freely, I envy couples in movies kissing, and that's when it hits me that I'll be devastated when I'll have to marry. I will not only ruin my own life but also my husband's.

246,"I've worked in this grocery store deli for 1.5 years. The other day, I noticed that my schedule for next week was completely empty. No hours. I texted the deli manager (DM):

&gt;Me: Do you know what's going on with this? I'm gonna have hours next week right?

&gt;DM: What the heck?! That's weird. I'll have to look at it tomorrow, I'm not sure what's going on with that

The next day, she wrote me in for 3 shifts, totaling 17 hours, when I usually have....well, more than that for sure.

I asked her today if she figured out why that happened she said ""I didn't look into it, I just gave you those shifts and moved on with my life.""

So I asked co-manager #1. He said he didn't know why I wasn't given any hours, and that the store manager made the schedule for that week, then walked away before I could ask anything else.

So I asked co-manager #2. She said she didn't know why it happened either, and for me to work the 3 shifts and go from there. I asked if we could find out why it happened because I didn't want it to happen again. All she said was that it won't happen again.

I haven't had a chance to talk to the store manager yet, but I plan to, and I'm thinking of recording the conversation to cover my ass. I'm not sure why they'd want to fire me/make me quit. I know they don't like my boyfriend who is kind of a smart-ass and works in meat department. I have reported a coworker sexually harassing me and heard through coworkers that the store manager called me a ""shit-starter who's gonna end up bagging if she keeps it up"". I've also had a few complaints about people in my department, but I'm not sure why they wouldn't want to know about people hurting the department. I do my job just fine. Way better than a good few people in the deli.

249,"So my sister in law got a boyfriend about two years ago..

We're all adults, 30+, by the way.

He is as dumb as a loaf of bread. He can't think logically at all, everything, even the simplest of things, needs to be explained several times to him. For example, he believed that the sun was BEHIND the moon and that the moon blocked the sun at night, which is why it was dark and the moon was shining. The real deal had to be explained several times, firstly because he simply didn't believe us when we said he was wrong. This is just one example, of many, many stupid things said. What makes things worse is that he gets offended, and offensive, when people know more than him (which obviously happens a lot). 

He also tries to be manipulative, oblivious to the fact that everyone sees right though the lies and ""stories"" he's telling. He acts like a child whenever he doesn't get what he wants, he throws literal tantrums. If he doesn't get what he wants, he goes out of his way to ruin the experience for everyone else, he complains a LOT, on the rest of us, on the environment, on random made up pains (neck, feet, stomach, head, everything), just to get what he wants. Like an child. It's funny though, the pains he's complaining about usually gets forgotten immediately when he gets what he wants. He gets whatever it is he wants quite often, there's not much you can do when someone is complaining about being in pain, without being an asshole.

The thing is, we can't really tell him off, it is after all my sister in laws boyfriend, and the family is already split enough as it is, with various feuds that run quite deeply, we don't want to cause any trouble. 

I know it sounds like there's some kind of mental handicap involved, but there isn't, he's been checked. 

So, I just need advice on how to deal with him, my patience is running really low now, he's ruined several outings this summer already. If anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.

2. The job market where I live is ""hot"" and I can likely get another job, but it's not likely to be a ""Skunk Works"" job because there aren't very many of those in existence.

3. I'm in my late 20s

261,"We posted a general notice in our neighborhood inviting everyone over for CAH.  We wanted to get to know our neighbors and figured this was a good way to do that, and also meet the kind of people we’d get along with in general if they came over for that game in particular.  We were clear about what we’d be doing and that we were hoping to make it a regular thing.

One couple came (we had never met before) and said they love this game and play it all the time. But very quickly it was apparent that the wife cannot read.  She was very outgoing but when it came for her turn with the black cards, she would mumble the questions and the answers  and everyone had to keep asking for her to repeat herself.

Sometimes she’d ask for help reading the cards, but most of the time she wouldn’t and the things she’d say were nonsensical.  It completely defeated the point of the game because nothing was funny or made sense and because she couldn’t understand what she was reading, she’d randomly pick a winning card. 

At first I felt bad for being so frustrated.  If she can’t read, that’s not her fault.  But at the same time, if she’s played before then she knows reading is part of it and she should have asked to skip her turns asking questions, or suggested a different game.  

Then I noticed some other things.  She would space out constantly.  She wouldn’t know it was time for her to put in a card, or that it was her turn to read, or she’d hand over several cards at once, or just one card when it was a multiple card round.  When she was the black card holder, she would always try to keep it and hand the winner the stack of white cards.  

I wondered if she might be high.  Her husband looked a little frustrated with her.  

When they left I asked my husband if he was frustrated by her inability to read the cards and he said yes, a little bit, but that if she can’t read she can’t help it, but that he thought she might be under the influence of something.  So, it definitely wasn’t just me who thought that.

So now I’m in a pickle.  This is supposed to be a monthly thing, but it really was agonizing playing with her.  Whether she can’t read or was high, this isn’t the game to play with her.  

Is there a tactful way to handle this?",28Jul2018,1
262,"I am writing today because I need advice.  Preferably from someone in law enforcement, someone who practices law, and experienced psychologists. 

My dad committed suicide several years ago.  My mom and him had another fight (very common in their relationship) and it ended with him shooting himself.  My mom has always hit him and emotionally/financially abused him. They went through a ton of counseling with multiple therapists over their 30 year marriage but it never improved.  After my dad died, my brother and I each (not realizing we both had reached out separately) called their marriage counselor they worked with the most over a 10 year period and she told me in their last session it had been recommended that my parents separate.  My mom lost her temper and stormed out of the session according to this therapist. My dad use to say to me all the time, ""As soon as you are married and taken care of and your brother is in his career, I'M OUT.""  He said this over and over again to me.  My dad's best friend and cousin told me after he died that my father had been making arrangements to leave my mom.  My dad had even asked him to find him a lawyer and he had been stashing money to get away.   I saw her hit him all the time. There was no stopping her. He was not a physically large man at around 5'6 110 Ibs.  She was much larger than him physically.   One time she broke a glass table over his head from behind when he was eating.  Another time she hit him so hard she had a boxer's fracture as a result.  My brother told me about the last 2 examples which occurred closer to his death but I grew up watching her lose her temper and hit my dad all the time.  I happened to be visiting with my husband from out of state when my dad died.  My dad was a very good man and a WONDERFUL father.  It was hard to see him go through all of this over the years and he often told me how much he continued to suffer.  I left home very early (teens) to get away from this and still want to stay as far away as possible.  My mom scares me.  Since my dad's death the story of that night has changed drastically.  I watched her lie to the police that night and tell a completely different narrative than what she first told us when it happened. She did an interview with a reporter from the local newspaper claiming my dad was on drugs, which he wasn't.  She claims he went crazy that night and lost it.  My dad was always cool, calm, and collected.  He was a respected physician in his community and church.  Everyone adored my father.  She has ruined my dad's reputation since he died in order to hide the fact that she was abusive to him and their marriage wasn't what people saw from the outside. We all kept the reality of what home really was like hidden from everyone.  My family - aunts, uncles, cousins, grandfather have all been told such a different story from what actually happened.  My little brother used to fight with her all the time because he saw so much of her abuse but my mom and him have always been close, even with the fighting.  I haven't talked to my mom in almost a year and my older brother stopped talking to her before that.  My greatest desire is to get away from all of this and not engage with my mom regarding my dad's death.  It has been very hard to hear her lie about the story and about who my dad was and after repeatedly asking her to please leave me out of it I finally stopped talking to her.  Her take is I either agree with the story she is telling about my dad or I am her enemy.  The night my dad died, a video was taken by my mom of him.  In the video my dad, who was exhausted at 11:30pm after being woken up by my mom, says, ""how many times have you hit me tonight?""  He repeats this question over and over again very calmly.  She moves the camera up into his face.  It is very sad to watch.  My sister in law and husband found the camera close to where my dad died.  My brother, his wife, myself  and my husband all watched it a day or two after my dad died and I uploaded the video clip from the camera onto dropbox.  After the funeral my dad's best friend and cousin asked to see the video and I sent him the video to be viewed on dropbox.  

This week I was sent a letter from a lawyer my mom hired regarding the camera chip and video.  It says, ""You are in possession of a video card which was taken from a Panasonic video camera which belonged to your parents.  You took the video card without permission.  The video card contains sensitive and personal information.  The video card belongs to the estate, and it must be returned.  In  addition, your mother has learned that you shared the contents of the video card with others, including your cousin \[my dad's best friend\] and your Uncle \[my dad's favorite uncle whom he was very close to\].  Sharing the contents of the video card must stop immediately.  You need to do three things: 1) Mail the video card to your mother within three business days of receipt of this letter.  2) Identify the name and contact information of every person with whom you shared the contents of the video card.  Please do with within three business days.  3) Stop disseminating and delete the contents of the video card (this includes any files you created and saved).""

I gave the chip to my older brother right after my dad died and my little brother (and out spouses) watched it.  He was handling a lot of the legal items as he is a lawyer.  I only sent it to my dad's cousin/best friend and to my little brother via drop box. I checked dropbox and it is not longer there.  The file is there with the date but it is just black.  I called my little brother the next day to ask if he received a letter or anything and he said my mom had told him her intentions and that he understood why she did it.  My brother and my mom have always been closer, even though they fight a lot.  For this reason I have hardly talked to him.  In fact I can't have a relationship with anyone she has a relationship because of the way she manipulated the truth about my dad's death and their relationship.  I don't know what to do because I don't have the chip, I don't have the video on dropbox any longer (don't know how it isn't there as I don't remember deleting it) and I never sent it to anyone except my cousin and little brother right after my dad died 3 year ago. I have been trying to get away from this dysfunction.  My husband and I live far away and decided a while ago that we want no part in this.  I can't believe my mom keeps trying to suck me in.  I am desperate to get away and live my life.  I have given up all the relationships I once treasured because I know she has lied to them and I don't want to get involved.  It is not worth it to me to stand up against my mom.  In reality I love her, she is my mother.  I don't want to hurt her or call her a lier.  I don't want to confront her or tell people the truth where mother and daughter have 2 completely different stories.  I just want to stay away from it all.  Besides, the more this is all drawn out the more it disrespects my father.  I want to honor my father and let him rest in peace.  I miss him everyday so much and this tragedy I will never recover from.  My hope is that I can at least stay out of the dysfunctional drama my mother causes.

268,"I am a 22 y/o female recently graduated from college, and recently broken up with my long-term boyfriend who I was sharing an apartment with. Until I can find another living situation, I will be moving back in with my parents. Ideally, I’d like my next move move to be a big one to a different state, since I’m not crazy about where I live and no longer have any serious commitments (like school or a relationship) anchoring me here. 

My parents are actually thrilled that I will be moving back in with them. In fact, the only reason I am living again in my hometown at all is because my younger brother, who I am very close with, became pretty severely disabled a few years ago; to the point where he will not be able to live on his own anytime soon. I left the awesome university I was attending in another country in order to move home and be closer to him, and to provide additional support to my parents in helping care for him (they both work full-time). I finished college at the local state university and worked/lived in my own apartment for the majority of that time, and also adopted my own dog. They and my brother have all made it very clear to me that they are super grateful for my support and welcome me back home with open arms. 

My parents have also recently purchased a new house (in their same city) and will be moving in soon, and which point I will fully move back in with them. The new house is in need of a few minor repairs but overall is a beautiful home and they’re thrilled to be moving in. For the most part, so am I. 

There’s only one problem. The new house has six bedrooms; five of which are located on the second floor, which is all hardwood. The final bedroom is in the basement, which is carpeted. As soon as I found this out, it seemed like a no-brainer to me that I would take that basement room, in order to have a little more privacy and independence, and not have my room literally sandwiched between my parents’ and that of my very needy, disabled brother. However, they have expressed serious trepidation about me living in the basement due to my dog, and their concerns that she will “ruin the carpet”. 

My dog is very friendly and energetic, but for the most part very obedient and well-behaved. She also no longer has accidents in the house or issues with chewing, although these were issues when I first adopted her and was living with them at the time. Her behavior is now that of a normal, fully grown and well behaved dog. She also does not shed, and gets along fine with my parents’ dog (we’ve had multiple dogs for many years, and they have no aversion to animals in general). 

When explaining my desire to live in the basement, I initially mentioned to my parents that I am in possession of a large, nice rug that I kept in the living room of my apartment, and could easily use to cover most of the carpeted floor in the basement bedroom; in addition to purchasing another rug if necessary to cover the remainder of the carpet. I am also willing to create/abide by a rule that my dog will never be in the basement unless I am going to bed and she is sleeping in my room with me. Additionally, I have purchased a pair of rubberized “doggie socks” that she could be required to wear whenever walking across the basement carpet -- which, by the way, is an ordinary, beige basement carpet, not a particularly luxurious/expensive one (though I understand they want to keep it as nice as possible). I am also more than willing to pay out of my own pocket for any damage my dog incurs to their carpet (which I truly believe she will not do). Finally, I want to point out to them that if I don’t take the upstairs bedroom, it can be used as a nice guest room for my very old, arthritic grandparents who frequently come to stay with us, giving them a nicer experience (i.e. not sleeping on a blow-up mattress in a dark, isolated basement room with steep stairs, and no bathroom nearby). 

To me, being able to have the basement room will make the difference between living with my parents turning into a positive experience where I get to bond with them and still have my space, as opposed to a negative one where I have no privacy or quiet space to get away from my brother (who I love, but who is VERY attached to me and lacks a sense of boundaries) and will be crowded into one bathroom with him AND my teenage sister. One of the main reasons they wanted to move into this new house was so that we could be less “crowded on top of each other”; to me, having five adults living in one hallway when there is another perfectly fine bedroom available elsewhere in the house flies in the face of that logic. 

I have faith in the strength of my arguments, but my parents are the type who are more likely to be convinced if I am able to present those arguments in a way that appeals to them. I am prepared to kiss some serious ass, grovel, and even offer myself up to them as their kitchen/garden slave in return for this one favor. Beyond this, how would you suggest I present the argument to them? I truly just want a situation that will work for all of us, including me. 

Parents, how could your child (in my situation) convince you to let this happen? I ",28Jul2018,1
269,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

About a year ago while on a family trip to the Mediterranean (mom not with due to family emergency) I caught a glance of my dad’s phone in which he’d sent a raunchy message to a friend he’d met on an online platform that he and my mom are both fairly involved in. I confronted him about it and it got ugly — I was an emotional wreck, he looked remorseful, definitely put a damper on the trip. I thought about it for the ensuing weeks and ultimately decided that I’d turn a blind eye to this one incident because it seemed isolated and not particularly egregious, but if I caught him doing anything even remotely extramarital ever again I’d tell my mom in a heartbeat.

Let me explain my reasoning. (1) My mom is completely dependent on my dad for income. Never finished college. Was an artist and musician for a living most of her life. We live in Silicon Valley and her supporting herself here is completely out of the question. And (2) she is emotionally unstable. I inherited this from her. She’s told me about the time she spent in therapy as a young adult. Takes things very personally. Used to have crippling OCD. If she found out I’m terrified she would become depressed to the point of suicide.

I’ve always had a somewhat strained relationship with my dad. We fought a lot growing up. He’s a role model in many aspects and I have him to thank for a lot of the traits I’m most proud of in myself. But the fact of the matter (which I’ve only come to confront recently) is that I’m much closer with my mom. Our relationship is less like parent-child and more like close friends. Short of divulging the more intimate aspects of her marriage, we have talked about most everything.

But my thought at the time (or at least the way I rationalized it) was this: I’m not protecting my dad. I couldn’t care less if the whole world found out he had a nasty indiscretion. But I care very deeply about my mom and would never forgive myself if telling her drove her to commit something drastic and irreversible. It would ruin her.

I subsisted on this rationale for about a year, but yesterday it obliterated my conscience like a freight train and now I’m having a crisis because it feels like I’m withholding information from my mom that she should really know. Far as I’m aware, my dad never slipped up, although he did have a suspicious phone bill one time that I confronted him about in which his social media usage was exponentially higher than others. I chalked this up to him working at a social media company.

But my anxiety is twofold:

1) am I committing an act of malice or complicity by keeping this from my mom?
2) has my ultimatum to my dad (to ensure nothing else happens again) just given him incentive to be more discreet? What if this wasn’t the first time?
3) my dad appears to have cut the individual he was having an inappropriate text conversation with out of his life based on his activity on the platform it involved. I don’t know this person and they live overseas. And they also know he and my mom (with whom this person also interacts) are married. What if she used it as leverage or told my mom?

I used to attend therapy somewhat regularly and when I brought it up, my therapist said my rationale was reasonable and advised me to keep my nose out of my parents’ personal problems, lest I regret it later. And my family has functioned fine since that event. But if my mom ever finds out and realizes that I knew for years and never told her, I think it would only compound the emotional break, and she’d probably automatically assume I was taking my dad’s side. (She has expressed the worry to me before that I tell my dad more than I tell her. For 99% of things this is categorically false, but taking every event to its worst possible conclusion is a personality defect that we share.)

I was working with my family on a project that aims to help children in poverty get school supplies. There was a group of five kids that came in, and there was a little Caucasian boy that set off a few alarms in my head.

I didn’t really work with him, but my mother did. She said he reeked of cigarettes. He was also really, really dirty and was absolutely covered in rashes. Every last inch of his skin was blemished and covered in dirt. I’m not sure if it was rashes, eczema, or an illness. 

We did an exercise with the kids where we taught them a simple English lesson and he struggled far more than the other kids. At points it seemed like he was on the autism spectrum.

273,"I've started seeing and sleeping with my housemate after 6 months of her trying it on with me. I would have been down for it way before but the idea of getting together with someone I lived with scared me. Since she moved in there has always been this spark between us but we remained friends and she has quickly became someone I feel comfortable around. 

A couple of weeks ago, something happened and I found myself wanting her constantly and then we found ourselves alone (I live in house of 6) we slept together. We agreed to stop seeing other people and see where things would go. Since then, we have spent most of our free time together. 

However, after a couple of weeks of sleeping with each other, I'm starting to get very worried about starting a relationship with her. I no longer have any free time so myself (I'm a little bit introverted) and she is always around. We have moved every quickly. I never wanted to be in a relationship (I have told her this many times before) and I want to solely focus on my new career (the reason I moved into a new area hence the shared house). 

I'm finding her a little bit needy at the moment. She always wants to cuddle (don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good cuddle but it's constant cuddling and it's so warm atm!). I have told her that I wanted to sleep in my own bed a few times after spending the night with her and she told me she saw that as a form of rejection which made no sense to me.

Hello! I’ve been a very sensitive person for as long as I can remember. It used to be difficult for me to take criticism and teasing. I would literally start getting teary when I would receive feedback from my music teachers when I’d go for my lessons. It was awful. 

I’d like to think I’ve gotten a little better in managing the initial jerk reaction of feeling hurt and wanting to cry, but I’d like to be a lot better. I think most of it comes from insecurity and being more harsh on myself when I make a mistake. I know that making failure is part of life, and going with the flow is much better than being rigid and taking myself too seriously, which I definitely do. 

For the most part I’ve been able to think myself through a situation and not be confrontational because more often than not, I’m overreacting and taking things too personally. But sometimes I’m not sure if it’s a legitimate concern that I should talk about. Usually I’ve found that when I talk about it, it sounds stupid, I can’t always explain my reasoning, and I end up dismissing it, thinking it was just be being sensitive. I’m also a dweller so that doesn’t help either. 

For example, today I had an errand to do and asked my boyfriend if he wanted to meet up with me later and do some shopping and hang out. He said sure. Once he met up with me he asked me again what we were doing. I told him the same thing I said the first time, and he said something along the lines of, “That’s it? Was there any other reason why I came down here?” We live in a city where he was only a 15-20 minute train ride from our apartment to where I was. 

Granted I know that his moods of wanting to go out change, and if he had said that he changed his mind, I would’ve been totally fine with that and done my own thing. And I know he doesn’t like going out often. 

I didn’t respond to it, just suggested we get some lunch and dessert and go home from there. He was fine then, but it was a real mood killer because I thought we were going to have a nice time enjoying the day. 

It’s still bothering me that he said something like that when I would do the same for him in an instant, even if I didn’t have any shopping to do or something. Again I understand where he’s coming from (doesn’t want to waste his time, likes to stay in, hates using the train) and I didn’t force him to come. 

Am I overreacting again? How do I go with the flow more and not let stuff like this get to me so quickly?

278,"My father tried to kill me when he found out I was a stripper. He tried to punch me to death andmy mum was blocking him and protecting me, but he was hitting so hard it did get me a little bit but if my mum hadn’t covered me I really think I’d have serious brain damage or be dead.  I’d never seen him so angry and he kept saying I’m going to kill her!, if I hadn’t gotten away and my mum wasn’t there I’d be dead or beaten badly. 

So it would be more private I decided to work as an escort, as that’s one on one and less chance of him finding out I still do such things. 

Recently a male person who knows my family and my entire familys social circle who has grown up with me together tried to book me. 
I asked him not to tell anyone and he said ok he won’t but I’m not sure. He might not be able to resist telling people. 
If word got out because of him, I’m terrified what would happen to me. 

I’m thinking of moving to another city altogether as I fear my dad trying to find me again to kill me. 

My mum denies he would’ve done serious harm but she was on top of me blocking his attacks. He still hit me hard enough that I lost my sense of orientation and directions that night, would walk around somewhere familiar forgetting it’s layout. I still live with her in the house he tried to kill me in, but he’s moved out and I don’t speak to him at all.

279,"Basically, The pressure to do well and get the best grades/work done that I can before the deadline pushes me into doing all of my work when I have a purpose to do it.

I'm currently studying software development, I've gotten all of my work in well before the deadline as I've been so focused on getting it all done and moving on to the next one during college time.

Now that I'm sat at home during the summer holidays I literally have no motivation to study Python as I had originally planned to. I don't know if a part of me is just tired from all the work I have done the past year but it's really getting to me that I can't sit myself down to work.

I think one issue is the lack of pressure and deadline - I have nobody to hand it into, there's no deadline and I'm not getting anything from learning it in my spare time even though I know it will benefit me greatly in the long run.

I go back to college in september. How do I get myself into self study during the holidays without putting it off, getting distracted and generally being lazy? ",28Jul2018,1
280,"Last night was my last straw, my father has tormented me since I was in elementary school with emotional abuse with all this ""woe is me"" bullshit. Ever since I was young he always would tell me about how much he hates his life, he hates our family, how he doesn't want to come home after work, and how he wishes I was like his friends kids who were ""so successful"" because he was ""ashamed"" I was his son. When I woke up, when we drove to school, when I got home, when I was sleeping. He would wake me up in the middle of the night just to yell at me, even if it was a school night...

He started saying all these things to me when I was 9 btw. Needless to say I did not take all these bashings too well, I was a very sensitive kid growing up, and this unrestricted flow of abuse left me insanely fucked up. 

I'm doing better now, but when I was 22 I physically threatened him after he came into my apartment unannounced and started trying to yell at me while I was sleeping. I shot up from bed and grabbed him by the neck and screamed in his face to get the fuck out of my house. 

Since then I just don't talk to him, I'll pick up his calls maybe 1/20 times and if he starts bitching and moaning I'll hang up. Last night he tried flipping out at me again, over...I'm not even sure what.

It was the same thing as it was before, ""I hate my life, you have no idea how much you (throwmywaaay) upsets me, I'm ashamed that you're my son, I'm embarassed by all of you"". 

I started laughing. my. ass. off. 

This only made him madder, and as his anger rose the hilarity of the situation made it even funnier. He kept saying ""STOP LAUGHING. I AM IN CONTROL, I AM IN CHARGE"", as if that was going to change my mind?

I stopped caring what he thought of me years ago, and as of recently I've completely let go of the thoughts of having a normal/functional relationship with him, last night being the nail in the coffin. 

So, I blocked his number, I feel like I never need to talk to him again. This will sound cold, but I don't think I would mind if I never saw or heard from him again, he could die and allthough I would definitely be sad. I would be sad for the relationship I never had with him, not for the one I did. ",28Jul2018,2
282,"Hello /r/advice! This is my first time posting here so I apologize if I'm not posting correctly. It ended up being a wall of text so...  
  
**TL;DR:** I have a part-time job on top of a full-time job and in both I work with clients with intellectual disabilities. Over the past couple of months there are different issues in my part-time job which leave me very stressed and emotionally drained without many days off to recuperate. In the span of two part-time shifts I was touched inappropriately by a client. Bringing this up to his grandmother, who hired me, left me with no confidence that this issue will be dealt with in respect of my personal boundaries and safety. I only have a month left in this town before college starts again. Should I keep pushing to get these issues fixed, or drop it to enjoy my last month of summer at the risk of seeming I do not care about my job?   
  
-----    
  
I am a college student who works with group homes housing clients with intellectual disabilities. My job can be summed as providing support in letting our clients live as independently as they can while ensuring everyone's needs are met. I am here for the four months that college is out for and classes start in a month. Around this time in August, I prefer to focus on prepping for school/life in the upcoming academic year. This is also the time I plan on spending with family and friends because we are all scattered around the country and everyone has some free time.   
  
So, I started the job off with roughly 20 hours a week and I asked my boss if there's any way to bump up my hours. He introduced me to a part-time position with a client who is the grandson of one of the group home system's board directors. His name is Mark, and the board member is Beth. Over the course of working with Mark, I've began struggling with different problems with this side job:  
  
* Mark does not have a program for me to follow. This is something usually planned beforehand so people in my position actually have a plan to follow in meeting the client's goals. I feel like I was placed in a position that was poorly planned and poorly organized  
  
* Since there is no plan to follow, my time with Mark is usually one very long car ride with maybe stops at different places. Now this is no problem with the client because this is what he prefers to do. He does not like walking or going into places. It is a problem with me because pretty much half what I make working with Mark is spent on gas money (which I am not reimbursed for).  
  
* I am now given roughly around 40 hours a week at my job at the group home. Working with Mark on top of this has led me to be emotionally exhausted most days as days off are now rare (once every two weeks).  
  
* Asking Beth, Mark's grandmother, for days off is uncomfortable as she is pushy about me ""getting as many hours as I can before school"". There are multiple days where she has assigned me to work with Josh right after 12 hour shifts at the group home. I stated that I am tired after these shifts and would not want to work, she just bumps the time later at night so I could ""take a nap before working"".  
  
* Since I am feeling exhausted (especially after 12 hour shifts), it is hard for me to pay attention to the road while working with Mark. I have made more near misses in the past few weeks and this makes me feel unsafe and not confident in driving.  
  
* My time sheet was misplaced and the program head who is in charge of paying me was unavailable for almost an entire month. A month's worth of pay is now a month late. Luckily I do not need the money right away but it is an added stressor on my part.  
  
  
And lastly, the number one reason I want to leave this position is that Mark has recently started showing a behavior where he would touch my upper thigh while I am driving. At first I thought he was trying to grab my attention but I soon realized that he would do it even though he didn't want to tell me something. This has happened a total of three times now. I can take verbal aggression, physical aggression, I can take clients destroying property and threatening me, BUT THIS is where I draw the line. My personal boundaries must be respected. I DO NOT tolerate being touched inappropriately in the workplace. No matter what the work.   
  
I brought this to Beth, and her and her husband did not take well to it. I tried to be as respectful as possible but they were very dismissive in their tone when I brought up that I felt uncomfortable. They were surprised I needed to park the car and allow myself a few minutes to calm down from being touched while driving. Beth told me that ""this is part of my job"", ""Mark is a teenager learning about his body"" and that ""Mark probably didn't have intent"". She also touched me in the thigh where Mark did and said ""so it was like this?"". It was so out of the blue that I did not react but that made me uncomfortable as well. I recognize that Mark is a teenager and there are a lot of new things he is learning about himself, but if I'm going to be experiencing this while his male workers aren't, I expect my concerns to at least be acknowledged.   
  
My issue is, are these reasons to drop the job? I've managed to tell Beth that, since I am going to travel to meet family, I need have two weekends off in August. I am now going to get my pay in the mail soon. Beth has started giving me gas cards to help with some (not all) of the gas cost. Most of the problems I had in the last month seems to be tended to at least in part. The very last issue now is that I feel like my concern for my own boundaries and safety is not being respected. I do not feel confident as a support worker to feel entirely safe while driving. Should I keep bringing this up and keep working or is it acceptable ground for me to quit outright without two weeks notice? I also work with Mark tomorrow so I'm wondering if it is acceptable to just say I do not wish to work that shift until I have spoken to my boss about the issue.  ",28Jul2018,1
283,"I've always felt like I work somewhere especially bad even for a restraunt but I could be wrong since this is my first job.  One thing that bugs me is that my coworker told me ""Hey I'm cleaning inside"" without really giving me a chance to say anything back.  Honestly I don't feel like I can complain abput anything because they're usually ignored or dismissed, including the fact that a lot of the kitchen staff are creepy.  Cleaning inside means you don't take anymore tables and you clean the kitchen which is pretty easy honestly.  The other servers have to clean hibachi tables, except I was the only server and that meant I had to clean 8 hibachi tables and keep taking tables on my own because we were so busy.  I should've spoken up but I never feel like I can.  All the people I like are quitting.  We also pool tip and 40% goes to the hibachi chefs.  Honestly I feel like I have to be an asshole like everyone else to get some respect which I don't want to do.  I've been in training for 7 almost 8 months meaning I only get paid 90% of the tips I shpuld get while working just as much as everyone else.  Honestly it feel like I'm working even harder than eveeyone else half the time.

The only benefits I can think of are it's easy to stay where I've been, sometimes the managers are cool, and if I work for 4 more months I'll have worked somewhere consistenly for a year.

284,"The title says it all, but some context: due to problems at school (unrelated to my grades) I (17f) still have three more years of school until I'm done, and hopefully go to uni. Where I live, normally you finish highschool at 17. 

Although school will be particularly difficult during these three years (moved to Germany) so I'll have to study a lot, I also don't want to waste my last years of not worrying so much trying to make ends meet just like that. 

It's kinda weird to think that most people my age are already pursuing a higher education and losing their virginities and all that, while I'm still here. So that's why I'd like to take these three years to full advantage and aquire new skills that'll be either useful for me in the future or just interesting to work on. 

Just for fun, I'm already learning coding. I also already have a solid understanding of taxes and all that stuff.

I said this was a pretty large stone and $4 compensation is pretty insulting. The least you can do is cover my order which was $20. They said absolutely not, there's no way we are giving $20 compensation. So I told them I will be pursuing other avenues and hung up.

287,"I'm not entirely sure how much of this kind of thing is normal in social circles. I have other friends and while I do have a lot of acquaintances, I've managed to avoid scenarios like this, thus far.  


Let me tell you what I mean. I have these 3 friends. One of them is my roommate A, the other is one of my best friends from high school B, and his girlfriend C. The three of them are used to doing third wheel things with each other. I started crashing the group because I had nothing better to do.   


A has high functioning autism and doesn't understand social cues. He is however he only one of us who has so far learned to drive and he's teaching me to drive. B is a fine guy, he can be unemotional at times but we have been through a lot together so he is one of my best friends. C is the only female of the group and has a tendency to overflirt wit all 3 of us. Most of the time I refuse her advances because 3 guys hitting on one girl in a group of friends is embarrassing, but she starts to feel bad if we aren't treating her like she's attractive.  


I have the most glib personality of the group and because of this C appears to be strongly attracted to me, however I don't want to hurt B's feelings, who is her actual boyfriend, and A is absolutely obsessed with her. The two other guys in the group are consistently jealous of me, but don't want to say anything out loud about it because it would embarrass them. Everyone gets weird and passive aggressive while I just keep trying to make jokes and keep the mood light.  


Yesterday we went to the beach and A got a speeding ticket going a 110 miles an hour because he wanted to feel in control of our lives because he felt inadequate. C continuously tries to flirt with me and I reject almost all advances. B just kind of puts up with it. We get back to our house where the couple is going to stay the night and watch a movie. They are drinking and smoking, but I'm a sober person. While this is happening C keeps flirting with me and I eventually kind of cave and start flirting back, but keeping it light and just conversational. The tone of the room takes a dramatic shift, A turns on me out of jealousy, B turns on me out of jealousy and C acts like I just got emotionally played and basically starts acting like I can fuck myself. All 3 of them turn on me after I basically did nothing but try to keep everyone happy all day. I even suggested we buy A dinner for getting a speeding ticket.  


I excused myself and went to bed early feeling absolutely betrayed by everyone while they kind of laughed at me for being such a cuck. Basically my friends feel socially threatened by me so they have to kind of bully me in order to feel better about themselves.  


Is this a normal thing in group friendships? Should I just get over it? Or should I stop hanging out with them as a group in order to preserve my feelings and dignity, because I'm not having fun.  


TL;DR my two male friends have inadequacy issues because our female friend wants to fuck me, even though I'm generally not interested, so they turn on me and try to make me feel small to feel better about themselves. Should I keep hanging out with this group?",28Jul2018,1

298,"Got my degree in Economics from a state school, which is a nice jumping off point for a masters. But, I didn't have the money to go directly to university, so I joined the military.  Next June, my service ends and the GI bill is mine for the taking but I'm having trouble deciding on a school.  The problem goes like this:  


1. Family from St. Louis. Havn't been around them much for the past 9 years (college+military).  Father works at a petroleum engineering plant (Schaeffer Oil if you must know) and would like me to be involved in it long term, something I am very interested in as it is a great company in my opinion.  

2. Outside of Ivy Leage schools, I don't think one universitie's MBA program (not dead set on MBA though.  I like statistics and international trade as alternates) is that much better than another.   

3. The GI bill gives me three years of $23000 tuition per year to spend at any accredited institution. Plus, any tuition not covered by this potentially is covered by the yellow ribbon program (uncle sam matches however much the university is willing to knock off the remaining bill. EX. $5000 left in tuition, uncle sam ponies up $2000, university forgives $2000, I pay $1000)  

4. The GI bill gives a housing/food allowence in relation to the cost of living for whatever area you attend school (ie. $1300 a month in St. Louis. nearly $4000 a month in San Fransico).    

5. My dream scenerio is to be a residiential assistant at whatever school I attend earning me room/board.  Meaning that $1300or$4000 goes from uncle sam directly to my pocket.  

6. I see this as a unique opportunity to live somewhere amazing and new without the comparative financial backlash.    


So, what school would you attend if you have a $70000 scholarship, cost of living were not a factor, (in fact, it could be argued there is an incentive to live in an expensive area) but your family/business opportunity wanted you to attend a school near St. Louis MO?",28Jul2018,1

I'm not sure how to approach this. **Beware incoming wall of text.** 

She has black hair, hazel eyes, a great body and a great personality. All the things I love in a woman. She is 33 years old and I am 24. She has two kids and they both have different fathers. I am trying to figure out if she is taken right now. I want to just straight up ask her if she is single/taken but I don't want to make things awkward at work as we interact at a small office all day. We share a lot of common interests and I find her always laughing and smiling when we talk at work about random things. Hell, she might even be flirting with me and I am too stupid to pick up on it. 

I have been a loner my whole life. An introvert who finds it hard to keep conversations with people, but this girl has been an exception to that. She is outgoing and really brings me out of my shell. I want to start flirting with her. Whether it be at work or via text. However I am not sure how she will react to that. I don't want to make things awkward between us. 

 I am her friend on Snapchat and we occasionally will send funny snaps with emojis/filters. Every snap she takes it seems like she is alone whether it be in her bedroom, kitchen and even the car. I knew she was into comics/superhero movies like Marvel/DC Universe and I asked her if she had seen any of the recent ones. She said that she doesn't have any friends to go with and hasn't got the chance to.

 [Here is a small part of the conversation.](https://i.imgur.com/aUze9eL.png) 

She lists herself as single on Facebook but I do hear her bring up one of the kids fathers names in conversation every so often.

After a week we ended up going to a late showing on a Thursday and it was the first time I had hung out with her outside of work. I could tell that she had more makeup on than usual and she looked great. The whole time it felt like just two friends seeing a movie and nothing like a date or anything like that and I was too chicken to make a move.

She argues with my dad and got a part time job initially to help support the family alongside her full time job, but spends all that money on clothes, shoes, and whatever else she find on Amazon. She’s also seemed to develop some bad eating habits. She started losing weight by eating only vegetables and fruit during lunch and drinking SlimFast in the mornings, she’s lost a lot of weight and I feel like she’s trying to be at the weight of me and my sister whilst not eating enough.

My dad can’t really do much in this matter because she constantly gets mad at him and if you say the smallest thing at her she’ll stop talking and get upset. I feel like she’s selfish and only cares about herself. She buys herself special things at the store, she uses her money to by only herself stuff, and she doesn’t seem to care about the sanity of her family. I’m so sick of it and I tell her to stop when she yells at my dad and I tell her to eat more when I know she’s not eating enough. I don’t know how to deal with it.

Jobs just totally sap the life out of me. I can't even pretend to be happy or even just not miserable. I would rather be dead than working a job I hate just to keep myself alive and having nothing to live for. 


I know everyone probably thinks this, but I know I'm a very capable person. I can multi-task, I handle stress well, and I think I would be a better boss than all of the bosses I've had. I just can't tolerate these shitty jobs designed for robots. If my mind isn't being stimulated in some way, I get incredibly bored and just lose my will to be there. The physical fatigue and boredom clash together and I end up just quitting or hating my life. 


I'm going to college and hopefully I'll have a career I enjoy in 2 years, but until then I can't function like an adult because I absolutely can't tolerate these shitty minimum wage jobs. I hate retail, I don't want to be stocking shelves, and honestly I'd prefer as little manager interference as possible, because I know I'll accomplish anything that's expected of me.

309,"This is leaning more into a ""know"" than a ""think"". 

So there are a few things to preface this with.
* I work in a healthcare role that also requires a lot of office work, as do the coworkers I'll be mentioning.
* There is one woman on our team, we'll call Mary, who has been working there since the building opened 3 years ago. She is so openly abrasive that patients refuse to go to her, people in other departments also refuse to interact with her and she has driven 2 other employees (We'll call them Dave and John respectively) out of the door by targeting them. This woman is not a superior to my position.
* There is a second woman on the team who has seemed to latch herself onto Mary. This woman feeds into and off of Mary's toxicity. This is the same woman who has been openly and viciously transphobic, bad-mouthed a transgender patient to other departments, and has said ""nigger"" in the workplace, on top of bad mouthing everyone else and talking about everyone else behind their backs. She and Mary both are the type of people to smile in your face and then try to ruin your life. We can call her Alice.
* We recently got a new manager who came from the South -- we'll call him Jared. Aside from other departments also having visible and verbal dislike for him (rolling their eyes during meetings, openly saying he's useless, ect), I've noticed he's extremely abrasive with me in a similar fashion that he was with John before John left. 

It's worth mentioning that Jared, Mary and Alice are all white and I am the only black person on the team. John was Jewish. And I never met Dave, so I can't say with any certainty. 

So now to explain the situation a bit more. 

This all started -- or at least I finally made the connection -- about three months ago but apparently it has been brewing for a much longer time. Approximately four months ago is when Jared became our manager and approximately 3 months ago is when Jared began acting hostile towards John, who Mary openly disliked for whatever reason and actually tried to get me to sabotage as well. With John, she pinned him as not completing standard work and got Alice to join in and also wanted me to as well. I never did, but Jared had a falling out with John, where Jared had him backed into a corner, telling him that he never liked him since he stepped foot in the building, that he was awful at his job, ect. Jared had only even been in the building for a month at that point. There were several witnesses to the argument (I wasn't one of them but video was pulled and I saw it) and our boss was very obviously the perpetrator in the situation. Our boss then immediately went to HR and told them that he felt physically threatened by John and gave an entirely different report of what happened to HR. Shortly after, John transferred out to a different department and has been going up the chain in HR to get someone to do something about what happened.

This is pertinent because what's happening to me seems to be a repeat of this type of incident.

I work night shift. My boss works dayshift. About two months ago before my boss left for the night, he casually mentioned that he drinks every night and needs to cut down. Skip to later in that night, I had a question about an unusual circumstance so I messaged him on our company's IM, explaining the situation in one bubble and as I was typing my question he asked me one, so I started answering his questions and didn't get a chance to ask my own because he was responding so quickly. He then asked me to call him, so I did and from there the situation escalated dramatically. My other co-worker was sitting beside me, as was someone from a different department and I had 2 patients who could overhear as well. 

The entire 40 minute conversation was him belittling me, cutting me off every time I tried to speak, telling me I'm a horrible communicator (for not asking my question immediately), at a certain point saying ""Listen to me now"", and ""I know you hate me but you told me my communication is abrasive when you don't even know how to communicate"". In our last one on one meeting, he had asked me for feedback for him, so I told him verbatim that sometimes he gets too abrasive with communication, and he agreed and said that he gets that feedback all the time. So it was a very confusing and frustrating thing for him to throw feedback I'd given him back in my face and couple it with ""I know you hate me"". He gave me the wrong answer to my original question as well, and then when it backfired, threw me under the bus and said it was because I didn't communicate well enough with him that he didn't understand what I meant. 

After that conversation, I went to HR and reported what happened. I had not once said anything disrespectful to him throughout the entire conversation. 

Now skip to a few days ago, I come into work and I'm told I'm having a spontaneous meeting with him and HR. In this meeting he had a two page list of my clerical mistakes and said that other members of the team have been telling him that I'm not completing my standard work. This entire list was very nitpicked -- attaching a file instead if hyperlinking it, missing a time on the paperwork that our patients fill out that we aren't allowed to write on. Very tiny mistakes, and some of them weren't even my mistakes. They were things that dayshift did that I didn't catch and fix. 

We also discussed the phone call and even with HR there, he kept cutting me off and talking over me when it was my turn to give my account of what happened. Then I heard him talking through the wall after I left. He lied to our HR rep and told her that he never said the things he said  and that he gets long emails from Mary and Alice about the issues they have with me. I never work directly with Mary, and one night out of the week I work with Alice. 

This seems to be going in the exact same fashion that it did with John and I've spoken to John about it and he agrees, as do two of my other co-workers who I work with the closest.

On top of those incidents, I've been reprimanded for not attending meetings that I was never told about, my boss always seems to coincidentally forget that we had conversations about any time off I've taken as well and when I had to have surgery earlier in the month I was told: ""This is inconvenient. You need to find your own coverage.""

I've tried discussing my concerns about being targeted with HR but I was written off and told to just start doing my work. I've already started being hyper attentive to detail since that meeting. I just don't know what else I can do. Once Mary gets her sights on someone, she does anything possible to sabotage them. She put it in Jared's mind that John was horrible and I'd be willing to bet she's doing the same with me now. My last resort is to look for a new job but if I have to I will. 

TL;DR: I think my boss is targeting with me, with the help of two of my racist teammates who have also seemed to target 2 other employees in the past. I've tried to talk to HR about it but my concerns were shrugged off. What are my other options?

I also apologize if this was all jumbled. I'm  upset and very worried. Does anyone have any advice?",28Jul2018,1
310,"I am overall a normal person, I used to have major issues with my personality. I had dissociated with various parts and was in turmoil with each of them. I am fully consolidated and centered these days though. Ever since I've stabilized I've started to get the hard to describe feeling, a set of thoughts, and this strange vision. I call it my vision of the eternal when I look at the world all I see is futility in it's highest form. All life under the heavens is but a stray dog, the prettiest of visages is but bleached bones, the highest life is nothing more than exalted dirt. This thought inspires in me a feeling of theatrical invincibility, nothing can faze me and the world becomes a performance for myself. Overall it doesn't affect my daily life, except I have become an incredibly skilled actor. I can portray any emotion perfectly and still keep indifference in my heart. I act chipper and kind to everyone I meet, but when I get home I accept the vision again. Yesterday it leaked out for a second, and a girl that was interested in me saw it. She seemed a little afraid of what she saw, later she told I have incredibly cold eyes. I have been thinking about that, and think that explains this feeling. I am divorced from the world on some level, and to many people that is cold. But to me, it is my greatest enlightenment and the source of my stability and self-confidence.

314,"Firstly I apologise for the length but I honestly feel stuck.

I currently have a nice job well on my way to getting a second job to bring in more income, a girlfriend who adores me and a good hobby to occupy my time that I share with some friends (riding motorbikes), what could be wrong right?

Both myself and my current partner went to the same college but when I met her she was dating someone else, I think the attraction of not being able to have her fuelled my obsession over her. I could never stop thinking about her and always wanted to spend time with her, I worshipped the ground she stood on. Fast forward 8 months we both ended up together and have been for nearly a year now and whenever she calls I put my phone on silent so I can pretend she isn’t there, whenever she’s round at my house I feel like I can’t sympathise with her over anything. 

I thought maybe I should just break it off with her, but whenever I spend longer than a week away from her I want nothing more than to be with her and no one else, and after I’ve seen her I take one step forward and two steps back and end up where I was previously with my mental state.

My current best friend broke up with his ex 7 months ago and still hasn’t been able to cope with the loss, and whenever I’m round him I find it hard to feel sympathetic with him, he’s currently turned to A-Class drugs and alcohol on a regular basis and I just feel so empty about it. 

I think the problem I’m having is I’ve worked hard to get a nice partner, the things I want (clothes, motorbikes, financial freedom) and now I’m just empty...

There is this one girl who’s never even shown the hint of wanting to speak to me that I’m currently so obsessed with, I feel like I need to speak to her, I need her affection and...... I’ve met her twice :I . 

I don’t know why I feel like this about anything, always feeling empty, unable to sympathise with anyone, I cry myself to sleep on a regular basis and sometimes just sit in my room looking at my wall. 

I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to leave my current girlfriend because I don’t believe that I dislike her but I feel like my mental state has fallen off and trying to work against me; my best friend won’t listen to me when I try to get him to stop abusing substances.

We talked for some time and she seemed very nice, then she said that she doesn't know my intentions but she's not interested in having a boyfriend. I said that there's no problem and that i understand and we lost contact for some time. About 3 months later after the final exams she suddenly texted me. To say the least i was surprised. We started texting again and she was showing clear signs of affecion(VERY CLEAR), example? I was away on holiday in spain and when i said i came back she texted that she's happy her crush is finally back. Some time later we met for the first time and it was really nice. But after the meeting she stopped texting and seemed distant, so i texted what's happening and she said she decided she doesn't want to change anything in her life and she didn't know how to tell me, i said that i understand and that i felt the same at the beggining.

He never hit me or abuse me or anything but he would always go for the belt when I misbehaved and would always insult or humilate me when I did something he didn't like.  Like calling me a stupid person or telling me I don't love my mother.  ((She is attually the only family member I love)) Morally wise we differ a good bit.  He will say very racist and terrible things like that all of california deserve there wild fires for letting the mexicans and gays in.  Another thing I dislike about him is that he is very traditional parent where he is always right and that he is the head of the house where my mother is second to him.  A good example of this is my step brother was gonna move out within 2 months as we moved to a new house but instead of doing the resonable thing where to let me have the nicer room first, so that when he moves out he won't have to pay to have more stuff moved upstairs, he says my brother will get the room because he is older.  Now for the only good parts about my dad.  He is rich compare to the rest of the people in the area.  He has used that money to help me get into college and support me in other stuff.

Technically it's almost like a leave of absence but we did not go that route due to difficulty in getting HR approval. My business leader thought it would be easier to rehire me rather than approving my leave of absence which was due to non medical reasons.

335,"* We've lived in our apartment building for 4+ years. The unit next to ours is used by the owners as a medium-term rental unit (minimum one month, but not long-term tenants). It used to be an AirBnB before the HOA cracked down on short-term rentals. 
* People come and go-- travel nurses, military folks, etc. 
* The units are loft-style, with no real separation between rooms besides sliding doors that don't go full floor to ceiling height. 
* It's a very ""adult"" building-- no loud partying, clean/quiet, well-maintained, and not inexpensive. 
* We're the same-- two professional adults in our 30s, keep normal hours, are not loud, don't have subwoofers or other audio equipment that would intrude on our neighbor's quiet enjoyment of their units. 
* We live in the urban core of our city-- there are not really parks/green spaces, playgrounds, or other child-friendly locations nearby.
* About a month ago, some folks moved in with three young kids under 5. 
* The unit setup and lack of kid-friendly services in the neighborhood makes this a tough to understand choice on their part. It's sort of the opposite of a kid-friendly building and neighborhood. 
* I work from home, and the kids scream/cry throughout the day. Full-volume, intense screaming and crying. The only times I don't hear wailing or screaming are when one of the caregivers (not sure if it's a parent or nanny) takes the kids out for an hour or so at a time. 
* I'm on work calls a lot and I can hear the screaming/crying through the walls despite them being made of thick concrete. 
* Some of my colleagues have been able to hear the screaming/crying on Skype/Google Hangout/regular voice calls and have asked about/commented on the noise. I wear Bluetooth headphones for my calls and the microphones are apparently sensitive enough to pick up the screaming/crying. 
* I feel for the person who's dealing with what are clearly upset kids all day, as it seems like it's really unpleasant for them. 
* That said, this particular kind of noise has had a negative effect on me work-wise and has also intruded into our leisure time in the apartment since there is often the same screaming/crying during the evenings/weekends.

336,"So I'll try keeping this brief so this might sound rushed.

I have a great last few weeks with my friend. How we became friends is that we started dating, went long distance and it got ""too casual"" before we got back together. Since then, she's been unsure and just wants to be friends. I want her to be happy, she's has depression troubles that I want to help her with so I have to say yes. Not that I don't want to be her friend, I just still think about her as more than that.

About 8 weeks ago I asked her if we'd ever get another chance. She didn't say no in those exact words but said she just wanted to be friends and would tell me if she felt differently. I trust her, but I don't believe her. In the almost year we've known each other I am always the one to start the talks or make the moves, but now I dont think I can because I don't want to upset her or ruin our friendship.

Basically, all this considered, is there any way I can test her and see her feelings without directly asking and potentially upsetting her? If I was to just take behavioural cues, she acts now the same as she did when she was interested, with one difference. Now we are a lot more comfortable together and I'll even my flying out in three weeks (Oh yeah she's going again) to spend time with her at her moms place whom she'll live with.

So next year I'm heading off to college. I was talking to my father and he asked what I wanted to study. I told him Archaeology. I've been interested in Archaeology ever since I was a little kid . I even read books about the subject ever since I was 13. My father didn't know this about me because we spend a lot of time together.  When I told him he had no idea what archaeology was but he looked it up and all that he knows about it now is that it doesn't pay that very well. He told me that I'm being childish and that I should study something that will make me a lot of money. 

I've talked with others and all of them agreed that I should study a subject that will help me make a good amount of money. One person even told me that if I worked as an archaeologist my children will starve. Obviously an exaggeration, but his point was clear.

An Archaeologist salary is on average 58k a year.  

Should I study Archaeology or something like software engineering which I have no interest in.

345,"There's a lot to this story so I'm going to only give the information that seems currently relevant. I'm also being intentionally vague to protect the privacy of everyone involved.

My older sibling ""A"" and their spouse ""B"" are living in the same house as myself and our parents because of money problems. (I am early 20s, starting to get my life going after delays due to mental health issues.)

A few months ago A's child (""C"", 12) was sexually assaulted by a same-age friend. C already had some depression/etc. (it runs in the family) but that incident of course made it much worse. I've always been close to C (we are only 10 years apart) and I've gone through mental problems of my own, so I'm especially sensitive to their situation. I'm doing the best I can to help, but I'm honestly not fully recovered from my own problems and sometimes I just don't know what to say or how to help. I don't feel comfortable taking on the responsibility mostly on my own.

My mother helps the best she can, but she has a lot of love and not enough knowledge on how to help. I don't blame her, it's a very difficult situation. The problem is that C's parents are just not helping the situation at all. They've always been quick to anger with and always expect the worst from C. I can say ""Yesterday I was with C and-"" and A will cut me off with an exasperated ""What did they do now?""

C has made mistakes, talking to the wrong people and being influenced by bad friends, but I don't believe it warrants that kind of reaction. Besides, they behaved this way even before C did anything wrong. They yell too much and act sarcastic towards C, who of course responds back with an attitude, but wouldn't you do the same? There's only so many times one can get such needless rudeness from their own parents before they get sick of it.

I've gone on too long I think, trying to describe the situation. The point of it all is that as parents, it's their responsibility to take care of their child with love and kindness to the best of their ability. It's also their job to accept when they don't know what to do, and let others help. A and B don't do either of these things, and it's negatively affecting C. I don't know what to do to help without making the situation worse or turning them against me. C is looking to me for guidance and I'm lost. Please help.",28Jul2018,1

347,"Okay here's some general information. I' don't have offline friends and I have bad social anxiety in real life and was socially excluded. I dont have a lot of friends (read: no close friends) offline. Months ago I met someone on a server who quickly I realized I could relate a lot to, and was similar to me in many ways. They became one of my best friends and we would talk nearly every day for hours, even just about trivial things we'd just talk to talk and it was sane.  We mostly used text but also voice and pretty rarely because of the mutual anxiety, but it was still pretty fun. They even attempted to kill themselves and was offline for  along period of time after but came back. 

They eventually found a  spouse and through them became much more active in life, and also started interacting more with other friends at their school and becoming much more social. We still talked almost daily though and it wasn't a problem, I was quite happy. But eventually went on a vacation for two weeks but came back and was active again (and even re0-started the old server). But recently they decided they would only be able to come on for 60 minutes a day, as they were trying to be more productive with their life and hang out with family and friends more, as well as do homework, chores etc. 

They live in a different time zone so it just isn't practical for me to see them, especially around the new time which is afternoon for them but barely into the next day for me, which they will be coming on now. It's just not sustainable for me to wait to see them only for 60 minutes, especially when my school is starting not that long from now.  So I explained this to them last night, and I explained I had to unfriend them and  they were very understanding about the whole situation, I had to as I would be too tempted to try to be awake when they came on which just wasn't practical. They expressed some minor regret to a mutual in private but was still understanding.

I had a dream about this last night, or really this morning, after I went to sleep having unadded and all a few hours before. So my question is how do I get over this?It may have just been a screen connection but they helped me through some di and was always very caring. I know it may sound like this is very peurile or I'm over reacting, but I dont know exactly what to do.

348,"Hello all. I’ve been really struggling with this for a while now and I’m pretty unhappy in my relationship....but I love this guy and really don’t want to let him go. Basically, my fiancé has a brother  and his brother’s girlfriend was mean to me behind his/his brother’s back. It all started when we went to a concert. I wasn’t looking so great and had gained some weight due to medications and she made sure to say that “i looked bad but she 
loved me anyway”.  (Her exact words) Classic high school catty bull. I had also just been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was struggling with this diagnosis. 

She is extremely fake nice when they’re around and gives ridiculous amounts of compliments, but when they’re not around she hints that I need to lose weight and says things like I wear too much makeup etc. I get it. I’m not thin. I’ve made it known that I’ve been trying to lose weight and she’s always using it against me every chance she gets. She barely talks to me as is and tries to make it look like she does by saying we should hang out but never asks me and whenever I ask her she is always busy. 

So I decided I just did not want to be around her toxicity. I’m trying to better myself and be positive and she just brings me down no matter how hard I try. Problem is, my boyfriend still loves his brother, who is really a great guy. I want them to have a relationship but it’s hard when I am uncomfortable around her and basically feel abandoned when he leaves me to go hang out. We moved to a new area where we barely know anyone except them and it’s been rough. I was hoping she would be nicer and we could really be friends but that didn’t happen. The longer I have lived here and tried and failed to be her friend, the more I realized how much it was stressing me out.

I love this man. But I have no idea how we can be in a healthy relationship when I want to avoid someone he cares about deeply simply because of his girlfriend. I’ve tried just letting go and being around her but it’s too much. I don’t have the best self esteem and would just rather not be around her. She makes me feel so awkward by fake complimenting me and then trashing me indirectly.  We all used to be sorta cool and hang out when she randomly just started being cruel. Talking to her is an option but I have no idea if it would make a difference. She has shown that she is pretty unempathetic when it comes to others feelings. (Ex. When  her boyfriend was depressed and anxious she said he should just get over it. Also, when my friend came to visit and had anxiety she was extremely rude to her.) I don’t know what to do. It’s consuming me no matter how hard I try to just let it go. I have tried to end things but he tells me I don’t have to be friends with her and our relationship shouldn’t end bc she was mean to me.

I’m constantly afraid he’s just going to abandon me bc its easier. I feel so alone. His brother has no idea what happened and is always asking us to come hang out. He was constantly asking my fiancé where I was bc I was not coming over to gag when he did so I had to deflect him by saying I have been acting off bc I was homesick. That backfired and has just made him ask us to hang out more bc he thinks I’m depressed. My fiancé refuses to tell him what’s actually going on bc he doesn’t want to ruin their relationship. I’m at a loss.


TLDR:  I don’t like my fiancé’s brother’s girlfriend because she has been less than kind to me. I love my fiancé but I’m unhappy because of the constant pressure to be around her. I don’t know what to do. ",28Jul2018,1

350,"Warning long post (pls read though I need help)

So some back story, my parents owned and operated a small business together for a number of years. They went to work together and worked in desks right next to one another for as long as I can remember. 

Long story short they were with each other 24/7, literally.  In 2012 my father fell ill and passed away, this took a toll on everyone especially and understandably my mother. 

After my father passed away my mom slowly got worse and worse she was always a little difficult and hard headed she began to become more abrasive and less motivated to do anything, period. 

She has since stopped working completely and refuses to do anything to the point where she no longer uses the restroom the only thing she does is scroll on Facebook on her computer. She stopped taking my little brother to school (which I began doing) and will frequently go weeks without leaving the house and days without eating. 

Although I am leaving for university soon I’m worried about her and my little brother and she doesn’t exactly make my transition to university easy. As a few examples she “forgot” to pay my final bill for dual credit courses I took in high school and then lied to me about calling the college to pay the bill until I paid it myself. She didn’t show up to my university orientation after assuring me she would. She refuses to give me the title to the vehicle I PURCHASED from my older brother (the title was kept in the safe when my brother bought the vehicle when he was in high school) among other things 

When I ask friends and family for advice I always get the same “well she’s depressed” “you just have to wait for her to get over it” and while I understand she must have serious mental health issues for her sake and my little brother sake something must be done. I don’t know if I should yell at her or straight up confront her? My siblings (who are all significantly older than me) seem to think it’s fine just to forget about it and hope she get better magically although I suppose they don’t understand the severity of the situation as none of them have lived at our childhood home for quite a long time. 

Please any advice would be wonderful thank you all!

351,"I (22 male) have been involved with the BDSM community. After becoming an adult and moving away for college, I became more involved in the community, attending events and learning more. I have never told anyone outside of the BDSM community of my involvement - not friends, family, or even neutral parties. However, I don’t know that I can continue living two separate lives without ever opening up. 

I have what I would call an addiction to porn and BDSM. I couldn’t go an entire day without thinking about them. But I’m not entirely certain that this is a problem with me. It might just be a part of who I am as a person.

On the weekends, I have to choose to go to BDSM events, and hide them from my non-BDSM friends, or to hang out with my non-BDSM friends and do vanilla activities. I enjoy both. I worry often that my involvement in the community takes time away from other things, like my friends and my job, and might even be hurting my non-BDSM relationships.

What should I do? I fear that opening up could hurt me, specifically at work. But not ever opening up leaves me to live a double life where I’ll never be happy and always be on a fence between two worlds.

This is also not your normal scenario about being in your parents house so I'll be vague and try to not take up too much time on the details.

I (then 25m) lived with my older brother and mother in my mom's house. She made a mistake and got in some trouble and last year she went to prison. For the past year it's been me (28m) and my older brother living in my mom's house because it's paid for and it's my family home. My mom was a collector i guess. It wasn't hoarding because it isn't trash or anything nasty. Just junk. She didn't like to throw things away so this house has a lot of clutter. I work a lot but I've been trying declutter it as much as I can. My brother hates cleaning and doesn't hardly do anything around here to help. (Yes I've talked to him about it before but it just ended up in an arguement and he done stuff for like 2 weeks after, then quit again. He works and we split the bills.) We turned my old bedroom into a room for my nephew for he comes and stays so I moved into my mom's bedroom.

Anyway that's the details. I've finally got to a point where I'm trying to improve myself and I'm now talking to a girl. I would eventually like to invite her to my house sometimes to watch movies hang out or whatever. But if things escalate and sexy time begins to happen, I don't know what to do. I'm NOT doing it in my mother's bedroom. Disgusting. I've thought about checking into a cheap house for myself somewhere but I currently am paying off credit card debt. My moms credit was bad. Mine was good. She was on disability at the time and so we put groceries and stuff on my credit cards and she would pay the bills out of her monthly check. I couldn't work at the time because she was in somewhat bad health so I stayed with her.

We talk for a week or two, and then she says how she hates life, how she wants to kill herself, how everything sucks and how emotionally exhausted she is. I mean, it's okay. I'm trying to help, sometimes it works, sometimes not. I'm not apathetic and I won't leave a girl only because of that. But it destroys me, imagine that you are surrounded by suicidal people all your life. I don't have depression, I've had social anxiety before, but I'm over it right now. It sucks. They made me feel exhausted, bored and sad all the time, even if I liked or even more - loved them. I was single for a year now, when I broke up with a girl, who also had depression after a year of sadness. I did it, because she didn't want to work on herself. I did everything, I was going with her to a psychiatrist, I was someone that she could trust and love, etc. etc. But she didn't do shit about herself, she just did everything to make her feel worse. (after a broke up she looked way happier, so I don't know if she wasnt faking her depression) Last night, I've met a girl that was gorgeous af, and we started talking. Today, she started talking about her daddy issues and her suicidal tendentions. Oh fuck me. I'm probably going to help her for a while (or longer, I won't leave her alone, that's for sure) but it got me wondering - why am I so special that so many suicidal people like me? Why do they want ME to help them? I'm not the most open person, but I like to help others. Although, it's not something that can be seen on a first glance. I'm curious, angry and exhausted.

I asked my boyfriend to speak to him about it but he says this guy has been like this since they first met and he only ever spoke to him about it once.

Apparently his flatmate got really pissed off at him and now my boyfriend is wary of bringing it up to him again. I would say something myself but since I don't pay rent in the flat (I have offered to pay many times and I pay a third of the bills but my boyfriend said he doesn't want to accept more cash from me while I'm still a student) I don't know if it's really my place to say anything?

361,"i don't watch porn too often (maybe once a month?), but 2 days ago i was watching videos on my tablet from pornhub (i don't usually use this site) late at night. lots of ads always pop up, so i try to close them quickly.  
Yesterday, i noticed i received an email which said:  
""thank you for using ccbill... we are unable to process your transaction at this time, due to banking system error""  
and some order details which included the website (seductive snaps), purcharse name (my email does not contain my real name tho... let's say my email is brownbear999@email com, the purchaser name was Brown Bear, seems that the website found my email and automatically generated an user based on the email name) and order amount ($30USD for 30days, then $25USD every 30 days)  
First, i don't know how did they get my email (i was using the browser in private mode) but maybe i clicked on one of the pop ups without noticing? that's the only reason i can come up with. i wasn't too worried about them taking money from me since i don't have a credit card or paypal account, so i blocked the email and marked it as spam  


But then i googled ccbill and they do work with adult websites, so i started worrying again. Can they still demand me to pay? should i contact the website? (i don't like this idea, if i accidentaly subscribed just by touching an ad, they must be sketchy) or contact ccbill customer service?

362,"I've been married to my wife for a year, and I'm not sure if we should keep doing this.

We argue. Perhaps, once a month we'll have a full blown argument. This is also interspersed with little frustrated back and forths, but the full blown arguments are when we both shout at each other.

The context of the argument is usually always different, but it'll always stem from her doing something which offends me (such as telling me off in front of our friends), me confronting her about it, her telling me that didn't happen, then me shouting at her, then her shouting at me, telling me I was nasty to her for no reason.

After some time, I will always (every time) calm down, maturely apologise for my actions, and explain my frustration. She will, always, tell me I was wrong. I then disregard this, and just make up and move on.

This last argument followed the same course. I had enough. I sat down with her and had a long conversation about how we both have faults, how we both misinterpret things, and how we are both insecure and it manifests in our actions. She disregarded all of this, and told me I was wrong and that I should just stop being nasty to her.

We both deeply love each other, but I feel like she doesn't want to work at our relationship, or she doesn't feel like she needs to change or improve, despite the fact that I try my best to do so. I do not know what do when she does something which is quite rude, and completely forgets she does so.

The reason why we don't have as much sex anymore is because we're both very busy and stress about our lives as we grow up. I can deal with stress much better than she can.

Anyway in the evening we decided to watch a movie and started flirting a little. That’s a normal thing for us though, we often flirt casually, but I always make clear that I‘m not serious and have no romantic interest in him. 
When we decided to go to sleep, he started talking about how he made out with another girl and I don’t know what happened really but we ended up making out. Rather he made out with me and I just kinda let it happen, just lay there, I felt absolutely nothing. I was pretty tired and really did not care. While we made out I told him just that. He then proceeded to tell me I was so lucky he was a nice guy and if he wasn’t he could technically rape me. This unsettled me a little now, but at this point i didn’t think straight. He just told me to let go and then asked me if I wanted to have sex with him. I firmly told  him no and he somewhat accepted it, I also told him that I didn’t want him touching me in certain areas. We fell asleep sometime later.
So for the record I’m a light sleeper and usually don’t sleep well in places I don’t know, however I act as if I’m asleep as to not disturb the other person. The same happened that night and I am kinda glad I wasn’t unconscious. In the early morning hours of the morning I awoke and lay awake for a while when I noticed him touching my back. I felt super disrespected because I stated earlier that I wanted to be left alone while I slept. Still I lay still, I wanted to see how far he‘d go. He then touched my butt and my boobs and after a few seconds he started slipping a hand in my pyjama shorts. That was it for me, I pushed him away and told him to get off. He told me to chill and we went back to sleep, I never fell asleep fully. In the morning he cuddled me. I was very dismissive, hoping he‘d get the hint. We got up and I went home.
He texted me implying that he‘d be looking forward to the next time. To me it was pretty much clear that there won’t be a next time. Now I‘ll have to tell him somehow, I have to be nice though because I don’t want him telling anybody about that night, furthermore we have a lot common friends so I‘ll have to see him in school still. Do you have any tips at how to let him down nicely? How do I keep my distance while not making him mad so he’ll tell anyone at school?

I hate arguing with them because they’re my best friend so during the argument I decided I would swallow my pride and say anything just to stop arguing, but I ended saying things I didn’t believe and agreeing with him and saying sorry even though the fight wasn’t even about anything I actually did.

Then after the fight I kept dwelling on it and picking apart the things he said and the way he acted.

381,"Hello,  


(28M) I've been feeling down lately so I thought maybe I can get some opinions here. I'll try to keep this short but there's a few things on my mind lately.

1.  
I started a masters degree in computer science recently and I honestly don't have any idea what I'm going to do after. First a little back story. I got into computer science after an initial career change. I worked in accounting and hated it. Took a chance on studying computer science while I was working and I loved the programming aspect of it. I didn't really have time to work on programming projects outside of those required for school. Eventually I got a job in small company that does some financial software. Honestly I can't say that I enjoyed it at all even though I was doing programming. It was mainly just bug fixes (a whole lot of bug fixes). Somehow I never felt comfortable or confident in my ability to do the job even though my employers never complained. The financial stuff was really boring too. Eventually I decided I wanted to learn a bit more so here I am in my post grad degree. Everyone seems so much smarter and more experienced. They all have impressive software projects to show off. I feel like an idiot there. Somehow I'm hanging in there but I honestly have no idea where to go after. I've been exposed to so many technologies, programming languages, frameworks where do I begin if I want to have a career as a programmer/developer. What do I focus on. When I look at jobs descriptions online they all want some 5+ years experience in some different development environment. I feel like I messed up by choosing this field. There's so much to learn, I have no clue what to focus on. I'm interested in everything but I always doubt my ability to do any of it. Could someone maybe suggest a path I can follow?  


**TL;DR version: Had a career change from accounting to programming. Doing computer science at post-grad level. Feel like an idiot. I don't really know what path to follow after. Too many different paths to take, no idea what direction to go in. What to do?**  


2.  
I haven't been talking to my friends lately. I feel like I need to move on but I'm  not sure.

I don't have much of a social life and I'm extremely introverted. The few friends I do have are friends from since high school. Problem is these guys are a lot like me, mostly gamers. I chat and game online with  these  people regularly but over the last few months I've just not been feeling to talk to them anymore. We always talk about games, anime etc. But I just don't feel talking about that stuff anymore. Its been feeling really pointless and empty to have these conversations. Making new friends is really hard for me and I've been feeling extra isolated since I've stopped chatting with my friends. Don't get me wrong, being alone is nice, but sometimes its too much. They have asked what's going on with me but I just tell them I'm really busy. **Should I explain to them how I feel  or is it better to not say anything and keep using the I've been busy excuse?**  


Sorry for the long read.",28Jul2018,1
382,"My boyfriend (26) and I (21f) have been together for two years. Six months into us dating his little sister passed away in a car crash and for six months I watched him cry every single day, he stopped going to the gym, sex went downhill, etc.

So its been a year and a half and he still doesn’t go to the gym, which I feel has led to a lack of energy and now we only havesex once every 1-2 weeks almost because he says he is tired. (He works a very physically demanding job as well.) he no longer cries about his sister very often but he is depressed. 

I feel like I sacrificed a lot for him. I don’t have too many friends anymore. When his sister passed away I spent every single night with him so he wouldn’t be alone. So now I don’t have people to really hang out with anymore because I spend all my tome with him. He likes to play video games a lot so most of the time I come over at night and he will ignore me for a few hours to play his games. We rarely ever go out. If we do, it’s never like an actual date. He won’t go out of his way to make plans, I always have to be the one to pick the place and it’s usually last minute. 

Lately I have really been into snakes and reptiles and since I don’t have someone to talk about them with I always talk to my boyfriend about them. I think they’re so interesting that I would like to go to school to study Herpetology so I can learn more about them. Recently my boyfriend asked me if we could stop talking about snakes for awhile because he says it’s getting annoying. Even though he goes on and on about stupid cars and motorcycles and makes me watch stupid videos of people crashing their cars. Sometimes I get annoyed by it but I know he thinks it’s cool so I watch them anyways. 

I don’t really know what to do. I think the main problem is that I can’t narrow down what’s bothering me in our relationship to really bring it up because there’s so much stuff. Idk if I should let him go or try to talk it out. I’ve never even broken up with anyone. I don’t even know how to do that. 

Another thing that I feel is stopping me is that he is in general a very honest and kind person. I know he is very loyal to me and I know he loves me... that is what is making this so hard. I think I love him. I just have been so upset with our relationship lately that I guess I’m not sure. I feel like he is unsupportive of me. I am in nursing school and halfway done with it. I don’t want to be a nurse. I only started the program to make my family happy. Now that I have found what really interests me I want to pursue that. He basically told me he will break up with me if I quit nursing school because he doesn’t think studying Herpetology will make enough money. Which he is probably right, but still, if I hate it nursing, then why would it matter if I finished the program or not? Not like I’m gonna go out of my way to get a job anyways.

I just need advice. Has anyone else been in this situation? What did you do?",28Jul2018,1
383,"I am a male, 23 years old currently living with my father. I'm working full time right now and other than that, I hang out with one or two people every now and then and that is pretty much all I do. Up until this point, my life has moved along the way anyone else's would. I have had relationships and friendships come and go, saved up a little money, gone to concerts, traveled a little bit. Right now I have no idea what to do with my life. I can feel myself getting older and older with every day I spend staring at my phone. I desperately want my own place to live away from my father, and I have the savings to move practically anywhere I want to. My biggest dilemma is the fact that I am adamant about living alone because I have never liked the idea of relying on roommates to help pay rent. I also enjoy being alone, naturally as I am a very introverted person. 

Creating things is what I love to do. Music being the biggest thing, and then painting and other visual art forms coming after that. I would like to be in an area where I feel at home which has an artistic community, but every time I learn of an area that might be fitting for me, I learn that the cost of living there is out of my reach. 

I have an urge to just get up and move somewhere, as I've been stagnant living with my Dad the past few years without doing much of anything at all.

Throwaway because my real account has too much info on it.

Four years ago I was a member of my university's marching band. It was ran as a student club with about 30 or so kids in it at any given time, and had no secure avenue of funding. A handful of students and I formed a petition to put a referendum question on our school's election ballot to add $0.50 to every undergraduate student's tuition to fund the band, and it past by a very large margin. This was when the band was very small, struggling, and not very prominent on campus.

Flash forward three years, I finished my music degree and started my second degree in education. When the referendum was successful years ago, the band was moved under our school's athletics department, giving it ""adult"" supervision after being a club for decades. I was hired as the director back in 2016. Since then, the band has grown to 70 kids (small-time for U.S. bands, but big for Canada, making us the largest college marching band in the country and one of the largest marching bands as a whole), the band is popular and better known on campus, and the future is looking bright. The only hitch in here is that we've significantly outgrown our budget to the point where the current size of the band, let alone a larger band, is unsustainable. Our instruments our 40 years old and in poor condition, we struggle to purchase basic equipment, etc. etc. As well, when I graduate, I can no longer be paid by the school (through a subsidized program) and have to be paid directly from the band's tiny budget. The budget can't handle what I was being paid ($4,200 salary for the whole year, including winter pep band and writing all the music), let alone have room to talk about a raise, which I need since I won't be a student eating ramen anymore (ideally). For context, in the U.S. college band directors are paid anywhere from $30k-$65k+.

The easiest way to increase the budget is to go to referendum again, and given the popularity of the band, it's expected to be a sure thing. It doesn't affect anyones budgets, and painlessly tenfolds ours - the only problem is the Athletics Department faculty that handle the bands finances don't want the band to pursue this avenue of revenue, but instead resort to me fundraising. They also don't share the same (ambitious) vision I have for the band, and aren't yet willing to let it expand. Fundrasing: 1) wouldn't raise a fifth of what's needed for the band to operate fully and 2) is unacceptable to add to my workload on top of my current responsibilities.

One more kicker. Once I'm done school, I have no reason to stay in the city where the school is unless I am still working for the band. If I leave the band, there is no one willing or able to run the band and it will devolve back into mediocrity.

Needless to say, I have a lot of bargaining power, but I'd like to do it in a manner that's professional as possible. I potentially have the power to end the marching band (since the members have expressed a willingness to walk away in solidarity as a bargaining tool), but I don't want to go into negotiating by throwing ultimatums around and souring things. Does anyone have any experience with bargaining and contract negotiations that can help in my situation?

TL:DR; I built band big, band and I need money, I can leave and destroy the band or stay and grow the band. I need to negotiate a better contract for both band and I.",28Jul2018,3
392,"My wife and I are moving across the country and told our roommate we bought plane tickets for 3 weeks from now -- we forgot to tell roomie even though we bought them after her boyfriend tried to climb in our bedroom window at 3AM a couple weeks back.

Roomie reacted by yelling repeatedly that we can't legally leave with less than a months notice, and her logical reaction is to kick us out for the 1st, in less than a week. The next day, she asked me about 9 times if I wanted to physically fight her, complained loudly to her dogs about me thinking I'm logical but really being...a hypocrite I guess? She fabricated a few stories about me yelling at her...which never happened.

After she threatened to kick us out because we called her out on making a racist comment a couple months ago, I haven't confronted her about anything, including her locking her pet rat in our room and forcing us to find and catch it. 

Anyway, based on the threats of physical violence, the fact I'm not on a lease, and we're moving too far to appear in court, I'm assuming there is 0 chance of my security deposit coming back to me. I can't decide if I should let my resentment get to me and free her pet rat (its sibling died of neglect and it does not have a happy life) once we leave. I am also considering hiding food somewhere where it can get moldy because she rarely cleans and it always smells like mold anyway.",28Jul2018,0
393,"This summer has been a drag so far. I’ve gone to six flags with some friends about three times, but that’s it.

I always see people on Instagram going to concerts and festivals with all their friends and whatnot and looking like they are living a dream.

This whole summer I’ve been working my ass off at two jobs. I have one close friend and that’s it, but he flakes on plans half the time.

I’m transferring to a new university next semester so hopefully that’ll help; I’ve only had one solid group of friends and that was my freshman year of college. It was seven of us but two transferred because they didn’t like the school, one dropped out, and the other three don’t talk because one was my ex-girlfriend who fucked another person over in the group and that ended it completely. 

I work out regularly and have a healthy lifestyle but can’t find love or friends. I want to be living but I feel restricted.

Is 21 young? I feel like 25 is the age where I’m really fucked if I’m still feeling this way but I’m not sure. Has anyone felt like this?

394,"Hello all, 

I've been hesitant to post on here. I usually hate sharing my problems with others and asking for help but this is too much imo.

I'm sorry for any grammatical or spelling errors in this post, I wrote this in a Stream of consciousness kinda format.

I'm 21m in college out of state and i returned home for the summer after 3yrs of school. I study mechanical engineering and have a very difficult curriculum. I came back home because I couldn't get an internship at the company I applied due to me dropping a failing class that i needed. I returned home because I have had bad experiences taking any class over the summer at this university. My mother and I don't get along very well because we are very different people, she grew up in a Hispanic culture and then moved to the US and I grew up in the US culture, she is very religious while I am not (you can say I'm atheist) we disagree on a plethora of other topics. My parents are divorced and my father moved out they both had issues and both made mistakes 

Our issue is that my mother wants to be included in everything i do in my life, no privacy, no personal anything, none of that. She wants to know everything that is going in my life every minute every day and try to give me advice on anything im studying or working on. I do not like including many people in my life, i like to be alone and be able to work on things on my own ( I read Deep Work by Cal Newport over a year ago and and have been implementing the lessons taught in my workflow since I was constantly working distracted you can also say I'm introverted too) and by myself (If the job permits). I tried explaining that I do not like it when she tries to include herself in every single aspect of my life, I am willing to let her be part of my life but it has become so overbearing that I can't take it anymore. Every time i try to explain things I always get told that everyone on the planet does this and don't have a problem with it, or I'm weird and i should just accept it, or \*insert religious reason here\* or in most cases, she thinks that I think that she is at fault for the divorce and i hate her (which is not true, the divorce was both of their faults imo) and i am like my father or i just hate her. I showed her that most of my friends don't have their parents as involved in their lives as she wants (idk about a majority of the population) and i explained to her that i think they were both at fault for the divorce. I also try on multiple occasions to explain that i'm out here trying to be self-reliant and get my own education and build my own career and make my own income. I would like to have her as part of my life but she just steps way over the line, every time I'm studying something here or doing some physical activity she tries to appoint her own agenda it seems. Its always ""no do it this way."" 

What can i do or say to stop this overbearing-ness? I get that she wants to make sure I'm okay but I'm extremely responsible and capable. Have I done anything wrong? 

Thank you,
