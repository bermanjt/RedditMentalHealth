0,"My living situation is thus: I live with one uncle (Jim) and my family. My mom, stepdad, and 2 little sisters. My other uncle (Richard) and his daughter started living with us about a year ago, and at first, he was okay, but over time he has become shittier and shittier. Making openly homophobic comments to my sister and her fiance, verbally abusive to his daughter (she is interested in girls and doesn't know how to tell him) and openly hitting his dog. Constantly berating my little sisters and only ever has negative things to say about anything happening. It's really dragging down the mood of the whole house. 

When confronted about being a piece of shit, he gets really angry and screams about everything that the person confronting them does wrong, and then tells us to do something about it, trying to goad us into hitting him so he can call the cops on us... 

How can I fix this without the authorities getting involved?",09Apr2018,0

2,"I have always looked up to my older brother for advice with everything in my life. He lives on the other side of the city by himself and lately he had been becoming distant and withdrawn but I assumed that he was just busy and honestly I didn’t think too much about it because I was busy trying to finish school. 

A week ago, I thought I’d surprise him by showing up at his house since it had been a while since I’d seen him. I had just talked to him the night before so he was on my mind all day. When I opened the door to his place, I almost got this ominous feeling. 

When I walked into his living room, he was on the couch surrounded by empty pill bottles. I ran up to him and shook him but he wasn’t moving so I called 911. 

Paramedics arrived and almost had to physically restrain me because I was freaking out so bad. I rode with them to the hospital. 

They pumped his stomach and he finally woke up a few hours later. The hospital said if I had not gotten there when I did that he either would’ve died or had serious damage to his body. 

They released him on the condition that he stay with me for two weeks and he attend therapy. 

I tried talking to him on the way home but he wouldn’t say anything and just stared out the window. I’ve never seen him like this, he was always a rock and positive. 

He’s spent the last couple days recovering at my place and sleeping most of the day. I tried to get him to do things with me just to do normal things we used to do but he won’t. 

I’m really worried for him. I can’t be home all day and I’m scared I’m going to come home one day and find him half dead again. I want to help but I’m afraid I’ll overwhelm him and make everything worse. 

How should I go about this?

It's currently still on the porch because I'm still processing it and am not exactly sure what to do.

9,"Last week I was visiting a city a few hours away from mine for work. I met a woman on tinder and we agreed very early on neither of us was interested in anything serious. We talked a lot lol week and found out we had a lot in common. When we met for our night that was supposed to be full of sex we talked a lot more than I expected and we both had a great time. 
We planned to get breakfast the morning I was leaving because she said she didn’t expect an emotional connection like we had and she wanted to spend more time with me. I told her I wanted as much time as I could get with her and she was flattered and thought it was sweet. Her friend ended up needing help so she had to cancel. 
We have still messaged the last few days but it’s definitely less frequent. But it’s also the weekend so she could be genuinely a lot more busy bc when she does message the tone seems the same. 
How do I handle this situation? I’m very interested even though I didn’t think I wanted a relationship. I’m not sure if she feels the same on that front but we are supposed to see each other when I’m in town again in 3 weeks. Any POV is appreciated. ",09Apr2018,1

12,"Hi, guys, this probably isn't the best place for asking but I'm left with no choice. And I don't wanna ask my parents or anyone else, I feel that it's inappropriate.

Anyway, with that out of the way, I just turned twenty-five and have been using cannabis for over a year now. Went from smoking occasionally to every night with my girlfriend after I get home from work. I have a stable job (In fact, I'm extremely important to my company, I'm technically a boss). I've never had problems with cannabis. I've been bullied to hell but I left all of that behind after leaving school. I moved away from my hometown to a beautiful apartment and started a new life, which is going amazing. But I'm worried for my health after hearing news regarding my little brother.

He is twenty-one and as far as I know, he's been smoking weed for at least a year. Occasional use to everyday like me. I barely ever see him but when I do, he's quite difficult to talk to whereas I'm the opposite. My parents have been telling me that he's been locking himself in his room all the time, doesn't talk much, and I found out on his Reddit that he's been having suicidal thoughts. I haven't confronted him about it yet but even my friends (who still live in my old town) have seen my brother in public and he always looks around and acts self-conscuous. Apparently, brother started staring at my friend and when my friend said ""Hi"", he looked away really strangely and signalled his head to say hi back.

Last night though had me really worried for him and myself. Apparently, he went to someone's party, had a few drinks and had a breakdown. One of his friends came to council him - so to speak - and my brother started slapping his head and palm and said he couldn't hear his friend over ""the other voices"", and he apparently was beginning to cry. His friend and me are the only people who know about that incident (everyone at the party just assumed it was too much alcohol).

The thing is though, he's had a different and less sociable life than me. I've been bullied but I had friends, and he's been around shitty people he had to burn bridges with and he's never had a girlfriend in his life. I'm just worried I might develop some mental illness if I continue smoking weed. Now, I know some people on here will say weed is irrelevant to his problem - but it's surely brought out a pre-existing problem sooner - so what should I do?

Mental illness does not run in my family. He seems to be the only one suffering quite severely. I'm worried he's got psychosis and it could pass on to me? Is this likely if I'm currently happy and experience no issues at the moment?",09Apr2018,1
13,"My grandma cannot walk without having to hold her pants up, her face is extremely skeletal (temporal wasting), and her fingers are unable to bend because her arthritis is so incredibly bad. She does not eat unless my mother brings things over and refuses to eat the food I cook for her, or take my advice. My grampa gets her to eat, but only when she is feeling charitable towards him and after much coaxing. The doctor ( who she hasn't seen since October of last year) told her that she has small blood clots scattered throughout her vascular system and that they could go away if she eats properly, exercises, stops smoking or cuts down on it, drinks enough water, and takes her medications. She has done none of this stuff and it has been a year and a half. She does the bare minimum. It hurts, and makes me angry to see her let herself waste away, and she fucking insists that nothing is wrong with her. If I try to approach the situation casually and suggest things, ask questions, try to reason with her ect she becomes extremely agressive, often calling me names, threatening me with homelessnes, telling me that after I move to LA I will never be allowed back to see her, calling me a bastard, a son of a bitch, or other such things. I live with her and try to take care of her and have to see this. She is skeletal and it disturbs me. She has thrown water in my face, kicked me, slapped me, and belittled me when I've tried to help her. She doesn't do this to my mother or grandfather, and if I tell her to do something that her doctor told her to do, she yells at me, and tells me I don't have the right to tell her what to do. Soemtimes she will says she will do better for me and when I ask when she says ""I'll do it tomorrow"". But tomorrow always comes and she never does anything! What the fuck am I suppose to do? How can I get her to to doctor? I'm not one to result to such practices, but if I have to I will pull the strings using underhanded methods to get her to the doctor.

15,"All my life, I’ve found and based much of my happiness on my interactions with others. I’m a female in my early 20’s. 

I grew up in a different, more social country than I am in now. I had good friends growing up including 2 best friends who I had to leave in my original country when I moved here. 

Throughout college, I lost my faith and because of those changes in my life, lost a good friend of 3 years that I had. I was involved in another friendship that I lost because of this reason. The crazy part is, these people started off good, but slowly revealed themselves over time. There was no way to tell how they’d turn out. I also got involved with a few not so great guys. Whatever, mistakes were made and learned from. 

In college, despite my difficulties, I tried to be as social a person possible. I won’t lie; my loss of religion did cause me to isolate myself from others, but I did regain that social aspect back at the end of my college career as I do enjoy interacting with others. 

Anyway, I’m out of college now. I have managed to make one new friend who I see sometimes. I’m waiting on one of my colleges friends to finish her studies so we can interact properly again. However, my attempts at getting into other friendships and relationships have failed for reasons I cannot control. I know I can’t control the actions of others but I can’t hide or take the pain anymore. I crave positive and affectionate interactions with others and I’m just not getting that from people. Not that I have changed, I go out and try to put myself out there but most times people don’t seem to interact really positively (get flaked on by people I want to truly be friends with) and I just get negative attention from men. So I don’t know what to do anymore.

I’ve never had a relationship either so that feels pretty bad as it’s all I really want- to have that constant companionship with someone, a life partner. I don’t know if it’s the city I live in (pretty cold and depressing) or what, but I don’t know how to live anymore. Maybe I have lost purpose and motivation but there’s not much I can do with my life without risking my “family image” and being outed by my family for living an irreligious life. I used to have dreams but I don’t anymore, I can’t really pursue what I love (artsy things) because of those reasons plus what I love doesn’t make a living. I also have a sibling, who thinks I live too hedonistic of a lifestyle- is this a bad thing? I don’t know if it is out of jealousy she says this due to her conservative lifestyle, and I do my best to be a good person everyday...but I don’t see what’s wrong with it. I don’t want to pursue more education.  

TL;DR: I want more friends and healthy interactions and relations with others and I don’t have that and it’s killing me everyday. My best friends aren’t nearby. It’s hard to make friends here, I was happier back home but that’s because I was dependant on my former religion.",09Apr2018,2

21,"So, for the past week we've noticed in our duplex that we're renting out until we move, that water has been seeping through the floors and walls of the residence. We noted that it floods severely in the master bathroom. We got a plumber called in today morning, but he failed to do anything as he would need to break open into the walls of the house to do anything about the flooding. Problem is that we don't own the duplex, again, we're renting it, we can't grant him that ability. So now we can't use the shower nor barely use the toilet. We've contacted the landlord several times with failure to yield any results, even leaving two voice mails I believe. My mom plans to drive to them tomorrow [Monday] I think. I don't know all the details, especially with contacting the whole landlord situation.

Currently we have the pipe shut in the garage so water wouldn't pass through. This renders every sink, toilet, and shower/bathtub unusable. We have to now use buckets of water to push our deposits down through the toilet. This is godawful for me since I have Crohn's, an increased need of toilet usage is the result.

The flooding must've gotten worse just now though, my mom woke up (She works at night) to brush her teeth. In the time she brushed her teeth with the water system on, it flooded the bathroom where she filled up a whole bucket of water (Picture below) while cleaning the floor.

What can we do? We're unable to last long with water.

22,"I recently was Catfished by my own best friend. For those that have never heard the term, it’s where someone pretends to be someone they aren’t online in order to fool someone and they can do this by having fake profiles, post pictures that are not them, lie about their age, etc. 

I have used the internet for dating for many years and have had multiple regular relationships that began by meeting them online so the concept is very familiar to me and have never had any big issues. Recently I was communicating with a guy for about 6 months that I met on a dating site and we communicated mainly by texting and emailing because that’s what I am comfortable with while getting to know someone new. We never spoke on the phone and that wasn’t a big deal to me because I HATE talking on the phone and I had recently come out of a serious relationship and wasn’t ready to get to the point of meeting him in person or getting too serious or involved quite yet. We exchanged many pictures and he seemed way more into me than I was into him and wanted to meet me from the beginning but I was a lot more hesitant to do so.

As the months went on, the friendship/relationship grew and I was surprised at how much he always wanted to talk and the attention was very flattering and I grew very comfortable talking to him and our conversations were deep and personal and even got sexual in nature. We shared a lot of our life and secrets and I grew to really trust this guy and he was there for me as I was going through things like my father passing away and supported me as my relationship with my sisters grew estranged and my friendship with my best friend of 25 years was falling apart. I was sharing a lot of things about this said best friend because she was treating me like shit and wasn’t there for me as I was grieving my father and hurt over my relationship with my sister fell apart. My sister even got married during this time and I went from being her maid of honor to not even being invited and I could not figure out why she was so upset with me. 

This guy said his name was “Johnny” and after awhile he kept pushing me to try to do all these mean things to my sister and best friend and talked constantly about how I should have sex with my best friend’s husband and would NOT let up on the subject. I grew increasingly upset because it was all he would talk about. After a few months he then said that he was in fact my best friend’s husband and had always had a thing for me and was trying to get me to meet up with him so we could have sex in secret. I didn’t believe him and just figured he was looking at my Facebook and Instagram and was using what he could see on their to get more info on me. I even revealed this to my best friend and she instantly said that he would never do that and changed the subject instantly and refused to discuss it. I thought it was weird because if someone was pretending to be my husband to my best friend I would want to find out what was going on and put an end to it!

Finally “Johnny” got me to believe it was in fact her husband by revealing a lot of personal info that only he and my best friend would know and I had never brought up in conversation like explaining times we had hung out and stuff like that. So basically it ended up being my best friend and her husband messing with me the whole time! I had told this person MANY private details of my life and secrets and had exchanged multiple sexual pictures and conversations during the 6 month period. I was beyond devastated and they took all this information and told my sister and that’s why I was cut out of the wedding because she was so disgusted at all that she had heard about me. I was almost suicidal during the time I was grieving my father after his death and losing the relationship with my sister and family that all knew my private details about my life and it turns out I was sharing all this info with someone that was using the info to ruin my life! I just don’t get why my “best friend” of over 25 years would do this to me! I have cut her out of my life and I am still estranged from most of my family but I am just wondering if anyone has gone through something like this or can help with any advice. My sister refuses to speak with me and threatens to get a restraining order on me if I contact her even though the last time I saw her, she physically attacked me and ripped out my hair and gave me a black eye because she was upset about hearing the things I had shared with “Johnny” as she is very conservative and thought I was complete trash for sending provocative pictures to a stranger over the internet. Has anyone gone through something like this? Even my mother refuses to go to therapy with me and has done nothing to try to help fix the situation. I have been so hurt and alone and my sister just says I deserved the beatdown and my entire family ignores me and thinks I’m trash. I’m so hurt and alone...  ",09Apr2018,3
23,"No, this is not some sort of dumb situation where she loiters around the store exclusively to talk with that employee. It's that she hangs out with him as a friend, and that she gets along with him. The ban was put in place by the assistant store manager because he got angry and jealous, then cut off all friendly contact with my friend.

Some backstory:

""Sam"" and I both work at a grocery store next to a Gamestop. The employee that we talk to, let's call him Steve, has been working there a few years. They became friends a few years ago, and they've been texting, talking, hanging out ever since. 

In comes the ASM. ASM was originally a lower-level employee, but due to ""Steve"" giving recommendations, ASM was promoted to their position that they're in now sometime late last year. ASM meets ""Sam"" and develops a crush on her. They hang out, but she's not interested in dating anyone, not ASM, not ""Steve"", not anyone. ASM slowly starts to get angry ""Sam"" is spending time with ""Steve"". This eventually boils into a conflict where ASM just eventually loses it and blocks ""Sam"" on all social media and bans her from the store. ""Sam"" did nothing at the store to warrant being banned, but ASM is being extremely emotional and won't let her be in the store. ASM just doesn't seem to like ""Steve"", probably because of a love triangle that doesn't actually exist.

Throughout all of this, ""Steve"" has been extremely professional, but ASM is doing extremely petty things at work to make their life difficult. The store manager (who has been neutral and generally won't get involved) doesn't want to have ""Sam"" banned, but he is desperate to keep the ASM so he's bending over backwards for him. The District Manager also said that ""if it will avoid conflict, then she's going to be banned"". No real reason given except that ASM doesn't like her so he doesn't want her in the store, but he spun the story in such a way that apparently it will cause ""conflict"" if she comes in.

I have been sitting on the sidelines furious about everything, and it's starting to get out around my own workplace that ""Sam"" is banned from Gamestop because the ASM is mad at her. I don't know is there's anything we can do, but the closest Gamestop is almost 6 miles away in a close city. I, personally, am probably not shopping at that Gamestop unless the ban is lifted or the ASM is gone. ""Sam"" has also been an emotional wreck, so all I can really do is comfort her. 

Is there anything at all that can be done? I know this is a big stretch, but maybe certain PR representatives would find this a ridiculous reason to ban. They're going to lose more business than just one customer at this point, and I can't seem to find any ethical reason why this can be an okay thing to do.",09Apr2018,4
24,"I know there are some emotions that exist that might not have a name (or a very common name), and that's how I feel about this.

I always feel like I'm not actually friends with my friends. No matter the extent/history of our relationship, I always feel like I come up short, I'm trying too hard, or that we aren't really friends. I'm not too sure how to describe it. I'm always convinced they don't like me, or they like me more than they should in that our friendship is just fabricated. 

I'm typically outgoing, so I always feel that my friendships have developed as an extension of my kindness/positivity towards others- but that we shouldn't actually be friends? 

I'm not sure how much sense this makes. I don't know what to do about this. It always makes me feel really depressed and alone. Has anyone experienced something similar? It makes me feel like I'm not a sufficient friend or person and I'm not worth anyone else's time. Even my best friends I'm convinced we shouldn't even be friends and I've some how fallen into our friendship.

But instead of greeting me back with a smile like I did, she told me to leave her alone,and proceeded to go back with her group of friends. I was confused and baffled so I walked over to where she was and asked her what happened. Before she could even say something back, her male friend told me to back off and I told him she’s  my cousin. He pushed me back and told me to go away and so I did. Assuming she was drunk and didn’t recognize me in person, I messaged her on Facebook and told her it’s me your cousin along with my name. She told me to fuck off and I didn’t reply back. I decided to ignore her. 

Couple minutes later her male friend came up to me and said she wanted to talk to me outside the club, and so I did. We were outside and she claimed I use to sexually harass her as a kid. I told her I don’t know what she is talking about. I cannot recall doing any of these things to her( keep in mind we were both kids at this time period she was referring to). 

Then she slapped me a couple times as I kept telling her I can’t remember doing any of these things. I tried to walk away but her friends cornered me. Then I made a run for it back into the club hoping the bouncers will protect me to which they did.

There are six people living here split into three groups: My mother and step-father, myself and my wife, my brother and his friend (both late teens).

35,"   For this story I'm changing names to preserve anonymity. My boyfriend named Alex and I have been dating since October (we met on tinder). We went on our first date in early september. After going on the date and hitting it off/deciding to see where things would go, I got a message from Brendan, another guy on tinder that I had messaged days before the date. He asked to go on a date, so I said that I was willing to hang out but I had met a guy with whom there was a strong potential that we would start dating. I told him that I was happy to hang out but knew that nothing serious could come from it. He agreed, and we hung out. 

   We became friends. We had class together and would go get lunch after many days of the week. One time he invited me over and we made out. I knew before going over this was his intention but made sure to talk to a few different people to confirm that there was nothing wrong with this. Nothing ever went past making out, and I made sure I was vocal about the fact that I was okay with things as long as Brendan understood that at some point things would become more serious with Alex and we would have to remain strictly platonic. For a small amount of time I had a crush on Brendan, but ultimately chose Alex because I met him first and liked him too. Brendan was unhappy with this but we remained friends. Things between Alex and I were going smoothly, and Brendan and I were becoming good friends and remaining completely platonic. 


   Brendan ended up becoming one of my closest friends because we discovered we were both dealing with depression and I felt like I could talk to him about it because he understood how I was feeling more than anybody else did at the time. Things were fine until one day Brendan told me he still really liked me. I didn't know what to do because I was uncomfortable with this but he was also my close friend. I decided to ask Brendan for space. I told Alex about everything that had happened. I told him Brendan was my friend who I met on tinder but that things didn't work out between us so we agreed to remain just friends, but that he told me he liked me and I asked for space. After a while, Brendan and I re-evaluated and decided that space was hurting more than it was helping and neither of us wanted to lose the friendship over the circumstances. 


   Things were pretty fine up until about 3 months ago. Brendan's depression worsened and he felt that he couldn't deal with it at the same time as a full university course load. He decided to take a semester off. I was very upset to hear that he was leaving, but he luckily lived just 10 minutes away from campus. I made an effort for a while to go hang out with him. I missed hanging out with him, and I knew that he felt trapped and that none of his other friends were reaching out to him. 


   A few days ago we were texting and he mentioned he was feeling pretty down, so I asked him if he wanted to talk about it. Things spiraled into him talking about suicide and wanting to die. He said that he wouldn't act on it but that he wanted something to kill him by chance. I was trying to talk him about of it. Eventually this turned into him telling me 1. That he was drunk (it was a wednesday afternoon and he was home alone). 2. He was in love with me 3. He had been in love with me since we met in September. He later texted saying he was ""mortified"" at what he said and apologized many times, to which I told him not to worry. 


Here are my questions: 

1. Where do things go between Brendan and I? I want to continue being friends with him but if he is in love with me I am uncomfortable spending a lot of time alone with him (not cause I think he would pull anything, but because it seems wrong to have a boyfriend and hang out with somebody else alone who is in love with you)

2. What should I tell Alex? I want to be completely transparent with him but I also don't want to disclose information about Brendan that he wouldn't want Alex to know? 

3. Should I address the fact that he was drunk alone on a wednesday afternoon? (He's had problems with drinking in the past) And if yes how should I go about this? 

tl;dr I have a boyfriend. My best friend is in love with me and that makes me uncomfortable, but I am also his only friend who reaches out to him and he is depressed to the point of contemplating suicide.

36,"Alrighty, a bunch of background info..

I've been dating this man for about three momths now. We are currently sleeping on our friend's couch together, have signed a lease for a house we are moving into this weekend. However, we cannot move into the house if we do not have the deposit that we are supposed to be paying the day before. We both have to work full days every day this week in order to make enough to make that deposit and be able to get into the house, otherwise we will have to wait another week. Our friend is already getting annoyed and is ready for us to have our own place just as much as we are ready to have our own place.
 
 We are both young, early twenties. He has three little girls that he gets to see randomly whenever he wants. Tonight, he went to his family's house to be with one of his girls that was sick. This house is 35 minutes from his work and I have to take him to work everyday because he does not yet have his license back. His ex does not work and takes care of the kids full time. So basically to get him to work the next day I would have to get up early, drive 35 minutes to pick him up, then 45 minutes to work, and then head to work myself.
 
 He says his daughter is sick and that he wants to stay the night there to be able to take her to the hospital. I suggested that once they go to sleep he let his ex take them back, that way he can still go to work so we can hopefully have enough to get our house this week and if they need to be taken to the hospital his ex can handle it because she does not work the next day. This was earlier, just a few minutes ago he called me and said she isn't really sick but that she really just wants to be with him tonight. She is eight.
 
 My need for advice comes down to this. Parents, am I in the wrong here? As I said, we are both young and I am not used to dealing with kids yet. I've never had to split attention with a significant other before. I feel like we are split between responsibilities and am unsure how to handle it. Am I being selfish?

37,"I’m 19, my mom was 17 and my dad was 20 when I was born. He saw me once when I was a few weeks old and then not again until I was around 4, since then he’s been in and out of my life. Talking to me for about 2 weeks out of the year every few years. In the last few he’s been more adamant and has apologized, then disappeared again repeatedly. He has drug problems and remarried when I was young (maybe 8?) and has always lived in another state. His flakiness has caused some issues for me in the way of mental health and relationships and I’m honestly just tired of him only contacting me when it’s convenient. He has 5 other daughters with his (now ex) wife and she doesn’t allow me to speak to or see them because she’s convinced I’m going to talk them into contacting him (?). I just don’t know what to do. It’s impossible for me to get unbiased advice from people in my life and I don’t want to hurt his feelings by cutting him out of my life, as dumb as it sounds.

46,"(I really hope this is the right subreddit)

Hi all, so a to make a very long story short: I'm feeling burnt out/uninterested/less motivated with my usual hobbies and I'm looking for guidance for a new one. Ideally one that can satisfy both my competitive drive to be at the top, but also a casual desire to kick back and relax. I'd love to hear what you all recommend and even your experiences to help make my decision.

**background + ramblings**

Currently and regularly, my hobbies including: 
- Gaming (specifically competitive Pokemon, Yugioh Duel Links, fighting games like Killer Instinct, Smash and Street Fighter, as well as single player games like Metroid and Shin Megami Tensei)
- Gunpla model building (for about a year, haven't since mid 2017)
- Drawing/writing characters and stories (something I'd like to make a little money off of)
- Martial Arts (something I can't quit even wanted to, though I am feeling a little burn out here too. Though, tournaments have never been my favorite thing in the world, at all)
- Watching anime / Youtube (I like Slice of Life mainly, but Action, Mecha and Comedy).

In my current life, it's mostly studying to be an EMT, practicing martial arts and my own personal work in visual arts. But part of me is yearning for a new hobby. I thought about this when I was mindlessly playing Duel Links, recognizing I've been bored with the game, but having little desire to go back to playing Pokemon after how much I've played during the 20th anniversary (yes, I'm still burnt out 2 years later). I'm not feeling the same drive I had for gaming, even card games, I had years prior. It'd be cool to build models again, but I also lack the drive for it. Naturally, I have the same feeling when watching my shows, the only ones I really keep up with (and want to see each week) is the super hero show ""Kamen Rider Build"".

Given my priorities, I probably don't have time, but the yearning for something to break the mold the 3 life focuses have on me. After all, I do love drawing/writing, I genuinely enjoy martial arts and given I'm pushing for a career as an EMT, this should keep me well rounded and my time occupied. But there's still an emptiness when those hobbies are removed. Something where I can work, plan and reach the top, all the while enjoying myself and have the freedom to go my way. But the most important thing I'm looking for is *I do not want to be stressed out*. 

I guess in my ramblings I found my biggest point that I'm missing. I'm looking for a low energy, no stress hobby that still fills the void of striving to be the very best. 

**What am I actually asking**

I need to find a new hobby to help relieve my burnout. Something low stress that can fill the need of being the best.
Given my current life is occupied with Medical studies, Martial Arts practice and Visual arts creation, where should I begin to look? What are everyone else's hobbies and why?",09Apr2018,1
47,"My friend (21M) is gay however he hates that part about himself. He hasn't accepted it and he says he doesn't want to accept it because it's not right according to God. I'm not very religious so I don't know much about what the bible says but I thought homosexuality wasn't actually talked about in the bible but it's more of a cultural bias in the bible. I thought the passages in the bible talking about homosexuality was negatively viewing the violence etc of the stories vs the actual same sex part. I could be totally wrong but that was my understanding.

Anyways I'm unsure of how to help him or give him advice. He always comes to me and talks about his struggles. He usually ends up relating it to God. If anyone has certain passages or things I can say I would appreciate the advice! I am going to read up on the bible to gain more knowledge and be able to cite things when necessary, I just haven't yet. ",09Apr2018,1

49,"Quick backstory
This is what my bff told me: around 9 yo, mom got a very violent boyfriend. For three years they lived with him. She witnessed her Mum almost being killed a few times, once, almost being run over with her car. All of her siblings physically abused. She's the fourth of five children, but she says she can't remember ever being abused herself. All of the abuse is backed up by family members and i know she was in therapy from the age of 10. Now, here is where it gets interesting to me. Not only does she not remember her own trauma at all, she became very troublesome. Shoplifting at 11, bed wetting until 14, lying, and mood problems. According to her, there are four main incidents of something resembling a nervous breakdown in her past, the fifth being the one i most recently witnessed myself; 1) being taken away from her mom and moving in with her unkind aunts, 2) starting at a new school (fifth school from all the moving around) and being reunites with her childhood bullies in high school, 3) first term in college and anxiety over leaving her family and ended up dropping out of college, 4) getting out a messy relationship with a clingy girlfriend, and 5) at her job recently, for no apparent reason.

She never sought treatment after the initial counselling with CPS when she was taken away, until now, but she dealt with the depression until it went away on it's own.

The last episode, she sought treatment and was put on Lexapro. Diagnosed with Clinical Depression, and a host of other things. Thing is, she just told me, she made sure to talk about her messy life because she knew that she would be put on meds and it would also give her legitimate reasons to quit this job she hated so much and people would empathize better. She said she is sometimes feels she used it as a cover, just like before dropping out, she spoke to her counsellor about her family life.

54,"So, I’ve had this fetish my whole life. A feeding/stuffing/weight gain fetish. I want to feed my BF fattening things until he’s around 400 lbs and he seems ok with it, but I’m worried for health implications later. I didn’t want to tell him at first because I was embarrassed and didn’t want him to feel like he needed to change to fit my bizarre kink. 
I want him to be happy and I’m not sure if he’d actually be able to be happy at such a weight, even though he said he would. He keeps saying it makes him happy because he knows I like it but ughhh l feel torn a bit. 
It is consensual, and I want everything in our relationship to be consensual. I asked if he felt forced to or pressured into it or uncomfortable many times and he said no it didn’t.  

I love him very much, no matter how he looks. But I’m having a hard time whether I should tell him not to gain weight even though he knows I’m turned on by it or just let him get as big as my fantasies and be extremely sexually attracted to him.

63,"Main issue is in title. I have like a half-mechanical keyboard that is pretty loud, as well as a wooden desk, and a rolling chair, on hardwood floors. I've never had a rolling chair before so I didn't realize how much noise it makes, but I just received a text from them and then a call from my landlord letting me know that they'd told her there's a problem, so I'm not too sure what I can do about this. Obviously, I don't want to disrupt their life, but I work afternoons and want to game late at night, while I know they work days. And based on the placement of the rooms, there's really nowhere else I can move my desk. I have exams coming up for my final semester of school as well and I need that computer to study.

I think it's a combination of the chair and keyboard (due to a tic disorder, I type extremely loudly because I put undue pressure on the keyboard). I'm not sure what to do. Should I get area rugs for the desk and chair area? Should I put a place mat or something on the desk? The house is pretty well insulated but I've realized not in that room since upon listening more closely I can hear them through the floor.

I've never dealt with this problem before. Any advice? Or is the only solution to move my computer desk into another room and disassemble/move all my furniture around to accommodate it? The landlord says she can bring me a cork mat tomorrow. Should that fix the issue? Thanks!!",09Apr2018,1
64,"I'll start my saying that I'll be 100% honest, hoping you can at least give me some advice on 1 thing rather than shitting on the many things you will likely want to hate me for.

So... I thought my old neighbor was in my yard with a gun and called the cops from there. 90% sure they're in jail now (they sold pot) but that their family is stalking me, I'm schizophrenic and my stepbrother had told me that there was a 20k hit on my head which he said he paid and later admitted (to my dad not me) that it was for some cokeheads debt that he knew.

I was bat-shit-crazy after that, like fucking disgustingly deep psychosis. Almost got a gun and killed a few people (old neighbours) because of my dumbass stepbrother. Mentally I've been strained since that all happened.

Anyways back to the stalking part, my dad hardly believes me and just claims everything I say is because I'm in psychosis (hes retarded)
So I have no help there.

Furthermore after trying and failing (I moved into a trap house and didn't have the money to get a new place) to go to school, I finally got my school funding and used it to try and kill myself by ODing on blow.

While in the hospital my dad cut out my catheter (Fucked, ikr?!?)

I was living with my mom, had my first gf, life was going well all in all, got in a fight with my mom, and got kicked out after. Didn't want to burden my gf's mom so I moved in with my dad (worst-fucking-decision-of-my-life-not-even-comparable-to-the-cocaine) he and my stepmom break up shortly after, we move 4 hours away to my grandparents in the boons and I'm now even more stuck by the person who sexually assaulted me in the hospital. Oh and my gf breaks up with me telling me I'm lucky she still talks to me, which she hardly even does now. (I was a pretty shitty bf half the time so fair I suppose)

After that, yeah I hate my life. Like loathe it right now.

I start a new job and I'm probably gonna just OD on heroin or something now, like I just spent almost $400 on an application to a better university than she goes to just to one up my ex

Like the only thing I ever do for myself is damage to it, or things to try and 1up other people, I'm just so fucking close to done, and having to live with my dad another 4/5 months is basically hell right now. I'm fucking lost. There's no help, I'm seriously considering suicide again. Head to the woods in the backyard one day and do a shot load of drugs.

It's not even what I just texted, like idk how to handle women, I'm shy af and always end up saying generic or awkward shit, the only reason I'm not a virgin is because I'm an 8 (multiple girls rating not mine) and occasionally a girl will pursue me. Like both my parents are fucking narcissistic asses, the only difference is my moms an uber feminist and my dad just an asshole.

Seriously, I'm about to fucking end this on my next pay day

The worst part, I have a psychiatrist, I'm in counseling, it isn't helping!

I wish I could even say I'm crying writing this all out but I'm just numb at this point.

He told me I was going to find one, and I was like, “I don’t think so,” He took it as me being like, “no one likes me because I’m disgusting!1!1!!1” type of self deprecating jokes, but then I explained how I just block people out. He has a friend who likes me, and I told him the dumb shit I’ve said on instinct in front of his friend. Like once I screamed, “skate fast, eat ass,” at my other friend who was sitting next to him.

I feel like I’ll just end up alone because of it. But I think I’ll be fine living alone. I really like the idea of living in a small apartment with friends, but I’m sure they’ll find significant others and I won’t do them inevitably I’ll be alone.",09Apr2018,1

70,"Recently I was selected for a prestigious position at my university where I get to work with a great group of people. However, from getting to know them, I've found that most (or basically all) of them have these groups of friends that they can fall back on, that they go on trips with, that they work with, that they live with, and so on. I'm naturally more of an independent person and have never really had a stable group like that in my life, just never found my people, I suppose. Getting involved on campus is difficult because I'm a STEM major and I have to work to pay for college, so it pains me when I hear about all their experience going to formals, studying abroad, hanging out, getting involved in causes they love, etc etc. I want to experience all this, but I just feel so disconnected from everyone around me, it's not really the culture I feel at ease in I suppose. I don't drink, and while I enjoy parties they always set me on edge.

73,"Hi reddit, so just a brief introduction to my situation: I'm 22-year old uni graduate and have recently found an okay job (in terms of pay, hours, colleagues etc.). My granddad passed away a while ago and I have been lucky enough to inherit a great deal of money (about $4 million in USD). I am perfectly aware that most people don't even make this much money in their entire lives, so I'm feeling a bit lost in terms of how I should move forward from this point onwards (e.g. life goals, career choices etc., if that makes sense). 

I didn't make many friends during my years at uni (and to a certain extent don't really regret it as I feel perfectly fine being alone) and neither am I currently in a relationship (and have no particular desire to be in one). I enjoy travelling but I've been lucky enough to have been able to travel extensively while younger with my parents and friends and at the moment there is simply no 'must-do' thing on my bucket list.

74,"throwaway for embarrassing ask reasons. my boyfriend and I recently started having sex and it’s great. he had been having trouble staying hard and we’ve finally been able to go at it past foreplay, so when the curse was lifted I was extremely excited to jump his bones. only problem is that almost immediately after I pulled out a condom he had a look of disappointment and asked if we could go without. I am on birth control but did tell him that I would prefer to wear a condom too, just in case. he reluctantly agreed but instantly went soft when I put it on, and just said “I’m sorry, I hate condoms.” I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid of pregnancy and I’m unsure if my birth control will cut it every time, which is why I wanted to use condoms from time to time. but his body is literally rejecting the damn things and I don’t know whether I should push the issue further or not. when I do give in to unprotected sex it’s great, but would birth control be all I need?

77,"I've been struggling with dysthymic depression and anxiety for a very long time now. Years, maybe almost 6 or 7. Of course over time, I've come to work around certain problems or at least work with it. My biggest problem though, is waking up in the morning. I've tried various things. I feel as though my problem is getting out of bed, once I'm out I'm okay. (Note: something else I've noticed is I usually have to sleep 14 or more hours to feel rested and not so depressed in the morning, which I can't do every night since my job is so demanding pushing me until 22:00 or 23:00 on a regular week night). I have to be out of the door by 07:15 the latest. Sometimes I'll be 10 or 15 minutes late, but even that's better than sleeping too far in. My usual bullshit was starting alarms at 04:30 having them every ten minutes all the way up to 06:50. That doesn't work. I figured getting at least awake and aware of the time would help give me more time to settle and get out of bed. So since that didn't work, I decided and was suggested to start the alarms later and more frequently, that way I get more sleep. So now I start them at 06:00 and set them for every 5 minutes. Not helping either. I then resorted to keeping those 5 minute alarms and smoking pot every night. For a while the pot helped me feel more rested and less depressed in the morning and I was able to get up. Now the pot just doesn't do any harm, but it's not helping either. I can't tell if this is all depression or all anxiety, or a mix of both. But I'm real sick of waking up in the morning and feeling the depressive feeling in my chest and the inability to get out of bed and start my day. Some days I'll even just feel pure nausea the minute I get out of bed (probably due to my medication, I take Seroquel at 450mg, this might be a factor into my problem too). The amount of days that I've slept into or otherwise missed due to my fucking up in the morning in the past 6 or 7 years, is insane. My grades in school have been a problem with the amount of days I've missed, every year since the issue started back in middle school. I'll be going to college in a few months, and I don't want this problem to drag into college either. I'm so sorry for how lengthy this post is, but I need help, and fast. All suggestions are welcomed. And just a reminder, it's just getting out of bed is the problem, not to be confused with waking myself up. Once I'm out of bed, I'm okay. ",09Apr2018,1

(also mother's side) I have no significant connection with any of these people, and yet I still feel as if I am completely under their control.

I'm not currently on medication, and have no wish to go on medication. I'm intelligent, but physically and emotionally unable to go to school often enough to have good grades.

I'm at a crossroads here, where I'm not sure what to do about my job. I really want to leave, but I also really like paying rent and not being homeless. I've been throwing around the idea of quitting for a while, but I think I've just tied myself up in a knot of uncertainty so I'm trying to crowdsource some sense. Like, is this just a grass is greener type situation?

**Keeping My Job Pros:**

- Don't have to look for another job. Something I hate. Don't have to interview for another job. Something I hate. Get to dodge two things I hate.
- I have a lot of freedom over what I do during my shift, and it's not uncommon for me to be able to sit and read, or play 3ds, or watch Netflix. These are perks that I really appreciate.
- The shift times line up with the times I want to work.
- I don't have a car, and the place I work is right off a dedicated bike path. Finding another job that's as easy to access as this one would be difficult.
- I like my work, and I plan to work in this industry until retirement. It's something I'm good at, and doesn't include customer service.
- Get paid relatively well, compared to past jobs I've held. However, I'm paid less than average compared to other positions like mine that I'm seeing advertised. 
- The general office is very lax, and I don't have to wear ridiculous uniforms that I've had to wear in the past. I can just wear normal people clothing. I love wearing normal people clothing.

**Keeping My Job Cons:**

- No support from management. Several times coworkers have sexually harassed me, and each time I've brought it up I get hand waving from my manager. I don't feel like management's got my back on issues like this, and it makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe when I work with certain coworkers. Especially because it's usually just me and them.
- Nepotism is a huge problem here. It's common knowledge in the office that our boss is fucking one of our contractors, so that contractor gets special treatment. Lots of which results in a monetary benefit to him. At first I ignored this as just office backbiting, but it's been confirmed by her verbally that they're dating, so I can no longer ignore it. Also, tying into the last bullet point, I have a coworker who is extremely violent. He's gone into screaming meltdowns twice in the 5 months in which he's worked here, but since he's besties with the president's son he still works here. I used to work 8 out of 12 hours of my shift with him, and his temper constantly made work more difficult than it needed to be. But he's still here. I was written up and threatened with termination based on our no tolerance policy for my ""involvement"" with his first meltdown, because on the camera they saw that I was close to him when it happened. There's another employee who was terminated due to this second meltdown. 
- Recurring issues aren't addressed. We have a contractor who no shows all the time. We have a ton of employees who continually fail to show up on time. We have a variety of issues that would be difficult to go into detail with, but they happen pretty regularly and it'd be easy to fix. But... they're not. They usually fall onto my shift, and I get the fun opportunity to fix them. Wow, I love that.
- Work and school have been an issue, and it's deeply frustrating. I sent my school schedule to my manager and his manager 2 months before it started. The class I had signed up with wouldn't conflict with my schedule at all. But my manager changed that schedule so that I was only getting about 4 hours of sleep. It wasn't sustainable, so I stopped my class halfway through. This really upsets me, as this class would have a monumental effect on my future success in this industry and I loved being in class. The next semester starts in July, and unfortunately does conflict with my current schedule at work. Very drastically. I let them know about that future class's schedule in the beginning of March and there's still no game plan. I'm really, really worried that they're going to fuck this up for me. But I'm not sure how to even address it. I don't want to wait till the last second, but that unfortunately is my manager's M.O. I know he'll fuck it up. I hope he won't.
- My stalker found out I work here. I'm not sure how to feel about this part because it only just happened. I work at a pretty secure facility. But I'd like for this person to not know where I'm at.

Anyway, the cons is much longer of a list than pros, but the pros are pretty sweet. My main concern is school, more than anything else. But I'm not sure really what to do here. ",09Apr2018,1

I want to provide some context so you guys can maybe help me out better. Any amount of help in this is greatly appreciated.

I dropped out of high school at 17 because it was my experience that I had always learned more and had been more engaged in meaningful work on my own. I taught myself how to program at a young age and applied the same principles of learning to other subjects I found interesting. My days pre-dropout were filled with long hours of intense intellectual work, the likes of which could not be matched by any mildly infuriating meaningless school work. Unbeknownst to me, the sleepless nights spent hunched over on the computer, not only took a toll on my physical and mental health, but led me to despise the very subjects I adored.

By the time I had dropped out, programming, graphic design, painting, and drawing were dead to me. However, I still found it in me from time to time, to hop on my chair and invest my time in side projects.

I’m now at a point where I do not find interest in anything besides laying in bed all day playing video games and occasionally reading pages from my google play library on psychology and self-help. Not that I enjoy those things either, but I’d rather be fucking around then not do anything at all. I spend my days completely enclosed in my room, devoid of any motivation to continue or pursue anything that even remotely requires half my brain, and I cannot find it within me to do anything productive.

To me, there is no point to anything anymore. I’m not depressed or anxious, I’m simply indifferent about anything and everything. I realize, being a semi-competent human being, capable of visualizing the future, that this will not end well for me. I have made several efforts to set goals and develop habits, but I really don’t like doing the same things every day, it exhausts me. I play video games and pretty much just sit on my ass all day, but for some reason, realizing how destructive this repetitive behavior is, isn’t a sufficient reason for my dumbo mind to make the necessary changes.

I like change, I don’t like feeling stagnant or unproductive, but I lack so much interest in just about anything now that I might as well be dead.

I need help, please reddit, tell me what to do. I’m 18 and I don’t have a job.

P.S. It is worth noting that I occasionally smoke with my friends and have had a few psychedelic experiences that may have altered my perception of reality in meaningful yet not very positive ways.",09Apr2018,2

I like drawing (pixel art), I’ve always had a dream to create a comic based on the world of a popular webcomic, but I’m afraid to be derivative, I’m barely good enough at art to do even a proof of concept, and my characters are lifeless and halfformed. 

I started a practice comic and then a full comic a week ago, but it’s not good enough. I’m afraid of it, and I’m rushing into it without planning anything so I don’t get choked by anxiety. I want to start over every time I look at it, but I worry I wouldn’t get anywhere. 

Am I wasting my time trying to create something by myself? Should I keep trying to learn more programming, or should I just hope my classes give me enough experience?

I'm 21, Brian's 23, Ryan's 18

I was with my ex Brian for 3 years, the relationship wasn't the best purely my fault. I cheated on him twice and fell for people online who I gamed with, I never knew why I did it, but a lot of people said it was because I wasn't getting my emotional needs with Brian. He used to just play games with his friends online next to me all day and work. The only time we spoke was at night for a couple of minutes if that.. Sometimes we'd have family events which was really good. With Brian I imagined my future with him, he's got a decent job, he's very loyal and mature \(apart from the fact he wont let me argue back with him. \-.\-\) But yeah, In January he decided to kick me out of the flat because I spoke to a guy called Ryan I played games with. Ryan really wanted me to leave him because he knew how depressed I was that he was looking at all my shit 24/7 and trying to download spy ware on my PC, which I understand why he did. So it was officially over between me and him, I didn't want to go home because I have family problems so Ryan let me visit him in Sweden for a while where I fell for him, he made me super happy, his smile is the best thing in this world. I know he really loves me, a lot. But Brian decided to contact me whilst I was over there, asking for me back and to come home. I can't seem to let go, every time I speak to Brian it eases my mind. So I said I'd come home and see how things go between us, I was fully honest with Ryan about this. So I'm at home, Brian wanted me to block Ryan completely, I told him I did but, I haven't, because I'm a bad person \-\_\-"" I'm single atm.

Those that Im working with; not only have no interest in bringing in new employees, but they have tried using misinformation to make things purposely difficult. I don't look forward to going to work at all. When I try to speak with my boss he doesn't have anything to say about the job. Aside from typical things that are self evident. He seems to have no idea what's going on. Or, what Hes doing. 

Should I search for something else to avoid this trainwreck. No one seems to be happy with the direction of things.

100,"I care about my boyfriend a lot as a person, and I don’t want to hurt him, and definitely don’t want him to die. He has struggled with depression for years and attempted suicide twice. He’s only recently managed to get back on his feet, in part, (AS CLAIMED BY HIM) because of me. He’s even told me that some days I’ve been the only thing holding him up.

I’m in a situation where I just can’t be with him anymore for various reasons. I want to break up. But I also REALLY don’t want him to kill himself. It feels unfaithful to continue like this, I’m basically lying to him. 

How do I handle this? Is there any good way out? I feel like a terrible person for not knowing the answer. Surely his life is more important than any discomfort on my end... but I feel so trapped.

102,"I love my girlfriend. I love her daughter.

But I think I'm gay.

We've been dating for about six months, and was very quickly a fall in love situation from the moment we met. 

She was just finalizing her divorce, and had a year and a half year old. 

I love them as if I want to be the best friend to them, I cherish every moment we're together.

I've always known I loved men, i am out as bisexual, but every woman I have dated just hasn't felt right. Every guy I've been with gives me a feeling of happiness and comfort. Very different.

I don't know what to do, she is very emotionally not healthy and she is quite honestly my best friend at this point. I want to protect her and the child. I sincerely do love them and telling her this will destroy her mentally and physically. 

But I know that I will never feel comfortable with her.

111,"(TL;DR at bottom)

I've been talking to someone at work for the past couple months and getting along really well with them. I think they're cool, we share similar interests, and we both seem to be very engaged when chatting to each other. One or two times they came to hang out with me in my department while on their break, and I did the same a few times in theirs, and they often made time for me. We have texted a bit and everything seemed to be going well. 

However, a week ago, I texted them asking if they wanted to grab coffee sometime after they mentioned having more time off from work. They ignored that text and haven't spoken to me since.

**Some relevant details:**

- I am a straight male (22) and the coworker is a female (similar age)
- I find her attractive but am only interested in being friends right now
- My intention was to hang out as friends
- I haven't had the chance to speak to her at work or try feel the situation out and don't trust myself to
- I have some social anxiety and have a hard time in these sorta of situations (hence my posting here)
- I have a history of doing awkward things when trying to befriend people, like writing letters or freaking out
- I didn't do anything strange this time -- just sent a simple message suggesting a coffee date and didn't even send any paragraphs or ??s or ""are you there?""s
- My exact words were, ""Maybe we could grab coffee sometime then.""

I want to find something to say to her that will help us figure things out and be comfortable speaking again. The problem is, I don't know if this is a misunderstanding, if there's a reasonable answer for why she didn't reply, or if I'm misreading things and making a big deal out of nothing. 
I don't know if my message was too much or made her feel uncomfortable. 
I don't know if she took my message to mean I was asking her out in a romantic way and she wasn't into that. 
I don't know if she's not interested in being friends and she took this opportunity to make that apparent. I don't trust myself and my nervous brain to make sense of anything regarding people I have any kind of interest in.

So, I'm hoping someone could help me think of something to say that wouldn't be too awkward no matter what the real situation is and could help us go back to being regular work friends. 
What I fear most of all is that I made her uncomfortable and made her loathe showing up to work even more because I'll be there. I know most people would think that sounds silly considering it was such a standard text, but that's where my mind goes and I figure anything is possible the other way around if I can imagine it. She told me once that she had to leave another job because a guy there was being creepy and kept hitting on her inappropriately. I'm terrified she'll think she has to leave this one because of me, as stupid as that sounds. To be clear, I never hit on her, but I did once say her hair looked nice.

This is the current text I'm considering sending:
""Hey! I hope that message before wasn't too forward! I'm not exactly the best at making friends lol but I think you're cool and we get along well, so I'd like to get to know you better. I'm sorry if it made you uneasy!""

Sorry for the long post!! I'm not really sure how I'd TL;DR it. I'll try, though. Also,hipe that was the right flair even though this wasn't about a romantic relationship.

And I've got a serious masturbation problem. I had times where I masturbated twice a day. I've been masturbating almost every day for the past two months and now I couldn't get as hard as I could during straight porn. So I tried to look at gay porn and got an instant turn on. I didn't like it one bit after my wank. I really don't want to be gay? I like girls and they're personalities are always different and unique from guys which i find attractive.  But the recent onslaught of rejection that i faced made my self-esteem really low. I don't want to have a relationship with a guy yet i got turned on by the gay porn i watched. I really do not want that, not because im worried of my friends or family, but because I want to have a relationship with a girl. I've not felt attracted to any other girl for a long time partly due to the rejection i faced (about a year ago) and I'm still hooked on that girl.

I came into her life when she was around six, she is now nearly 15, she is my daughter in every sense of the word, her younger sister who is now 9 as well, but its easier with her in a sense as she doesn't remember living any other way.

my eldest does, and for all their dad is a deadbeat dad and take virtually nothing to do with them, he is still her dad, I can see her conflicted loyalties. the younger sees the dad as a source of extra birthday and xmas presents and that bout it, but its not so simple with my oldest.

this weekend we got into an argument, usual teenager stuff - helping round the house, try not to fight with sister and brother so much etc and she got all worked up and so did I, I suck at keeping calm and often forget that despite her acting like an adult, she is a child, and I expect her to argue like and adult which obviously she doesn't.

anyway this particular argument she decided to say that if I didn't like the amount she did, she could go live with her real dad. if im honest I knew this day would come, or some variation of it anyway, but man it was like a physical blow to the stomach. I blew up and for the first time I swore at her, I feel horrible that I did that, my parents swore and that at me constantly, but this was the first I have ever done it in anger at my kids. she was in shock, she tried to backpeddle and say that wasn't what she meant etc, and in my heart I know she would never go and she does love me and count me as her dad, but still I should be handling this stuff better.

more and more I see my dad in me, and he was not a great parent, and I need to find a way to handle these things like a proper adult and not the manchild I currently am.

any advice?

for the record, I apologized to her (via text) this morning and we are ok, we will hug it out tonight and it will be fine, although this was the first time I have swore at her, we do fall out on occasion and we always sort it out, but really I shouldn't be getting as worked up as I do even the times where I don't swear, she is a child and I should be able to handle that, that's why I need advice.

He has been getting worse over the years and now it’s to the point where he’s making rash decisions that could get him in legal trouble. I am 25 and live in CA. He is 65 and lives on the east coast. I apologize ahead of time if this story gets confusing. It is a bit complicated and I’m bad at telling stories. 

5 years ago my grandfather (mom’s side) passed away. Just days before that my dad asked the company he works for, for medical leave (idk the proper term) for his anxiety which was granted. Once my grandfather died he started drinking every night. Last year my uncle, (mom’s side of the family) who he was good friends with, committed suicide. This exacerbated the issue. He doesn’t like my mom’s side of the family aside from two people my deceased grandfather and uncle.

After my grandfather’s death my grandmother was left with a substantial mortgage and no way to pay it. She is severely handicapped and cannot work. From what I Understand, My aunts and uncles had my mother forfeit her inheritance (which I don’t believe was much) in order to help pay for the house. But now my aunt (the wife of my deceased uncle) is selling her house and moving in with my grandmother. 

The reason this all ties in is because my dad helped my grandmother pay her taxes and took care of her financially so he feels shafted and is mad at my mom for giving up her inheritance. He’s been getting blackout drunk every night and sending aggressive, borderline threatening texts to my aunts and uncles who are now talking of getting restraining orders. 

A couple weeks ago my dad accidentally texted my friend thinking it was someone in my mom’s family saying things I’d never heard him say in my life. Just the meanest shit about my mom’s family and It really fucked me up. He’s been treating my mom like shit and my sisters are pushing him away. He was looking after my deceased uncles kids but now my aunt won’t let him see them. 

It fucking sucks because my dad has always been calm and collected and shown me how to properly handle myself. However, seeing him act like this is freaking me out and I have no clue what to do. He’s been getting aggressive with me and I’m afraid to lose him. 

He’s gained a lot of weight and I’m sure he’s gonna drink himself into an early grave. Anyone who’s had an alcoholic mother or father, how did you handle the situation and what advice can you give me to try and help him? I greatly appreciate it. ",09Apr2018,2
125,"Firstly, I'd like to say that this is my first post ever on Reddit, so if I mess something up, it's mostly due to my lack of knowledge around here. So, just please bear that in mind.

Secondly, I decided to post the entire story, from the beginning because I feel it's important to understand it instead of just writing what happened in near past and what is currently happening.

With all of that out of the way, here it is:

Around one year ago, I bought a MMORPG game from Steam (I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say the name of the game, so better safe than sorry). Now this was right in the middle of my semester, when my midterms were coming up. So at first, I didn't play it a lot. I actually, ended up quitting the game until the end of semester but not before I joined a small group. 

Fast forward, semester ended, I passed all of my exams, 3 months of freedom. But what to do? As I was browsing some stuff on internet, I remembered this game. So I started playing it and started getting more and more involved with the group. In that group, was a girl. I liked her from the beginning. Not in the relationship way at first, but over time. And as time went on, we started talking more and more. All was going well. And then, middle of August came. She wanted to meet up with me, but because of her schedule, she couldn't come here as she wanted (Side note, we're not from same country and we are separated by 500 km, roughly). Then she said about an event that's going on near her, that was really interesting for me. I offered to come to her instead. Few days of planning, setting up things, we agreed on date and duration of my visit.

Guess it would be best if I bring some info. I was 19 years old back then, had birthday between then and now, and she's 20. So we both are going to college. 

To cut the entire trip, two interesting things happened. 1. We kissed. Which means that we both liked each other. 2. After second night from the kiss, she said that she couldn't do it. Now this is down to me mostly. Because of the circumstances, given that it was my first kiss and my first ""girlfriend"", I kinda rushed things, but not against her will. But even with all of that, it was clear that we still wanted to be friends. But I was upset because we didn't really even try.

I returned back from the trip, I had a month before going to college again. I didn't really expect much, but at the end, we ended up going back together. And we agreed that she would come to me for a week. I was really happy with that outcome. Her trip and stay went really well. Even when she went back, we were still in the relationship.

But, things weren't meant to last it seemed. She was telling me that she was becoming increasingly unhappy with the distance between us. Now to a point, I understood that. I was also having sad periods as well, but I didn't want to think about breaking up. We tried some things to get closer together, we were talking as much as possible, having fun but it just wasn't enough. At the end, beginning with November, we broke up. 

Now comes my first mistake. After the break up, I didn't break contact with her, even though I knew I should. A reason for that being, is that both her and me didn't really have many friends. Or a few. Let alone someone we could discuss our feelings with. Also important to note that, it wasn't really over for me. I expected things to go back to normal, at least after few weeks or so. But that didn't happen.

So we continued being friends. Best friends. And I knew she cared for me as much as I cared for her. It was all going well, but my feelings for her didn't change. Her feelings for me did. 

In between then and a week ago from now, not much was going on. We had a few arguments here and there but we passed that without a problem. Around few weeks from now, she ended up in another group that she took to going there more and more and talking to me less and less. This is where my second mistake happened. I got jealous, and instead of talking about it, I let it escalate too much. But that was resolved as well. And with both of us being happy about it.

Now comes where the issue started. A week ago, she was getting ready for a trip to meet few people from the group for the weekend. I was urging her to go from the beginning, because why not. I will admit, I was worried a bit about it, but I was just trying to calm myself down, without looking that I worry too much about it. But the issue happened on Wednesday. My feelings for her were still there and it kind of reached the boiling point. At the end, I told her. She was glad I did and said that it's an issue that we had to resolve. Now this is where I knew things wouldn't go well. For me, it wasn't an issue. For me, all I wanted was just that she knew and that's it. But she wanted to ""fix it"". Her solution? To stop having contact for now. And that genuinely hurt. But okay, I went with it. Yesterday, she returned from the trip. I expected for her to at least tell me that she got back. Because she knows that I care for her. I ended up catching her online in the game, I wanted us for talk but she just responded with ""why?"".

Right now, she's back in college and my midterms are coming next week. I'm not sure what to do. I'm close to the tipping point between just waiting and hoping and just breaking it all. But to keep that from happening, I agreed with myself to give her until next Monday for her to talk to me again. But I'm not sure if that's the best thing for me to do. Because I do want us to be friends again. Any advice would be good right now.

TL;DR: Met a girl in an game, we got in a relationship, broke up, we remained good friends, my feelings for her remained, I told her, she stopped talking to me.",09Apr2018,0
126,"##**[Edit]: I chose the ""Other"" flair because it covers multiple flair topics.**

---

Sup .. &gt;.&gt;  
Thats ^ my face right now.

##**This will be a wall of text.**

Let me give you some backstory first before i get into the main part..  
I've been a gamer since my father first sat me before a computer when i was 4 or so, always into playing games alone, with friends, multiplayer online.. you name it. School went... not that good over time since i lost more and more interest in it, not especially because of gaming but mostly because i had a mindset in the direction of - Why would i ever need chemistry or religion and so on as long as i don't want to become something along those lines in the future, which i would have never planned on becoming anyways.. To speak quite frankly i never actually ""planned"" to become anything in the first place.. which is the problem.

I came out of school with below average grades.. Even tho i participated in the classroom i just couldn't be asked to do shit like homework or tests. Same with someone asking me about something.. I'd never rate anything or give a show a rating of 1-10, ask me and you shall recieve an detailed explanation in person.

After i got out of school i basically did nothing for a few weeks until my father suddenly woke me up one morning, throwed some working pants at me and said i have to be ready in 10 minutes. I thought i had to help with something real quick but in the end we drove to **his** company and from there to the construction site they were working on at that time. Basically after many days of not sleeping well because i suddenly had to wake up much earlier than back in school i got accustomed to it and ""helped out every day"". I didn't enjoy it at all tho. That was back in 2009.

The new round of apprentices for that year were just starting to go to school too so i got signed up for it in the end aswell since ""when you're done with it at least you have something"". I completed the thing in 3 years, not enjoying a single day of it, and became a roofer.

After that i worked like 2-3 years... until i got burned out. Not just because of work.. remember i said i was a gamer? Yes.. thats the main reason in combination to not enjoying work at all... At the birthday of someone i met at the school i went to to become a roofer, 2 other people joined us who were also in our multigaming clan at that time and asked if we were interested to help out with organizing stuff a bit here and there.. We agreed since we also knew them for a few years now and we were fine with sometimes helping out. The problem is tho a few months after that both of them and that guy from school went really inactive and over time, mostly because i've been in that clan for about 3 years now, i just didn't want to let it end.. I tried first to uphold it by myself until i first caved in on the stuff i had to do and asked other members to help out but none of them were even remotely dedicated enough to even do the most basic things and some said it even themselves that its just too much for them.. we had like 90 members.. i tried to continue to uphold that clan for close to a year.. alone. In combination to being that asshole who had to do everything on the job because i'm the chefs son..

I just couldn't do anything anymore when that burnout happened. I spend the entire next year (yes, a whole year) at home (still at my parents house) doing absolutely nothing.. and the best part.. it wasn't really helping that my dad doesn't recognize that burnout is even a thing and calls it bullshit people say when they just don't want to work. Eventually after that year i started to slowly go back to work at my dads company even tho i still didn't enjoy it. I never found enjoyment in anything i tried that i could maybe do instead of being a roofer either. So i just continued to work as one once again for another year or 2.

Since i first started out as an apprentice, EVERY week people would ask me if i'm eventually going to take over his company.. About half a year ago i got pressured into actually doing my master for it aswell.. i'm halfway through, not enjoying a single second of it.. still.

Now comes what i've been up to for the last 2 weeks and after that what the current situation is..

Going back two weeks i jokingly suggested that a friend and i should create a bossfight for VRChat (the name speaks for itself, its a game on Steam for VR that allows you to speak with other people; Everyone can upload custom avatars or create worlds), after seeing someone creating a boss themselves based on a Sword Art Online game.. that was a first for VRChat which made it pretty popular.. After joking about it, my friend said.. ""Hmm, i wonder what we could do.."" &lt;- He has some background in C#

We then proceeded to go absolutely wild with it and exported assets from the game World of Warcraft with a public model viewer. The problem is tho.. everything is broken because its not supposed to work in Blender (a modeling program) and Unity (the engine required to run VRChat, its avatars or worlds), in addition to VRChat blocking any C# scripts, my mates main subject he would have at least known a bit about..

In the last two weeks, with me never having done anything like scripting/game creation or working on Unity in the first place.. we've been in contact with Unity people, modders of it, the VRChat devs, an actual WoW boss designer who really likes what we're doing and many other people who just sometimes give us additional tips when we're stuck.. but most of the time, its actually us now helping out in chatrooms or discovering new techniques aswell. People who have been working on VRChat for months/years have been saying that what me and my friend have done in two weeks took them or regular other people months and months of trials and errors.

This is the first time i've got any praise like this on an actual thing that i've enjoyed creating.. in 8 years. I've had more fun and found more enjoyment in what we've done in these two weeks than what i've done as a roofer for the last 8 years.

When i went to school today for my master course 2 hours ago.. i drove like 10 minutes and thought.. for the first time, actually slightly starting to cry while driving, i have finally found something that i'd rather do than being a roofer. I changed course back towards home. And after coming in my mom immediately stood there with a confused look on her face on why i came back. I told her how i just can't deal with it anymore and i never enjoyed being a roofer from day 1 and so on.. Shen then sat down and told me that just a week or month ago (i forgot just now while typing) they got told that they have to change some stuff around because since they're privately insured they'd have to pay far too much in comparison to their pension for when my dad stops working, so much that they'd not really be able to continue living here. Their hope was that i'd do my master and then take over the company and employ my dad for a bit of money while he'd still manage everything like he does today but instead of being privately insured he'd get statutory health insurance. This was a first for me, they haven't told us anything about it. Just like the next one she immediately dropped right after. Apparently when my grandfather still was managing the company my dad only took over because they were in some serious debt and my grandparents would have to otherwise get kicked out of their home, so my father took it upon himself so they can stay in their home... Its not fully paid off yet tho. They never told us anything about something like this. This is like a massive guilt trip she's setting me on now for finally finding something i'd rather do instead of continuing to work as a roofer and then she drops bombshells like this..

127,"A little background I’m very close mates with “Cate”, “Cate” and “John” were in a platonic relationship for 2 or 3 months before hand and have only started officially dating about a week ago. And this is basically the first sexual thing they’ve done.

She only told me this when was she really drunk the other day, I’m the only one who knows, what she told me shortened down was practically:

“Cate was dropped at John’s house after a party, she was blind drunk and John was high, they tried to have sex but it hurt Cate too much so they stopped. Cate fell asleep and woke up to John fingering her, she was too drunk to do anything it hurt to the point that she started crying and John didn’t stop till he got tired of it. “

Sorry for my attitude but it gets me fucking riled up that he’s done that and the fact that Cate is basically whipped on him and won’t really acknowledge that he’s done any wrong and tells me “he want thinking right don’t worry” makes it worse. I know that he’s done shit like this before, eg back when they were still in a platonic thing when Cate was over at John’s and he was really drunk he barged into the bathroom while she was starting to get changed and tried to strip, undo her pants and I have heard that he has in the past gotten girls drunk just to take advantage of them, no clue how accurate that it is but it honestly would not surprise me. 

I feel really fucking guilty because honestly I don’t know what I can do to help her, i know if she broke up with John it would 100% be better in the long run but she’s told me she’d be devastated and become depressed, go back to self harm etc if John broke up with her for good. And she’s told me to promise her not too tell anyone about the incident, so I’ve been trying to persuade her to atleast tell one of her best friends or her therapist, but she’s against it because I think she knows that if she tells one of her friends about it it could cause her and John to brake up. I told her that I don’t know what I can do to help her, so it would be for the best that she would atleast tell one of her friends about it and her response was “it’s fine don’t feel guilty about it I will get over it” which got me fucking devestated like I honestly don’t know what to say or to do can someone help me out ?

128,"It started off as just friendly banter, but now everyone just gangs up against me, it’s even escalated to the internet and social media. I’ve tried everything to make them stop, laughing it off, just staying silent, telling them that they’ve crossed the line and need to stop, and (to which I regret), trying to intimidate them into stopping which just made things worse. I’m in no physical danger, but this shit just gets in my head, to the point where im depressed every day. and the hate spreads like a virus, destroying any dignity or reputation I had. And I know that if I speak to somebody, and everybody involved gets in to trouble, it won’t do shit and I’ll just become a complete outcast and hated by everybody even more, because these guys are completely relentless.

130,"Warning: this is REALLY long

Me and my partner met our current roommates in August 2017, after interviewing like 30 people, and hit it off so well I went camping with them. We had tons of similarities in hobbies, political views, lifestyles, etc. Their kid [8] got really attached to me too. We all had been through trauma, dealt with mental illness and lgbt discrimination, and were just looking for a peaceful home.

We moved into an apartment together in October 2017, so we just hit 6 months and have 6 more to go. Things pretty much went from great to good to meh to bad to worse, and my partner and I have no idea what to do. This family is the first set of roommates we’ve had.

Right off the bat, we found out that their kid was going to start being homeschooled due to various struggles at public school. That was fine, but it would’ve been nice to have known beforehand.

On Halloween, one of their cats attacked mine and I stupidly rushed in to save him and their cat bit me really badly. Had to be on amoxicillin for a month and I have several bite scars. I wasn’t too angry because cats fight, especially cats that aren’t familiar with each other, and I should’ve intervened with a broom or something. Roommate A was pretty shaken and was convinced that we were going to move out over that, but I reassured them it was all okay.

Things were pretty okay after that aside from a few arguments about divvying up chores and me being stressed that my cat is rarely leaving the bedroom due to being attacked by that same cat every time he left.

Then came the new year.

I noticed increasingly that this couple has no idea how to homeschool their kid. Roommate A is a stay-at-home parent, and Roommate B works ridiculous hours. The kid spends all day playing video games and doing maybe 1 assignment. I understand it’s frustrating to deal with a kid that has ADHD and is on the autism spectrum, but the kid still needs a proper education. Roommate A spends all day on the computer; reading, gaming, Skyping friends, etc.

Then shit really hit the fan in late February. My cat (male, neutered, 8) started spraying on my roommate’s stuff. Great. After a huge shitshow, that made me have a panic attack, my roommates (mostly Roommate A) forced me to isolate my cat in my room, buy pheromone diffusers, and insisted he needed to get on anxiety meds because “he’s so aggressive and territorial”. Bullshit. He’s my Emotional Support Animal. Plus, their cat (female, spayed, 8) was the “victim” and “that’s just the way she is”, so they see no reason to punish her behavior.

So the next few weeks go by and my cat is stressed beyond all belief. He cries constantly, day and night, unless I am petting him. My partner and I are barely sleeping. I’m so furious at my roommates that I spend my entire spring break and 6 year anniversary with my partner sick and stewing in my room. 

We talk a few times, but nothing substantial. I’m living on ramen and microwave soup. I try to work out with my roommates what needs to be done moving forward. They say I need to get a large baby gate to keep my cat from getting out and their cat from getting in our room. We can’t afford the luxurious gate they want, so we get a less expensive one for the time being. 

Roommate A absolutely loses her shit while the gate is being set up, before I have time to explain. She’s screaming, stomping around, says “I can’t do this, maybe I’ll get hit by a car” and storms out of the apartment. We try to explain over our group-text, but Roommate A is not having it. She misconstrues our words, says very nasty and accusatory things, forced me and my partner to apologize for her misunderstanding, and promptly says she doesn’t know where she is and “thanks for the panic attack”. My partner goes and finds her.

Shortly after that, we all kinda sorta talk it out. Roommate A admits that all the things she said were attempts to hurt and upset us, and apologizes. Then they both redirect the conversation to how messy and gross our room is. (This whole time I’ve been struggling with complex emotions and had very little energy. My partner works an hour away, gets up at 5:30 and gets home at 7, so she can’t really help.) They say that cleaning up will improve my cat’s mood. I spend the weekend cleaning the fuck out of our room, injuring myself in the process. (I’m disabled btw.) My cat’s mood does not improve.

The following weeks are immensely stressful. I get a kidney stone and have to go to the ER, my last grandparent is dying, I had arguments with my partner, I’m not socializing outside of school and social media, my aunt picks a fight with me at my gma’s house and she nearly has a heart attack, and my partner’s parents basically tell me I’m a freeloader.

While all this is happening, they’ve begun to increase the kid’s workload. Barely. The kid sobs every day. Sometimes for hours. Sometimes more than once. They tell me that they’ve changed their mind about re-enrolling her in school and are going to continue homeschooling. Because it’s worked soooo well so far.

At this point, I barely leave my bedroom. I can’t enjoy anywhere else in the apartment because of the kid’s wailing, and my cat is fucking distressed and lethargic. I’m looking into temporary homecare because I am barely functional.

This past week has really knocked it out of the park. (Note: I have ptsd from abuse from my dad.) I wake up suddenly to both roommates screaming at their kid for something and spanking her. I later find out that it was justified and not excessive, but at the time I was terrified. Flashbacks and pain course through me. I send distressed and garbled texts to my mom, who immediately comes and gets me. I’ve been at her house with my cat since then.

I’m immensely worried about this kid’s mental health. I found out she started stealing and shoplifting, and she had to start seeing a child psychologist. She had already been lying about schoolwork, going to bed, brushing teeth/hair, bathing, and taking meds. Today my partner told me that she had to stop the kid from trying to run away while our roommates were asleep!! (They stay up and drink after Roommate B gets home at 10:30.) When my cat started spraying our roommates were sooo concerned that someone would call CPS, but I’m pretty sure CPS is more likely to be called for her scream-crying bloody murder every day!!

At this point, me and my partner feel like unwanted guests in our own home. We are terrified to confront our roommates because every attempt has quickly become Roommate A screaming and accusing us of various things. Roommate B is pretty chill, but always sides with Roommate A. I think it’s ridiculous that these grown-ass adults are treating me and my partner (who are practically still kids) so fucking badly.

Getting through the next 6 months seems totally unfeasible, but our roommates have told us time and time again that they would LOVE to continue to live here with us until their kid gets to high school. That they’re tired of relocating.

All four of us are on the lease, and I wish we could just kick them out at the end of it and get new roommates, but I doubt they are willing to go down without a fight. They’d probably be fine with kicking us out and getting new roommates so they don’t have to relocate and we do.

What the world are we supposed to do?

TLDR; we have shit roommates and another 6 months on the lease. Is there anything we can do to prepare ourselves for not renewing the lease and the likely fights while getting there?",09Apr2018,1
132,"Hi everyone. I’m a 21 year old female just now starting to discover my sexuality after growing up in a conservative Christian family. I really need some help figuring out my sexual/romantic identity as I can’t tell if I’m bisexual, homosexual biromantic, or lesbian... and it’s somewhat urgent because I’m engaged to a man. I’m hoping some people here might have had similar experiences. Please read until the end, as there is a lot of information affecting my uncertainty.

I’ve always had “crushes” on guys; obsessions/nerves around guys I thought were intimidating and cute. This started young, like first grade. I also had what I now recognize as crushes on girls, but at the time I just thought of them as special relationships, like really happy friendships or something. 

Once I got older, I would have sexual attraction to a guy for the first month or two. After sleeping with him, this sexual attraction would dissipate. It only seemed to remain long term with hard-to-get players and guys other women wanted/found attractive. With other guys who were easier to “get,” romantic feelings would remain even after the initial phase in our relationship, but I’d no longer feel interested in sex with them and it would become a chore. The only “intimacy” I’d want would be hand holding and cuddling. I would feel a sparked interest in sex if I found another girl was interested in him or that he was attracted to another girl. Jealousy seemed to be the only thing to kickstart my desire for sex. During these times my desire to watch porn/masturbate never went away, and I would continue doing that on my own, often preferring it to actual sex with the guy I was with. I only ever wanted sex with him if I felt lonely and wanted connection or attention. This has occurred over and over throughout my life. I would often get bored with the sex itself even the very first time with a guy after the initial build-up and excitement, and would sometimes feel sad and emotional afterward for no apparent reason. 

I also find that around the same time my sex drive disappears with a guy, I tend to to start getting kind of mean to him. Not abusive, but certainly not the way I was at the beginning of the relationship. I get irritable, snappy, resentful, lose a sort of respect for him, and am constantly annoyed with him. 

I’ve never had sex with or been in a relationship with a girl, but I’ve had sexual fantasies and thoughts of girls, crushes on girls, sexted girls, and have kissed a few girls. I seem pretty picky about which females I’m attracted to (generally dark hair, light eyes, petite, intelligent, well-spoken). I enjoy thinking about being with a woman both sexually and, I think, romantically.

Today I went to Starbucks and a girl I knew from my old school was working the cash register. All of my charisma that I usually have with guys went out the window. Instead I was flustered and embarrassed. I felt an immediate sexual attraction toward her that I’m not really used to feeling with guys. Usually if I see a cute guy it’s more like, “Wow, he’s cute/hot and intimidating, I wonder if he thinks I’m cute too and is noticing me.” With her it was more like, “Holy shit, her eyes are stunning and she has pretty hair and looks good without makeup and I’m so nervous to talk to her and I wonder if she’s interested in women and if she is I wonder if she thinks I’m pretty, and now I’m thinking about seeing her hips and the outline of her breasts and sitting with her under the stars???”

Here’s the real kicker— I’m engaged to a man I consider to be my soulmate and best friend. He knows I’m figuring out my sexual and romantic preferences and is open minded. We’ve considered an open relationship, and he’s okay with me experimenting with women. One thing to note is that I rarely, if ever, want to have sex with him. This makes me sad and I often feel guilt over it, even though he says he is plenty satisfied. Just like other relationships I mentioned above, our relationship started with an intense sexual attraction- we were actually FWB for **five years**- that quickly fizzled out for me once we had actual sex (instead of just oral) and got in a relationship. He still finds me sexually attractive. I find his face attractive, but am not interested in his body. I even find it gross, though I know other women would find it appealing. In order for me to find a guy’s body physically attractive it’s like they have to be incredibly fit and athletic, freshly showered, not too harry, and not too pale. It’s just hard for me to find a normal good-looking guy sexually appealing. Sometimes, to try to get myself to want to have sex with my fiancé, I remind myself that other women would sleep with him if they could. Even thinking of him cheating helps! Once we are having sex I can enjoy it, but more times than I like to admit I still find myself feeling grossed out, reluctant, bored, wishing we could hurry up, not wanting him to cum on me or in my mouth, and like sex is a chore. I’m not sure if this is simply low sex drive, me having a sexual preference for women, or if it’s possible I’m actually a lesbian. I do often fantasize about women during sex with my fiancé, and enjoy thinking about him with other women too.

I have no idea if I’m simply bisexual, homosexual biromantic, or lesbian. It may be important to note that I’ve experienced depression since childhood, but that it has gotten much worse in the past 3 years. I’ve wondered if that could have to do with my sexual identity confusion.

I know the label doesn’t *technically* matter much but if I’m going to marry this man I think both of us deserve to know what our relationship is, and what the implications are. I want us both happy. I love him and would like to have children and a life with him, but I am concerned about never having any zest for sex, and wonder if it would be different with a woman or if I’d run into the same issues.

Thanks for any input and insight you might have.",09Apr2018,1
133,"Hi! I'm a 21yo Spanish student of Law and Political Science. It is a double bachelor's program of 6 years (long time, I know). Currently, I'm finishing my 3rd course but I've realised that actually I don't like Law and I definitely don't want a job in that sector. Anyway, I find it mildly interesting and have no problem learning and passing the courses, but it's not my passion.

Political science, on the other hand, is something I enjoy. I'm passionate about it and wouldn't mind working in that sector. Main problem there: lack of employment opportunities. There are some jobs in political consulting and strategy (which is what I would love to work in), but they are rare, it's highly competitive and it's increasingly being occupied by technical careers.

Then the plot twist: I've realised I love Statistics and my interests in Math and Statistical Programming (R, mainly) has been steadily increasing for the last year. I'm actually thinking about starting a BSc in Math in a public distance-learning university while continuing with online courses in data science and statistical programming and my current university studies.

Ditching Law and sticking only to Political Science at this point would only save me 6-9 months, so I don't know if it's worth it.

The thing is: having clear that I want to specialise in the Data/Stats + Political Science field (analysis, campaigning, strategy, consulting), does it make any sense that I keep on doing the Law+PolSci program? Plus, is it crazy that I want to go this way and start the Math degree?

PD: I have been doing several online courses in Coursera and DataCamp learning R programming and have had a couple stats courses in university. No real ""hard math"" background.

TL;DR: Halfway of a Law and Political Science degree realised I have no professional interest in Law and want to specialise in data science and stats + political science. Should I finish my Law degree? Is it crazy to start a BSc in Math?",09Apr2018,1

138,"Okay here we go...

So I’ve been super horny lately. Like I’ve masturbated everyday for a week which is unusual for me. But the thing is, masturbation is just not enough to satisfy me, I need a man. 

I have multiple options, but none of them seem like that great of options. 

First off, my fuck buddy. We have a great time together. We have a lot of the same interests, we laugh a lot, plus he satisfies me to the max lol. On a side note, we also were really starting to fall for each other for awhile. We’ve been FWB since about October 2017, though I haven’t seen him since February. I found out from a mutual friend that he had a girlfriend about 2 months back, which means he was in a relationship while we were fwb and did not tell me. I find that quite dishonest and disrespectful to both his ex girlfriend and me. So anyways, he doesn’t know I know, but I do. And honestly, I’d like to not tell him I know he had a gf and just keep doing our thing without the emotional part. But what stops me is that as far as I know, he could have a different girlfriend at anytime. It’s not that I’m jealous, it’s that I don’t ever want to help someone cheat. 

Next option is my ex boyfriend. We’ve recently started being just friends and it’s actually been working out great! We feel pretty platonic, but he’s still someone I’d be okay with having sex with at least just once, though I’m somewhat not that attracted to him. But I happen to know he’d be happy to help with my dilemma here lol. 

Next option is this guy who I got really emotionally invested in and found out later that he had just gotten out of a serious relationship and was pretty broken up about it. No hard feelings, we left on good terms, and he would be okay to have sex with as well though I’m not sure if he’d be open to it and I don’t want to ask until I know it’s what I want. 

So the advice I’m looking for is what to do if I feel like I need to fuck a man, and have these options? I’m in college and this is the last month of the semester which means lots of stress on top of being sexually frustrated and I need to do something about it!! Any advice would help ",09Apr2018,0

140,"Hi reddit!  My normal account has been active for five years now, but I don’t want to be associated with this story, hopefully that is acceptable with you people...

Background:
So I’m a 27 year old gay man living in a ‘big’ city in the Midwest. I’m kind of tall and scruffy, and have always been I guess technically considered morbidly obese. I have always been the type of fat where it was a constant battle as to whether or not my double chin is visible. My freshman roommate told me near the end of our school year that I had gone from ‘obese’ down to ‘just fat’ throughout our time together, meaning it as a compliment. I would yo-yo in weight as years have progressed, since about 13. I would always be between pant sizes 46-52, even after my roommate told me this.
As a fat kid, I made a promise to myself that I would intentionally never get a boyfriend until I lost the weight, as lame and stereotypical as that goes. I had a couple flings with friends over the years, but never lasted more than once or twice. I would always use the excuse that I’m fat to tell myself to stop. Never audibly, of course. As I got older though, I probably became increasingly desperate and boiled to the point of using hook up apps. I know, the gay culture is alarming. I definitely learned a lot about it too, but that’s a different story. This one involves the most recent hook up I’ve had, starting last March (2017). Bare with me here, because there’s so much background info.
So I meet up with this dude from an app. I can’t believe I’m typing this right now, but I was meeting up to give him head. Not typical of me, and I’m not proud, but it happened, okay? His picture was abnormally attractive was the first thing I noticed when he messaged me, and felt like it was irresistible at the time for some gay reason, no pun. I had never really been with someone as hot as this dude, okay? Literally his description: tall, brunette, bright blue eyes, beautiful face, abs, a huge booty that looked photoshopped in person, etc.... he was basically perfect in every way. We meet up in a private place and do the deed. Nice d too, by the way. And continued to meet up about ten or so times from March-July to hook up, sometimes more intensely than the fore mentioned act.
We would chat, smoke weed, and watch stuff on Netflix. He would always introduce me to new shows which I thought was cool. But after a while we would sometimes hook up, and sometimes not. And instead of chilling at my place, I started hanging out with him at his. The first time I went over there was July. It was one of those pay by the week motels that are crusty. He told me he had just moved out of his place and was looking to find a room somewhere in a house but had been unlucky with the search, which was understandable. I also noticed girl things scattered around. From a pink blanket to a hair straightener, something wasn’t right. He tells me at this point that he had a girlfriend but they broke up because she admitted herself into a psych ward. I knew that he was probably on the straight side, but didn’t know he had a girlfriend. I rationalized continuing to hang out with him because we had met in a sort of sleezy way, and he was now single so it was fine. And we weren’t together so it was double fine, even though it goes against my morals to be in this situation. He was beautiful, and an officer in the marines, and so much more at the time. At least so I thought. 
After living in this shady motel scenario for probably three months and paying out the ass for it, I tried helping him out. He was in a weird spot. Newly single, driving a rental car because he totaled his, he also needed a place to stay. His insurance company was making him take the rental back soon, so he was soon to be without a car as well. I felt bad for him, especially since I would occasionally get the d. So, I did what any awesome person would do and got him the extra bedroom at my weed dealer’s house for a good price.
They started off as good roommates, but things eventually turned sour as things can easily do when strangers live together. Especially a marine living with a weed dealer... they definitely clashed. They got into a couple notable confrontations that I won’t describe in detail. Sometimes this guy would want me to come over, sometimes he would be weird about responding to my texts. It led me to be a little weirded out about buying weed from my dealer because I would run into him there. Anyways, he started hanging out with his ex girlfriend at my weed dealer’s house, but didn’t tell me about it. But we would still hook up sometimes when my friend wasn’t around. My dealer had no clue that me and this guy were boning and the guy wanted to keep it that way, which I respected. He didn’t have a car at this point, so he started trying to get me to go to the gym with him, which I started doing. He was an extreme gym rat, and he helped me start the routine of working out every single day. I also took him to work when I was free, ran errands with him, etc.
I met his girl when I was helping him move out. His not as hot brother came too. I found out from her that day that she had being staying there, and knew my dealer pretty well at that point. This made my head spin, and I still don’t know what I was feeling. I’d relate it to a form of jealousy mixed with an urge to keep the secret and also mixed with the guilt of the situation. But why didn’t he tell me? That’s not my advice question, that’s still coming up. This is internal dialogue haha. 
He moved out because him and my dealer didn’t get along, but ended up moving in with his ‘ex’ girlfriend at her new apartment. Their relationship was volatile, and her roommates wanted him to move out. So, he moved in with his coworker for a few days.During that time, I found him a short term lease on a place, which was important because he is going to officer candidate school or something in a month from now, which is nowhere near here. I helped him move like three separate times, and found him 2/4 places to live. He also convinced me into not talking to my long term weed dealer anymore, causing me about a month of pain trying to find a new dealer (I’m back with him btw were good now).
He still didn’t have a car and it’s been months. So I eventually developed a friendship with his girl. We were just friends to her, but she had no idea the extent of our friendship. But I was driving him around all the time. He would always send me gifs and compliment me and make me feel good all the time on top of being extremely good looking. 
When he moved into the short term lease place, he started inviting me to spend the night. So, I spent about two months spending every night there and going to the gym with him every day. We would cook food, drink together, watch netflix, and sleep in the same bed. This was the closest thing to a relationship that I have ever had. I knew he was moving in a few months, so I knew it wouldn’t last. However, we both thought it could, because my dad lives near quantico, the location of the school he is going to. And my parents have a house near where his parents live in Florida. So we could have been life long friends.
His ‘ex’ girlfriend and his brother told me seperately and with great detail about how he is a pile of dog poo. I would rationalize everything, or I would confront him and he would feed me his best version of every event. He always seemed like he was in the right and I was falling in love.
One night, the three of us took an Uber downtown to meet with some of my friends, who knew the real story. I was heavy on the tequila this night. My friends were telling me I deserve better than this bullshit. As they were telling me this, I literally was watching this dude and his girlfriend grinding on each other and making out over my friends shoulders as they were telling me this. Inside I was on fire, and also ready to cry. We took an u we back to his house where the three of use were hanging out. He had always told me that he would always pick me over this girl and that they just hook up. He wanted me to leave for the first night ever since starting to sleep in his bed with him because he wanted to have sex with her.
I know I can’t be upset, but this was the closest thing to a relationship I ever had. And I was wasted, I had just thrown up when I pushed him in his yard. After I pushed him, he punched me three times in the face and then kicks me in the nose, knocking me unconscious in my drunk state. After, I screamed to his girlfriend everything that happened between us before I left. They’re still together probably.
Two days later I took him to buy a car. I didn’t remember what had happened that night, I thought we had gotten into a bro fight or some shit. I was too drunk to remember. A few days after, me with a broken nose, he told me he kicked me in the face, which I then remembered. I got up out of the restaurant and left after he told me. We haven’t hung out much since, but his girl told me that he is holding onto some of my things for leverage because that’s something he does to people.
So I have tried getting my stuff back from him, which I am still working on. He doesn’t have much left, just a pear of headphones and a clothes steamer. I realize that he had taken advantage of me during this time, but assumed the whole way that he would do something shitty eventually, based on the testimonies of those who know him best. So, one time he passed out naked and I took a couple pictures in case he tried to do something shitty to me. It was a preventative measure. A well needed one. He doesn’t want to give me my things. He says he’ll drop them off but doesn’t, and I don’t want to just roll up to his house. But he is leaving soon. We haven’t hung out much since he beat me up when I was wasted, and I’ve tried to do so in order to a) try to get back to being real friends and b) to get my stuff back. But I couldn’t get over his beating me up. Every time we hang out now (it’s been about three times in a three month period now) it’s too awkward. With that, and then the whole hooking up thing, and him having a girlfriend, and the whole thing was a big secret to everyone else he knows.
I threatened to expose him tonight in order to get my things back. I can’t say I would ever do that to someone outside of this. I threatened to show his family and girlfriend the pics and tell them all that he is secretly into dudes. But I feel so guilty and don’t think that I’d be able to do that in reality. I feel like this has made me ugly enough.
I go to the gym every day still, just by myself. I’m losing weight and gaining a ton of muscle, I wear pant size 38 now which is dope, and I’m getting hotter every day. So I feel like I am working toward something in my future. This whole thing has made me realize that I want to be in a relationship at some point, but with someone else obviously. I’ve never thought that before. I’ve always degraded myself and believed that all the garbage person memes were made for me. 
Could someone love me after being in this situation? Could I find someone? Should I wait until I lose the weight first or be open to something now? Should I just be single and lonely forever?
For someone like me who was gaslighted into this whole mess of a situation, which is way worse than even described, how do I move forward from here? I want to be a good person.

TLDR: Forever single gay man breaks that trend, only to be bamboozled by bad human. How to proceed?

145,"I was on a dating site. I set my “search criteria” to the city that I’m going to be moving to in June, so that I can meet new people. I started talking to a guy and we clicked instantly. We found out we’re from the same small town away from the city, in fact we grew up 15 houses apart. We have tonnes in common.

Conversation amped up until we found ourselves at the point where we were talking all day every day. Morning til night. Sometimes phone calls that lasted through the entire night until 5am. He made it crystal clear that he wanted nothing more than to date me when I’ve moved down to the city. I made it clear I feel the same, but at the very least I’d even just want a friendship with this guy. He’s like the male version of me.

However over the past month he’s been completely different. Not messaging first, not carrying conversation or asking questions. Just very quiet. Only talks if I message him, and even then I’m lucky. Most times I’m left on read. I asked him a couple of times if everything is okay and he told me that he’s having troubles with his daughter. She hasn’t wanted to talk to him for a couple of months and it’s really getting him down. He hasn’t been talking to anyone.
I told him that I’m always here and then left it for a while. Didn’t message him, just to offer some space. I didn’t hear from him for 2 weeks.

I reached out to him after the 2 weeks had passed just to check in. He said he’s “getting there but still numb” he apologised for being so quiet and down lately. I offered my support again and tried to start a conversation. He left me on read and that was 11 days ago. Heard nothing since. He actually didn’t post anything on social media either until this morning. He’s been totally quiet.

I clicked on his profile and noticed that he has removed the “father” description from his bio. Which seems odd considering the problems he mentioned previously.

Anyway my issue is, I feel really weird about the fact that he just isn’t making the effort to talk anymore. It’s like one moment he was 100% in and then the next he was gone. We were a huge part of each other’s daily routine and I was so excited to get to meet soon.
I can’t work out if he’s really just struggling with life and just living on autopilot, or if maybe he’s lost interest. Should I try and ask somehow? Or considering I’ve reached out 3 times with little luck and my last message is on read, leave him to it now and hope that he’ll contact me?

**tl;dr** - got really close to a guy, messaging every day, planning dates. Suddenly he starts “having problems” and now he never ever reaches out to talk to me. Never carries conversation on or asks questions. Should I try to ask him if he’s lost interest, or wait for him to contact me?",09Apr2018,2

From my mother's point of view I take my family's help for granted and recently have been putting a new relationship ahead of them and starting on the rest of my life. I struggled with anxiety and depression at uni and they did help me through but I was very open in my appreciation of that. Now she also tells me I'm distant and closed off and she wishes I could actually talk to her. I wish I could but I almost feel scared of doing so.. she can be pretty harsh and cutting when she chooses to. I never rebelled as a teenager and never did anything that she didn't want me to because I was scared of upsetting her.

150,"Already posted in relationship advice but only got one comment so posting here to get more opinions :) 

So me and friend, let’s call her D started talking in our first year of college as we were in the same class. I knew her previously as we attended the same school together. 

Me and D became close in our college class and at the end of they year I broke up with my boyfriend and became closer with my friend and ended up hanging out with her for the majority of the summer

During the summer every time I would hang out with D she would bring her boyfriend , lets call him T and another friend called L. T was a nice guy and enjoyed doing the things we were doing so I didn’t mind as such. 

Fast forward to the end of the summer and we decide we don’t like L anymore, for reasons such as she became bitchy and different.  All three of us were in agreement of this. 

We then began hanging out as a 3. Now I had no problem doing so as I had hung out with him in the summer previously. However hanging out just the three of us it began turning into me third wheeling and I started to see it was D and T and just me on the side. I also started to see that D was becoming agitated with T as at only 18 years old they had decided to live with each other, and began snapping st him constantly causing me to feel awkward. 

Now In January of this year I struck up conversations with L in college and we decided to hang out as I found I liked her again. So I told D and T this and they weren’t happy. 

I then started to feel as thought I was too uncomfortable hanging out with my friend and her boyfriend and asked D ( in private) if we could hang out just us two from time to time and have some girl time.

This is where the friendship fell through. D got very upset and said she thought we were Three equal best friends and that I was out of order for asking to see her without her boyfriend. I told her that I thought she snapped at T too much and maybe they spent too much time with each other. 

I then received a angry text from T regarding what I had spoke to D about. I felt betrayed as I had spoke to D privately and did not expect her to go and tell T everything 

This is where our friendship ended and nothing more was said.

D then decides she wants to be friends with L again and her and T start hanging out with L more. After two weeks L stops talking to me and carries on hanging out with D and T, suspicious? 

Was I right to ask for girl time? Was I right to end this friendship? I’m having doubts? Where do I go from here

152,"So I am 16 and really haven’t had any fun maybe since 7 th grade 

Let’s go over the meaning of fun 
Fun- something that makes you soul happy/ can come from many different things/ I haven’t beeen able to find that thing

And having 2 more years till I turn 18 and sign up for the coast guard, I am at a state of uncertainty. Should I stay as clean as possible, not do anything risky and keep a clean record. Or should I “scrape my knees a little”.  For example I have never been to a party. I am scared to do these wild things because my older brother who is 28 also was wild and ended lots of nights at the police station and it drove my mom crazy. The last thing I want is her to look at me and think of my brother.  If I were to ask him this question he wouldn’t tell me to go out, he would stress the importance of just staying safe and not doing anything wild. But even though maybe going to a party or going to the city with my friends in the middle of the night  is sorta a big jump out of my comfort zone, I might be willing to try it. What do u guys think? Should i just forget about fun and focus on having a safe next 2 years, or should I gain some experiences while at this age?",09Apr2018,0
153,"Hey guys!  
I've been having some issues with my friend for the past few months,  so I thought I would post here for some advice.  We've been friends for a bit over 2 years now. To be honest I can't really remember how I felt in this friendship before it got this bad,  it's kind of a blur. Which worries me,  because it's not like I'm an old man,  I'm only 18. I do remember though that I was a lot more open with her,  more talkative and I was definitely closer to her back then. 
So..  Here are the issues we've been having for quite a while now:
-Whenever she does something dumb or illogical she gets angry at me
-She always expects me to magically read her mind and now what she wants me to do
-If I can't read her mind she gets even more upset
-I have to tidy up after her quite a lot(in her own house)
-It seems like she is only productive when I'm around: suddenly wants to dig up the garden with me, paint the room, fix the printer,  stuff like that. 
You know,  in general,  I wouldn't mind to help out around the house,  but when she invites me over to chill out,  I'm obviously not going to expect to have to dig out cement in the garden. Because of that,  I can't even bring the proper clothes for it. So I had to dig in my dress shoes. 
-Even when we are just hanging out,  we don't really do anything together, we are usually only on our phones
-Or when we could do something,  she still chats with people on her phone for hours instead of talking to me
-It seems like we don't really have shared interests anymore, when in the past we definitely did

I know,  in general these aren't really big issues. But this has been going on for months,  and I just don't know how to change it. I'm not really comfortable with confronting people,  so I haven't been vocal about it up till now. I would really appreciate it if you could give me some tips,  thank you in advance!

I always looked up to my older brother for advice and he is my best friend. That’s why this is so hard. 

Two weeks ago I went out for supper with Sam and Sarah and my girlfriend came along too and noticed that Sarah was quieter than usual. She is usually bubbly and cheery. 

As the night went on I was talking to Sam about my graduating soon and my girlfriend was talking to Sarah. At one point, Sarah laughed loudly at something my girlfriend said and all of a sudden Sam got angry and grabbed Sarah by the arm and whispered something to her. 

Sarah almost recoiled when this happened and didn’t say much for the rest of the night. I didn’t say anything because I wasn’t sure what I had just seen and it was so unlike Sam to do something like that.

I was in a relationship for 9 years with an amazing guy I met at university. My best friend, and the person I planned to spend my life with. A few years ago I had to move for my job, and it took a couple of years for him to trail behind. Obviously it's a huge deal to leave your home town for your partner, and sadly it was never the same. We spent the last year trying to make it work - but somewhere down the line, I guess we just stopped talking. I called it off just before Christmas, but we remained living together until I decided we needed space. I found somewhere to move out to, and yesterday took the plunge. I packed up my things in the place that's been my home for years, said bye to my ex. I get to the new room (rush job) and it turns out it was an ex-brothel...very recent 'ex' - the room still has a mirror on the ceiling, it feels dirty, and there's left over memorabilia everywhere. I immediately found a B&amp;B and left - leaving my things there (I panicked), I've got to go back tonight, and continue my nomadic lifestyle by using hotels and AirBNB. Hopefully they won't cause a fuss about me leaving, but I really can't stay there. 

I also need to find a new job. I work in academia and my research group head is retiring. The interviews are next week. I have an interview for his job, but it's been referred to as a pity interview (which is good experience), the only issue is that people at work seem to have taken offence at me applying for the job, and really they've been bullying me since it happened. I get where they're coming from, I'm not qualified for the job on paper - but I have been doing the job for the past year, so maybe I am physically capable. It's making work really uncomfortable. I always thought of myself as relatively strong, but I really am cracking under all the pressure. Yesterday, I managed to smile all day, then just totally broke down when I got back to my B&amp;B. 

My grandad has also been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He's had a great life, and he is a great age, but it's still sad. 

I just feel like I've gone from a clear future with a life plan and a work plan to someone who doesn't even know what career I'll have that almost ended up living in a sordid shared house.

The school I go to is a private school so the students here do not suffer financially and most probably lead easy lives. Okay so it was this morning. This dude was invited to talk about depression. Note: he has a PHD in something. Let us call him Lau. 
Lau gives an hour long talk about depression and how committing suicide means that you are selfish, weak, fragile, and a loser. He continues to say that the kpop celebrity who killed himself was loaded with money and fame, but he was a whiny bitch who killed himself. Lau said that depression were for weak people and that they should stop being depressed. His speech was greeted with cheers and claps by the juniors. The seniors were just looking at each other in disbelief. It was really... something
Now, people found his twitter profile and most of my friends are tweeting at him respectfully saying that they get his point but he should work on perfecting his way of conveying the message. He has replied with sarcastic remarks and calling my friends bitches and stupid. I honestly am really dumbfounded because I have contemplated killing myself in the past and I have a friend who says that she is about to give up and on the verge of losing her battle. I want to show my friend that she is not what this Lau guy says she is and I want my school to treat the mental illness seriously, not as a joke. What can I do to make Lau realise his mistake and not allow him to continue passing on messages like this? 

something else also happened after that, there was a girl in front of the school's counsellor office crying while saying that she wasn't weak and that she doesn't want to be like this.

167,"Full story: I have been out of the country for the past couple months. I came home for 2 weeks but am leaving again soon for another 3 months. 

While I was gone, one of my roommates, S, moved a bunch of my stuff into my closet, as she was temporarily taking over my room while I was gone (this was agreed upon). 

When I came back, I asked S where some of my stuff was. She said that it was all in the closet. Most of it was there at first glance but I couldn’t find the particular items I was looking for. I figured I wasn’t looking hard enough and just kind of got over it

Well a couple days later, my girlfriend, A, comes over and she wants the stuff she left at my place (which was a lot). After literally tearing apart the closet in which our belongings were stored, we only found about half of it. I decided to take a look in my dresser, which S had been using. I ended up finding multiple belongings of A’s in the dresser. After this, A got upset and started going through pretty much all of S’ stuff. We found that S had been using my girlfriends underwear and bras (a few pieces being expensive lingerie I bought her as a gift), her shoes, and a lot of mostly used makeup. Also, there were other items missing such as $100+ worth of essential oils, a nail lamp, and a few other things. Not only that, we found some of MY jackets, hats, and other clothing items intermingled with her stuff (I had given S permission to wear a couple sweaters and shirts but not as much as we found)

Basically, while I was gone, it seems like S just decided that most of A’s stuff and some of mine were now hers. When I confronted her about this, she denied stealing, got upset at ME for “violating her privacy”, and refused to talk to me. 

S is moving out before the end of the month, but that doesn’t change the fact that there are still belongings missing that she just straight up denies touching. 

It wasn’t a lot of my stuff, but it was a lot of A’s, and I feel that S not only wronged A, but also me, because I trusted her with these things and she either used, lost, or took many things from my girlfriend. 

A wants to get police involved. Idk if that is necessary, but S won’t talk to me about it anymore so idk what to do. 

Edit: there is a 3rd roommate involved in this as well. His [21M] name is J. He has had problems with S in the past too. S is not on the lease, so he asked her to not throw parties while he is not home (he works 2 weeks on, 2 off) but she does so anyways. Also she would throw parties while he *was* home without asking. 

J and myself are the only 2 on the lease. We were letting S stay here as a favor while she got on her feet, and both of us feel disrespected. I considered S a friend, so along with the disrespect, I feel hurt as well. ",09Apr2018,4

I WANT to date someone since I don't wanna die alone, but sex scares me in every way. How do I come over my fear of sex and learn to be a real man and not such a sissy?",09Apr2018,1
170,"My bf (M 16) and I (F 17) have been dating only for a few weeks and I’ve only knew him for a months or two. So we’re not that close (I know) and after he asked me out its like he stopped trying and he became really distant all of a sudden. (By distant i mean barely talking like a few sentences once a day he did say he’s busy too so that maybe a factor) we text very little and I feel more like a distant friend rather than his girlfriend - of course this got me thinking if he really likes me or if this is a sign of some sort. I’m not sure if he still likes me or not or if its a different thing happening. I’m just confused as to why he’s doing this or what this could mean. 

He’s my first boyfriend as well and I am very in experienced with this, if someone can help me with this it would help a lot thankss!!! Feel free to ask me anything else about us or ‘us’ if it helps too i don’t mind :) ",09Apr2018,1
171,"Hi everyone,

I live in eastern Europe (non-EU country) and was wondering is there any chance of legally immigrating to an english speaking western country ?

I'm on final year in law school here but the market is overcrowded with lawyers and the corruption is really bad so I'm thinking about droping out. As for qualifications and working experience, I have worked mostly driver-related jobs and passed something like a special driver test which qualifies me as a 'professional driver' here(probably isn't worth much outside, not sure about it). My english is not that bad too, although it obviously needs a lot of work and practice.

Anyways, is there a chance to move there at all? What kind of certificate/ degree/ experience would be helpful? Do I need to have a family member/friend/wife there ?

Thanks in advance.",09Apr2018,2
172,"Hi reddit, today I had some bad news about my current job which I earn good money and enjoy a lot, as of the last few days the company I work for seems to be going down hill (managers leaving, losing money etc..), now I am one of the most valuable members of staff and if I leave then the company goes down.

Now one of the other managers I work with has told me it doesn’t look good for the company and seems like it won’t last more than a few months, this has me worried.

I am starting to apply for new jobs as we speak but with my experience and qualifications I don’t think I will find a similar position that has anything like the salary I’m on now.

If it all comes down and I’m left unemployed my friend made a joke and said “you will have to try gamble to stay afloat”.. now this got me thinking, I need to earn a minimum £1200 a month to live and pay my bills, if I could do that for a few months max till I find a job will that work?

Ideas?

173,"Here's the context of our past 2 years spent together (sorry if this is wordy, but bear with me):

We started off as friends who started becoming increasingly close and flirty, and who both ended up getting feelings for each other (he had a girlfriend of 5 months at the time, which should have been some type of red flag to me, but whatever). He broke up with her and we dated for 9 months.

I broke up with him at the start of November, b/c he was becoming distant, putting less effort in, and we only saw each other on weekends (ridiculous bc we go to the same University). We agreed this was for the best and that we'd both miss each other, but went NC for 5 straight months. 

During these 5 months NC....i find out he's back with his ex. Posts a pic of them together on facebook in February (lets just say I wasn't happy). 

Literally a month later, at the end of March, he reaches out. Initially I have my guard up and try to sound cold. He started off with small talk like ""how've you been"" and that slowly led into him bringing up memories of our relationship: 

""Remember when I took you on that road trip to __?"" ""Do you remember last summer/my dog (he really liked you!)"" and so on...
 After a decent amount of exchanges I ask him ""should we even be talking again if you're with *ex-GF's name*?"" To which he replied saying they weren't together anymore and that it was a ""Boom and  bust, and it had the exact same ending as before"", and he admitted it was a mistake and a waste of *only* 4 months.

This led into us talking about our relationship/our perspectives/what went wrong, it was a pretty productive chat. We really cleared things up. Unknowingly...this kind of turned in to us talking for 3 months straight, daily. I don't know if I was catching feelings but I liked having him as a friend. 

3 months in, one day he confesses feelings. We meet up in person to talk and he is confident we can make it work/we have amazing chemistry/we are worth another shot. I actually turn him down (I was on the fence though), saying how do I trust the past won't repeat itself? Etc. We talk for about 1.5 hours and we agree we still want to be friends.

Not long after, I was drunk one night and for some reason had the idea of a FWB. I messaged him and asked if he would be down....and of course he said yes. So that was the start of our FWB, that lasted 6 months.

We'd sneak out of our parents places, drive to his house when it was empty or park his car somewhere, or come to my house when it was empty. Not only this, but he'd take me on dates (to the movies, restaurants, and even drive me to and from school...skip the ends of lectures to meet me, etc). It felt like we were casually dating honestly. It was very lowkey but really really fun. We got along honestly better than ever, and he was being SOOO devoted to me. Like more than he ever was when we dated. 

Near November, he confesses again that he wants to try dating again. This time, I agree to try because he's been putting in so much effort and we've been getting along amazingly. So we get back together. 

One day I saw his phone light up with a 3 texts....from his ex. I shut down right there and he was like ""i'm so sorry, there's nothing going on, we still do have all the same friends so we like to keep in contact. She's on a school trip and was telling me how it goes, its harmless"".

I still was like ""just drive me home"". He begged and begged, literally saying he ""didn't want to lose me"", and then added ""If me talking to her makes you upset, I'll cut the contact. Losing you means more than losing her"". I thought he meant it so I said that if he really would cut the contact, do it.

A few days pass and we still talk and everything's normal. We meet  up one night to hookup/hangout, and I ask him how the ""cutting contact"" was going. He shut down isntantly and after a few weird attempts to not quite answer the question, he said ""I mean, I know I said I would.....but she's been a friend of mine for 3 years, I can't just cut that out"". 

I understood but I am not the type to stay with him in any means if I know half his attention is on his ex. And 9 times out of 10, in the past, them ""talking"" led to them getting back together. So I told him that I'd leave, this is ending, and he can have as much of his ex as he wants. And then asked him to drive me home.

The last things he said were him insisting they aren't getting back together, he's really sorry I feel this way but he understands. He seemed genuinely upset but I just said sorry and I wish you the best, and got out of the car.

We haven't spoken since (this was late January)...so I can only assume he's with his ex again *for the 3rd time*. I'm not upset or hurt.....but I'm wondering if he'll reach out once he and her break up again. B/c if he does, I'd really be down to hook up again.

Now, Reddit is this a solid plan? I am leaving because of the verbal and physical abuse and they refuse to treat me like an adult.

Do you think this will work and is there anything I am missing out on my plan? I know legally they cannot make me come home. But is there anything I can do to make sure I am secure and they cannot take me away from my new place of living.

Our last date was two weeks ago because I was out of town the past week and a half.  During the last date, he asked me when I'd get back and mentioned a couple places he wanted to take me around here.  While I was gone, he was working on a big project for work, but he texted me and initiated conversations a couple times: once texting me the day of an exam to ask me how it went, and once to ask how my trip was. I responded and we texted back and forth a few times.

He texted me after his project finished on Friday to let me know he was finished with it.  I answered and sent somehting else and he didn't respond. I got back in town Saturday evening and let him know I was back and could hang out Sunday or some evening this week.

He hasn't texted me back yet. I've seen him logged in on the app this yesterday and I've noticed he's still on the app fairly often.

I'm wondering if he's just busy or if seeing me is actually a priority for him or if he's just keeping me around as an option. I thoguht he was interested because he remembered when my exam was and texted while I was out of town, but now I""m not sure.

196,"I will start out by explaining that I am 23M and I have battled with some severe anxiety, depression and stress issues over the last 5 years. In that time, I have slowly started to be unable to effectively fall asleep while listening to music. This was strange to me because back in high school, having music playing was the only way I *was* able to fall asleep. Now, when I try to fall asleep to music, I hallucinate. Usually I see stuff like dark shapes, spiders, unexplained shapes and colors and they usually scare me and I jerk awake out of this half asleep hallucination state.

You may say: ""Well, OP, just stop listening to music while falling asleep then. *DUH.*"" It's not that simple. The last few nights, I have been having these hallucinations with no music present. Last night was the worst. I kept seeing a black sort of orb about 6 inches in diameter that would fade away as I stared at it. I got almost no sleep because of it.

It should also be noted that I have ""hypnic jerks"" where my body sometimes jerks awake as I am falling asleep (sometimes accompanied by heart palpitations). This is a common thing and it seems to happen when I am more stressed, whether that be something actively stressing me or something that is subconscious.

I have been pretty stressed the last couple weeks because my girlfriend and I have found that it is a large possibility that she may be pregnant. I see it as a blessing and I am also scared, as it is a difficult time in both of our lives and having a baby will complicate things. She finds out for sure on Tuesday and we will go from there.

Like many of you here, I have had depression for most of my life. There was never really a time in my life where I was solidly happy. I have always been anti-social and generally horrible to be around. I also barely feel anything anymore and do dumb shit to constantly try to chase the rush of maybe feeling human instead of this outsider alien that watches all the normal people act and do their lives. I also have to swear a life of absolute celibacy because I am attracted to younger girls. Illegally young. Imagine never being able to actually get off to the porn you are watching, imagine never being actually attracted to the girl you are with. Imagine if you could never look or think about either of them without being called a sick fuck and told to kill yourself. Imagine jerking it to gay porn(if you are straight, if you are gay reverse this) all the time and if you looked at straight porn, you could get thirty years in prison, $100k+ fine, and a life on the sex offender list tagged as a member of the worst group of humans alive, forever.

* NO actual working experience (I only work for a company about a month as an intern)

* Get a degree from a not-so-worth-while (no requirement) community college or something online

* Get a job at local SME (Even though the pay is really low, but learn something and climb the ladder?)

204,"When I was pretty young, I guess I was a bit of a special kid; I went to an inner-city school and was top of the class in most things. This carried on until I got into my teenage years when I was starting to spread out my skills. I'm still relatively skilled, but my problem is that I seem to be *ok* at a whole list of things, but not particularly great at anything.

And when I say a whole list of things, I really mean it. I completed a degree in Graphic Design some 7 years ago where I covered animation, illustration, interactive design, layout etc. After that I took a professional role where I was producing videos and animations, designing print materials, managing social media, creating interactive stuff. Since then I've gone freelance where I mostly work in animation but design and web too.

And even within those jobs I do everything. Normally if you work in animation you'd specialise in a particular area, but I find myself writing scripts, recording voice overs, storyboarding, illustrating, animating and producing the whole thing. As if doing one part of that wouldn't be good enough.

I also recently started a masters so that I could try and focus myself, but all I've done is add 3D modelling and programming to the list of things I have a basic grasp of.

In my spare time I make music. I've been playing guitar for about 19 years, played drums in a few bands too. At the moment I do my own thing; I play live with a looper and throw in guitar, bass, vocals, keys, rhythm all by myself. I've written, recorded, produced, packaged and distributed my own music all by myself (because I always have to do everything).

So yea, I can do *a lot* of things, but not to any great degree. 19 years playing guitar and I honestly have the speed and dexterity of an old man. I can animate things but please, no characters. I can build websites so long as you want a really basic WordPress site. Get the idea?

I'm not just being modest here either. I'm fully aware that actually I've achieved a lot and I should be proud of what I have, but really I just look at each thing and feel exceedingly average at best.

I'm about to turn 29 and I'm feeling like I've achieved nothing. Maybe it's because of how things were when I was young; always held to such a high standard. I pressure myself to achieve more, but I have so many things I want to work on that I can't make a decision, and so I go nowhere. I can't relax, every minute should be spent improving and I feel guilty every time I get distracted.

So what should I do? Should I specialise in a particular area, and if so how do I decide what to specialise in? How do you come to terms with the fact that things you've put so much effort into will amount to nothing? Or is there some sort of way that being experienced in such a broad range of things could be useful? Can being a generalist, a ""Jack of all trades"" make for a successful life?

tl:dr; I do lots of things to an average standard, which makes me feel unsuccessful. Should I specialise in something, and if so how? Or is there a way to make a success out of being a ""Jack of all trades""?",09Apr2018,2
205,"I’m a military wife and moved overseas about a year ago. Jobs are pretty scarce here for dependents—especially good ones.

I ended up landing a job working with kids (pretty much a boys and girls club) and even though I’m so grateful to have gotten this job I can’t help but to feel a little bummed out.

Its technically “part time” but it’s one of those jobs that you come in, leave, then come back because there’s a period in time when the children will be in school. So the thought of coming back to work kind of sucks and I hate how technically I would be out for work all day but only get paid for a regular 8 hours because there’s that awkward gap in between the shift. That and I don’t feel like that leaves me with much time to be able to do stuff throughout the day. 

There’s a girl who recently started working there and she kind of freaked me out about the job too. She said that she comes home so exhausted because most of the time the children will throw toys and whatnot at her face and most of the kids she deals with are pretty obnoxious.

I don’t know. I feel so bad for feeling this way because it’ll be nice to make money of my own again and help out financially. I just feel like it might not be worth it and end up hating it.

206,"So I have a friend that I talked to every single day (sometimes we talk for hours on the phone), we've known each other for 4 years. Recently she went on her own to Italy for vacation; and for the first 4 days it was fine everything was normal. But suddenly she stopped responding to my messages (it's been a week and a half); last time we talked everything seemed fine she wasn't mad or anything. Normally I wouldn't think this is a big deal (I would think maybe she got busy with work or something) but I'm kinda worried because my friend is lacking in the common sense department (i.e. she does dangerous stuff without thinking); for example one time she got lost and a group of five drunk guys in an alley offered to help her find where she needed to go and she went with them, only turning back after realizing they were leading her the wrong way into a more secluded place away from people; her being alone in a foreign country could end up going really badly. I'm worried something happened to her.",09Apr2018,2
207,"Hey all, 
I lost the most loyal dog in the world in my arms this weekend. He had been on hospice care for the last few months and the vet couldn't get here to put him down until this morning. He didn't make it through and died before that could happen. I'm in an abnormal living situation at 34 at my parents house with my 4 year old. 

I moved in here about a year and a half ago when my daughter's father and I split up permanently. It was to be temporary until I could purchase a home. Needless to say, things haven't gone as planned and I haven't been able to purchase my own place yet. 

I have had anxiety since I was a small child and was diagnosed adhd as an adult. What I truly would like is to get both myself an animal and get my daughter one. She has her heart set on a husky and I really would like a pig (for many reasons). The issue is that my father is NOT an animal lover and he's the decision maker. He does not want any animals here at all- let alone a new pig and new dog. He was okay with my dog because of his age he just slept all day. 

I truly don't know how to be without an animal. I would qualify to receive an emotional support animal since I have diagnosed qualifying conditions. Essentially, I could possibly close around the middle of this summer on my new place but it really depends on what I find and how much money I can save. 

I can't wait until then. For my own mental health. For my daughter's. She doesn't know what its like to not have a dog. We both relied on him for support and care above any other human. I don't see how I can get my father to understand this being that he doesn't connect with animals. 

Any advice or direction is much appreciated. My father was born in 1931 and is nearly 30 years older than my mom so he's of a very different generation. He's the best dad I could have ever asked for except for not being an animal lover. I just don't even know how to approach him and am terrified to tell him its not just a dog but a pig too. I don't know how to explain the comfort an animal provides to someone who doesn't get it. ",09Apr2018,1
208,"Hey guys, so my friend refuses to eat at Olive Garden because her parents never had a great experience eating there. But I think this is unfair because it's not based on her real experience but on others. How can I persuade her to try it? What can I do?

This is the email I've sent to Olive Garden:

Hello Olive Garden,

While I do enjoy your chain-restaurant establishment, my friend does not. In fact, she is prejudiced against your food. The only information she bases this off is from her parents who say they have tried ""The Olive Garden"" at the Fair Lakes Shopping Center location in (city, state) TWICE and had told her the food and experience was awful. 

This is upsetting to me because I think my friend would genuinely not mind eating at your establishment if her parents opinions didn't have so much impact on hers. 

Olive Garden, I need your help to stop the prejudice. Help me find a way to enlighten my friend.

Sincerely,

209,"My place of work has a few acres of grass in the middle courtyard and in the surrounding areas of the building. When the maintenance workers cut the grass, the air handlers suck in that air and pump it throughout the building. The resulting smell is of fresh cut grass and mower exhaust. The smell/air really bothers my sinuses and I get a headache for a few hours. There are other minor symptoms I get in addition, such as minor respiratory discomfort and eye discomfort. It really bothers me and it takes of a lot of extra focus and effort to do my work. I do not have a grass allergy and when I am at home, I can cut my grass and not have an issue at all. I’m afraid of the health impact it will have on me, as I am young and have a fairly stable job and do not plan on moving anytime soon. Not to mention it makes me less productive and uncomfortable. They cut the grass about twice a week and the resulting smell lingers for up to four hours of the day so it’s not just an hour or two a month.
 
None of my other coworkers have an issue with the smell and air, except for my mother who also works in my building. Relocating my workstation is not an option. I have emailed the building manager and notified him of the issue.

213,"I know I am lucky enough and spoiled enough to even have this problem, but I am trying to find something that inspires and motivates.

Motivation used to come from the idea of partnering up in life with the person who I thought was going to be my wife. I was inspired by all the adventures and conversations we would share. The six year relationship fell apart though, and I am no longer interested in being in a new relationship.

A secondary source of motivation used to come from my career path. I was highly interested in the brain and technology. I, however, lost interest because of how those fields are bringing us closer to dystopia (one that we might have already started getting our feet wet with). From my perspective, technology is centralizing/automating control and removing humanity out of the equation. As our understanding of the brain grows, I think we also are removing humanity because we will see people as machines. Plus, even though this is an unusual concern for someone to have, I am concerned that consciousness will emerge in technology and that newborn consciousness will be subjected to an actual living hell.

One last motivator was to get out of poverty and increase ""success"". I had very mixed feelings about this last motivator to begin with. I only completed college to keep judgemental people away from me rather than to try to attract attention to myself. I am really disgusted at the opportunism that becoming ""successful"" relies upon. It's hard to get excited about trying to take advantage of people and circumstances, but I think this is a prerequisite to be motivated by standard measures of ""success"".

Well, those are the dead ends that I am encountering. I kind of feel like a zombie slogging through each day, super inefficient and uninspired. I would love to find a new flame to ignite my passion again. Is there any advice to where to look next? Thanks!

I really don't wanna mess this up, when if at all do I message her again? ",09Apr2018,2
216,"OK am not sure if am doing this right (just like what to do with life in general) I might include certain details just to clarify the situation which you might find unnecessary. 

So my father died a year ago, he had a lot of money and lost it all two years ago (which caused him stress and multiple strokes, it almost caused me one when I heard too, not the fact he lost it, but the fact he had it.) 
he lost around 2 Million AED (544500.00 in USD as per our dear google) and this is only his last loss but not the first and he barely said shit until he almost died. We lived in the UAE till father died, then went to our home country which isn't really our home country but don't mind the details and anyways, nobody in the family(Not mother, not three older sisters, definitely not my younger brothers and all our relatives in general kept swearing that father had money but we never believed them because we were idiots and father never let anyone talk anything about money with him) knew that he had such money, not when I needed the simplest of needs of clothes to relatively important ones as in professional help? Or when I wanted a new PC? Or when I wanted to hang out? Hell, never went to a dentist in my life even when I had the worst of hell of pain. “take a painkiller or something.” All people say in reply to this kind of talking is that, am spoiled and some people don't even got painkillers but that's not the fucking point. 
 
Anyways, current situation is that now we got a small piece of land which is yes, very good but I don't plan on selling it because (I hope to build my father's dream house , we still have the blueprints and because it's located on the highest point in the expensive area its in, it has a very nice view and if I sell it I might not get the price it deserves) the money will probably go to mother to buy herself a flat. I really want to build a house because it will solve many future problems for all the family members , it would serve as a last resort when shit goes wrong, because we've went through the experience of not finding a place to go to when shit went wrong, and want to at least do what my father could but didn't when he had the chance. Now the plot thickens with one last piece of asset of a land in our  “real home country...the occupied one” that we can sell for around the car’s price unless we sell it to Israelis which I would love to do, they pay better and I actually love their country? Family would kill me because thinking that way is that of a “traitor” and because it's the last thing we have there and father fucked our whole lives to still have the citizenship of that country and selling it to NOT Israeli people is just giving it away for almost free. You should guess where am originally from by now.

 But it is I, the eldest son who have been bestowed upon the crown of responsibility that must make a multiple set of decisions. 

But what about what I am doing now and my career? Half of my salary, which isn't even much to begin with, goes to the car we bought with a bank loan and electricity and net bills, and the other half barely is enough for fuel and other expenses and allowance.(Mother gets my father retirement salary and she pays for rent and house allowance in general) I almost don't go out to not spend without noticing . And any plans of saving up cash is impossible for at least 3 years if I do not sell anything. And I don't know what to do. I never had the chance to spend cash on shit stuff and complain about not saving up because I spend a lot, It's a bad/good thing I guess?

Sorry for all the above, I've studied English Language and Literature and currently work in an international company as an invoicing assistant(I am still not sure if the company itself understands what my job is or should be?) they hired me for my good English because OH GOD HE CAN SPEAK ENGLISH and this job has no career whatsoever, if I leave the company(been working for a year and a half) , am almost certainly not getting any use of my work experience I got here but do advise if am wrong. 

A good and stable career path for me would be to teach English and give courses in English, but most of the good jobs here are through connections and shit, which kinda makes me scared to even try, especially because working where I do is considered a SAFE(Kill me)job, it's scary to quit with all the above in mind. 

Finally I don't know if this is important but I want to be a scriptwriter and game designer, which requires money and time. (Maybe this point is not important and I should just give up on it because it's just a CHILDISH ambition that probably is the only thing I have an interest in doing and acts as a long term goal so that I don't succumb to the Fuck this and shoot myself thought) I don't know and am not sure if am doing anything wrong or if this is normal and if am overthinking the whole thing and should just sell both lots, one to cover the car loan and other to serve as installment for the flat and then change career with ease of mind and slowly do what I want.

All I know is that I am stuck and my family aren't much for planning or discussing this and fuck sometimes they just say God will find a way or something similar and just brush off the whole discussion. I am depressed, like I've been my whole life and been constantly having suicidal thoughts from at least 7 years back , had breakdowns, couldn't leave room at times,but I (SOMEHOW) managed to get here now, and thought once I got at this age(22, been depressed and had social anxiety since I was around 10, but not the point I want to be talking about because I've been self-fucking to not think about it and keep masterfully wearing my hard-earned masks so I can get a job at least ) and now I'd at least afford going to a psychiatrist or shit at least do what other people do, fuck-drink-drugs?  I can't even buy a PC to enjoy what I enjoy. Bars are expensive, so I just buy myself a bottle of whiskey for a month to avoid going out and drink a glass or two every weekend. I just need someone to maybe I don't know, point out what am doing wrong? Punch me in the face? Give any sort of actual help other than saying “You're still 22, am 25+ and I still have your problems” or “kill yourself hahaha” or “Woah, you're complicating stuff, just stay where you work for a couple more years and then God will open the way for you.” Sigh. 


Oh, this is the last part for you to laugh at, my family are all Muslims and am atheist , they've all wished me death multiple times and they kept insulting me on almost daily basis. I am not starting a religious war or anything, it's just funny how quick they forget all that when where my salary is involved. And no, not scared of any of them, not doing this because it's the “right thing” not because I love them, not because I want anything in return. It's because I don't want anything to do with them and I want them to have everything they would ever need but not have control of to not fuck things up. 



Any advice of any sort is welcome. And sorry for the long post.

I don't want to come across as selfish, but as an introvert, I NEED time alone to think to myself and recharge.  I like socializing, but it drains me. By the time I get to lunch, I'm already pretty tired. I use the time to recharge a bit before the rest of the day, but when I walk with this family member, I'm completely drained.  It's nothing against them, but it just makes it harder to get back to work. 

Unfortunately, this family member is an extrovert that likes to talk to others 24/7, and just doesn't ""get it"". In addition, they like to complain (rightfully so) about their work, and off handedly tell me about all the things I need to do.  They're not doing anything wrong, but the way they communicate just makes me tired and drained, and I just really need this space. 

I keep making excuses about 2/3 times they ask, and agree to it the other 1/3 time. I can agree to it once a week or so but I just can't do anymore. I don't know how I explain it to them without making it seem like I have something against them. ",09Apr2018,1

221,"Ok, I know this might sound incredibly stupid, hear me out though.

I had been suffering from clinical depression during a lot of my formative years, meaning, from around the ages of 13 to 20. In elementary school I was one of the cool kids that was friends with everyone and during the last grade depression hit me like a sack of bricks and I distanced myself from everyone. I've stayed like that during the entirety of high school and the first year of college. 

I was finally put on proper meds last year and while I feel fine  emotionally, I don't see the value of pursuing friendships and relationships.

I've spent most of the time working on things I liked and improving myself and I don't feel like I have time for anything more. If anything, I'd probably be a horrible friend/boyfriend due to how selfish I've become with my time.

That's not the main issue though. I can't quite grasp the concept of interacting with someone you agree with anymore. I've had quite a few good online friends which I've completely cast away now because hanging out with them feels like wasted time. The only time I don't feel is being wasted talking to another person is when you have an argument and there's some goal or progression. Even when I'm on Reddit I always tend to lean towards controversial opinions, even if I'm playing devil's advocate just for the sake of argument. I just don't see the value in talking about something we agree on. 

I know the whole emotional support shtick and all that but I can't justify gambling lots of time I'd need to spend to find someone who I liked that likes me back. I'm not sure if I even need it since  I've become independent to the point where I'd probably be fine just remaining alone. Fuck, I don't even know how to talk to people normally anymore.

First off, I want to state that this is not a troll post, even though what you are going to read will seem so retarded to you. But it's so fucking annoying to me, it's driving me insane and i have been thinking about this *literally* 24/7 and idk how to fix it. It's been two weeks since this weird thing started and i have tried everything to fix this but I just can't.

This thing is happening only in my head, and it's not a mental disease.
I  literally, and i mean literally, can't stop making low hanging jokes or trying to be witty with literally anything i see, in my head (i don't say it out loud). The more I try to stop making jokes/being witty, the harder it gets. I know I am the one actually making the shit jokes, but the moment I start trying to stop making them, the more shit jokes/witty attempts I make. It's like i try to supress making this witty attempts (not really witty) but i try to keep making them in like a background process (but it's not really a background process, i know it's me but i can't fucking stop it it's so annoying). And what comes out is a piece of shit, it's not the ""default"" wit, it's not the wit I used to have two weeks ago. I'll give you some detailed examples to be more clear:

* 1.1 I see or hear anything which makes me feel like the ""click"" of when you have an idea for a joke or a witty thing to say (idk how to call it), even though there isn't really a joke there, or any idea.

* 1.2 Or, i start ""noticing the words"", and I can't stop myself from coming up with shit puns or jokes with the words that i am hearing from the other person. The harder i try to stop ""noticing the words"" the harder it gets to be ""default"" again. It's like automatic breathing, when you notice it, it stops being automatic and you try to get it back to normality but you just can't. This whole issue is like this. Like in automatic breathing, you also try to ""be normal"" and ""stop noticing"" but that doesn't fix it. Its almost exactly the same.

* From here :
I either try to ignore it (doesn't really work because my retarded brain reminds me of this whole issue, I almost automatically (though i know it's actually me) make a shit joke or shit witty attempt, where there is no joke. If I try to supress making jokes i involuntary start trying to make one like in ""the background""*), 
Or, I try to repeat a word in my mind constantly until i forget about this, which kind-of works but is very very tedious and just reminds me more and more of this whole thing. I spam the word ""prohibited"" in my mind , it kind-of stops generating jokes/witty attempts in my mind but I still get the ""urges/clicks"" to be funny.
I also tried to embrace it and make the jokes ""myself""?, which somewhat works but it's still pretty tedious since i have to do this for hours (until i give up) because my brain keeps reminding me of this. 

The only time I am normal is when i forget about this whole thing. But the moment i notice that i am being normal, this whole issue is reminded to me and i start doing what's in 1.1 and 1.2. Its a fucking loop which is driving me insane. And this is when worry and sadness emotions come up which only makes things a lot worse. I know I am the only one causing this whole problem in a very stupid way, but I accidentally made myself some weird thought patterns which don't allow me to fix this like a normal person would do. Here are all the things i tried:

* Spamming a whole lot of keywords in my mind like: ""prohibited"", ""you are the one actually making the jokes/wit attempts"", ""accept it, don't try anything"", ""dont look for the funny side of it"", ""try to get like a ""normal"" feel"", and some other more. 
Putting some ear plugs and headphones w/ white noise so i can't hear any words or anything (so i stop doing the noticing-the-words thingy) Problem is that i can still see and do the shit wit attempts thingy. This only works inside my house because i have to go to highschool and i can't do this retarded thing in class.
* Pretending its magically ""fixed""
* Pretend as if i were normal and this is just me being a retard
* Embracing it (i still get worry and sadness)
* Praying, even though i am not religious
* Forcing myself to play videogames 24/7 to distract myself from this, even though i would prefer studying. 
* Saying to myself ""you are actually the one doing this""
And some other things. The best time of the day for me is now being in my bed, comfy with all those blankets and having nothing to worry about, but that time only lasts 15-30' until I fall asleep and have to suffer the whole next day with this weird and annoying curse. I already cried two times  these two weeks because of this retarded thing i made with my thought patterns which i honestly don't know how to fix. I bet i am the only human in the world who has reached this state. I just hope that i could erase my memory and go back to normality.

231,"Hi folks,

I apologize in advance for my lack of perfect english.

I'm in dire need of an advice and I hope you guys can just lend me your ear (eyes).

I started to attend university in september last year. Being really anxious when it comes to social interaction I was happy to hear that some old colleagues from engineering school were also starting to study at the university in the exact same field as I do. They are a rather quiet bunch of people but have no problems talking to strangers whatsoever. I try and hang around with them as much as I can because I feel really uncomfortable being on my own (at university that is).

Now the problem in the topic is actually just half the truth. I can't small-talk AT ALL. Yet it seems kind of a prerequisite to get a deeper connection with strangers. It shows clearly when we're hanging around in groups with at least one stranger. Everyone seems to contribute to any kind of topic very well. But I just can't. And even if I man up and make a comment, people never seem interested in my contribution. That really makes me feel worthless and far less eager to make any further contributions. I would be far more motivated to keep at it if people would actually give positive feedback. Just agreeing or chuckling (depending on the context of course) would be more than enough for me to gain a sense of accomplishment. But as this is not the case I feel like every conversation in a group just worsens my anxiety, in these moments I feel rather like an obstacle than an actual, equal individual.

I really don't know, where to go from here. Where to improve... I would honestly like to be a well-recieved contribution to a conversation. I've been having this problem for many years now but I always kind of ignored it. But now it's grown into an overwhelming shadow that basically denies me any kind of progress regarding social relationships (the last time I made a friend was six years ago - my first and last relationship was seven years ago). And it's getting worse and worse.

Just to clarify - this is solely about 'small-talkish' and (social-)relationship-forging conversation. I have no problem speaking in front of people (for example during a presentation). I have little to no problem going to town and running errands (and having to talk to people for that matter).

Did you ever encounter a similar problem? How did you manage to vanquish it? Thanks for reading.

233,"So I recently put a post up about a random account in a girls name I found was owned by my boyfriend and linked to his email address and a few people asked for an update, so though I'd post...
Basically I decided to confront my boyfriend last night. I started off asking him again if he had another other Instagram accounts. He said no. I then said the username of the account and he just replied cluelessly asking what I was going on about. He basically kept lying until the bitter end, despite me reassuring multiple times that I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this and I'll be super understanding whatever's going on. 

Finally after continuous lies from him, I told him I knew he had another Instagram account and showed him a picture of the account linked to his email address. He then responded with ' so I've got an account in a girls name, shock, huge discovery'. He continued to be very defensive and actually got quite angry, which involves calling me names.  

I asked him to explain the reason for the account and why he'd lied about it. His explanation is that he'd made it for work ages ago but decided not to use it and the reason he was claiming not to have another Instagram account was because he completely forgot he'd made it. 

Personally, this didn't add up to me, I can understand that you'd maybe forget but when you had the name of the account read to you surely it would jog your memory, it also doesn't explain why he got so defensive and responded the way he did when I finally showed him proof. 

So this is all I've got at the moment. Based on his response I decided to call things off. I explained that I couldn't be with someone that lied. 

I'm not sure if I've made the right decision and would love to hear other people's perspectives and theories on this! 

Thanks again!

238,"Hello. For the past 10 years or so I (32,m,USA) climbed a career path that allows to me be creative and work on good projects that's seen by lots of people. Think designer. My job is objectively really great and a lot of people would kill to get the projects I get. Over the past few years, I've found myself loathing every morning I have to go into the office or interact with clients.


Despite being a highstakes environment, I do still get some job satisfaction; I can be quite fond with how projects finish and I can sometimes really enjoy the client interactions when I'm in the midst of them.


Basically, my issues boil down to this:


-Loss of creative interest in what I'm doing + a strong sense of imposter syndrome. Maybe its being under constant creative scrutiny? Everything is subjective.


-Lack of meaning to what I'm churning out. I promote products which I in no way would support otherwise, in a very disposable way. I work on things people will actively ignore.


-Tired of putting on a ""show"" that is working with clients in my field. I often have to entertain while working with clients, and it drains my naturally introverted self.


-Long hours at the office. Work-life balance has definitely gone to the wayside. I want to feel like I have a life outside of the office.


-I've kind of peaked in my field. There isn't really anywhere to go except bigger and more stressful projects.


Ultimately, I'm feeling empty about my career. I have the biggest urge to just drop everything and take an extended period off. I don't necessarily want to keep doing this for the rest of my life, but I'm not really sure what else I'm capable of doing for a living.


I guess I don't have any specific questions, just more vague general questions. Is this just a normal thing to feel working, and I should power through? Is it a terrible idea to take some time off and float around doing arguably less stressful freelance work for a while? Is someone capable to switching career paths at my age? Any anecdotal experiences that relate to mine?


Thank you for reading and/or responding.",09Apr2018,1
239,"I started attending college 3 years ago (210 lbs.) and I was in a pretty good mental state and was overall excited for college. I have been overweight my entire life even though I played sports a lot. I was always the big kid in school, so I had major issues with my appearance. My weight has always been a struggle because I would gain weight so easily and I would have to go through strict diets and exercises to go back down with the help of my parents. Once I moved out and started attending college my life got out of control. I started gaining weight quickly and I would tell myself I would start yet another diet. The problem was that I never had the self control and the determination to go through with it in the long run. Now I’m at my 3rd year of college and I’m at 292 lbs. I now suffer from severe social anxiety when I go out in public because I feel like everybody is judging me over my weight. I will miss class because I don’t have enough clothes that fit me for the week.

I prefer long lasting battery and smooth, ridiculously smooth software. Many times I've been disappointed by phones slowing down after 3 or 2 months and I it is something I want to avoid. Now, aside from that I also don't want a phone that looks like it's 4 years old or anything. I don't care much for cameras but I guess having one above average would be ok. I've looked at a ton of phones, from the Pixel 2 (and the XL), to the Note 8 and S9, then at the OnePlus 5T, and even coming to consider the Essential PH-1 in an instance. Everywhere I look, there's complaints about all, about everything. I know no phone is perfect, but every time I kind of decide myself I see something that brings my interest about the phone down to 0. And I even took a look at some iPhones to refresh my POV a bit, but I wasn't convinced either. The only phone I haven't had the chance to try is the OnePlus 5T, which has had some love on the internet. So, that's that, I'm in a bit of a phone crisis and instead of going to biased or unheard of people making reviews (well, at least unheard to me), I thought that asking actual people with actual experiences might be a better idea. Thank you, and sorry for the wall of text.

242,"Some background. My boyfriend and I go on vacation from time to time for usually 4-7 days getaway. We always have the same routine. We typically spend much of our morning/early afternoon in the room and go out at night. We normally put the privacy hanger on the door as we are in the room when housekeeping is going around. 

We really don’t need new towels or the sheets changed during our short stays. I also try to clean the room before we check out (wipe down surfaces, put everything back, etc).

The issue is garbage. I normally bring 13 gallon garbage bags from home and fill those up. By the end of the trip we have 1-2 bags full. If the dumpster is accessible we take care of it ourselves. But most hotels have them locked. I feel like putting the bag in the hallway is just *trashy*.  (But really I hate seeing half eaten food trays sitting on the floor outside a room for hours.)

But hell, im unappreciated anyway so signed the offer letter and put in my notice. My current job loves me and offered me a promotion to the next step. Less pay but more plausible next title and is even begging for me to stay with them.

The person that will be my boss was fired from my current job. Apparently budgeting went wrong and something buckled under pressure.

The reaction? They laughed and said i better start cancelling after i stated there was no cancelations allowed.

None of the people i will be working with have any experience with what they will soon be doing.

247,"So first let me say I'm not as social as my other classmates, and by that I mean going out to party and posting on snap all the time. Rather, I'm more nerdy, preferring to play video games with friends and learning how to program, but that doesn't mean I exclude myself from being social, I'm cool with pretty much all my classmates.



 I would say I'm friends with a few of the girls in my class and mildly acquainted with the other. So, to begin where my confusion came from, it started mid-year in class (band). I was assigned a seat next to a girl (let's just call her Mary), and Mary is one of the girls I barely talked too during my entirety in High school. She smiled and said hi, and so I smiled and said hi back. 



Over time we began to talk a lot and we began to become pretty good friends. However, one day caught me off guard when she wanted to take a selfie with me and post it on her snap. I just smiled and took the picture with her. Then she began to take a selfie with me almost everyday, adding filters, swapping faces, the filter most used was the heart filter, she would always type something on the pic, but I thought it would be rude to see what she wrote and I don't have snapchat so I couldn't see for myself. I didn't take it as anything romantic, she was out of my league, and I just thought of it as us having some fun.



Then she asked me out of the blue, are you going to prom? Now remember I'm the nerdy kid who doesn't party, so I said no probably not. Then Mary started insisting I had to go and that it was a once in a life time thing. I told her, I'll think about it, and she insisted on it for 2 weeks until she forced me to say that I will probably go. I had assumed for a few months that she already had a prom date, cause she started talking about her dress color and such. Then one day she asked me, did you get your tux yet? I said no, cause I was still not sure about going (my second main reason would be because it would be awkward to attend prom alone).



Mary then said that she would cry if I wouldn't go (jokingly), I laughed and said you probably wouldn't. She said she really would, and then very quickly and quietly she said I'm going to prom alone, and then got interrupted by band music. After the music was over, Mary said that I needed to grab a date and go to prom. She then said ok what girls do you like in this school? I said no one. She paused then said ok then go with a friend, what is the first girl that comes to your mind? I paused thought about it, almost said Mary, thought this was way too awkward and so I shrugged and said I don't know and then music played again. 



After the music ended, I said why aren't you going to prom with anyone? She said, well all the guys are kind of annoying and jerky, well except for you, and all the guys that want to ask are too shy to ask. I said, why don't you ask someone out then? She said that's way too embarrassing if she got denied, and that a boy should ask the girl because the hit is less hard on guys (I could disagree on that, but I nodded my head in agreement). Music played again, and then we started talking about food. 



So I keep getting a weird feeling that she's hinting she wants to go to prom as friends, but I'm not sure on asking because I am both too nervous and awkward. Whether or not I go to prom doesn't matter to me really I would enjoy both prom and a day at home. However, if Mary wanted to go to prom with someone and didn't have someone I would definitely ask, not out of pity, but of a want to make her prom (which seems important to her) a more enjoyable and memorable experience. I don't want to ask though, because she might be waiting for the guy she likes to ask her out. Sorry for the long and weird story, thanks for the advice.

248,"Hi, I could really use some advice... I think I know what you're going to tell me to do, but maybe if I hear it enough, I'll actually listen....

I've been married for 5.5 years. When we were married for 3 years, we had a daughter who was born with health issues. We went through a very difficult time, my daughter needed surgery at 4 months old to stop the constant seizures that could have killed her. She is now almost 3... she is delayed in all areas and has significant physical disabilities (but she's not having seizures!). 

Last year, my husband and I decided that we needed to move our family across the country to be closer to my daughter’s health care providers. My husband and I were having marital troubles, so I took on the brunt of responsibility for this move... I got a new job, I arranged the moving company, I moved early with our daughter and our 2 dogs to find a new place to live by myself.

When my husband joined me in our new home, our marriage troubles just got worse. He was cruel to me. He blamed me for everything that he didn't like about his life. We went to marriage counseling and he barely participated, did not try to see the work I was doing, or do any work himself for change in our relationship. It is hard to describe the toll this time took on me. I was trying so hard to work on our relationship and do all I could for him, but he would just be cruel and dismissive. I had absolutely nothing and no one. On top of all that, I was doing all the work to set up our daughter with her special needs services and daycare, etc.

4 months after he came, I found out he had been having an affair for the past year. He had made a few trips back to our old home in order to clean out the house and facilitate the sale. But really, those trips were just to see his girlfriend. I have found out that he spent weekends with her and my daughter, they had sex in my bed, he cooked her my favorite meal that they ate on our wedding china. When he moved here, he planned to stay with us for a year. (His girlfriend had a contract to finish at work). When her contract was up, he was going to leave us and move somewhere 600 miles away with her.

As you might expect, after I found out about the affair, I was very angry. We would fight and I would say mean things to him. He started saying that he hated it here and wanted to kill himself. He said he had a plan to do it and even showed me a selfie he had taken with a belt tied around his neck. At one point he told me he had a gun and said some very vague things, threatening violence on himself.

Right before New Years, things changed. We had a heart to heart where he explained that the holidays were hard and he realized how much he wanted to be with his family. He was going to end his affair and be committed to us. So, we started trying again.

Maybe I shouldn’t have let him back in, but I love this man. He has had a difficult life, with a lot of childhood trauma. Then, I think, when we had to deal with the medical stuff with our daughter, he just lost it. I took pity on him. Also, being a single, specials needs mom is hard – he could help.

As this year went on, things were going ok. I was still angry and most of the time he would take my anger in stride. His go-to phrase was ""I know you have a right to be angry..."". But, lately, he would start getting more and more defensive and angry when I got angry and mean. He started saying ""I feel like you just won't get it until you find me dead."" Saying that my anger was driving him to want to kill himself again.

One of these fights happened last week. We got in a fight because he was not being emotionally supportive after a difficult meeting with the school district about our daughter. To help us cool down, I said I would be taking our daughter out for lunch. About 1 minute after I left I realized it was a bad idea to leave him alone and turned around. Then, on my way back I got a text message that said ""I don't think I can be alone"". Back at the house, I found him in the basement with a plastic bag over his head and a computer cable hanging from the ceiling, tied around his neck. He was in a position where if he lost consciousness, he would end up hanging. I went over, untied the cord and took the bag off. He seemed a little out of it at first, but then recovered quickly and continued being mad at me. When he got so angry he started throwing furniture and yelling at the top of his lungs in my face, I called 9-1-1.

He was taken by the police and brought to a psych ward. Then he was admitted to a mental hospital. When he was gone, I had his phone. I found his secret email address that he had used last year to communicate with his girlfriend. I found out through this email account that they broke up because she cheated on him. That is why he pleaded with me after Christmas to make our family work. He was still lying to me. There were other lies I discovered, along with a journal he's been keeping since they broke up. The past 3 months when we've been ""working on our marriage"" he has been pining for her, wishing she would drive here and declare that she's seen the light, they belong together. But, that is just a journal. He hasn't contacted her.

He called me that night from the mental hospital. He said that he had told everyone that I lied about everything because I was mad about his affair and that I had staged the scene where the suicide attempt had taken place.  He told me the only way he could get out of there was if I called and told them that I had been lying. He was sometimes crying on the phone and sometimes just plain angry at me for ""doing this to him"". I told him I would tell them I lied (I never intended to do that, I just wanted him to stop being so upset). 

The next day, I went to the mental hospital to bring him clothes and meet with the social worker. The other patients in there were so scary, he didn't belong there. He looked so pitiful. It was heartbreaking. They told me that he admitted what he had done and that he didn't actually intend to kill himself, just wanted to scare me. They said that he would be released early if I would accept him back into the house. If I didn't accept him back in to the house, he would have to go to his parents. His parents are far away, so he wouldn't be able to work, he'd lose his job. I said that yes, he could come back to my house but I didn't want to be alone with him, one of his parents would need to stay with us so that I was not responsible for him. He cried and apologized to me. He realized it was all his fault that he ended up in there. He told me he had never had a gun, he was just trying to get through to me. I told him what I had found on his phone and he cried, saying that he now has hit rock bottom and wants to work hard to make everything up to me.

The next morning I was to pick him up. When I woke up, a plan came to me. I packed up all my bags and put them in the car. I was going to pick him up from the hospital, drop him off at home and just leave. That's what I did. But, I am so susceptible to him. When he realized I was leaving, he called crying, he threatened to call the police on me because ""he thought I was going to kill myself"" and he pointed out that I was doing this to him the day he got out of a mental institution. He got through to me with that one. It probably wasn't right that I was going to abandon him right after getting out of a mental institution. So, I came back. 

And, that was the situation I was going to ask advice about. Do I leave and let him lose everything? If I do, he'll probably go through with killing himself. 

Friday, things got more complicated. I got a call from DCF (the Department of Children and Families). The police were required to call them after responding to the 9-1-1 call because our daughter was in the house. DCF is going to have to visit us. I got us a lawyer and he says not to be worried, but I'm terrified they're going to take my daughter away. I have put all my thoughts about leaving him aside so that we can work together to get through this and make sure that my daughter stays with us.

Having no choice but to team up with him to make sure our daughter stays at home helps to put the affair and other stuff to the back of my mind. But, it’s still back there. Nagging at me. Should enough be enough? Should I leave? I can’t help but hope that now that he’s “hit rock bottom”, maybe life can go back to what it used to be. Maybe we can be a family again.",09Apr2018,0

I've had scholarships for the past three years but my school screwed me over and now I only have tuition payed for.

She always says that she'll pay me back but I just payed her own loan off and she owes me for that. This loan btw will be paying for the first few months of rent as well as a car.

252,"I'll preface things by saying that my dad does not have health insurance. My mom and I do, but my dad could not be added to her plan. 

My dad has been sick on and off for roughly a week, with his symptoms being consistent over the past two days. My mom and I have offered to take him to see a doctor numerous times but he will not go. I don't feel that it's appropriate to call 911 for his situation because he's still functional and the severity of his symptoms don't justify an ambulance (at least not at the moment). From what I've seen and heard, he's having chills, muscle and abdominal pain, dehydration, and a lack of appetite. All he's taking is OTC ibuprofen. 

He can't be prescribed anything unless he sees a doctor but he absolutely refuses to go. He's shooed my mom and I away when we've offered to help. I don't know what to do. I can't stand to see or hear him in pain but he won't do anything on his part to get better. Is there anything that can be done?

TL;DR: Father is sick and refusing treatment. Mother and I have offered to help multiple times but have been told to go away. 

EDIT: He had the same thing happen about a year and a half ago. The ambulance was called and he refused to go with them. I took him to urgent care the next day and he didn't want to be treated because he didn't have insurance. I'm not sure if that was the case or if there's an underlying reason. ",09Apr2018,1

**NOTE THIS WILL BE TMI BUT IDK HOW TO WORD IT WITH ALL THE INFO NECESSARY WITHOUT THE TMI**

My mom is having issues (period issues) because of messing up on some hormones she was taking. She missed it one night and one morning and then doubled her dose the next night and morning and now she has been ""gushing"" for the last 2-3 weeks. I know that's not good but she went to the DR and now they are doing a DNC to flush out everything and see if she could possibly have cancer or what is going on, officially.

Personally, I think she just messed up on her hormones and this is happening because she isn't supposed to be having a period. She was taking the hormones because she was worried about cancer and now she is worried it may have caused cancer. She has been taking them for 2 years now.

Dr stated her lining has to be at 30cm in order for them to be worried about cancer. She is at 8cm.

Am I wrong for not being worried its cancer? Am I being really cold cause I'm not worried and just want to take it as it comes?

I see it this way. Maybe she does have cancer or heart disease or something. If she does, she would have (hopefully) caught it early enough and can treat it (hopefully). I will worry about everything when we have the official results. If she doesn't, then I was right and I didn't waste my time and stress myself out more by worrying. Basically a 'take it as it comes' approach.

Does this make me a cold person? Don't get me wrong I love my mom with all my heart. I care about her deeply. I don't WANT anything to be wrong but I can't control this. I don't want to worry about this because I want my mom to be okay.",09Apr2018,3

259,"First off, we're an Indian family so things are really stigmatized and conservative. My mom has severe cognitive decline due to dementia (she cannot have a proper conversation, physical appearance has declined, doesn't drive, can't use a phone, etc.) My dad has kind of isolated himself and mom because he has a history of lying to people (and sometimes cheating them out of things) so my parents no longer have contact with any friends here or any family nearby really. 
I feel like I'm dealing with the repercussions of all this...

My mom's dementia is already highly stigmatized in our culture and my dad has a tendency to lie to people, so the reputation of my parents/family is pretty bad. My mom was dealing with some mood disorder type thing when she was younger but still had friends + family support her, but my dad kind of isolated them once she was experiencing cognitive decline. 

My cousin's wedding is coming up soon and a lot of extended family and even old family friends will be there. My parents CAN come, but with my mom's condition she won't be coming and my dad wouldn't go without her. It's already going to be weird that they're not coming because it's their own niece's wedding, so I think everyone's going to wonder about it, and I also dislike when I go to things like this where everyone asks how my parents are doing but more importantly, they all look at me and my brother like we're associated with a *bad* family, even though my mom's condition is something we have no control over and my dad yeah, has made mistakes. 

Sure, maybe my dad's made mistakes, and yeah my mom had a history of mental illness (which is a huge taboo in indian culture unfortunately), but I just hate the stigma associated with these types of things.

283,"I don’t know if this is the right sub but fuck 

So growing up I had 4 cats, 3 Maine coon mixes and 1 domestic short hair. My parents house is pretty big, so this was never a problem. 

After I graduated high school 2 years ago, I moved out after a fight that got pretty ugly. During that time, two of my cats, one of them being the biggest culprit, started peeing around the house. Since then, my parents have gated all four of them off in the relatively small kitchen, where they stand by the gate and howl all day to be let out. They put little puppy pee pads by the litter boxes and the one problem child exclusively pees on those, while the other 3 use the boxes from what I’ve heard. 

They have 3 boxes with lids, (which some cats can develop a phobia of resulting in them peeing right outside of it or on a carpet) and refuse to try an un-lidded box because of the “mess”. I told them to get some litter mats or even a roomba but they just go “yeah maybe...” “I’ll look into it....” they could even tell my little brother to sweep up the litter when he gets home from school if it’s that much of an issue but they won’t hear it. 

I’ve also suggested opening up another room and putting a puppy pee pad in it to see if she (my problem cat) will use it instead of the carpet, but they say that’s too much work. 

And then complain that my cats constantly meow at the gate. 

To top it all off, they’re getting divorced and my mom wants to keep her favorite cat (who is extremely social with the other cats and people and would suffer living alone ESPECIALLY because my mom is NEVER home), and give the other 3 to my dad. 

But my dad is annoyed with the fact that my one cat pees and I’m scared he’s going to get rid of them. 

And I wish I could just take them but during the time we didn’t talk I ended up with two cats of my own (who both have problems but hey that’s fucking cats for you don’t adopt a pet [[[[or have KIDS]]]] if you don’t want to take care of them). 

AND ANOTHER THING, Problem Cat TM has eosinophilic ulcers, which are PAINFUL lesions on her lips that are caused by an immune system issue. The treatment is to get a shot of medicine when a flare up happens. They’re too lazy to take her to a vet and brush it off every time I bring it up or even offer to drive her to the vet myself. I wonder if the pain has anything to do with it 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 (they say she started peeing before this last flare up but holy shit. Who knows maybe it hurts before a flare up happens too I don’t know. Or maybe she had another one in an area covered by fur. Jesus Christ) 

I worry about my cats constantly because they were my best friends growing up and are the SWEETEST, friendliest bunch of fur balls you could ever imagine. They don’t deserve this misery and to be ignored in the kitchen all day. I bring it up literally every time we talk and every time I visit (I’m in Chicago, they’re in Ohio). What do I do? 

TLDR: cat has a problem with peeing, my parents solution is to lock them all in a room and ignore them all day, won’t listen to any suggestions I have (amongst other issues) 

Edit: please don’t tell me to call the cops or give them to a shelter. My parents legally own them and I’m looking for advice on how to approach this differently to make them take this a little more seriously, or steps that I can take to ensure they’re being cared for. ",09Apr2018,4

I went to the docs a few months back they told me I was beginning bronchitis. I took pills for it, prednisone I think. Never went away. I think it's weed related.

So yeahp, any information at all here would be kindly appreciated. Please don't tell me to just quit my job because that's the last thing I want here. 

I've been told a spoon full of local honey would help my lungs but not tried it. 

Thanks.",09Apr2018,1
288,"I'm almost 20 years old and just a couple of months ago I found my birth family. Almost all of my siblings (I have 10)  have contacted me but I've heard nothing from my birth parents. At first I thought they just didn't care, but now I realize it's because they didn't want to rush things which I understand. My birth parents fucked up a lot with drugs and alcohol and that's why I was adopted. I feel like I should be angry at them but for some reason I still want to talk to them, I guess it's just curiosity? I've heard mixed things about them from my siblings, so I don't know if it's a good idea. I don't even know what I would say if I were to speak to them. Should I hold off on it?",09Apr2018,5
289,"I have been with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. I currently live with her in her dorm and have been for the last 2 years. She graduates this semester and already has a job lined up and wants to get an apartment after summer break. 

When we first started dating I was a college dropout and she helped motivate me to go back to college and even helped me find a major I actually enjoy.

She is always talking about marriage and children and a couple times a week she will say a random name and ask if it's a good baby name.  I'm her first major relationship so I kind of understand why she is so attached to me but on my end, before I started going out with her I was in a relationship for 5 1/2 years. Obviously it didn't work out so I'm skeptical a lot of the time about getting married because I know relationships can end even after years of being together.

She also has pretty severe depression which she does not take medication for and on multiple occasions has said I'm the only thing that makes her happy.

We had a fight recently after I told her that when she talks about marriage and babies that it puts pressure on me to propose. When I told her this she immediately started crying and freaking out saying that ""I can see all that stuff with you and half for years"" and ""I thought we were on the same page"". And at the conclusion of the fight she gave me an ultimatum that if I didn't want all these things with her then I need to pack up my stuff by the time she gets back from work.

Now I love her but we have big fights like this about once every month or two and so I don't really feel comfortable marrying someone that I fight with a bunch but at the same time don't want to break up with her because I feel like we don't fight enough to warrant that.

It's been about a month or two now since we had that last big fight with the ultimatum and last night we went to the little pizza shop, ate, and drank a whole bunch. We were both pretty drunk and we started having sex and at one point she started saying stuff like ""your the only one that can satisfy me"" and ""I can't wait to have your babies"" etc. 

She doesn't really know this but that just made me think of that fight again and how it never really got resolved and I guess she feels like I'm totally ready for all this stuff.

I honestly still don't know if I even want kids when I get older and I feel like if I bring up the fight we had and tell her my concerns she will take that as me not wanting to be with her. But at the same time I know that it needs to be addressed but the timing is complete shit. 

We have one month of class left.
Then she graduates.
I go to Hawaii for a month for navy reserve stuff.
Then when I get back we are getting an apartment.

So if I talk to her about it now and the conversation goes south, she might wreck or job or school performance. If I wait till she graduates and I talk to her about it I feel like she will think I was using her for the free living. If I wait until after Hawaii she will get blind sided and think I cheated on her while i was away. If i wait until after we get an apartment then she is forced to live with her ex or foot the bill herself or break lease.

The whole situation sucks and any help is appreciated and I'm sorry that it's such a long read. I just wanted yall to have as much info as possible.",09Apr2018,2
290,"Hello hello Redditors! I am a 19-year-old male dating a 19-year-old female. So, I met a girl online, and we happened to hit it off pretty instantly. I took her out to a concert and we kept lining up dates. We ended up kissing on our second date. We’re not in a committed relationship yet, and I don’t really think we have to be yet, but the way I feel when I’m with her is incredible. I’ve never felt this way about any other girl I’ve dated. I want to ask her to be exclusive, but I’m scared that she’ll say no. And yes, I know the only way I’ll know is if I ask, but I don’t want to rush her into anything. For reference, we’re going out for ice cream for our fourth date today. Thanks for your advice!",09Apr2018,2
291,"About a month ago, I was looking for pictures that she had taken from our recent trip on my mom's phone.  As I was scrolling past, I saw naked pictures of her, and right next to them were naked picture of a guy who was clearly not my father. I had an idea of who the guy was, because on our trip, my mom was showing me pictures of some guy. She said he was her ex boyfriend when she was a teenager, and she asked, ""isn't he so handsome?"" I replied jokingly with something like, ""Ew, no. Ask him how WWII was."" We laughed and she rolled her eyes, and I didn't think much of it.
A few minutes later, she asked me to not tell my father. I was a little taken aback, but I chalked it down to my dad not liking her ex boyfriend or something. A few months earlier, I had seen text messages to this guy. They were sending lovey-dovey things, but I assumed it was an old friend. Once I saw these nude pictures, I pieced everything together. 
She isn't physically cheating on my father, but she's emotionally doing it, and sending nudes. I don't have the best relationship with my parents, as my father can be creepy towards me, and my mother can be really rude, but I don't want to see them fall apart. I've talked to my boyfriend about it, and he's said I've been extremely moody since I found out. I'm just so confused on what to do. I don't have any siblings, so I can't speak to someone who's in the exact same situation.  
My boyfriend's parents divorced because his father was cheating, but he was only five or six at the time. I'm turning fifteen in less than a month, so I have an influence in this situation. Do I talk to my mother first? What do I even say to her? Also, I know they're not in an open relationship. They are both very conservative when it comes to relationships, and I know my mother would have told me by now if they were. I'm sorry this is such a messy post, but I just needed to get everything out. I'm incredibly confused, and not telling anyone involved is eating away at me. Thanks.",09Apr2018,3
292,"So to get right to it, I really like working with my hands and thr field I chose to go in os mechanics, soecifically diesel mechanics. I recently graduted from a tech school last november and will have the cerimony sometime in june I think (this will be important later) so right as I got out I got a job working as a mechanic apprentice for one of the manufactures of semi-trucks. At first I loved it, working on these big machines, but fast actually I came to a sudden realisation, that I don't know if I like where I am at. I have been working here for a little over 5 months and everyday as I drive to work, I get really bad anxiety and wish the day to be over before I even get there. And I feel like I am stuck because if I quit I will owe the company $2000+ dollars (training and other stuff) and I would feel ashamed of what my family might think since they are coming down for the cerimony. Don't get me wrong I still love mechanics, I just don't think I love where I am at. I had invisioned myself going more electrical in the field because that stuff really intrests me, but I still like doing some of the mechanical work. My instructor from the diesel tech school got me this job and I would hate to go to yhe cerimony telling him I quit. I am going crazy.

A little more back story, my girlfriend and I plan on traveling for a couple of years to see the world. We talked to a lot of people and read a lot on the subject and the majority if not all say to travel while your young, before getting a house, kids, cars, etc.. and that's exactly what we want to do before we settle down, we want to explore and see the world and plan on starting by next year. Which brings me back to the first paragraph. Should I tough it out in a job that gives me bad anxiety for another 7 months, or go for the sake of my mental health and well-being, because even now the evenings are starting to stress me out because I know what waits for me in the morning. And also possibly disappointing my whole family and instructor. I have only talked to my girlfriend about this, but I have seen her get help on reddit before and thought I would give it a shot! 

Sorry if it's long and boring, but seriously any advise on the matter would be more than appreciated. ",09Apr2018,1

297,"I don’t really have any reason to look forward to my life. I laugh, and have short periods of fun every now and then. But I also feel very empty very often. I have found myself sitting around feeling glum and unable to move as I go over my thoughts. I’m not quite as cheery as I used to be, and people have taken notice (teachers, manager at a shop I frequent.) 

I don’t really have any hobbies anymore, and nothing seems to make me “long term happy.” I guess I’m not really excited about anything anymore. I used to get excited for things I cared about. I made model miniatures, I played video games. Whenever new models were released, I would be very excited, and I loved playing the model game with my friends. However, I don’t live near anyone who plays the model game anymore, other than my dad. I have since given up on it.

I used to be excited about new games coming out. I haven’t bought a new game in months. Nothing interests me. I am moderately interested in a new update coming out on Wednesday for one of my games, but I can’t say I’m excited.

I tried doing some things I thought would be inspirational and make me feel meaningful recently. I bought food for my coworkers, and I went to the beach with ice cream another day. I didn’t really feel anything, though. I don’t really understand why. 

I thought I liked helping people. Now I don’t as much. I don’t hold the doors as much. I don’t smile as much. I am still pretty good and conversing with people and pretending everything is fine, but only for short conversations.

My family has recently talked about going on vacations and whatnot. For the first time in my life, I didn’t really care about an opportunity to go on a roller coaster. The vacation to the capital that I have been wanting to go on for many years now has also lost all its weight. 

I want to get excited about something, and have something to look forward to. Something to work towards and be happy about. But I don’t anymore.

What can I do? How do I find the excitement I used to feel?",09Apr2018,8
298,"I've been living with my step mom and my dad since i was around 4.I have eally difficult feelings concerning my step mom. To the surprise of other people i do care about her and there are some good moments between us. I feel lost in what i feel because it isn't as black and white. My step still does stuff for me she she isn't truly neglectful and that makes me doubt things. I always feel like i need some type of validation or advice about my feelings because i feel so lost and mixed up. 

My step mom is frustrated often. She yells whenever she stressed, tired, sick etc. My dad has told me that she gets severe headaches sometimes and doesn't always feel well so she her being on or off her medicine affects her moods a lot. She always seems to take stuff out on me. She is super critical about stuff and is really hard to please honestly. She always have some type of issues with the clothes i wear. 

When i was younger i went to a special thing for boys and girls club.I had  two shirts one had stains the other didn't so naturally i wore the other one. My step mom made me raise my arms up to see if three shirt was too short.Because the shirt had showed my stomach she said i was trying to ""get attention"" that i ""knew what i was doing"".She said this same thing  when i had bent down to tie my shoe in footlocker when i had on shorts.She would always make me feel like i was disgusting somehow and gross. Last year we were living in a hotel because our home had flooded(we live in the south) i was taking our dog out to use the bathroom. This man has approached me and started hitting on me i was like 17 at the time so naturally i was appalled(tho i would be appaled now I'm just 19) and i had ignored him kind of laughed uncomfortably and went to the front of the hotel.My dad and my step mom had saw and when they came back into the hotel they were like why did you take him out in the front? (I wasn't supposed to ) i told them that the guy had made me uncomfortable and my step mom said that i had ""wanted the attention because i was smiling""and that i wouldn't admit it in front of my dad....

When me and boyfriend got together she became really obsessed with the notion we were having sex. My boyfriend wanted to drive my for senior prom last year and she would go from this undertsanding mom tell me ""its okay you can talk to me etc etc then the next its ungodly to even think about sex at all that ""she sees what we are doing"" and it is ""not of god "" how its suspicious he wants to drive to prom. Two months later on a family trip with my cousin she keeps berating me about ""walking funny"" at one point she even pulls me aside asks demands to tell her why I'm walking funny.   She would see a sexual context in everything. ""Why is your hair messed up? Let me find out you're doing something during the day for your hair to be messed up"" as of lately age constantly thinks im sneaking around in my friends dorm. She was also judgemental towards my sister who had a baby last year out of wedlock.She asked ""why would you talk to your sister about birth control?OBVIOUSLY  it didn't work for her""or ""your mom probably told your sister to keep her legs closed. ""My sister is 26.

She criticizes my apperance often one ssay a few months ago she went on and on about how i don't put enough effort in my apperance ands how my boyfriend would want to""keep me ugly"" so that i wont leave she took a picture of me to show me 'just how i look'.If i am wearing a hairstyle that she doesn't like or think it looks good she would say stuff like ""if somebody tells you that looks good they're lying"" to you or ""if you were out with your boyfriend he would be looking at other girls"". Shes controlling over my hair won't let me wear certain hairstyles threatens to perm my hair (I'm black with natural hair).
  She yells and overreacts over the smallest stuff.A few weeks ago i had got in the shower while she was in there by accident and when i got out she yelled at me told me i was lying about not hearing the shower she was in a rage pushing my head back with her finger telling me i have this demonic spirit in me that i probably did it on purpose... My dad had told me i ""should've paid attention more""
Last year we had moved into a trailer while we fixed up our house. Before the flood happened my chore was to mop the floors.There wasn't a mop bucket so i had used the sink.When my step mom found out she was livid she started yelling at me calling me stupid and pushing my head back with her finger. At one oint She put her hands around my neck like she was going to choke me.  She asked me where i got it from and when i said someone from my mom side of the family she screamed 'i knew it i knew it ' asked if i had been talking about her to other people andthat she just KNEW i had been talking about her i had said yes and she took my phone. 

For the past two weeks things hasnt been as tense last week she took be to a prayer circle apologized for anything hurtful shes said or done crying and asking me to forgive her. This week she's been mostly calm i haven't gotten really yelled at she tripped a little.she was sick on and off since the beginning of tyre year so she kept tripping about things as usual she was  yelling about the outfits i wear to work making me change and made me show her all the outfits i wore to work. She would ask my dad or my little bother what i was wearing over the phone and kept making me late or almost late to work with her persistent yelling. For years my dad has always brushed it to the side ""she's frustrated sick she's  off her medicine etc"" ""listen to what she says not how are says it"" ""well she did overreact a bit but you did so xyz wrong"" and I've been noticing lately how much he brushes this off.

My sister and my mom live in a different state then me.  ive been recently complaining to my sister about my step mom and i guess she was fed up so she told my mom my mom was livid and 
Called me a few days later.She said that she shouldn't be putting her hands on me like that and told me to speak to me dad about it to give him a chance to fix the issue. She said im old with to where i don't have to stay here i can with her or my sister or i can stay with my aunt who lives down here. 

So ive talked to my dad yesterday and he basically spouted the same stuff. That i know she yells and i should just deal with it and there is stuff i need to improve and do better on. That if i would open up more things would get better for me he can promise that. He said he didn't think i was ready to live with my aunt.So i called my mom during muy break at work and told her his response and told her my feelings of guilt. She said she can talk to him Monday. Apparently he's not allowed to talk to her without my step mom present so she said i have that on my side.

I feel really anxious and guilty about this situation. For one I'm not allowed to talk to anybody about ""things that go on in the house"" and then i feel guilty because things have been going somewhat well and i don't hate my step mom and i don't won't them to hate me but at the same time i don't want to be here. I doubt they would agree on mrw moving out i think they expect need to stay with them throughout the next three years of college which i really dont want to do.I would love to stay with my mom or sister but they are far away and i would love to stay with my aunt but that also bring up the complication of driving to school/ work.

TL;DR

Complicated feelings with step mom's actions need advice. ",09Apr2018,1
299,"Background- just look at my posts 

It's day 2. I am a mess. It's like its dawned on me what I've done. I've realised that I am going to be isolated at my house. I've moved from a different city and won't be moving back. Lost contact with many of my personal friends during our relationship.

In order to remedy this I have utilised meet up, I've requested to join several groups from socials to parenting. I have agreed to go to a local board game night in 2 weeks time and will be doing it every two weeks.

I've also recently joined a gym. Therefore will be using my days off to go to at least one class. I will be forcing myself to speak to the people there.

I've gone through my phone list, he's already told me that our friends are loyal to him and they won't be talking to me.

 I've only had 2 mutual friends contact me, but I don't know who knows etc and I don't want to contact them so I don't ""step on his toes"" (one which is flaky anyway- so I will put her on the back burner). 

With this in mind I have a grand total of 5 people who I can contact to hang out with/have play dates.  One of whom I've contacted but they've not replied (so probably down to 4).

How did it come to this? Are there any suggestions as to how else I can improve my social circle?

305,"So a little back story. I'm (21 male) I have been working in this local Lumber Mill near where a i live for over a year now. I started out being hired in a entry level job performing basic shop tasks), (since i basically had no idea about lumber). Ever since then i have learned a lot about lumber. I fed lumber into a ""molding"" machine ( makes crown molding, base boards, etc), And i found out one day the operator was quitting, so I asked the Co- president of the company (he hangs around the shop mostly) about maybe i could learn to operate the machine. He seemed to think for a second but stayed silent. I found out later they would move someone else over to do the job. That was fine by me tho. They then put me on Stacking lumber on the off feed side for a rip saw. 
 
One day the Truck driver for the company fell and hurt himself on the job, and i got to go with him for a few weeks and do the heavy lifting for him. Those where the best few weeks on the job for me, It was a change of scenery, something else to do. After the few weeks where up tho, it was back to the same old same old. A few months after i found out from co-workers the person i was helping on the rip saw was quitting to. I thought this was my big chance to go one rung up the ladder and be able to run his machine, since i helped him for so long, and had the knowledge of how the machine works by watching to see how the operator did it. My sank tho when i found out they had already hired someone from outside to do the job, and that i would be helping him. 

I just wish i could Move up a little, find something else to do, But i feel like there is just no ""UP"" from there, Maybe I'm just impatience or expecting to much.

I decided to apply for a co ed private school, ended up getting in, and (for a while) was pretty sure I wanted to go there. However, now, a lot of people are trying to convince me not to leave. I've had teachers come up to me, principals, and the head of the school is supposed to talk to me about it tomorrow. They all say that I won't have good teacher recommendations for college, and that I may not make friends because everyone is already friends by junior year. I've known that this school is what I wanted for a while now. I love their course options, the size, and the opportunities they offer.

Our office is small 6 including me and its a very family/friendly vibe we do work days out etc. The sole guy in the office is a bit of a douche and coincidentally is a vegan, we have probably on a daily basis an on going friendly argument about veganism and diets etc but its always been friendly banter. Basically he wants to lose weight but has 0 self control to the point where he'll come in to the office in the morning and tell us not to let him buy any sweeties at the shop etc. or if he does buy sweeties he gives them to the woman that sits next to him and asks her to only give him one a day. It should be noted we all have drawers in our desk and we all keep to some degree some food in there, whether it's sweets or tims of soup.
Last week all my colleagues decided to challenge themselves to lose a set amount of weight over the next 4 weeks but I did not agree or contribute to the conversation much as I have my own issues and dont need anyone else weighing in with their thoughts or opinions.
This morning I came into work to find my desk drawers taped shut and everything inside removed (even my coffee) except porridge sachets and soup with a label saying contraband had been confiscated.
Now even though I knew this was a poor attempt at a joke it made me really angry as who are they to dictate what I should or shouldn't eat? also what if that had been all the food I had? was I to beg for my food back??  I know they didn't mean it in those ways but thats how it felt and unfortunately later in the day I was leaving the office to go to the post office and tried to make a crack about how I was going to replace all the food that was stolen out my desk but it came out far angrier than intended so when I came back into the office everyone else was upset! One of the women gave me one of those apologies that isnt really an apology by saying that how were they to know that I wouldn't find it funny and that everyone is always in and out of each others drawers, which is sort of true but not to that extent and I certainly don't go into other peoples drawers or take any food without being given explicit permission to do so, I grew up well knowing that you never know how much food you might have (or not have) and that you should never assume because someone looks like they can afford means they can.

Long story short the mood in the office was hellish all day.
I want to apologise for being bitchy but I don't think they understand that I had a valid reason to be upset, how to I get that across without sounding like a petulant child?

Thanks guys",09Apr2018,1
318,"Hello everyone,

I'm not quite sure where to begin with this, but something really odd happened this weekend.

Let's start from the beginning... I met this girl, S, on the first day of freshman year of college. This was in 2012. We were great friends during college, and had a lot of platonic fun together. We currently have a dozen or so very close mutual friends. We essentially have the same best friends. I always cherished her and thought she was absolutely wonderful &amp; beautiful... I still do. On the surface, we aren't too similar, but I have always felt in my gut we had a lot of similar traits and were very compatible. During our years in college, we never dated, but I do believe she always knew in the back of her head that I had a crush on her. We always dated other people and we never really pursued each other besides some very light flirting, but I simply could be misinterpreting that on her end.

We graduated in 2016. I stayed to pursue a Masters degree, and she moved back home to where she grew up, which is a large city in the Midwest. This is about 4 hours from where we went to college and where I currently reside.

Lately, I have become more open and honest with my feelings. I still think about her very often, and we often exchange texts and sometimes use SnapChat. Sometimes the pictures on her end are maybe a little.. flirty? I must admit, I've sent some flirty ones too, and I think they have been well received. Hard to describe really.

Anyway.. this Saturday at around 1:30am my phone rings, and it is her calling. I instantly freak out. Heart sank. I initially let it go, because I was pretty sleepy and figured I'd just text her in the morning. She called again. At this point, I think holy shit something is wrong, so I answer. Turns out she was kind of drunk and upset. Left her friends at a bar and went home. But she didn't vent to me or complain about anything... we just chatted on the phone and laughed with each other for about 30 minutes. It was surreal. I was shaking I was so nervous. But as the call went on, I never have felt more comfortable talking with someone. Eventually, I had to leave her as I was quite tired and had a lot of work to do Sunday. She was bummed... texted me back 15 minutes after we hung up saying, ""Wait do you really have to go to sleep?"" I responded and played it cool but said yes, and she called back. I said once again I really had to get to bed, and she said something along the lines of, ""Well I think it means something if you are still awake"".. I've thought about that line a lot.. and what it meant is that I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about her. Maybe she was thinking the same about me?

Anyway... what do I do? Is this my shot to maybe tell her how I feel? I mean... she called ME at 1:30am. If she wanted someone to talk to when she was drunk, she could have called literally anyone. Maybe she was and I was the first to answer, but either way she decided to call me to chat and talk. I'm not trying to say that just because she called me she feels the same way, but I think the call is a good invitation for me to at least say something, even if she doesn't feel the same. Probably better than just randomly telling her. Sorry if this comes across as weird or whatever, but I'm tired of hiding my feelings and I feel like I should say something.

She is visiting all of our friends and the city we went to school in this upcoming weekend, and I will be seeing her Thursday, Friday, and probably Saturday. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR: Girl I have had feelings for for years randomly called. Is this my chance to at least tell her how I feel?",09Apr2018,3
319,"A year back I got offered part time as an apprentice butcher and I said yes. I needed the money and a career path opening to me sounded great. I was trained for 5 days on how to use the equipment and given a quick overview on how to cut x into y. After that they told me to do my best and ask if I had any questions. Around 10 months in I find that I'm not doing things efficiently enough and I ask for additional training because I feel like I'm making bad habits due to not understanding some things too well. I was told that corporate wouldn't give my boss additional hours for the store so couldn't be trained more. I come to find out every other butcher including my boss and his boss had worked side be side with another butcher full-time for a year before they were even left alone on a shift. I'm about to hit 12 months here where I feel they just want to stamp me as journeyman and then throw me out the door. I'm under-trained, inefficient, and unable to get the help I need to fix it.

320,"My last 2 semesters in college I had a serious episode of depression and was suicidal. It greatly impacted my daily life and I coped in not very healthy ways. I began embracing a more hedonistic lifestyle and became a part of the campus’ “hookup culture”. I lost my virginity during the fall of my senior year and after that went on to have sex with 4 other people. It’s been a year and I am just now reflecting on what I did and it’s haunting me. I’m never going to see any of these people but I do follow them on social media and vice versa. I can’t help but feel as though I might’ve gained a reputation.  My biggest regret is that I ended up sleeping with the friend of the guy I lost my virginity to. I’ve been celibate for a year and have been tested for stds and am thankful that the tests came back clear. How do I get over this? I feel dirty and like I lived a double life, my parents and family still think I’m a virgin.",09Apr2018,0
321,"My boyfriend is kind of close with one of his sister’s best friends who goes to our university. I met her once briefly and she seemed nice enough. Last night while perusing social media I saw she posted a video of them sitting in his bed. She showed him playing a video game and her making a sad face and the caption was ""pay attention to meee"". It's not that i think he'd cheat on me with her cause i know they're just good friends and I know their relationship isn't like that. I also trust him and know he wouldn’t cheat in general. But still, it just made me feel weird. If I had seen the post as an outsider I definitely would've thought they were dating just from the way it looked. Him and I were texting the whole tome and I had no clue she was there till I saw the post. I don't expect him to tell me what he's doing at all times, again I trust him, but it was just weird to go on social media while in contact with him and see that. Also he has a TV in the living room of his apartment that he's usually plays video games on if people are over, so I didn’t see a reason why they needed to be in his bed. This morning I was over at his place and he wanted to show me a funny meme she had texted him. Above the text I could see her text from the night before asking to hangout and if he’d give her a massage. His response was “only if I get one too.” Again, it’s not that I’m suspicious of anything between them, I just feel that it crossed a boundary out of respect for our relationship. Especially because if the situation were reversed, he would be uncomfortable with me giving a guy friend a massage in my bed without mentioning anything to him. I haven’t brought it up to him yet because I want to organize my thoughts first. I don’t want to sweep it under the rug because I fear that will just make me act passive aggressively. Help! Do I have any right to feel uncomfortable and like this crossed a boundary? How should I bring this up to him without sounding insecure? Should I just ignore it?",09Apr2018,3

325,"I am 18 and my girlfriend (17) and I have been dating for a year and a half. We both have mental issues of some sort and with family. I've been diagnosed with General anxiety disorder, she has a history of depression, physical and emotional abuse and PTSD from that. She lives with only her mother and sister and her father is not in her life and struggles to be comfortable around them. She also doesn't have many close friends.

I also live with my mom and my stepfather and we've had screw ups with each other the past (fighting, drug use) but now we've moved past that. My mom doesn't really try to get to know my girlfriend, when she comes over my mom never initiates any conversation, never asks me about her. Her mom talks to me when I go over her house. 

Is it bad to have such a lack of communication with everybody in that way after almost two years? 

A second point is, she's a very sensitive and attached person. When we first starting dating, we would hang out almost every day, for hours. This went on for months at a time and we tried to see each other any chance we got and it was fun. Now, I feel like I get bored whenever we hang out, there's not much to talk about, things seem dull. Even doing something new doesn't feel as exciting as it should feel with someone like my girlfriend. 

What could this mean? I also feel like we don't have a whole lot of similar interests, mainly similar personalities. I love her but I'm not sure I really do anymore. This is also both of our first time in any relationship. ",09Apr2018,1
327,Hello Reddit i am a college student doing a speech on human cloning and the ethical and legality of the subject i have to sell the class on why we should adopt this practice (hypothetically speaking) I need some legitimate sources i can use from prof. references what are some good ones ?,09Apr2018,2
328,"I’m kind of conflicted about the flair, because this is, and also isn’t about relationships because the relationship I’m going to refer to is my best friend, who I have no sexual interest in, who also has no interest towards me. This paragraph below is backstory, and I’d advise reading it.

She moved here in eighth grade and everyone at the school thought she was a complete slut. She’s absolutely beautiful. In all honesty, I thought she was kind of slutty at first, and thought she had a terrible attitude. I know it’s a terrible thing to say, but trust me we joke about it right now and it was one of those situations where people judged books by their covers. Anyways, I digress. I was really attracted to her though, and made it my goal to get to know her. I’m not that attractive myself. To put it into perspective, I’m probably a 6.5 not to sound conceited I would just probably do that, and she’s by far a 12 out of 10. I started talking to her, I added her on snapchat and tried to not be intimidated by how she looked. We found a common ground and I found she’s a huge geek, and we both were into bands like twenty one pilots and p!atd at the time. We just talked all the time since then. I was amazed that someone so pretty was actually like, being with me and liking me. This also led me to some of the best friends I have right now, who happen to be the popular pretty girls at my school. I know firsthand that they are not judgemental or bitchy like 80% of the time, and they’re actually the most supportive kindest group of people I have ever met in my entire life, and I feel so happy with them. But this girl, who is my best friend right now is someone I would choose to be with over anyone simply because I love her personality and her company. I want to put it out here right now that it’s really not like I’m ridiculously unpopular and this one beautiful girl is my only friend until she introduced me to these other people. I really do have a good deal of friends, but it’s only been almost two years and I love her more than anyone or anything. Her phone number is on my favorites next to my parents in case anything happens. It’s not one sided either, she’s the same for me which makes me so happy. I have no sexual attraction to her whatsoever and she is the same. We’re just best friends. It’s not even like a “hurr durr friendzone” type of thing either. I just enjoy her company. Two years, and she’s closer than anyone I know. 

But I feel so depressed all the time and here’s where the advice comes in. Whenever I’m with her I feel happy in the moment but dejected and waiting until next time I’m with her. I have to convince myself to myself she still loves me. I hung out with her parents for nine and a half hours yesterday, on Sunday to watch her kick ass at her volleyball tournament. They won for the first time by the way. 
But now I’m depressed listening to Boredom by Tyler the Creator thinking about the next time I’ll be able to be with her. She is the only person that makes me feel so happy. Seriously the funniest kindest person I’ve ever met. I have great friends, but when my cousin killed himself she was the first to answer her phone to console me and tell me she loved me and it would be ok, and when her dog was lost I was with her for hours looking for it in the woods.

I don’t know if I need a therapist because feeling depressed over a girl I know loves me platonically and I feel the same way is stupid, and I’ve had this conversation in a couple different ways with her. I feel silly even writing this down because I feel so stupid. I know she doesn’t hate me but if she did what would I do with myself? I need some help.

Background: I (22F) live with my ex and my family (mom and sister). My mom is your typical narcissistic parent. She gave me and my ex an eviction notice to leave but is willing to let only ME stay for 6 months so long as I get a job. She gave us the eviction notice yesterday and I had a job interview last week that I just got a call back from and got the job. 

My ex has family on the other side of the country and is planning to move back there and wants me to go with him. He’s very kind and we’re close friends, plus I think this would be a very good experience for me. My mom basically never taught me how to do anything on my own so I kind of am a pretty useless adult. My ex has definitely helped with me becoming more independent and has been teaching me how to do adult things (he helped me file my taxes, etc). He’s very important to me and although we’re not together right now, I do see us potentially getting back together and spending the rest of our lives with each other. 

However, as great as moving would be, all of my friends are here. I’ve just started getting a real social life and I don’t know if I want to give that up. My best friend (who I know I can count on) said that if I can get the 6 months, we’ll both save up and move out.

336,"So my older sister and I are both currently living at home. She graduated college last year and has been back here while applying to med school. I'm still in college but am home for a little while because of some lucky scheduling on my end. 

She recently broke up with her boyfriend and they'd been together for just over 4 years. Last week, she texted me asking me to come upstairs to talk with me about something. Long story short, she has been feeling extremely lonely and has been having trouble sleeping by herself again (sounds odd but I guess it makes sense). And, she asked if I'd sleep with her in her bed to keep her company. She was basically in tears when asking, and we've always been extremely close (at least, way closer than any other sibling relationship among the 4 total children in the family), and telling her no just seemed like the wrong move. Plus, we'd shared beds before on family vacations if need be so it wasn't completely foreign to me, even though we were much younger then. 

So, we shared her bed that night. Wasn't weird at all, aside from being spooked by the cuddling position we were in when I woke up. We never talked about it that day until nighttime when she said she was hoping I'd be okay with it again. Nothing went wrong the first time so, fuck it, sure. 

It's been a couple weeks now and this has become pretty regular thing. Some nights, she'll come home late from being out with friends and I don't make a point to wait up but if we are both home by the time it's bed time, I think she has just assumed this means I'm going to keep her company that night. 

Again, nothing odd has happened but I can't help feeling like this is weird. We both seem to understand this because we are both making sure nobody sees me coming in and out of her room in the night/morning ( I'm always the first one up out of any of my siblings anyways but still). I kinda feel like it should end now and it's going to eventually. I have to go back to school for the summer session, which she knows. It's also only a month and a half away so I guess it wouldn't be too long to stick out. 

I guess my main issue is my sister is hurting, I want to help her get over her hurt, but this isn't really helping. This is just masking the issue. I also know if I tell her no, even though she might say it's okay, I know it's going to upset her more so than she is now and that's not what I want either. Am I completely overthinking this or does it seem justified to be worried, even if she is only my sister?",09Apr2018,61

351,"He was never really there for me. When I was born he refused to acknowledge that I was his - he didn't even sign my birth certificate. During when I was 6 he started coming back into my life and whole-heartedly apologized to me. Me and my Dad started forming a relationship up until I was 16-17. I had my own personal problems and my Dad always tried to contact me but I was busy being reckless and knee-deep into alcohol addiction.

I am 22 now and everytime we end up trying to start a relationship again we always fight. We would be talking about normal things and he would just snap and start screaming bloody murder threatening to punch me in the face, telling me to shut the fuck up. I would always remain calm and try to defuse the situation but it would never work.

I always forgave my Dad but he never forgave me for blowing him off and he thinks it some sort of revenge for how he abonded me early on in my life.

Today was the first time I talked to my Dad in months, he left some brief messages some very aggressive then one that he was joking around and singing my name and stuff. So I called my Dad and he answers and we start talking about what's going on in our lives. Well not 15 minutes into the conversation he hangs up on me. I thought to myself - okay maybe it was just a phone disconnection. It wasn't. I called again he said hello? I said hey dad I don't know what happened there then he hangs up again. I call again and he does the same exact thing. I call AGAIN for the final time and it goes straight to voice mail.

I honestly 100% believe this is some sort of passive aggressive revenge for me not calling him back when he left a bunch of messages. He has an explosive temper and one minute he is normal the next he lashes out on me or then becomes zombie like and doesn't want to talk even though he initates the conversation.

When I often talk to him sometimes there is a brief silence and I don't know what to say and thats when he hangs up on me and thinks I just don't want to talk to him.

I mean his way of thinking is so off the radar I can't even explain it.

I'm pretty much tired of these games and already went through a long grieving proccess that I will probably end up not ever be close to my dad again.

I always try but it always ends with one of us being hurt. I'm beginning to think I need to cut him out of my life for good.

358,"Hello /r/ Advice. I really need some help on this problem as fast as possible. The story begins 4 years ago, when I've left my country to study somewhere else. We were a group of friends and colleagues that shared a lot of common things, basically best friends. After I left, things changed. Three of my friends went to other groups to boost their popularity and whatever, but they started to spent more time with others than with us(on facebook and in reality). Other two of my friends did the same thing and the rest grouped up with some old friends. When I first came back, the group reunited for some time, but again after I left they broke up. After 2 years of repeating this process, my friends stopped to communicate between them at all. Just two of them are still talking to me. They said that everything is done, but I didn't want to believe them. I begged them to invite the others to their birthday party (twins) so we can start the process again. The thing is one of them was at some kind of tournament and the others didn't accept it. I got really pissed and asked them for some explanation. ""It's over, we aren't going to talk anymore"". I was shocked that my own friends betrayed me in this way. Now I need some help in deciding what to do next. I know that  the explanation given by me isn't really precise, but there is still hope to repair things, but I don't know how. If anyone could give me any advice on this situation, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",09Apr2018,1

I'm taking steps in that direction (I've left Facebook, I've left Snapchat, I've left Instagram, etc.), but I feel like I should go off more.

I'm concerned (and I know this will sound stupid) about a couple things though.
1) I am literally on Reddit right now since I have nothing else to do. If I go off of the internet, what will I do instead?
2) Where should I draw the line? It's not reasonable for me to stop checking my email and throw my phone away. I'm not exactly sure what to keep using and what to stop using.
3) Having already left Facebook (and I'm never going back), how can I tell everyone that I'm going off the grid? That seems to be the responsible gesture nowadays.

362,"So I have this friend that I have been best friends with since freshman year of high school. I used to love her as a friend and loved to hang out with her. Now we're in our freshman year of college at a local community college. Since the start of the semester, she has really started to get on my nerves. She has become really clingy and annoying about hanging out with me.  If I cancel on her she gets super mad and she demands that we hang out at least once a week when I have multiple classes with her throughout the week. There are other small things that she does that makes me mad. For example, she will say she loves me in public and if I don't answer or say it quiet she will call me an asshole.  She knows we're not in a romantic relationship or anything as I'm a gay guy and she is a woman. Another example is that she will get an attitude with me if I study for a class without her. She also really wants to go to the same four-year university I plan on transferring to just because I am going there. So now whenever we hang out I don't enjoy it and I even dread looking at having to hang out with her because of how she acts with me.

365,"I want to keep it as vague as possible because I like and respect my professor a lot, and the class he is teaching leads me to believe he could possibly be a redditor though the chances are slim that he'd see this post. 

Anyways, he assigned us a project two weeks ago. Part of the project is completely related to the class subject and I was able to finish it without any problem. The other (and most important part) of the project relies on having knowledge from a class (Call it class W) which isn't a prerequisite class for the class I am taking (call it class M), and class W is actually a higher level class than class M. My professor is aware of this, so to get around it he assigned each person who has not taken class W a group partner who has taken that class (my school is very small and has small class sizes making this a viable solution). 

But my professor added the contingency that in order for the workload to be fair, each person has to be contributing to every line of code, so in essence, I would need to be sitting next to my group partner who has taken class W while he explains the code that he is writing and attempts to teach it to me also. The problem with this is that it is extremely time consuming, so in a private email my group partner said that we should skip this part so he can work on the aspect of the project that I don't know about. It would save him time from explaining everything to me, and it would give me more time to do the data entry part of the project which would take a long time in itself.

Fast forward to now, and our project is not working and it is due tomorrow. All of the data has been completely entered and we have made our website, but we can't figure out how to link the two, which is a complicated process that our professor showed us how to do in class. Admittedly, this still went over my head and I think my partner doesn't understand it either, despite having taken class W. 

We can't email our professor for help because he has already extended the deadline and expects the project to be ready by now. 

The project is worth 30% of my grade and we have nothing to show. I feel like any project should be able to be done by one person, even if it's a group project. I feel like this was not the case with this project because I barely know the information I need to know to finish the project myself. I feel like it's completely out of my control and not very fair to me.

Admittedly, we procrastinated a bit but not to the point where we had to do the whole project the night before it's due. 

So what can I even do in this situation? Try to salvage what we have and get the highest grade we can get? Should I email my professor and hope he sympathizes with me and gives me an alternate assignment for less credit? At this point I think it's too late for the latter because other people have already presented and me and my partner are the last group to present tomorrow.

370,"I have a close friend I’ve known for years. I only met her sister a few months ago, but we’re somewhat close.

So Sister recently got out of an abusive marriage. Soon after, she started drinking. She was drunk texting me once and said she had drunk more that night (so far) than she ever did in one sitting before.

I haven’t talked to her too often since then, but over the past few months, I know she has continued drinking pretty regularly. She’s also getting her own place with a new boyfriend who is also a heavy drinker.

Sister also has a history of substance abuse and almost lost her daughter to child protection over it.

I was talking to my Friend today and she said every time someone from the family talks to Sister about all the drinking lately, she gets mad, shuts everyone out and starts playing the victim.

She said that maybe she’ll react differently to me.

My thinking is that nothing I say will help until Sisters life becomes unmanageable. As long as she can plausibly hide her growing issue, she will, and she will lie to me, her family, herself, as long as she can.

But is there anything I can do to help my friends sister? Even if it’s just preparatory for the day when she cant hide it anymore?",09Apr2018,1
371,"I have a very close friend who I see as a brother. He also sees me as family. 

Unfortunately, due to severe depression and a suicide attempt in December of 2017, he was put on medication. He hasn't really given me an idea of how he felt or currently feels about being medicated. 

My broseph was on Prozac until he collapsed one day in school and I realized from research I did on it that the exhaustion that caused him to collapse (he seemed to be in a haze and was slurring and rambling) was a side effect of said medicine.

I'm assuming he changed medicine; however, he's also now taking mediciation for another condition (I don't want to say what). 

Since I was little, I've had disastrous experiences with medicine:

 I got addicted to a medicine when I was around 2-4 because it tasted good. 

I've drank disgusting smelling and tasting cough syrup or cold/allergies medicine and vomited, drooled, spat. 

I hid under a bed in my childhood home's abandoned room out of sheer fear or taking cold medicine, crying when my father was trying to get me to come out from under the bed.

My mother, who has multiple health issues, ended up taking SIX medications at once for diabetes, kidney issues, a screwed up shoulder, and other things because each medication had a side effect another covered. She ended up stopping all medicines because it just cost too much.



As a result, medicine mentions, seeing people take it, being prescribed it makes me feel very anxious. Just typing this makes my stomach feel like fucking mud.

My broski likes randomly mentioning things instead of having serious conversations or choosing a quiet, relaxed time to reveal news. 

I fear he'll randomly mention what he's now taking and it'll make me extremely uncomfortable, anxious, or sick to my stomach. 

Is there a way I can give him a heads up not to mention it with me without making him feel I don't want to hear his issues? Or perhaps a card (like a business card or something)? Last time I discussed something similar (phrases if he wanted to talk about something so I had time to script better responses and help more than if it was random) he got really quiet for a bit and he didn't really speak about much with me. 

I don't want to push my bro away, but I don't want to be vigilant either.",09Apr2018,1
372,"This is a pretty long story but basically about a month ago some Mormon missionaries stopped by my apartment (I live in a college town at a large university) and convinced me to come in and learn a little about the Church of Latter Day Saints. I'm not religious but I reluctantly agreed to come in and see what the whole Mormon thing is all about because I knew a lot of Mormons growing up and they always seemed to be well-mannered good kids. In any case, I've since learned more about Mormonism and I want to believe the things they teach you but so far I just haven't been able to get myself to buy most of it (I've never considered myself atheist but I've always been a skeptical guy and struggled with the notion of a higher power and with heaven/hell, among other things). The problem is that a new sister (female missionary) recently arrived and I've started to like her. It started the other night at dinner. I was at one of the convert's house with a few other guys from the congregation and we were waiting for some of the sisters to arrive so we could eat. When they finally arrived, the girl I've started to like seemed really excited and happy that I was there and she immediately approached me and asked how I was doing and stuff even though I'd really never even talked to her before. Eventually everyone sat down to eat and I ended up sitting across from her at the end of the table and talking to her a lot throughout dinner and again before she left. As she was leaving, she half-jokingly reminded me that I need to help her practice speaking Spanish (she was alluding to something we talked about at dinner). I'll admit that I thought she was kinda cute when I first saw her but besides that I didn't even have any feelings for her until the other night. Ever since then I haven't been able to stop thinking about her and the next time I see her. What I'm really thinking about though is the fact that she's on a mission trip, where her sole job is to convert people, and how I can't force myself to believe the stuff her and her sisters teach. I don't know what do because you can't just convert to a religion because you like the people in it, you actually have to have faith in the doctrine it teaches. 

Edit: Everyone at the church is either (1) a college/grad student like myself who has converted or (2) a Mormon missionary, so everyone is around the same age. It's basically just a fun, well-rounded friend group that hangs out all the time in both religious and secular settings, which is my favorite thing about the congregation.",09Apr2018,1

Also he threated to tell everything to my friends parents(we are childhood friends he and my friends parents are very close) and to tell my and other friends parents that lives with my first friend but only if the takeing of drugs continues.
