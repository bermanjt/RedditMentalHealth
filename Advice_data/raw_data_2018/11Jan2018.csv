I am 19 years old and from sweden. I have quit school and arent really planning on going back in the early future.

I have some work experince, mostly with people and thats what i like (restaurants and street/canvas salesman).
What i really want to do right now is to travel somewhere and i want to be able to work even though i might not have the best resumee. Try to live in another way, another climate and different people. I feel trapped where i am right now and i want to leave. There's a whole world to explore :)

I would prefer to travel with somebody because it is the first time really leaving my comfortzone but most of my friends dont have the opportunity or they arent really interested... So it looks like i'm doing it alone.

So you lovely people got any advice on where i should start looking, what i could do?

5,"I'm in my last year of high school, currently studying (or trying to) my ass off to get myself into a good school. My best friend and person sitting next to me in class has already applied and passed early at an art school, so she doesn't have to stress over this critical last year because she already passed. 

Lately she's been acting kind of weird. During the holidays, I took time off to relax and then organized a studying schedule for the next 12 days. I still spoke regularly to people I know, including her, I just didn't hang out with anyone because I didn't include it in the schedule, I didn't want to leave the house etc. we return to school and the first thing I hear from her is ""why didn't you come to my place? Am I really that unimportant to you?"" I didn't have any malicious intent, I was just so focused on studying etc that I didn't think about leaving the house for anything, and I spent my free time relaxing with family. Mind you, we hang out as much as we can so it's not like I'm flat out ignoring her! Just lately I've been very busy. I tried explaining this to the best of my abilities but as usual, she got super angry over it and didn't let me speak much. Whatever, I thought, I don't have time to go over what just happened. So I ignored the event and the days went on as normal.

Today I had surgery in my wrist for a ganglion cyst, a long overdue process. I have to rest my hand and, consequently, not attend classes for the rest of the week. I had notified the few friends I have about this, including her, and got the normal ""hope it goes well"", ""get well soon"" etc. I finally arrive home, hand in sling and sore, mind fuzzy from all the pain medication. I get the go to relax in bed, sleep for 4 hours straight and then decide to update my friends on what happened. 

Everyone shows support, as normal, but she asks me if I took pictures during the surgery. I said no, I wasn't even allowed to see and was actually drugged midway because the pain from blocking circulation to my arm was nagging me. She sounded *so disappointed*, like we had arranged it (we hadn't!). She then asked if I took the cyst home, I said I remember getting it, she immediately said PIC and I spent a few minutes searching for it, but to no avail. I told her I must have forgotten it and she said ""idiot"" and logged off for 5 hours. Whatever.

Now the latest event is her asking me to come to her place since I'm not going to school, which I got really mad about and flashed back to the messages during the holidays. I calmly said that I have to rest my hand and stay inside for a few days, I can't just hop on a bus with an arm as shit as this (hand hurts when I move fingers), and suggested she should come to my place if she wants to meet up. Now she's not talking to me, and is once again upset that ""I'm not giving her enough of my time"".

Am I in the wrong? What can I do to make this situation at least a bit better? Sorry for the wall of text, 3 different kinds of medication does that to ya, I guess.

TL;DR: Best friend thinks I'm ignoring her when I can't hang out, I try explaining I have studying etc etc and she gets mad, then gets more mad when I can't hang out even though I just had surgery in my wrist.",11Jan2018,3

14,"I was going through all my papers, bills and stuff from the past year a couple days ago and I stumbled upon three cheques from a couple months ago that I don't think I've cashed in. I almost always cash in my cheques by mobile deposit, so there is a possibility that I cashed them in, but I usually write the date I did it on the back and there isn't anything written on these. 

Now here's the thing, I used to work in a VERY small independent boutique (I'm talking under ten employees including the owner) that went bankrupt and closed down a couple weeks ago. I was thinking of reaching out to my old boss and asking her to look up if they were deposited or not (I'm not even sure how that would be done?), but I feel so so bad asking for like 2000$ when she just had to close down the business she had for 10+ years... 

I guess I already know that I need to talk to her, but I'm just wondering what's the best way to do it?

15,"Now I know this is an advice subreddit, and this may not exactly fit the mold, but I don't know where else to post this so here we go:

Ok, so I am currently in college. Last semester I had a roommate who I would describe as a stereotypical ""bro"" character (and not in a good way). He was alright, but he would make crude sexual jokes or comments that made me uncomfortable.

*Full disclosure, I am male as well. The reason the comments made me uncomfortable is that I have people who I consider to be close friends who have experienced sexual harassment and/or abuse, and I don't like it when people joke about it or don't treat it seriously.*

He had a friend on campus who would often come over to our room. This friend could also be crude, sometimes even more so than my roommate. They would watch this show and they both seemed more interested in the sexual parts of the show than the actual plot. The friend would also make jokes when the show covered serious topics.

Now, outside our room, in classes and around campus, this friend of my roommate would often wear a suit and present himself very professionally. Now this seems to be in opposition to the side I saw of him when he came to our room to hang out with my roommate.

Now my instinct, despite his public professionalism, is to pass judgment on this person as I find the side I saw of them in private abhorrent. So really, I guess my question is: What should my response be? Should I just ignore it, try to talk with him and understand him, or write him off as a jerk, or something else?",11Jan2018,1

17,"I watch police videos sometimes where it's clearly evident that the cop escalated a situation unneccessarily and someone either goes to jail or gets beat. I've had 2 very bad interactions with police in the past that have left me with hatred and thoughts of irrational behavior. It has cost me a good relationship with my cousin who's a cop and she just fails to see why it upsets me so much. She says I need to get over that shit but I haven't been able to. She also claims that she's never seen a cop use excessive force in her 20 years in Chicago PD, which I think is bullshit. I think she's just caught up in her bubble and refuses to see that cops do this shit every day without consequences.

We once got into an argument because there was an article about  people using certain medications while at work and I commented that the law should apply to cops too. She had a huge problem with *that* but not when it came to citizens. My comment was to the effect that if she didn't think a citizen should be allowed to work under the influence then there's no way I would trust a cop to make the right call under the same circumstances.

She recently cut me off social media becuase of the whole ""take a knee"" thing. I simply pointed out that her being angry about it and calling her fellow officers and service members cowards if they agreed is in poor form and that if she didn't serve, which she didn't, then she had no dog in the fight. Her father, my uncle, and all of our older uncles had been in the service so she thought that gave her the right to ""defend"" the reason they served.

How do I go about making amends without becoming a toxic asshole about it when challenged?

I also hide my stuff during the the time and its normally hidden while I'm work, and I'll come to seeing my room being looked through to get my stuff.

36,"17M. So I joined a new school this year. I'm rather a mildly social person, and I'm an introvert. So it's often hard for me to socialise with everyone.

Anyway, I've made some friends. But I'm still a stranger to the 3/4 of my class.
Normally, the solution would be to just go and talk to them regurarly.... But for some reason, I just don't do it. I feel weird. I don't share many points in common with most of them, but I don't want to remain a prospect.

I think I have social anxiety. I also have problems with my self esteem. People often make fun of me because I'm different (different culture and mindset) and they look at me as the weird guy. While this may be true, I'm a friendly weird guy. I'm taken for an hostile person, but really I'm just mature. My problem is, the person they see is not the person I am. 

Is there a way to bypass all my social issues and find a way to make friends with people without being awkward? What's making this 100x harder is that half of my classmates are little kids who keep doing childish stuff (bullying, poking jokes...).

This has got me even more reluctant to approach people, and now I don't know how to get my stuff together.

40,"I am an American who lived in Mexico for about a year and a half and learned Spanish. I'm semi fluent. I returned about 7 months ago. I am twenty five years old an live with my dad. Have never been independent. My family is really well off. I had an expensive education up till college. Dropped out after a semester. Went to community colleges off and on. 

I started frequenting a Mexican restaurant. A beautiful hostess there caught my eye. She was on a student visa. She didn't speak English. I don't have much relationship experience. Was a virgin. I eventually worked the nerve up to talk to her out after a few margaritas. There was a language barrier but we flirted. I am very tall and attractive. I eventually asked her out. We have now dated three months. I have seen her nearly everyday for these past three months. I felt like I was in a rut but she has brought me out of it. I feel more motivated to do things with my life. Sex is also amazing. She took my virginity. But not uncommon to go four rounds. I'm just trying to demonstrate that there is some chemistry. She taught me how to dance. I taught her some English. Her family knows about me. Mine knows about her. We get along great. Her student visa ran out. She is from a country that is in shambles (not Mexico). 

I was thinking about getting a place so that she could move in. She has talked about paying someone to marry or getting political asylum. But she has never suggest that person be me. She tells me shes too young to marry (for real). And I feel the same way. I'm not sure if i'm a good judge of character, but she seems like a very good person. Her cousin has shacked up with an American though their relationship isn't a complete fraud it seems tumultuous at times. She has made the last three years of my life better than the previous.

Yesterday, something was off. I picked her up from work and she seemed distant. I asked her repeatedly and she denied anything was wrong. Then she kissed me with unusual passion and started crying. She told me she found someone she could marry for a green card.  They have not yet met. We cried for a while in my car.

This girl seems genuinely good hearted. She has made these last three months fantastic. She makes me want to do more with my life. I feel like getting up off my ass for the first time in a while. I know i'm not ready for a real marriage. She isn't either. But I feel i'm ready to move in with this girl. I feel like she's something I need in my life right now to improve.

43,"(I posted this on relationship_advice and no one responded, so sorry for reposting)

We met at my high school job, and he was known around the store to be the “hot guy”. We dated but weren’t exclusive for 6 months, then became a couple. But, it was during my senior year of high school so within a few months I was going to be leaving for college.

Part of me didn’t want to go into school with a boyfriend because it was an hour away, but we really clicked and plus, it was the HOT GUY from work! 

My first year of college was amazing. I went to parties, met tons of amazing friends, joined a sorority. I’d party Friday night, then drive an hour home to spend the weekend with my boyfriend! 

I honestly don’t know where things went wrong, but all of the sudden me having guy friends was an issue, me going to parties was an issue, me not being around was an issue. So I felt obligated to drive back any time I could, even in between classes or if he needed something. I won’t say he’s controlling, because it wasn’t that he told me no, it’s that if I did those things, it hurt him and so I felt selfish and guilty and began to stop all of them. 

By my second year, I felt like I had no friends. I’d distanced myself from everyone because I was so focused on my relationship. I felt so left out seeing everyone else, but if I even went to a party it’d start a fight and end I’d end up a drunk sobbing mess that no one wanted to hang out with. 

I feel like somewhere along the way, we lost our trust, and it led to some controlling behaviors on both ends. 

I can’t even begin to explain how much I love him, I’d do anything for him. He’s family. But, i feel like i lost focus on my studies and on my life outside of him. I feel like i don’t even know myself anymore. He’s brought out qualities I’ve never seen in me, and qualities I never wanted. 

I don’t want to break up with him, god I don’t want to. But, I think we have become toxic for each other.

We fight over the smallest things, and it’s always because of something stupid. We hate each other’s friends. We barely talk because he hates being on his phone.  (Which is also another reason I drove home every weekend - if I didn’t I’d never hear from him) 

How do you leave someone you could see yourself with forever? I mean, I know someone who was in a similar situation but as soon as they moved in together a few hours away from their homes, Their problems stopped because their old friends weren’t around + when you live together you don’t fight about not talking enough because you’re literally together. 

———————

This is irrelevant but another reason I’ve been thinking about this is because I’m an engineering major, and he dropped out of college. Which didn’t bother me, until everyone judged me for being with someone who didn’t seem to have any big plans for their future like I did. And work ethic is a big thing for me and I don’t see it in him. 

I’d love to be with someone who was as focused as I am on their future and someone who shares my passion for Engineering, but it seems so superficial to say and I feel guilty even thinking that. (Feels nice to finally say it though tbh)

Well, I doubt anyone will see this, but thank you Reddit for letting me vent. This is one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make. Any advice is welcomed and appreciated.",11Jan2018,1

I am asking this question due to not being able to find specific information online. This summer internship program is for students who are very good in physics, math, computer science, and engineering. This is a highly competitive program.

I do have an interest for computer science and would like to go into that field for a future career.

I just found out about this program and the deadline to apply is next month.

Anyway, I took a seasonal job (I'm not going to say where because it's a well known company and we're not allowed to actually talk about it, but it's essentially warehouse work), and planned on leaving when my time was up so I could continue to look for a job I actually want, and work on my portfolio. 

But my sister and her whole office suddenly got laid off, and she's having issues with unemployment (the temp agency apparently listed her as 'voluntarily quit'). My family all live together, there's six of us in a small house, and with less money coming in I feel obligated to help, even though they don't expect me to because I don't make a lot. They also know I hate this job and couldn't wait to quit... 

The problem isn't just that I hate it though, the problem is that it leaves me so drained when I get home that I just don't want to work on anything for my portfolio (or anything else work-related). I just want to come home and sleep. Or at least relax my body that's usually achy. And being in the art field, it is Super important to keep updating your portfolio and keeping up with new software and such. If I ever want to get into my field I can't just stop! 

I just can't seem to balance anything with this... It feels like I have to choose: the job I hate but money, or (hopefully) the job I want and no money until I get it. But once again, it's more complicated because I want to contribute to my family. And trying to balance everything is difficult...

47,"Hello Reddit, I need your advice.
The two times I posted here you were right, so I'm going to try again and see what you think.
So I just ended a relationship that lasted almost 3years. But it was bad for almost 2 years give or take. I didn't broke up because I loved her and  I was having those thoughts of ""It will get better"". Only got worse. Maybe a couple of days of bliss but then everything went downhill again.
Because of that, my feelings started to diminish to a point where I started to think why I was with her. I didn't broke up because, to be honest, I didn't had the balls. Every day  I sayd ""It's today! I will do it!"" Only to not do it .. because something happened to her at work, or it's holiday season , etc..
But this Christmas, my family invited some friends to spend it with us. Turns out, those friends had a daughter that was gorgeous. I spent the all dinner, and the rest of the night looking at her and admiring everything in her. I got smitten so hard that I even felt guilty.
After that she added me on Facebook, and I going to talk to her but because of what happened and because I was still in a relationship I didn't. But I used that guilt to give the courage, so I decided to brake up with my girlfriend a little after the year ends. And so I did, but in the day I did the girl from Christmas messaged me. This was a week ago and I can't stop thinking about her and we talk every day
. But I'm worried that I'll hurt her because it only passed a week since my broke up.. we already talked about this and she is willing to take it slow.
Should I take the shot or should I just take her as friend? I really like her and I really don't want to hurt her. Also she is 17 and I'm 22. She will turn 18 in a couple of months. Some people say because of this mere reason that I shouldn't try anything... I dont know what to do but I want to do what my heart says so much. I think about her every second I'm awake.",11Jan2018,3
48,"I started getting these little red bumps down my back around the 24th December. On the 27th December the bumps were getting really itchy so I went to the pharmacy to get something for them. At this time they were a few and were down my back only and I didn't know the cause yet. The pharmacist prescribed me ointment to put on them and told me to wait one week and if it didn't go away, I should check my doctor. Meanwhile I thought they were bed bugs or something so I changed my bedding, my clothes, washed all my blankets, vacuumed everywhere, basically did everything to try to get rid of something that could've been biting me.

One week later and the bites didn't go away; actually I had a lot more on my legs and even more on my back. So on the 5th January I went to the doctor and she told me they were flea bites. She then gave me an injection and prescribed me two ointments (anti-allergy and relief for the itching) and anti-allergy pills, which I've been using every single day ever since. I also changed the bedding again, washed my clothes, etc, all over again.

The bites were finally getting better but today I got bitten again on my back and it's really itchy again, despite still being on the meds my doctor prescribed me. My cousin brought her dog to my house on the 23rd so I believe it was probably the cause of the fleas the first time because she doesn't use anything to get rid of fleas on her dog and the dog walks freely outside but right now I don't know what to do anymore since I can't see anything (no fleas nor flea poop, literally nothing) but they keep biting me (and only me, they don't bite my family). Also, I have a kitten but she doesn't have anything.

I vacuumed the house again today and washed more clothes but I don't how to get rid of something I can't even see.

51,"I'm starting to get very uncomfortable around my girlfriend of three months. I don't know what happened but recently whenever she touches me I feel weird and I'm finding myself avoiding texting her and calling her and such.

This wasn't a problem a month ago before we left school for winter break, and I enjoyed hanging out with her and actively sought her affection and attention. During winter break, we didn't see each other for a month but we still texted every day, but now that we're back in school everything just feels really really different and it's me it isn't her.

I don't want to hurt her, I know she is really attached to me and wants to be around me and with me and to touch me and talk to me and I really don't want her to think she's annoying me or anything. She's also a pretty key member of my main friend group so breaking up with her would effectively be breaking it off with my only real group of friends here.

I feel like a humongous asshole and during the last breakup I had  I handled it so poorly that I really did look like an asshole and I don't want people to think that about me. I really try and be nice and friendly I would never intentionally hurt anyone but not hurting people is becoming increasingly hard to do.

I know this is really long but it's getting to the point where I can tell that I'm acting differently around her and she's gonna notice something is up soon. Any advice is welcome.

62,"Now, I've thought about this post and rewrote it multiple times, so now, after much frustration, I am basically chopping it down into the most basic possible explanation. Too basic, maybe, so tell me if I need to tell more.

18yo male recently graduated, Central California.

I am so lost as to what to do with my life. I can't decide whether I should become a writer or animator. I have a grand vision for one day creating my own web series, and I'm not sure what path to take. I'm thinking of studying in college and getting a degree, since I don't have the resources to try making an indie project.

I already attended half of a semester in an Animation major, but had to take a leave of absence because of how awful I was doing. I enjoyed the experience and the college atmosphere, but my drawing and art skills were simply not there. My grades in my major-related classes were plummeting, and the stress was piling up.

Now here I am, working a part time job back home with my parents and wondering what to do next as Fall 2018 closes in.

Honestly, my true passion and strength lies i writing scripts and stories, but the problem is that I have the strong desire for my work to be visual. I'm not content with text on a screen or page. I've always been a visual-kind of person, imagining my stories and ideas as if on a screen in my mind.

But my drawing and art skills are simply not there. Even with practice, I was leagues behind all other freshmen.

I could become a writer of sorts (not an author, though), but I'm worried. Without being the one to draw characters and bring them to the screen, I'm terrified that I won't have the creative control I want over my ideas.

Maybe that's an unfounded fear, but I don't honestly know what the responsibilities and duties of writers are in productions.

I want to be the iconic figure, the mastermind behind a project. I obviously can't do everything myself, as I've already seen, and I'll need a good team/studio behind me before this project can ever begin. But I want to have the final word, to be able to say:

""Yes. This project is what I envisioned, it meets my expectations, and the characters/story are proceeding according to my ideas.""

I'm not sure wheter being a writer can grant me that. Maybe I'm just paranoid and this is an unfounded fear.

I'm so lost, I have no clue what to do.

Maybe there are better subs to be posting this to, but I need as many opinions and ideas as I can get.

Again, feel free to ask for more details.

63,"First post here, I hope this is the right place? 

So this German girl (22f) and I (24m) have been talking for a few months now, we got talking after embarrassing myself in the pub. 

Most of the conversations have been over messages since then, this is due to us being the opposite side of Australia to each other and me being out at sea (fisherman). 
The conversations have been fun, but she's not very talkative over messages and is pretty poor at replying. 

Finally finished work and am now in Sydney also. So, finally asked her if she wanted to meet up, the date kept changing because of her schedule etc, so I thought it would never happen. But, it did! I was pleasantly surprised and excited. 
We had a really good time, heaps to talk about. We were getting on very well I feel. 
Anyway, we both went to our respective homes. On departure I asked cheekily for a kiss and received one on the cheek, that'll do I suppose! 
I asked her if she had a good time, just to make sure and she said ""yes, of course. Did you?"" 
So that was on the 8th, there has not been a huge amount of talking since, I know she's had work. But her replies are really far and few in between. But since she never was good at messages before I've kind of accepted it as that. 
But I'm starting to feel more and more like I'm wasting my time. 

So, I'm just wondering what everyone thinks I should do? 
It's getting me down, feel like I'm just sitting around waiting for her to message back. 

Thanks anyway, hope some people read this!

 I skip school a lot. About once every week, sometimes more. To be clear, I dont skip during classes, its more like I wake up in the morning and just don't feel like going to school. My parents know it's a very serious issue but don't really know what to do. Sometimes they let me skip because I bring home good marks and am an overall good student except this one thing. I study for tests, hand in assignments on time and respects my peers and teachers. I have a few friends that I hang out with outside of school. During school, I can keep up normal conversations with classmates however I usually remain quiet. 

There really seems to be no reason as to why I skip school and thats what really annoys me. I can't chalk it up to anxiety or depression as I haven't been officially diagnosed. I just always get this feeling go through my body every morning that just makes me want to stay in bed and do nothing. Maybe I'm just lazy. I want to stop but don't know how. This isn't a good habit and I don't want it to impact my future.

75,"I have changed. 

When I was  younger, I had close friends and was close with my family. 

I shared my thoughts, my wins, and my struggles with my friends and they trusted me with their thoughts in return.

My relationship with my family wasn't perfect but we stayed together through the ups and downs. 

And looking back, the downs definitely overtook the ups.

A few years ago I moved to a new city. Well not exactly a city. 

The area is actually very remote with the closest city of any size about three hundred miles away.

I had no existing connections in the area.

At first I enjoyed the remote area. I spent my free time outdoors, camping and fishing. 

I remember enjoying the idea I was living a little like Hemingway.   

I work in a field with one of the highest burnout rates (usually listed somewhere just after the military and being a police officer for stress level).

The average attrition rate stands at three years.

I have been at it six years.

I'm not bragging, but I used to be an amazing employee. I worked continuously into higher positions and more responsibility. And once I reached my current position, I was doing what I aimed to do.

I don't have anything left in the tank. I haven't spoken to anyone at work in months. Maybe close to a year. 

My effectiveness at work has slipped far below my standards for myself. I have no more energy though.

I knew I would not be able to stay in this filed forever, and because of that I began training myself for a career transition a few years ago. 

I am afraid that I do not have the energy to start over. But I know I do not have the energy to continue with where I am at. 

It isn't fair to the people who depend on me or to myself. 

About six months ago I lost all contact with my family. We had been drifting apart for years.

But between my mother's emotional deterioration and my father's moral deterioration I found cutting off contact was needed in order to save myself from the intense stress of helping them with their problems.

I had been doing what I could for years, but I was running out of energy.

Approximately two years ago, I stopped socializing almost completely with people in my area. For various reasons, but basically it came down to the very small town vibe where I felt as if I couldn't cough without the entire small town discussing it.

There are people here I am cordial with, but no close friends.

Somewhere around the time I stopped speaking with my family, I began shutting off the last of my long time friends. 

I honestly am not entirely sure why I have done this. But I do not know if those relationships can ever be as close as they once were.

I recently broke up with my girlfriend of a couple years. It was a mutual breakup and while it sucks tremendously, I am sure it is for the best.

So now, I find myself entirely alone. 

I have been living with chronic stress for so many years now that I worry about permanent health damage I may have done.

I know I am exhibiting the symptoms of severe depression. I have a lot of willpower. Frankly, my stubbornness is the only thing that has kept me plugging along. Though, I don't know if that ended up being a good thing.

I am also not the type to ever complain openly or ask for advice. But I am honestly the lowest I have ever been and this is the first time in my life that I think I may not be able to come up with a solution.

My pay is not great, but I would have trouble making enough to survive on my own if I don't stay in my field. But I don't have the emotional stamina to remain in my field. 

Seeking counseling will likely be recommended and while I don't disagree, due to the field I work in and the rural community I live in, I would essentially guarantee losing my job.

I have been training myself and taking additional college courses in the tech field, but I am afraid that I am not going to find a company willing to take a chance on a career changer like myself. 

I've never turned to anyone for help like this, but I don't know where else to turn. I'm not whining and I'm not making excuses.

I'm not even sure what advice I am asking for, but I sure could use something.

tl;dr I've pushed away all my relationships. I am suffering from a major depressive episode for close to three years. I don't know where to turn as I feel I have backed myself into a career and relationship corner.

76,"Quick backstory, two years ago immediately after I graduated college I was in a head on collision that caused me to develop a neurological disorder that prevented me from moving out of my parents house. I have a service dog  that helps with my mobility and emotional distress caused by this condition. 

Fast forward to now, I'm two weeks from moving in with my boyfriend out of state. About two weeks ago my dad's dog attacked my service dog, bit him and drew blood. My service dog only yelped but my dad insisted it was my service dogs fault because he's a pitbull. Tonight, our other dog, who is super old, barked. My service dog was laying in my lap, my dad was in the other room with his dog. My dad comes flying into the room screaming at me that my service dog attacked his dog and that was what the bark was. Mind you, his dog was with him, in the other room and there was only a single bark. No yelping, no squealing, just one bark from our cattle dog. This caused a huge argument. During the course of that argument I decided that I don't want my dad in my life after I move. My mom thinks I'm overreacting.

My dad has been abusive both physically and verbally my whole life. CPS was called more than once when I was a child. My mother always makes excuses for him and stays with him no matter what he says or does. She's inconsolable and acting like the argument was my fault because I don't want to have my father in my life anymore and she's trying to guilt me into apologizing and not holding to cutting him out. My father has untreated bipolar. He refuses medication and any therapies that doctors have recommended. I wouldn't cut him out if he got help but if he doesn't I really don't see how I can ever have a positive or healthy interaction with him.

What is your advice on how I should move forward and handle this? Additionally how should I handle my mother's reaction to the whole thing?

78,"Not literally. But when someone does the smallest thing to annoy me or anything, I snap. I react in a way that I don’t recognize who I am once the emotions subside and my logic proceeds. I’m starting to think I’m bipolar or something is wrong.

Examples: 

Guy I’m dating try’s to hit my phone out of my hands in a joking and playful manner, I flip and call him immature, raise my voice and say it’s not funny. When afterward I recognize I could say something along the lines of; hey that bothered me can you not do that again please?

Or last minute canceled plans. The reaction usually depends on with whom and the situation but let’s take same guy I’m dating for example.

79,"I'm headed to college for compsci this fall and have had the idea on the backburner. In particular, Japan and Germany are intriguing places to learn about (outside of the job opportunities). For most of my life, I haven't gone much of anywhere or gotten many interesting experiences, and I suppose I should at some point. The curiosity is there, but I feel that traveling to parts with culture way different than here in the US comes with a great degree of respect for wherever I'm visiting. Beyond not knowing what I should do once there besides school, I feel that wherever I go I'd stick out like a sore thumb, especially as I don't have any heritage as far as I could trace outside the US or Western Europe.

There's so much more but it's complicated and I'm exhausted.

About a week after telling me that, I invited him to meet me and my brother at this cafe. He asked which cafe and what time, and then said he would let me know if he could make it because he had to get his drivers license picture taken because he lost his wallet (probably an excuse), then left me on read and never opened my message letting him know we had to leave early.

90,"hi reddit. a little backstory. i've refrained from coming onto here asking for help on this specific topic. it's something that hurts me, and something that'll end up in the back of my head every now and then if i don't let it out or at least vent to someone.

let's get right to it. i'm 16. in highschool. straight guy. i met this girl last year in freshman year. we've been together about 9 months and counting.

she's pretty. she's forgiving. she's nice. her heart's in the right place. she cares about me and my feelings, and cares about when i'm down. she's everything i've ever wanted, in this wonderful package. 

but her family isn't great. along with her mental health and general well being. she smokes cigs. does weed. has ""bad"" friends that encourage her to do this stuff. and she gives in. she cries a lot, thinks about wanting to die a lot, etc.

her family belongs to JW (jehova's witnesses) and they are die hard advocates for this ""cult"". among the 9 months, i've learned a lot about the JW's and what they do. they go to people's houses, ask them to have faith in their god. they have ""kingdom halls"", etc etc. her parents don't give a shit about her feelings. they never support her. they have me because i'm a guy--i'm going to spare you the details. she does not believe in this at all by the way. she is lgbt. (bi, to be exact)

a couple months into our relationship, i learned she has chronic depression and was raped by her cousin years ago. when she was a child. this made me sick to my stomach and i didn't know where to turn from there. not because of her, but all the anger that sort of formed around the whole situation she told me.

fast forward a couple months, and here we are. let me enlighten you on the current news;

about a week ago, i've noticed something was wrong, and i hesitated to ask because i've asked before and she is very personal about her problems, and doesn't say much. i agree, and don't want to dig 1000 miles down and get to the bottom of why she's feeling that way. i just feel like it isn't my position. so i don't ask.

fast forward a couple days later, and around sunday-saturday, we start having shortened convos. we exchange good morning texts, good night texts, how was your day, etc. that's it. our convos were never that short. 

and today, she told me she wanted to take a break from this whole relationship thing. i asked her friend (who's also my friend) and she said that my girlfriend feels like it's a lot of commitment, and she needs to sort her feelings out now. she also told me she feels more comfortable with girls romantically.

and i'm not sure why?? i'm so confused? this is all happening so fast, and i'm just stuck between edges on what to do.

we've built so much these past months, and i'm really just looking for a compromise so i don't go crazy. any help would be nice. thanks reddit.

Coincidentally we were paired together for a group assignment for the day and it was taking a survey (in Spanish) about whether or not you’re introverted or extroverted when it comes to relationships. All of his answers were shy / not comfortable with flirting with someone new / etc.

I myself am shy especially if I don’t know the person but this guy piques my interest. I don’t know anyone else in the class and was thinking about asking for his number.

96,"I'm so despondent about everything. Everything I try goes totally wrong. There's no escape from this hole here. I feel drained. So far, I still haven't found a real purpose in life. Sometimes, I'm afraid to get out of bed in the morning. There's nothing to get up for.  

I'm currently in college, completed my first semester and am on Christmas break for the next week. I have no job or friends. Let me give you some examples of my predicament. I basically ignored every opportunity given to me and ended up in a crappy college, all my fault. I blindly chose classes. The guy i got for my algebra course, while a very nice man with tons of great stories, was a bit of a moron and wasn't good at teaching. We spent many classes watching him fail to answer his own questions and then spend a solid hour trying to figure out why he couldn't get the answer. I got a 67 in the class and need a 70 to pass. He gave me a slip to retake the test, it expires on the 15th. No problem, I'll take it on the 15th, start studying on the 11th. Just checked the calendar and the testing center is only open until the 13th and it closes early in the morning. This means I only have half the time to study. Every class I picked for this semester relies on passing this class, I cannot move forward without it. The department test is harder than the in class test. 

This does not shock me, I've had absolutely horrific luck with college. For example, I also nearly failed English because I woke up at 4 PM on the last day with the final paper due in an hour. I somehow managed to type a 5 page paper in around 45 minutes and got a 95 on it. Just stuff like that happening constantly. I always wanted to do well but had horrible luck. It's weird because I'm normally pretty lucky. You obviously can't tell since I'm just writing my thoughts as they come to me and am not going to format or proofread this but I've always excelled in English and was tested to be reading at a high school level when I was like 5. I don't like English at all and hate reading and writing so it's a useless skill I have. 

The only thing I'm good at and like is coding. I easily passed both classes, they were child's play. But to move on, I need to pass the algebra class. I took literally the exact same algebra class in high school and got a perfect score, a 100. So, while I'm not trying to avoid responsibly and blame someone else, I legitimately believe I'm not entirely at fault and the professor could have something to do with the fact that half the class failed and the other half barely scrapped by. I honestly hate college, it really isn't my thing. It's a total chore and I'm not learning anything from my coding classes, I know it all. I'm just there for the piece of paper to prove I know what I say I know. 

I want to be a coder (Java) but I can't put up with this shit, I'd much rather keep doing it for fun and be a cashier or something if it means not having to go through this. That brings us to my other problem, I don't have a job and don't want one. I also hate leeching off people and don't believe someone who doesn't bother to work deserves handouts so I've always fantasized about taking my little catamaran down the coast and far away from here or hitchhiking across the country and never going back. I also have a Chinese visa so I could always go there, I can legally stay and it's good until sometime in the 2030s. 

Also, I'm losing my mind, as in I think I'm in the early stages of memory loss. I forget what I've done during the day when I'm going to bed and forget my middle name and the names of people I know. I have to write down everything I do and want to do so I don't forget. This would obviously render me useless as a coder. ",11Jan2018,1

101,"Hi,

This post may be more appropriate for /r/relationships or /r/relationship_advice, but they are way too idealistic over there and I fear all I will do is get angry with anything they tell me.

My relationship of ~5.5 years ended in late August. We were engaged and it was two months before our wedding. I take responsibility for ending it, as I was unhappy and felt that I needed to end it. Regardless, I am still utterly devastated. When the breakup occurred , some ugliness happened that I do not wish to get into detail about. Rest assured that it was in fact my fault, and the guilt and shame is destroying me.

I am a graduate student on the verge of getting my Ph. D. I do not make very much money. My ex comes from a rich family and when I was in the relationship I was used to the fun lifestyle that came with it. Since the breakup, I had to move into a shitty house with two undergraduate students who are nice, but me being 31 makes it very depressing. My ex has an intense personality (this was part of the reason we broke up) and, as a consequence, most of my life was her life and, in particular, most of my friends were her friends. I have not spoken to them since the breakup and they have not spoken to me. It's to the point where none of them even like my posts on social media anymore. I have re-kindled some friendships that I had from the beginning of our relationship but it just isn't the same. 
I am slowly falling apart. I still miss my ex terribly, and miss my old friends terribly as well. However, given my behavior, I can understand why they would not contact me. I have apologized to a lot of these people, but they are so loyal to my ex (I fear that she told all of them every detail of what happened) that it doesn't matter. 
I know that the usual advice with these sorts of things is ""fuck them, you don't need them"" etc. etc., but I am not that type of person. I can't do that. It is difficult if not impossible for me to cut any relationship (be that friendship or love) completely out of my life, regardless of what they did to me. It seems like it is so easy for everybody else, and I am ashamed to not be able to. 

I have tried continuing to exercise, but motivation is very difficult. I am doing it, but not nearly enough. I have even signed up for a half-marathon that I am training for. I have tried making new friends, but none of them have become that fulfilling. I am still so desperate for my old life that I am driving myself deeper and deeper into anger and depression. My work and life schedule has become incredibly erratic, with me going to bed in the early morning and sleeping until late afternoon. Since I am in graduate school, I am very busy, but have no structure since I can do my work anywhere at anytime. 

I have issues with depression and anxiety, and take medication and go to therapy regularly. I thought that ending a relationship that I perceived as tragically toxic would help, but the dramatic downgrade of my life, and the unfortunate ugliness of the breakup process has called this into question, and I am even more depressed than I was before. 

I don't know if there is anything anyone can really say for me. I know that these things take time to heal, but the reality of the scenario has been sinking in very slowly and painfully. Sometimes I can't stand to even look at myself. I am so angry at my actions and my inability to adjust to the new life that I fear my life will never recover. Meanwhile my ex is being horribly professional and seemingly well-adjusted. I can't help but feel like it is a spit in the face. Except for the loss of me (which of course is a large change), her life has not changed very much at all.

 I am terrible with impulse control and keeping a healthy schedule. I am working on it as best I can, but it is getting harder and harder to keep up. 

I am not suicidal. However, suicidal thoughts have been popping up more than usual, which is terrifying. I have no plans to hurt myself or anyone and if the thoughts continue to get worse I will of course get the help I need. They are just hard to process and escape from.

Anyway, any advice/comfort is welcome. I know that life will go on,. but it's so hard, and I am losing hope.",11Jan2018,2

This is going to sound crazy but every thing is absolutely true. 3 years ago I met a foreign exchange student. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen and I was terrified to even speak to her. One day in class we happened to be paired up and we clicked. It was crazy. She was so cool and down to earth and even tho she was from Germany and a couple thousand miles away we connected like we had known each other our whole lives. I made some very poor decisions and ended up falling out with her after a few months of the best times of my life. We reconnected right as she was about to go back and it was amazing. And then she left. Back to Germany. I knew that day that I would never see her again and it really sucked. As time went on we stopped talking every day. All those miles and that time difference will really do a number on you. I hadn't talked to her in almost a year until last week, when I got a message from her and it made my heart drop. She is coming back to America in 3 months to visit. Should be the best news ever right? Well here's the thing: I am so scared. My life has changed a lot I'm a completely different person then the one she knew. They are all good changes I think she would be so proud of how I've grown. But I also have a kid now, and I love him with all of my heart. Me and his mother aren't together so that's not an issue. The issue comes in if she comes back and we still have that spark. I can't let her leave again if it's still there. So now I debate on wether I let the woman I have spent 3 years realising was the one go back or leave my family behind and move to a foreign country.

Back in high school, I'd get great grades. They always tell you to get ready for college and a career. I felt their pressure not just because I didn't want to repeat 12th grade, but I didn't know what to study. And I still don't. I graduated HS May 2017 so last year. Am I in college? No, I currently work at Taco Bell. Fast food is sort of a demanding job, but having this job I've come to realize that I might actually have some sort of disability, hence the title.

For alot of people who started working there after I did, I saw that they learned how to make the food items in less time than I did. Whenever an MIC tells me what to do, my mind goes blank and I have to have them repeat it. I have to have some sort of short attention span or ADHD or some shit. For example, literally just yesterday around 9 last night, we had to close the front line since the dine-in room was closing and all I did was clean the grill, for which I asked my shift MIC not once, not twice, but SEVERAL TIMES if it was properly cleaned. It's not even just this. I've been working at Taco Bell for almost 6 months. 6 MONTHS. I'm always asking the general manager if I'm doing good and what else I need to be doing at a certain moment. Once again, I'll reiterate, I've been working at TB for several months and still act stupid.

Beyond my job, I feel like if I go to college it'll end in a major disaster for me. I may be good in the classes, but once I enter the real world like I already have from HS to fast food, I'll mess up horribly and have to work a dead-end job I'll also mess up badly in.

108,"I don’t how well the title explains what i mean so i’ll try to explain again. So for context; this stems from a family issue right now where my older sister is now not speaking to the family.

Her being my older sister, me being under 18, and our parents being less then ideal she has always been a support for me, and now that she isn’t speaking to us because of a fight with my parents i’m realizing how messed up i might be. Without her to talk to i’m feeling very depersonalized and depressed again and i’m thinking i’m feeling it again now because i haven’t been speaking to her about it. 
I am in therapy that will be starting full time in February so that should help when it does eventually start but i was hoping some of you might have advice on 1) how to recognize if you are too emotionally draining on someone? and 2) should you continue a relationship with someone where you confide in them and use them as emotional support but they don’t do the same? 

tl;dr I think i might be emotionally draining for my support system, how do i recognize that if it’s true? and what do you think about platonic relationships where only one of the two people feels comfortable using the other for support?

We're pretty spooked at this point and start thinking it was a box being pushed in the attic - we we're standing just below the access as well (one story house, only access is inside). Quick call to my dad who lives 7hrs away, and he recommends we call the cops. Cop comes and checks it out. I go up and check it out. Nothing. We walk around outside, no forced entry, no other signs. He leaves. I go up for a more thorough check - every dark corner, the rafters, etc. Nothing...

We give another check around the house and can't find what made the noise... WTF was it?!

I have explained to my parents that my idea of a job is kind of something that I can, like my father did, work my way up from bus boy to whatever. For example my dad, in high school worked from the box cutter boy to assistant manager at a grocery store.

I am grateful that my parents are spending money for me to be in the school that I am, but I think taking the option of making my own money away from me is bad. I know I should be grateful for what I have. Can someone talk me out of this mindset and convince me that my thinking is flawed? This has been on my mind and I really want to put these invading ideas to rest.

I haven't met too many women in my entire 28 years of existence. The only intimate relationship that I've been in was at 27 through a long distance correspondence. I met someone through Tinder last month. It felt like I had finally met someone who I could talk to. She was as miserable as me. I think that's why we connected. I due to lack of love and she due to too much of it, with the wrong people. Our interactions in the few weeks were largely about endless talks about our pasts, futures. I think I could just talk to her and that was like hooking up for me. I think once you find someone after so long. You become easily dependent on them. 

Last night she told me she's meeting her childhood friend and I canned the daily walk that was our routine. She met the guy and she seemed to impressed by him. That's when I realised that since she's turning 30 she's looking for a husband figure. This has triggered my insecurity. You see, I think I suffer from a 'Third guy syndrome'. I've always been the third Guy in every equation and I let the woman go. I think I might have let her go yesterday. Now coming back to this crippling loneliness is aching me. It's hurting me even more compared to the years of lonesomeness I've chosen to be in. I'm an insecure guy so I can't fight for attention. What should I do, other than being miserable.

122,"I've realized I don't like any of the friends I have right now.

I'm also in professional school which keeps me very busy. The path to get here was busy too and required personal sacrifices in terms of my friendships (I lost a lot of friends or didn't have time to make new ones). I see the same people in my class on a daily basis. So naturally, most of my friendships and socializing is with these people. The problem is I don't really like any of them and if it weren't for school, I definitely wouldn't be friends with them. This stems mostly from differences in our interests and what we consider ""fun"", feeling like they don't understand or relate, differing perspectives and outlooks on life, or just being too sheltered/narrow-minded.

I've realized that through every stage of my life, I've told myself that in the next stage, I'll finally meet people I'll become lifelong friends with. They'll be more mature, we'll share more interests, etc. Elementary school... high school... college... professional school... and now I've convinced myself I'll meet them when I start working. The problem is I'm scared this will just continue and I'll end up with no real friend group I actually enjoy spending time with.

I do have a few very close friends but they have all moved away for school, jobs, etc. They also never belonged in the same friend groups as I met them through different stages of my life so none of us all hung out together. Hard for me to make this happen now too since we all live in different places.

123,"Hello, thanks for reading.

I am terrified of bugs. Pretty much all of them, no matter the size. There are some that I can step on with no problems, like ants (not that I want to or that I enjoy it, but I can’t help it- I freak out), but others, especially spiders or roaches, I freeze up and start breaking down into tears, I get all shaky and have an anxiety attack. 

Tonight for example, two spiders got inside. Each of them were fairly big. It’s cold and rainy so that’s probably why they were trying to get in. The first one crept in behind me after getting the mail. I doused it with cleaner, waited for it to die, then vacuumed it up. It took a whole 30 minutes with all my crying and nonsensical breaking down.
Now the second one.... was slightly smaller than the first, but it was in my baby’s bassinet while my baby was sleeping in it. I grabbed her, shook the bassinet until the spider ran away. I did the same thing as before, crying and all.

Each spider took about 30 minutes. I’m seriously so pathetic. If I weren’t, I could just be normal and step on it. Or even escort the creepy little thing back outside! I’m so tired of being like this, especially now that I have a baby.

TL;DR: I plan on seeing a specialist to help, but I was curious as to what else I could do to help myself overcome my irrational fear of insects.",11Jan2018,1

131,"These past couple of months, I've been having some problems with my newest neighbor across the road. What started out as a simple issue of them forgetting to put their dogs away before leaving for work has transformed into something way more serious.
I live in an area outside of town where a majority of our neighbors have at least one dog or cat, and every once in a while a puppy will escape or a cat will wander through the property. I've sent a few bigger dogs back home and usually a quick chat with the neighbor is enough to cut down on the doggy escapees. I figured it would be the same with these new residents after we found their big pup harassing one of our cats. We informed them of their wayward pet and thought nothing of it for the next few days. But when the dog showed up at our house for three days in a row chasing our cats, we figured a call to animal control was in order. 
According to the officer, this lady went crazy on him. Unfortunately, since our home sits on the reservation and our newest neighbors aren't Native American, he wasn't able to do anything and told us to call the animal control officers from town next time. We didn't see the dog after that, and assumed that everything was good. 
Next thing we know, they are lighting bonfires every night. Flames high enough to see across the road, and nothing but dry grass and trees for miles. I was worried they were going to start a fire, considering a man further down the road had accidentally burned half his field while doing the same thing a few weeks before. We inform the fire department, the fires stop. This time for sure had to be the last we needed to worry about them.
While walking one of our smaller dogs, my housemate noticed our neighbor's two younger boys (maybe 12-14) wandering around in the trees behind our house carrying bb guns. He was annoyed and told them to piss off, but otherwise didn't bother telling me or bothering any further. But tonight after getting home from town my sister and I found one of our cats with a clear puncture wound going through his lower abdomen. No way another animal made that. We have no emergency vets nearby, and the earliest appointment we can get isn't until later tomorrow. We're here with our precious kitty and I'm fucking livid. 
I don't have clear proof that these kids did it, but I have no reason to suspect any of our other neighbors. I'm terrified of letting our two small dogs out, and I'm worried we might find one of our other cats in a similar condition. I'm also afraid to call Animal Control since my sister and I are Native American, and the next town is infamous for siding with non-natives when it comes to disputes on tribal land. I'm also worried about any more retaliation, or making this worse on the off chance that these neighbors really didn't do this. Tribal Cops can't do a damn thing to help us because they're non-native (even though this is all land owned by the tribe), and the few interactions me and some of my friends have had with non-tribal police out here makes me doubt they'll do a damn thing about this.
I'm stressing out and have no clue how to deal with this. If anyone has some helpful advice for us, I would greatly appreciate it.

135,"I won't go much into detail but here are the quick facts

I recently accepted a position in a company that my mothers friend owns (her husband) it is a brand activation agency (google it) and basically, the job pays $400 a month and I have to wait for a 3 month probation to lift before I can negotiate my salary as I am under probation. 

I haven't signed anything yet. at most I have just registered my thumb for getting into the building. 

The pros are

- Great environment. 
- Close to home (~8KM for 1 way) 
- Good people
- I get to go to some high-tier events. I don't know how much I can say but one of the events is a black panther premiere in my city, and other events with some large multi-nationals like Coca Cola and more who are our staple clients. 

The cons

- Money I was making $350 at a previous job, $400 here. Can only be renegotiated after probation. 
- Work hours are 9:30 to 6. I am the only punctual one with most of the office chiming in at 10. It's just me and office staff who are cleaning and stuff. 
- I have NO idea about growth. or anything else. I'll have to wait a year for my first pay bump. I will get the employment contract after my probation ends. 


The second job is a marketing agency or something. I gave the interview way back in November or so. They call me out of the blue citing being busy in other projects and now they offered me a job.

and below is their job description. 

* Develop Creative and Social Media Strategy for brand’s upcoming and ongoing campaigns.

* Research, Conceptualize and then Develop Content for the brand in accordance with briefs provided by the client

* Working Closely with the Account Manager and Design team to ensure that all the ideas are properly executed.

* Planning the roll out of the campaign(s) on social media, and other offline/onground activities related to the campaign.

* Work to prepare high impact ideas for pitching and proposals for potential clients.

* Provide quality control over concepts and projects.

* Community Management and Moderation of the social pages/digital platforms being managed for the assigned brands.



Pros

- More Money
- Work with and for many famous brands such as Mountain Dew. 

Cons

- A bit further from my home, but more money means I can work out transport. 
- No idea on the work environment, but my friend who worked there says that the woman I will be working under is a bit ""difficult"" but I have a helicopter / control freak of a mother, so I can handle women.

In High School, my family couldn’t afford it, and in college I had no job and took advantage of the fact that college students could use the city transit system for free while I lived at home. Unfortunately, I moved from a city to a town in my senior year, and my plans of taking the bus to a job after college while I learned on the side from the local driving school was obliterated. I took a job working at a gas station right near my new house that I walk to years ago and am still there now. Up until recently I was doing midnight shifts full-time to help pay off my student debt, so I was sleeping all day and working all night and didn’t have any real opportunities to learn.

I’m finally being transferred to day shifts with my new boss coming in and telling me that I shouldn’t still be on overnights after a couple years, and I asked for 1 less shift a week just to be able to give me time to find opportunities to help me get my license, but there don’t seem to be any. I still live at home, but neither one of my parents will take me out driving. I don’t really have any friends around here and the few I do either don’t have a license themselves, or don’t have a car. The one or two driving schools in the area don’t offer adult courses like the one in the city I used to live in did, and even if I threw away my dignity and took classes with teenagers, everything’s filled up till June/July. I would VERY much like to not be waiting to the Summer; I’ve waited long enough. I’m 26, I should have a goddamn license by now.

144,"So first some context, I had a friend that I'll call Miles, and Miles and I were great friends, but we would later down our friendship argue a lot. This happened because he would try to be the leader of our friend group, show off his muscles to us, and if you called him out, he would get sensitive and if we tried to joke around with him about those things well we we're harrasing him. So as you might guess we aren't friends anymore and so I just said ""we can be cool, but not friends"" and that was that. Well that was until he blocked me and my family on social media lol then it was over. Fast forward a month or so and he shows up to my sisters work place and is super nice to her and over all fake but here he tells her that ""yeah so OP blocked me first, but I'm not against being his friend again"" then says a little later "" yeah so I'm going to work at C Job and go to B school"". So here's why this is weird: first of all I never blocked him so that was a blatant lie, also he goes to A school and when we were friends was very adamant and firm on going there while I told him back then that B school was for me and for C job he worked there before and we briefly worked together when we were friends before he quit to go to A school as he didn't want to worry about work. But now that we're not friends and he knows that things did not end well despite me saying that we can be cool because he has me blocked to be petty he's going back to a job where I work, and going to the school I'm going to which is REALLY weird coincidence and that he told my sister this AND my brother knowing that they would tell me, it's almost like he's brute forcing his way back into my life and there's a lot of complications that I hope are clear because of this.

145,"To explain how I got to this point: 

(Currently I’m 22 and my brother is 20.)
When my brother and I were very young, he stole all the money out of our savings accounts that my mother and various family members had contributed to from the time we were born. When he and my mom were getting divorced, he forged a check from her Discover Card. And more recently I was told that he had a history of stealing from his father, sisters, and elderly aunts when he was in active drug &amp; alcohol addiction. My grandmother (his mom) created 529 accounts and contributed $600 a year on top of interest rates. When I graduated high school and was going to community college in 2013, she switched the accounts into my father’s name with us as beneficiaries so he could write checks on our behalf for educational purposes. What I didn’t know because I was too young and naive to realize, he started stealing money from my account basically the second he got access to it. In total I only used about $3,000 for my own education and he stole over $26,000 from my account (I only have $50 total left). He stole from my brother’s when he turned 18 as well, but less because my brother used a lot more than I did for college purposes. On December 8th, 2017 my grandmother (my mom’s mom) went to the hospital and was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I told my father that to his face when I stopped by his house to get some mail and he did not tell me anything about the stealing. He waited until my brother came home from college a thousand miles away and told him to his face, which made my brother have to tell me, and then I told my mom. He’s promised us $250 a month every month plus his tax returns. My brother’s debt would be paid back in about 5 years but mine would take about 9 and I expressed my concerns because my father has a long history of going back on his word (with child support and carrying us on his health insurance like he was legally required to do). I’m scared because legally there’s nothing we can do to make him pay us back since the accounts were under his name and SSN. When I told him this and how I wanted more per month, he told me there’s nothing more he can do. And that I “lived in his house rent free for 4 years and owe him money for car insurance”. The agreement for me living at his house rent-free after 2014 was either going to school or getting a job. I went to school online from Jan 2015 - Jan 2017 and got a job in Aug 2016. And I know I owe him the money for the car insurance, but (and I expressed this to him as well) I think it’s bullshit that he’s pulling me owing him money as if he wasn’t robbing me blind for the past almost 5 years. He threatened if I didn’t deduct what I owe him for car insurance that he’d cancel it. I said whatever mostly because I just don’t feel like arguing about it anymore. But he’s been treating me with blatant disrespect and favoritism for my brother (as he always had but even worse) - he hasn’t truly acknowledged what he did to my face whatsoever. He’s shown me that he’s a sociopath with little to no feelings or remorse. His mother and sisters will never see or speak to him again and I’m not sure I will more than I possibly have to. I’m at the point where I don’t want him to go to my future wedding, interact with my future children, or be a part of my life after the payments are done and over with. 

To the main point: I want to disassociate myself with my father as much as I possibly can, up to and including any legal rights he claims on me. I don’t want him on my birth certificate because he certainly hasn’t been what any father should be to me. My brother is grasping at straws but I’m 100% done and over everything. How can I go about doing things like that?

Edit: I want to add that my mom’s mom passed away on January 3, so this whole situation hasn’t even allowed me or my brother to mourn the sudden and devastating loss of our grandmother.",11Jan2018,4

155,"Today whilst I was eating breakfast, I heard the sound of someone trying to enter my home. At first I thought nothing of it, because I assumed it was my mother dropping by unexpectedly as she does at times. But the sound continues so my rational self figured it was coming from our next-door neighbours who had potentially locked themselves out. After finishing my breakfast I went to check at the door and through the glass opening I spotted a neighbour who lives 2 houses away from ours. This is a man between the 60-70 maybe older, but as far as I am aware he isnt senile or anything so he had no bussiness there. We had 2 previous instances where we dealt with him or his wife, 1 time were he accused me of playing hardcore loudly at 2 in the morning; I don't like hardcore, and for it to have been me the whole neighbourhood would have heard it. The 2nd instance happened a few weeks after we moved in, his wife came to our kitchen window (she had to have like crouched), whilst my mother was cooking and demanded to know why we keep the curtains closed 24/7. We are the only ethnic residents in this row of our block so I'm not sure if that plays into it.  

Now, I'm unsure whether or not I should tell my mother about it because I did not catch him directly in the act, I only saw the top of his head, which is pretty distinct, I know without doubt it is him. Also I don't want my mother to feel limited in her freedom, like she has to be on guard because the 'neighbours are trying to get her'.

I know its a cliche to say that Im capable of making a 4.0 in my next semester but even if i do that i feel like it wont matter because my gpa will only be a 2.39. i have a lot of responsibilities with my family and i live at home which i feel like definitely doesnt help me at all because the environment counteracts the one im trying to create to be conducive to succeeding. my parents are divorced and i live with each of them part time alongside my 4 siblings who i transport between houses i feel like i have enormous weights on my shoulders and dont know where to turn so any advice at all will be helpful i just dont know what to do with my life anymore.",11Jan2018,6
159,"This is a long story, but I really want to get this off my chest and hopefully get some advice. 

I'm a young girl in college who was briefly on a dating app. This was pretty out of character for me, since I'm usually shy and prefer my privacy. However, I was feeling lonely and it seemed like a convenient way to meet guys at my college.  
  So earlier this week, some international student at my college sent me a friend request and message request on Facebook. I didn't accept his friend request but did read the message, which basically said that he saw my profile on the dating app and wanted to get to know me better. It seemed relatively innocuous, although admittedly a bit creepy. He also sent a picture whose link didn't work, so that will forever remain a mystery. Anyway, the next day, after seeing that I had ignored his message, he sent a second one apologizing for ""scaring"" me. I didn't reply.

For reference, I've been staying at my parent's home for the holidays, which is located on a **dead end street** about 30 minutes from campus (assuming zero traffic, which is almost never the case). Some time after I had received the second message, my neighbor (a new dad who never sleeps) calls my house at 3:30 AM to warn my parents about a car parked in our driveway and a man pacing the house. Unfortunately, because none of us heard the phone ring, we didn't learn of this until the next morning. Meanwhile, the neighbor didn't call the police, since he thought the man might be a relative (I have brothers who live nearby and occasionally drop in). Instead, he waited until the man eventually got back in the car and drove off.

Last night my dad spotted the same car, as described by our neighbor, parked in front of our driveway late at night. Our neighbor was able to make out the license plate number from his window, and we reported it to the police along with an account of the event from the previous night. The police eventually showed up, but the car drove off minutes before they arrived. The police did, however, verify that the license plate tag belonged to the same man who had been messaging me on Facebook. They had his phone number on file and called to give him a warning.

I'm super paranoid now. I put up makeshift curtains around the house and even deactivated my Facebook. It's morning now, and I haven't slept all night. Part of me thinks I'm overreacting. At the same time, I can't get over the creepiness of this whole situation. 
 
Anyway, if you managed to read all this, I *really* appreciate it and apologize for the rambling. If anyone has been through a similar situation or wants to share their thoughts, I'd be super grateful.  

**Update**: Thanks so much for the advice, everyone. It didn't even cross my mind that the link he sent me might have been some sort of malware. My memory is hazy, but I'm not actually sure if I clicked on the link (I figured it was probably sexual). IIRC, Facebook messenger just showed ""link failed to load"" on the preview screen. McAfee and Malwarebytes didn't detect anything, so idk. I also contacted the Office of Undergrad Education, and they put me in contact with the Title IX coordinator. I'll be talking to her tomorrow about the situation, and hopefully the school can take some action. In the meantime, I figured it would probably be best to cancel my late-night movie plans. Not sure I want to come home alone at 1:00am.

He is quite a difftent type of person, an artitic soul( we both went to an art academy) and very emotional.

Ever since his break up with his gf(it wasn't a healthy relationship) at a time things were a downward spiral. His other close friend passed away, and he has been doing some drugs. 
I myslef made an efort to make him clean, helped him find a job, all the small things to keep him moving so he dosent have time to overthink things.

His parents are cool people but quite old and sick.
So i do my best to help him, talk to him about everything and norhing. But i litteraly feel he is more distant, deeply hiding himself.

Last time we went out he got really bummed out cause of some girls rejecting him thus not being able to get laid. 

I love this guy, like my brother but he's mood brings me down. Like despite my best efforts and good will nothing changes. I'd hate if something would happen to him, but don't know what to do with him anymore.

Im 21 and girlfriendless, ive been hitting the gym since 15 religiously and ive got myself a nice lean phsique. Ive been playing guitar and im picking up piano very quickly (i didnt play these because i wanted attention from girls, ive had a genuine passion for music since i can remember). 

Im not the best looking but im not ugly either, ive had many girls eyeing me before but lack of confidence holds me back from approaching, im also very insecure about my teeth and avoid smiling, i guess this gives the impression to most that im not friendly.

170,"I should've posted this on r/Korea, but I don't have enough karma to post something there. Oh, well.

I'm a foreigner who lives in South Korea, and I'm very obsessed with Japanese anime. I love the designs of the female characters; their doe-eyed face, cute and elegant hair, and the adorable dress they wear. I watch anime and sometimes draw them. Although I don't spend too much priority on anime-related things, I admit that I am getting addicted. You see, I want to go deeper into this shit. Deeper. Hang out with anime conventions, share my drawings, buy figurines, hang out with like-minded people, and even date one of them. It is THE dream of my life! I was too busy going though depression and I never had a chance to unravel this lifestyle.

At last, I overcame the depression! I want to give myself a fresh new start! Yeah, being gung-ho about anime is sort of embarrassing. However, if I hang out with other otakus, I would feel accepted. And I'm passionate about dating otaku girls. Life is exciting when my girlfriend and I watch anime and read manga together... Hanging out in anime conventions... bliss.

Unfortunately, I can't. For some reason, I came to South Korea. From my observation, not many people are into anime. I never met anyone who is interested in this. If I look at other Korean websites, this otaku lifestyle is mostly mocked at. Very frequently, I see caricatures of this subculture as a life for socially inept losers. I was offended when I saw this, and I'm getting disappointed.

Nevertheless, I have to move on. It doesn't matter how obsessed with this anime lifestyle I had become. I'm in South Korea and I have to stop or people will not accept me here. But how on EARTH am I going to do this? I have this urging desire to date with otaku girls and live in South Korea simultaneously... It's going to be a rough task...",11Jan2018,2
171,"So, I'm currently 17 years old and living with my mother. I don't have a real chance of moving out now. Anyway, my mother is really religious and extremely delusional about it. She has hung icons everywhere in the apartment, and I mean that. Every. where. I can hardly convince her not to, she even wanted to put an ""icon calender"" on the door to the living room, even though we have like 3 of them hanging across different rooms. 

She keeps spraying her holy water all over every evening, that includes technology, important papers that then shrivel up to the point where you can't read them anymore and just refusing to stop it. 

She doesn't aknowledge that that's not healthy, and thus, refuses therapy. When I was in therapy, my psychologist assumed that she was delusional in the first place. 

I was sick with the flu some weeks ago and she refused me medicine and told me that it was my fault for getting sick because I didn't pray/went to church everyday. 
I can't talk to her about anything because she brushes most things off as ""the work of the devil"" or that I just don't believe enough. 

It's really draining and tiring and I've come to hate religion, with her forcing it on me since forever. 
I don't know what to do anymore. 

Edit: I forgot to mention that she keeps donating a huge sum of money that we don't have to the church and into buying more icons and other stuff. We're into a lot of debt but she doesn't stop.
She also thinks that all doctors/psychologists are demons and want to sabotage her life and drag me away from religion.  ",11Jan2018,6
173,"Just yesterday. 1 year and 4 months, not even. A little furball of a chihuahua. She had a lot of hair for a chihuahua. A full coat. She died suddenly of a combination of a stroke and heart attack. It all happened within about 8-10 minutes until she drew her last little breath in my arms. I'm crying hysterically as I write this and I can't find peace. I cry every time I'm not doing something, like talking to people I don't want to cry near or playing an online game with people. Anything that has to do with me being alone or doing something by myself, or even just walking through my house, keeps reminding me of her in all the little ways I still remember her. I remember the good, the bad, and the moments of death. I tried so hard. She fell over when it happened and went practically limp. I held her. I tried to feed her. Her mouth was sealed shut but you could see her make the most miniscule efforts to try and eat. I wrapped a towel around her. I tried wetting her face. I held her near the heater to try and keep her warm. I even attempted CPR after she was dead, when I didn't accept it. I tried so many things, but she was robbed from me and my family here.

We took her to an animal control facility to get buried because we don't have anything but concrete property here, plus it's illegal to bury pets in my city. We cut off a small amount of hair from her tail, which we're going to keep laminated with a photo of her in a little frame with her name on it.

I can't be happy anymore. Anything I do is just to get by or pass time. I enjoy nothing. I can temporarily distract myself and lessen my thoughts on the matter, but I just can't forget. I never will, and I know time will heal me, but I just know that this will leave a permanent hole on my heart forever. It's gonna hurt me for many years to come, just like when we had to give my first dog away due to expensive sickness we couldn't afford while I was younger.

I have another dog. He's been sticking by me in this. I think he feels the sadness and pain. I just don't know what to do, though. I'm so thankful I still have the little one, but I can't help but feel so much of quite every bad feeling when I think of my dog. Seeing her in my head makes me a little happy but more sad that she isn't here with me anymore. I loved her so much, and I just can't move on from this. I have to move on from this, but I will never fully do so. What can I do to try and numb the pain? I currently look at life like a good friend that has done me wrong. I'll never like that friend even though they donated $1000 to charity, because of all the other bad things they've done. I see life that way right now. It has given me a lot, but when it takes away, nothing it gives me can make up for that betrayal.",11Jan2018,6

I did not get along with anyone, dad was constantly working, I was home alone every weekend unsupervised with the internet. Soon after hurricane sandy he got sick. We were homeless, moved a lot, couch surfed a lot. Shit has been rough but I understand other people have it worse. I haven’t been able to open up to anyone. I have trust issues. I’m guessing fear of abandonment or something idk. The only person I open up to is my mom. Whenever we communicate in the past she talks about my dad never has anything positive to say.

We drifted away a bit after a few months, and I haven't had a deep conversation with him since last October despite messaging and gaming with each other somewhat regularly. He doesn't open up about his life as much anymore, and gradually talked to me less and less. It's like he doesn't have time for me anymore. I asked him if we're still friends. He reassured me we are still friends despite him not talking much to me the past few months.

We only hung out twice since last October, but both times, he is with his girlfriend of now 4 months and I can't talk to him about stuff without his girlfriend being intrusive. I'd barely have a conversation with him because his gf would dominate the conversation. She's quite extraverted too compared to me and my friend who are introverts. I used to confide in him for everything before his girlfriend came into the picture.

I was friends with his gf before they started dating, but I didn't really like her because she doesn't keep secrets, and whenever someone mentions that what she's thinking of doing is a bad idea, she ignores it and does it anyways which leads to...bad situations, and doesn't really think about how others feel. If I talked about my love life in front of her and ask her not to tell anyone else, the whole friend group would know within a week.

Whenever I message him nowadays during the times we used to have conversations at night, we'd have small talk, and just when things are about to get erudite, he stops messaging me.

189,"Hello,
So I should probably say that for the last 5 years I have been working on myself to increase my lack of self confidence, be more assertive, be less hard on my self, etc.

So the week before Christmas I had to do some sort of ""exercise"" at the psychologist to try and get out of my head and get more in tune with my feelings. Doing this exercise I felt incredibly, uncomfortable, rushed, tired and sad. Afterwards I went to school, but I was honestly kind of dazed for the entire day. This didn't seem so strange to me at first, because sometimes those appointments can get very confrontational and exhausting for me.

The next day however, I woke up extremely emotional and tired. I was either asleep or in some sort of emotional daze and wasn't able to do any school work at all. I was worried how much this would influence my work and the psychologist I go to is only available for appointments on Tuesdays and can't really be called since he's usually busy with other appointments. Because of this I did a bit of research and got some 5-HTP pills that apparently help make serotonin if I understand it correctly. This seemed to help somewhat and I was able to focus a bit more. 

Unfortunately the pills affected me less and less after 1.5 weeks, which was luckily in vacation time. When school began I took a bigger dosis in the hopes that it helped but it didn't. I was incredibly emotional, tired and it is really ruining my focus. I contacted somebody who works at school to help and after a long talk she advised me to stop self medicating and talk to a doctor. I also had to have a talk with some of my classmates about me not feeling well and that I won't be very efficient for the foreseeable future (we work exclusively in team projects at our school) which I hated doing.

So I went to see a doctor in the hopes that she could give me some sort of anti depressants or something, just a quick fix so that I could continue working properly again. Unfortunately she didn't really wanted to do anything without discussing with the psychologist first, who as I previously mentioned is really busy. So basically I have to wait until next Tuesday which is when I have my next appointment with the psychologist, which is also the deadline for my tasks.

In the mean time I am still really struggling with doing any work at all for school. I'm not able to properly concentrate and even though the amount of work I have at the moment is low I still can't seem to make much progress. I don't want to give up even more work since I really enjoy doing it.

192,"Hi everyone, I'd greatly appreciate some support and advice.

My younger brother has recently been clinically diagnosed with depression and this was only found out after he admitted he planned to commit suicide. This happened about half a year ago and since then he has been getting help and been prescribed antidepressants and things seemed like they were getting better. Last night he overdosed on his prescriptions and has been admitted to the hospital and has been having seizures since. It's incredibly painful for my family, we can't stand to see him like this. I want nothing more than to be by his side and to be there to help him out if he has any sort of problems. I just want to be available to be a big brother for him and somehow help. He's 16 and I'm 24.

My problem is that I relocated about 10 hours away from my family with my long term girlfriend after we graduated from college this past summer. She found a great position at a nice company, but I have been struggling to find work, and to be honest I have been struggling to get over being away from my family. We've talked about how I felt about being away from them, and it's been made clear that my girlfriend has no desire to move back closer to where my family is located. 

I guess I should also mention that I have also finally received two job offers in the past two days where I'm living now. Of course this all happens at once. 

What should I do? What does the good big brother, the good son do, the good person do? My gut is telling me to move back home with my family to help support everyone. The first thing that went through my mind last night when I got the news about my brother was that maybe things would be different if I was there. We've always been close. I care about my girlfriend, but I just don't think I can twiddle my thumbs down here while my family goes through something like this. Moving back home will surely mean ending the relationship because she doesn't want to move back. I must sound so shallow even debating this issue, when it's my brother's life at hand. 

Is moving back reckless? I see this as family vs. my girlfriend and finally gaining employment.

193,"My family has become pretty fractured and broken over recent years. 

My brother (21m) has always been troubled - depressed, takes a lot of drugs and has recently been going through some issues. I have made an effort to keep in touch with him, and went to visit him at a hotel he was staying in. After sitting with him in his room for a while he nervously says he wants to ask me something and asks me not to tell anyone. 

He says: Can I see your boobs? You have really nice tits. I've thought that for years and it's always been in my mind.

My response: No. I'm your sister. That's really inappropriate. What even makes you ask?

Him: I dunno. It's just been in my head for so many years. 

Me: Sometimes weird things go through our mind. Like, 'what would happen if we eat shit?' It doesn't mean anything. Don't think about it. 

Him: I'm sorry if I've creeped you out.

I felt uncomfortable to say the least and left shortly after.

Back in 2012, someone hid a vibrator under my mattress. 2014 I received emails from a fake account asking if I had found the vibrator, used it and for me to show my tits. 

At the time and since then I was hugely freaked out and alarmed that someone who had access to my home and bedroom had done something like that. It felt malicious, I guessed it was a cousin trying to get me in trouble by my parents finding it. I now know it was my brother. He would have been perhaps 15 at the time.

Growing up, I was almost a pseudo-parent due to the age gap as my parents weren't around much. 

I'm sickened and horrified. Does he have sexual feelings towards me? What did he think would happen by him asking? Me showing him and then what? Doesn't he realise how inappropriate it is? 

I've often worried about him causing harm to others. Does he have other inappropriate sexual thoughts? Is he acting on them? 

I think back to wearing totally normal items of clothing, or not wearing a bra at home when we lived together and feel sick.

When the guy I've been dating recently showed interest in my breasts I felt uncomfortable.

I feel really upset by this. I can't talk to anyone about it. I'm no longer comfortable meeting my brother alone. Any advice would be helpful right now. ",11Jan2018,42
194,"How do you stop being single? What do I need to do to get away from the term “single”? I have this “active” dating spell that seems to never go further than 2 dates! I’m in my last years of 30s and I’m pretty much in a stage of “should be getting married.” It’s frustrating that amongst my peers I’m the only one who seem to not be taking a step forward.
Maybe I am reeking desperation? I don’t know… but what is it I should be doing and not doing in order to find that one person who could break my spell? Some of my friends have already set me up on blind dates (which was a bad idea) and some friends suggesting me to go for online dating. I am really not one who can fare well with meeting people online… it just doesn’t work for me. 
But I really don’t want to be single anymore and matchmaking sites started to catch my attention, especially this traveling for love which they call singles tour or romance tour. It’s been weighing on my mind and have been thinking why not…? But, should I really try it?! To travel thousands of miles away to meet hundreds of women… is it too far fetched or worth trying? On the bright side, I’d get to visit a country I’ve never been in and traveling doesn’t seem really bad at the moment, but to travel to find romance……. I need some advice on this. Anyone here has ever done this? :/

195,"I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible while still giving necessary context. I'm 23 and have been going to university for almost 5 years now. I initially wanted to get a Chemistry degree with a Business and Leadership minor, but I got stuck. Physical Chemistry is hard, man. My school only offers the course once a year in the fall and it is the first in a series of 3 classes. This past fall was the second time I didn't pass the course (the first time with an F, this time with a D.) After failing the first time, I decided to take more business credits because I hope to get my MBA one day. Now that I've failed again, I could get a whole International Business degree by the time I finish the Chemistry degree (barring that I pass Physical Chemistry on my 3rd try.)

Now my advisor and several members of the student life office are telling me to just get a Multidisciplinary Studies degree, but from what I can tell, I would be looking at a job market not that dissimilar from someone who didn't get a degree in the first place. I would be able to graduate by this spring, and still get a leadership minor, but I don't know if this is something I can really be proud of.
 
I think it's silly that people my age are supposed to have what career they want all figured out, but if I had to choose, I would like to be a laboratory technician in the short term, and then move into something more administrative. That being said, I really have been studying chemistry and business not to get a job, but because I'm really interested in those topics. I like to learn, and those two subjects touch on a lot of others (Chemistry-Biology, Physics, Math and International Business-Finance, Politics, Economics). 

If I take the MD Studies degree, I fear I will feel like I have quit on something I really would have been proud of. My family seems to be in total favor of finishing the degrees. My mom doesn't see the MD studies degree as an alternative, and my dad has been buying me beakers and flasks because he thinks it's so cool I'm doing chemistry, so I don't want to let them down. On the other hand, I've been hemorraging money since I've started school and been working ~30 hrs a week to keep up. I've been struggling off and on with mental illness, and fall quarter was absolutely misirable for me. I'm also beginning to think that maybe I don't need some fancier degrees. Maybe I'll just go raise Australian Shepard puppies on the outside of town, and use the money from that to build a studio so I can record and compose music in my spare time, which is something I've recently thought of doing. 

Some additonal information:

-I'm current a Building Supervisor at the recreation center I work at, so I at least have some decent job experience. 

-I'm also billed as the Worship Director at the church I work at, even though I only get paid via $50 stipend every time I lead worship.

-I always seem to have enough money at the end of the month, but this is the first time I'm seriously taking out a personal loan (~$5000 for the next year), which would would be in addition to the 30k I already have in federal student loans. 

-My living situation is great and I finally got back on health insurance, so I can start going to counseling again (yay), plus my girlfriend is super wonderful and supportive.

-My course load would not be very heavy if I decide to go for the two degrees. Average about 10-12 credits a quarter until Spring 2019 (13 is considered full-time)

197,"Title. I'm extremely claustrophobic. 

Last year I had a spine injury and I had to take an MRI. I was severely drugged (medically). Painkillers and sleep drugs and other stuffs so I managed to resist 60 minutes during MRI. 

Who did this knows it's a veryyy tiny capsule. You have air to breathe in theory, but given my claustrophobia I feel I suffocate even when I think of it. 

Also, I have to stay still for 1 hour. Unmoved in a tiny capsule with a wall that almost hits my nose-that's how tiny and close to my face it is. 


I have to do the MRI this year too. Now I'm not on any drugs  and I think straight, but I'm afraid what if I can't stay in there? 

The procedure is quite expensive And I don't want to fk the money in vain. 

I also don't want to drug myself again (meds) because It reminds me of my months of not being able to walk standing on drugs. Horrible depression. 


Please any tips how I can resisr in that capsule foe so long? What should I think of? What made you do it?

I also keep my eyes close all the time but honestly that increases my suffocation rate .. i barely breath even when I think of it now...

200,"My husband, young children and I just moved into a new apartment. Our neighbour on one side is barely existent and very quiet. The neighbours on the other side are a couple with a dog, who we have never met or spoken to.

My son is learning to walk, and likes to play by the glass sliding doors (inside) which lead out onto a shared back ""yard"" for all the apartments. They walk their dog around the same area and their dog was peeing in our bushes (I don't care if it does that), we figured they didn't know we had moved in, but would quickly figure it out because their dog got a fright when he saw my son and barked maniacally. Nothing changed, though. 

Last night at about 10:30 they either threw something at our glass doors, or slammed theirs so hard that it shook our living room and woke my children up who sleep upstairs at the other end of the apartment. 

This morning I opened our blinds to the glass doors, and there's a massive pile of dogshit on our patio. 

Unsure at this point whether they're just mindless, or if maybe they're ""those"" types who hate children and our general life noise has upset them. My kids are young, they have occasional tantrums, but in general we're pretty quiet and the only noise they'd ever hear is between 7:30am and 6:30pm. In the evenings my husband and I eat dinner and watch Netflix. We don't party, we don't play loud music or TV, we don't speak or argue loudly, we don't leave trash outside or slam doors, so I can't see what else would have upset them if they are upset. 

My question is; do I bake them something and go over to introduce myself and my family, or do I just let management deal with it?

I really don't care about being friends with them, I prefer keeping to myself anyway, I'm more interested in not having to re-settle my kids late at night and clean dogshit off my patio every time they make a peep.

201,"I went away for a few days over christmas, and when I came back, most of the toilet roll (which I bought) was gone, all of my toothpaste was gone and my shower gel. I went and bought a big carton of milk when I arrived home also. 
This one specific housemate I had a feeling was using my things, and I went and bought toothpaste and shower gel and placed them in specific areas so I'd know if they'd been touched. I came downstairs this morning and she'd used the last of the milk and hadn't bothered to buy any more (I've bought the last two now, and it's just us in the house). She went to shower about an hour ago, and I went in after her and she's definitely used my things because they're the only ones in the bathroom, and they'd been moved (toothpaste had squeeze marks on it). She squirted the last of the washing up liquid into the sink this morning as well (which I bought) and then just walked off without washing any thing.

I know these things sound really minor but I'm a student, I have literally £3 to my name right now and cannot afford to be providing for people who DEFINITELY will not replace something that is finished.

I don't know her hugely well, so that's probably why it's annoying me more than it would if it was a friend, but I feel pretty offended that she's been using my things and hasn't bothered to ask or say anything after the fact. How do I bring this up without sounding like a bitch, and how do I say it in such a way that she won't feel awkward around me in future. I'm annoyed but I don't want things to be uncomfortable between us?

203,"Good morning Reddit, I'm going to start this with the obligatory I hope this is in the correct subreddit.

I'm looking to reach out to the dealership that I bought a vehicle from about 7 months ago, on June 29th 2017. The vehicle in question is a Chevrolet Equinox 2015 model it was certified pre-owned vehicle and was in the showroom. Upon test driving the vehicle they already had to jump start the car to get it out of the showroom. My father was present with me when I purchase a car as he was just there purchasing his own truck. It was brought to attention of the sales associate about the battery which he stated it would have been replaced. We didn't think anything was wrong with the vehicle assumed it just had been sitting on the showroom possibly with some doors open.

It drove fine, it still drives fine, honestly I have not had many issues with the vehicle I have had to call roadside twice to get to jumpstart since I've purchased. Upon pickup of the vehicle we had mentioned the brakes were low and would like that looked at and replace, sales associate said it would be done. When I took the vehicle home I already had scheduled to go back up there within a few days as they had to order a new key fob to set up for my vehicle so I had two key fobs. Again I mentioned battery and brakes they said it would be taken care of.

 At my first service that was included with my purchase I put on about 5500 miles I made it known there was an audible squeak with the brakes they told me the brakes were fine the front were at 5 mm and the rear was at 8 mm.

I just got my car back from a second service from a different dealership it's a Buick dealership closer to myself who told me my rear brakes are 85% gone and are at 2 mm. The gentleman question how long it had the car and what was said to me during my last inspection which was only 6000 miles ago. He told me I had a bad cell in my battery and it needed to be replaced.

Is there anything that I can say to help me levy the situation in my favor I plan to call and I think talk to a sales manager because this is something that should have been taken care of as I told the sales associate who told me it would be taken care of and of story especially because of the CPO and it has to pass so many inspection points to be considered. I'm still covered under the 12-month 12000 mile initial warranty under a CPO purchase. I really just would love some ammunition to keep in my head so I don't get angry because I know I won't get anywhere if I get angry.

If all fails what type of consumer agency would I be able to reach out that may be able to help me something like the Better Business Bureau or a state type of organization? I live in Massachusetts.

TL;DR bought a vehicle at the end of June 2017 supposed to have brakes and battery replaced was told it was all set. First oil change mention audible squeak from brake told rear brakes 8 mm. Oil change 2 my rear brakes are at 2 mm and need to be replaced. I have a bad cell in my battery I need a new battery. This was told to me from a different GM dealer. What can I say to Levy the situation in my favor when I contact the dealership should I contact a sales manager or service manager?",11Jan2018,1
204,"Hi, this is the first time I’m posting a work related problem online. 
Actually, my boss (she’s around 40) is a very difficult person to deal with, I’ll share a small incident with you:

I am from India and work for a captive European back office company in India. 
Few days back, there was a political turmoil    in my city with two radical groups clashing. The government had advised the citizens to stay indoors because there were clashes on the street and the mob was disrupting the traffic. Being year end closing, it was impossible for us to miss office that day so frantic discussions began on the work Whatsapp group, wherein the manager said that those who can work from home please continue and don’t try to reach office. Considering that my home is far from office and I could not reach office without crossing the mob areas, I logged into my laptop and worked as hard as i would if I were at office. 
Now the situation is under control and I applied for regularisation of attendance as ‘on-duty’ for that day, but she rejected that saying since you were not in office, you should apply for a leave!

I told her that this is not fair, but she argued that many people made it to office (people who stay nearby and some people who reached office before the violence started on the streets), so you should too have reached office. 

I know it is a small matter if just a day’s leave but I feel that this is unjust and want to fight. But I cannot fight with her as she’s the boss and will get her way.. and even screw my appraisal which is due soon. Can’t escalate or contact HR as I’m aware they would take her side. 

I applied for a leave, but want to do something to raise my point. Any advise what can I do?

210,"In order for this to work, i need to lay out some context that may seem like a life story but i promise ill keep it short and concise. 

Some facts about me:
~I have a long history of anxiety 

~that anxiety has lead to multiple self harm attempts

~I have legit memory problems due to a series of youthful physical brother abuse and a greivous assault while defending a friend that left me scarred on my face, nearly 100 stitches on my head alone and thousands$$  in dental costs.

~I am very loyal and obedient, curious and foolish. But a damned good and hard worker with a work ethic i take from my father thats to the nines. 

~I have a unnerving fear of failure and rejection. 

~I have a useless partial university education in graphical art and design. 

~I have healthcare-level BLS and CPR, a partial EMR, and advanced first aid. With a strong sense of care and empathy for the sick, wounded and sad. 

~i now have advanced self defense training, handcuffing and ppct(more self defense/pressure point compliance), crisis intervention and communication training.

~im financially crippled, loans out, missed bills. No dependents and im single.

~i am an extreme introvert with no time for friends besides online gaming on occasion. 

Now i currently work healthcare security for many years. But my company isnt the most effective at keeping us happy, equipt or paid. 

But im honestly wanting to move on for many reasons, some include that due to recent very personal experiences, my old anxiety has begun to work its way deep inside more than normal (i normally spend most of my brain power pushing down my anxiety and the pressure to excel, healthcare security is a very demanding field). THIS has led me to fall short of my team mates abilities, my verbals are lacking, im only half the size as my colleagues and im masculine gay. Which all has a psychological snowballing impact. Also my R. Knee has wear and tear damage from years of physical use.

In short, i deeply feel its only a matter of time before my anxieties catch up and do real professional damage. And i want an out. But i love healthcare and want to stay in it. But cant afford to go back to school, at best a certificate program. 

I have a few job opportunities infront of me, some are my own based on preference, others are through connections, work, and friends. 

**My job now:** I work 72-96 hours each week on a 4 on 4 off rotation days then nights. 12 hrs a shift At 18/hr. I dont qualify for benefits and even if i did they are shit with my company. I work in teams, general healthcare security stuff. Lots of paperwork. High chance of injury. 

**Job1:** in my hospital, porters get paid 20-23/hr, 40 hour weeks, 8 hrs a day, days only. Government benefits, union, differential pay available. Already meet requirements and some. Huge boost to social life. 

**Job2:** offered a 'supervisor position' at my current company, several months ago that never materialized but is still a carrot on a stick in from of me. Its the same schedule as now(72-96/wk hrs, 12 hr shifts, days and nights) but apparently pays 23-26/hr. Rumor is they scrapped it but havnt told me. I meet the requirments barely. But im well respected by my company colleagues. Same situation with social life. Ill have a company truck and be primarily a 'support role'

**Job3:** offered a potential 'high probability' job in the oilfield as a millwright apprentice. This is through a good friends family who i know. It pays 20-22hr but can get up to 30 or 40 im told if i stick with it for many many years. I meet very very few of the requirments, and am not mechanically inclined. In town, chance of a social life. Requires i renew some of my oilfield tickets and new ones. But it wants me to wait until after winter for work to build up. 

**Job4:** offered to sign up with a n oilfield fracking company. **Context**, ive done roughnecking before and i crashed hard after hitch, not going back due to pressure and anxiety. Im a good shophand though.  Pay is oilfield, so astronomical. Goodbye sociallife. Requires me to renew all of my oilfield tickets. I failed my class 1(big truck license) .

**Job5:** Healthcare Aide/Client Care Assistant. Requires $4k in a certificate program. Directly in line with my interests and personality. Requires i wait, or take one of the other jobs to pay for it, which in my current situation means a year-ish. Same government benefits as porter, 12 hr shifts, nights or days or casual(meaning possibly more hours). 24-28/hr (id fall in the middle with my experience). Union work. Guarenteed work, can retire easily  on it. 
Leads to Mental Health  Aide which pays more and is more rewarding work. Downside: lack of social life outside of work.  

I want someone elses take on my situation. Feel free to request more detail where needed. All i know is that one of these options will occur in the near future. But i also know if i choose the wrong one, and it doesn't pan out, im royally fucked financially. 

Thank you.

While none of them have been illegal, I still feel guilty because I feel as if I wouldn't have gone about it the way I did back then. (I'm 22 now and was very sexual from 18-20). I've been having bits of anxiety that chalk these incidents up to rape and sexual assault, but every time I talk to someone about it, they tell me that I didn't cross the line into rape. (i.e. having sex with someone while we were both pretty drunk - not to the point where either one of us were slurring words or stumbling or passed out - but then the girl feeling distraught after the sex and being mad that we had sex while we were drunk). There's probably 3 or 4 incidents where I cringe at how I went about having sex or engaging in the sexual relations. I've been trying to rationalize the situations but I feel as if I violated the girl even though there was never a point where I've kept pressing on when a girl expressed she was uncomfortable with anything.

I'm applying for a university in Scotland at the moment, but to be honest, I have recently fallen in a hole of slacking and not finishing my assignments. I used to love school and being educated, but a mix of a bad class environment, lack of willpower and teachers who didn't care about how I did, has had a huge impact on my grades. It has reached the point where university seems improppable. I am applying for a course in film production, but even for an art course like that, I don't meet the entry requirements.

The way I see it, I have three possibilities if I don't get accepted. I can redo this school year, working harder for better grades and upping my chances. Or I can go through with my compulsary military service, save up some money and spend time building a strong film portfolio. Or I can do both.

However, it's becoming more and more apparent to me that she genuinely believes she is ugly, even though she absolutely is not. I don't understand what she sees when she looks in the mirror but it makes me so sad that she can't see what I see. 
She's a very nervous person, I have witnessed her have one panic attack but I know there have been more and I know that she barely leaves her house, except to visit me and to go to lectures (she is a student). She's such a sweet girl but she's making no friends and I can tell she's lonely. 
I have gathered through conversations about her family that mental health issues run in the family. It seems as though her father, grandfather and her sister all have bipolar disorder, and her aunt and uncle have depression that has caused many problems in their lives. I have urged her to go to a doctor or therapist because she has had issues in her past (sexual assault, bullying etc) that I think has led to her feeling down for such long periods of time and being so anxious, but she seems terrified to go. 
She's had rocky relationships with the people in her life who have bipolar disorder - her sister no longer speaks to the family and have never allowed them to see her daughter, she admitted that she loathed her grandfather for how he treated people and although she is fond of her dad, they seem to really grate off each other. 

Can I help her? She just seems so lost and vulnerable, and she is liable to blame *everything* on herself even though much of it isn't her fault. How can I help her to believe me when I say she's wonderful and beautiful, and to stop having these negative emotions? 

She is not always this low and hateful towards herself - it seems to come in bursts that last for anywhere from 2-5 months. She claims this has happened since she was 14. I believe her when she says this but I haven't known her for all of those years. This sounds like bipolar disorder to me, but I can't say because I don't know much about the condition and she is convinced it is normal and that it's not an illness

I just hope she agrees, it'll be hard to see her go when it's not her choice. But I'm worried about what my friends might say if this does happen. Will they be supportive?

219,"I'm at a cross-roads with my career: At this age, do I chase money or experience in a new position?

The situation:

1. I currently work for the federal govt. (6 mo.) and loathe this job. My health has suffered because I've become depressed working here. I make 55k now, will make 67k in 6 months and 81k in 18 months. However--my paychecks are so sad because they take so much out (~1300/biweekly). There is sporadic opportunity for OT pay. I am learning nothing. 

2. The old job I left paid me 58k, with OT so I was making around 80k a year. It was mind-numbing and boring but I had friends there and was generally a good place to work. No real new skills to be learned, but going back would be a means to an end (of my student loans).

3. I had approx. 100k+ in student loan debt and its down to near 60k. I plan to pay it off in 2 years (paying 2k a month with some bigger payments each year)

4. A new position in a new field would likely mean taking ANOTHER pay cut. Maybe somewhere near low 50s. 

5. I work a part time job ~4 nights a week to barely make ends meet. 

At this juncture--would a step in the opposite direction financially be wise in the name of learning something of value for a future career?

222,"I’m married. Next week will be a year - our relationship was strong and I had no doubts. We were together for five years before we got married, lived together for most of it. In August something happened at my second job..a girl I supervised texted me at 2 in the morning saying she had feelings for me. My wife read the text before I did and she freaked the fuck out. I responded to the girl and told her while I was flattered, I didn’t feel anything and nothing was going to happen. Wife read my response, was okay with it. But she thought I led this girl on, in the 6 years we’ve been together I have not done a single thing to make her question my loyalty. We never fought before this. She has been a completely different person ever since. We had disagreements but never fought really before we got married.

I’ve tried to calmly talk to her so many times. I suggested couples counseling. She turned it down and now I just go by myself. Things seemed to get better at Christmas. She broke down, cried, said she was jealous and bitter and was blinded by it. She has depression and anxiety and takes medication. Won’t talk to anyone about it. This weekend things got bad again for apparently no reason. She can’t or won’t say exactly what set her off. 

She’s just always mad at me. I pay all of our bills, I do all of the housework - she has a stressful job and I try to make things at home as easy as possible for her. I work two good jobs and go to school so it’s not like I’m just a lazy bum. I know it feels like I’m playing the victim here but I seriously just want my wife back. I’m willing to do whatever to figure this out but I can’t when she won’t talk to me. I met with an attorney and my financial advisor to make a plan in case she wants to end it. I told her that when things were okay and she said “I don’t blame you, I was being a bitch”. I told her I wasn’t going to put up with her treating me like shit again for no reason, she understood. 

She makes jealous comments about my friends all the time, but in the same breath says things like no one else could ever find me attractive. She can be so mean. Last night when she got home she was in a bad mood. She picked a fight and I told her we could talk about whatever was really making her upset but I wasn’t going to listen to her call me an idiot and tell me I didn’t deserve love from anyone. She didn’t want to talk..just scream. So I got up and started walking outside..she threw an empty beer bottle at the back of my head. Like, I know it wasn’t going to really hurt me but we have NEVER been physically violent at all. I only raised my voice at her for the first time right before Christmas. We’ve never laid an unloving hand on each other. This is so crazy and unlike her. It’s clear she no longer respects me. What the fuck do I do if she won’t talk to me or get help? ",11Jan2018,5

After multiple long drawn out application processes (one was for a corrections deputy took about 5 months just for them to say sorry we don't want you) I am thinking about going back to school for at least an associates in graphic design. 

I thought about switching majors my first year of college and never went through with it but now I realized I should have. 

Anyways the community college has a graphic design associates program or my college has a BA program. CC is obviously cheaper and the BA program only allows 16 transfer credits. So I would need to know which one I wanted before I started or right away when I start. 

As far as jobs go I am currently waiting for a yes or no with a warehouse job. If that is a no then I will have to get a job at the grocery store. 1 to start paying off the loans I already have and 2. Save a bit for possibly getting back to school. 

My mom and dad are super supportive of me and got me through my 4 years but I am 99% sure that would be it. (Minus maybe paying for interest on loans, or books which I usually find cheap or at least I did for my 4 years) But they are not pushing me out the door or anything like that. They just want me to find a job and start making money. 

But this is like my first day considering it. I have a therapist I have been seeing for years I will get his advice on it too. So I am not rushing into this idea. Basically job first, see what I am paying on current loans and go from there.

236,"I don't know what to do guys. I'm almost about to put in my two weeks over this. 

The best way to describe my life at work is in the following analogy: 

Anytime I go to the bathroom to shit, I have one coworker tell me not forget to wipe my ass. Every. Fucking. Day. Sometimes twice a day, if they think I forgot from earlier. 

I go to the bathroom and take a shit. As I'm pulling my pants up, I hear a knock on the door. It's my boss, telling me to bend over and let him look as my asshole to make sure I did it right. 

Now, if I was potty training, maybe this would be appropriate. But I've been wiping my ass for almost 28 years. 

How do I tell my coworkers to get out of my fucking ass and let me do my job?


Edit: grammar 


Edit 2: A nice opportunity came up to be assertive and tell my coworker to knock it off. 

""Yes, Coworker. I heard my boss tell me to change the toilet paper roll. Thank you.""

Now my cousin for many years had been improving herself in terms of mental health and actually becoming far beyond healthy than we could imagine, lots of joy and happiness in her.

Despite this, I'm trying to figure out what to do next.  The house we lived in together is in my name, I bought it before we were married.  So I will get all of the money from a sale.  We do not have any children so I'm not tied to the city I'm currently living in.  Most of my family lives a couple states away or elsewhere.  Because of all of this, I'm not staying here.  

So this is where I need advice.  Where do I go?  I believe I've limited it down to two areas.  I've always wanted to live in Colorado (I'm more of a mountain person rather than a beach bum), or in the Washington D.C. area (Virginia or Maryland.  Cost of living is WAY too high actually in D.C.).  For me personally they both have pros and they both have cons.  On the same note, I've always dreamed of living overseas.  I did a study abroad in London during college, and I've visited England several times.  I'm a self professed Anglophile.  Of course I'm always open to other suggestions as well.  Is there someplace else that I should consider?  I have two dogs that I absolutely refuse to give up, so I have to take that into consideration as well.  

I'm just completely directionless right now.  I had the worst holiday season I've ever experienced.  I've literally been sitting around the house for a couple of weeks now.  I have no idea what to do, and I think the first step to pulling myself out of this black hole is figuring out where I want to go.  After I figure that out I can start looking for jobs, packing, and getting the house ready to put on the market.  I can also start looking for places to live wherever I decide to go.  At least then I will have a direction and I can begin the healing process.

247,"Context before.

I'm an UN service contract (SC) employee, UN in Brazil is acting as manager of our international project money. UN take care of our finances, they get a % for doing this job. SC can't call themselves UN staff member and can't fill official complaints by rules. Even if I had to assign many papers saying I'll be holding UN values in and out work hours. Salary, medical plan, business travel expenses etc are responsibility of them too.

Dream job until the first travel. They took two months to reimburse my expenses, very weird for government project (first time I and others colleges see this model). Travels start chaining and I said my finances aren't investment to the project.

Project is clearly suffers from mismanagement and I inform I'll be leaving soon. Boss comes and ask everyone to stay calm because we need to be soldiers for her. At same night I send a giant e-mail saying why I can't be her soldier. Next day they ask me to stay and offer a promotion, I accept with condition of no travels without certain competence of UN. They promise delays won't happen anymore. As today waiting since August/2017 for reimbursement.

We contract a new IT member, he asks to do a presentation. Says we are doing everything wrong, most of the team accept his view but think he was overaggressive. We start to see he can't work with the team, we make request and soon became the most used word. Everyone's work start to slow down because of him, he also don't like to assume some responsibility of his actions. Climax moment for me: boss ask him to reply a technical IT e-mail and said her no. Then assembly teams and ask for support to reply (support are mostly biologist with no IT background). I lose my mind and ask him to leave his salary to me if not going to do the work (screaming). He accepts to reply with our help ""couching"".

One month later he sends an e-mail to boss asking for numbers only the support team can provide like we aren't helping him. My co-worker also full of his passive-aggressive attitude go to his desk and ask him why he can't ask directly to us. The dialog go as:
&gt; her: why can't you ask us? boss work at Ministry and has no time for this

&gt; him: I'm only cc'ing you, you can't control my e-mails

&gt; her: I'm not fucking controlling your e-mails, learn to work as team

&gt; him: don't call names...you gonna regret it
 
&gt; him: you gonna regret it!

I ask her to calm down and we leave the room. Her start crying and says she's tired. UN can pay for extra hours but boss didn't allow payment. Boss also knows she do and can't fulfill a complaint against her. Because of our SC UN status we also can't fill any complain. This with Brazil in economic crises made her ""forget"" about it. Later we discover he's friends with UN security chef and for our surprise this week he became our immediate boss.

248,"So long story long, I guess. I’ve always had a vested interest in animation: the motion, the writing, just everything about it that regular film and tv just could not satisfy. It wasn’t until I began watching Cartoon Hangover, that it made me realize that sometimes you don’t have to be someone in the business to produce your own show. That was when I was 15. 

Ever since then, I’ve been drawing and sketching and writing everything that I’ve possibly could to formulate a pitch and then some, gradually improving my art style and taking in influences from both Western and Japanese animation. All I needed was an outlet, and that was when I found that Frederator Studios, home to several prodigious cartoons and multiple incubators, allowed for anybody to begin the pitch process for a pilot, with the restriction that you had to be at least 18.

I’m 18 now but I haven’t sprung into action like I thought I would. These past few months have been grueling, as I’ve been trying to organize and improve on all these little flaws I didn’t notice in the originals and basically procrastinating on the whole thing to deal with college and the like.

And then it hit me, like a truck, it wasn’t because I was trying to gather everything in its most appealing manner that I put it off. It was because I was scared, oh so very scared, of rejection, that I wouldn’t even be able to have a shot at a shot, that four years of hard work would go down the drain, that all I had done was for nothing.

I still haven’t finished my pitch documents, but I’m so terrified of what’ll happen when I’m finished that I haven’t been able to focus at all.

Not in a bad way, just not in the ""cool"" category. She always always goes to school wearing these cartoon or japanese costumes even going as far to painting he face with make-up or literal paint for it. Just last week she was dressing as Star Butterfly with devil horns and little hearts on her face and know she's some Japanese blue haired chick...

Cosplay isn't the ground level, she'll roleplay the characters often or act out in public looking incredibly lame, even my friends has bashed on how weird my sister is. Then if roleplaying doesn't sell it, she may be cute or a little attractive (not that sexy whatsoever) but that's countered by her jumping around being an energetic, singing, prop weilding... person. I don't know. It's just she's so loud and as many others call her at school ""annoying.""

-------------------------

So I'm a virgin and I try to fit in, try to be cool, I have plenty girls numbers and female friends. Despite this some how my sister got laid before me... Even worse when it was just me and her home yesterday and I was in my room on the game, I was comepletly hurt inside from what happened.

Hearing her, loud moaning and crap, I couldn't help but run to her room because my heart was pounding... then I opened her door and my heart just stopped... In my sister's room, the room with japanese posters, books, toys, clothes, even japanese swords on her wall, a japanese bed, etc... She was on the bed with a guy, he was naked and pulling out of her and cumming. She was semi-naked... wearing her cosplay she had on at school yesterday, jacket open showing he breast and her skirt was up so he could well... yeah. So she saw me and closed her legs and I feel like he just came inside of her but she got embarrased so I stuttered a different language closed the door and died in my room.

""AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH"" was literally the words that came out of my mouth for the rest of the day. I couldn't do anything but yell in pain that she got laid before me. It was literally like I lost all confidence what so ever. I haven't even talked to anyone on the phone since and even my sister killed me more inside by coming in and trying to excuse what I saw as if she was just playing and accidently went overboard or whatever shit she said. 

All I could do is stare at her. Looking at her face, I was just thinking to myself, wow I'm lame as fuck. And I can't even think straight. I skipped school today and just rambled to myself... I always thought her room kind of stunk... and know I realized she probably has sex often and I'm still a virgin.

258,"I was walking home from the subway and saw a business card on the ground of someone high up in a pretty large media company. I'm in a job I don't really like that is out of the field I'm passionate about.

I'm a big believer in fate and karma and I had just done something nice on the train and I feel like this was a sign from the universe saying ""here you go. don't mess it up."" I walked home leaving the card on the ground but couldn't get it out of my head and ran back and picked up the dirt-covered card on the ground. 

Obviously this person has no real part of hiring, but they are successful and have a big position in the company. I wanted to email to say what happened and give my resume just in case they ever have a position available-- no matter how small or entry-level. 

I really feel like the universe was trying to give me a chance that I've had a hard time finding. Nowadays it's impossible to really be considered for a position without some sort of connection and this would at least be something. Man, I'm so conflicted, because I don't wanna look like a creep.

259,"I don’t know where to start. I guess the fact that I feel tired all the time? I feel like caffeine doesn’t affect me. I’d say I started feeling that everything is pointless, as in life or any schoolwork, in 6th grade (I’m currently in 11th). Sure I’m capable of doing it but it doesn’t mean I’m going to. As soon as I pick up my pencil I start to feel unmotivated. As if there’s no reason to do it and that it’s “too much work” for nothing when I know it isn’t.  I know I’m not tired but at the same time my mind feel as though it is even though I get plenty of sleep. I know I should be doing the work in class but I just don’t. I’ll feel motivated at times and think “I got this, I’ll actually start doing something with my life!” But then the motivation I had before goes away within the same day. I’ll think in my mind like “eh, maybe next year.” It’s just an endless cycle.  As for being sad, I don’t know. I can say that I’ve never felt happiness before. The closest I can think of is whenever I’m laughing with friends. I would call my personality “empty” because that’s how I feel all the time.  I feel like antidepressants would help which is why I feel I should tell my mother about my problem. I’ve never done so before which is why I’m discouraged from telling her because I’ve never talked about my feelings with her before. Friends don’t know much about me except for the close ones. My best friend knows I’m depressed and so do three other friends. I feel more comfortable telling my friends my feelings than my family. As for why, I just feel disconnected from them. I don’t feel like I’m a part of the family. As if they don’t like me. I know they do but I feel like they don’t at the same time. I don’t know, what do you think I should do?",11Jan2018,2

Be it at work, school or anywhere, really, whenever I feel more comfortable with the people in the room I ""slip up"" and either say something I shouldn't or end up revealing something about me people really don't want to hear (weird habits, that sort of thing).

261,"So a little backround I met this girl about a year ago we live in the same dorm in college anyways I developed huge crush on her, but due to my lack of experience I failed to make a move on her and got stuck in the friendzone. It was at this point she started a thing with one of my friends. Anyways it also turned out her bf liked me, I was not attracted to this friend but had sex with her through a drunken one night thing. so months pass and im tormented by my feelings toward and seeing her with my friend. Eventually we finally hook up and its great until she starts being terrible to me not in a mean way but like manipulative wise, she would blatantly flirt with me the whole night making me think something was gonna happen and then ditch me at the last second to get with another guy, I would tell her off and told her that I didnt like this behavior but it continued. our hooking up was also a secret bc her friend still liked me. she then told me that she was done with guys for a while and literally the next day fucked another guy.It was at this point i told her that we couldnt be friends, but she eventually she asked for forgivness and i forgave her.Fast forward to next year we begin hooking up again but she always at the last second bows out of having sex with me and continues to hook up with the guy that is my friend. one night she comes over and hooks up with me and in the middle leaves to go hook up with my friend. this was devasting and I told her that this was it and i could not be friends with her. she then offers to have sex to remain friends. But her bf that liked me tells her that she cant hook up with me. As you can tell I was pathetically obssessed with this girl. But recently she has come to me apologizing and beginning for forgiveness acknowledgiing the things she has done and saying that shes making an effort to change and working on herself and trying to mend all shes done. She also says now that we cant be tg all those terrible things can never happen. To be fair she is literally my best friend whos a girl and I do enjoy her company outside of hooking up with her, and she only did those things while drunk, but she is also still hooking up with my friend. I am also finally over her, However I just dont know if its the right thing to be friends with her it seems so surreal to never speak to her ever again after so much we been through.",11Jan2018,1

Parents are currently in process of divorce because my dad cheated on her with one of his employees (she found out and kicked him out of the house in September) who's he's now dating, she's way younger than him(hes like 50 and she's like 21 or 22 I think).
This obviously damaged my relationship with my dad but for the first few months I still saw him like every week. I started seeing him less around Christmas (because I was at friends houses Ect.) And then for some reason my mom had him over for Christmas in the afternoon so that we could see him(he doesn't really have a place to live right now). And I thought that was really weird and awkward and I told my mom that I thought that. She agreed but said it was for my brothers(both younger than me).

 He came over again after Christmas and this time I went to grocery store with my mom while he was at our house. Now my mom's having him stay at the house while she goes on a trip for 2 weeks for work because that's what my brothers wanted. I don't really want to see my dad though because I think it's weird that he's gonna stay at our home that he left because he fucked up. I think his actions should have consequences and I've stopped talking to him for the most part.

I'm conflicted, sad and confused. On the one hand i think I don't want to see him. On the other hand I miss having a father.

265,"I have a colleague at work who I share an office with. We're teachers. She and I work very closely and share a lot of the same work, so we have to talk about it a lot. However, she honestly talks more than any other person I've met. She will go on forever until some external force stops her from talking (like the bell rings or kids start walking in to class). The other day, as an example, I spent a full hour of my day talking to her about one small assignment we might hypothetically assign in the future. An. Hour. During which time, I made several attempts to end the conversation, like turning away, doing work, not responding, or saying ""We can discuss that assignment more when it's actually time to assign it"". However, the conversation didn't end until she realized she was running late for something and left. 


She's a great teacher with great ideas, so that's not the problem. The problem that I have is two fold. One, I feel like I never get to give my input. She steam rolls over me by interrupting and dominating every conversation. Two, she talks so much that I can't get anything done. I honestly feel like I'm being held hostage by her words. I'll tell her I have work to do, or I'll stop responding to her, or turn away, but she doesn't always catch on to this body language. 


I really like her as a person and she is a great colleague to have, but I don't really know how to approach this issue. I mentioned to her before that I would like her to be more concise when we discuss work issues, but I don't think she knows how to be concise. I've also told her that I don't feel like I get to give much input on things because she dominates the conversation. But neither of these has led to changes.

266,"Scope of the situation:

I live in a house with 4 roommates. We are all in our mid to late twenties, and get along fairly well. I work in entertainment part time during the day, and bartend at night. Roommate A works nights in a restaurant, and Roommate B works a 9-5 M-F. 

Roommates C &amp; D are a couple. C is unemployed, rarely leaves the house, and Roommate D works from home running a non-profit, very rarely leaves the house. 

Lately we’ve been running into issues about the noise level during the day. D usually comes out and says something along the lines of “Can you guys keep it down, I’m trying to work.” The requests for quiet have been passive aggressive and condescending, now bordering plain ol aggressive. 

Now, we understand that making excessive loud noise is rude and discourteous, even if it's noon. However, the noises we make include talking, laughing, watching TV, or listening to records. This all takes place in the common space, which is on the opposite side of the house as D’s room.

I think it’s a bit ridiculous to request quiet in the middle of the day, which is also the only time that Roommate A and I get to enjoy the common space (getting off work at 1am, we certainly can’t make noise then). 

Here’s the spicy part: Roommate D is the leaseholder, and tends to think of the house as is own, even though we all rent. Disagreements with a previous roommate over dishes and air conditioning led to that roommate being ousted from the house. That’s what we’re afraid of. Do we just deal with this Tyranny Lite?

We all deal with unwanted noise, without complaint. I would love to argue, and say “no, this is a shared house. Wear headphones, listen to music, go somewhere else to work,” but I don’t want to risk losing my housing situation because of it. 

Bottom line: he works at a home, we don’t live at an office.

Since beginning I had and issue with my instructor as she didn't have much time for me, so I had a lesson every 2 or 3 weeks. For about month and a half now I'm driving once a week and I was fine with that till Christmas. After holidays I have booked lessons twice a week, however she rearrange them and it got back now to one lesson per week. The more time without practice I have the fewer confidence I have and I feel like I am making few steps backwards instead of making progress. 

Every time I speak with her about my progress and how I feel she placate me that some people take longer to learn driving and I am too harsh on myself (which is probably partially true). Last week she told me that I will probably be ready for practice test in summer. IN SUMMER?! This is already taking 6 months and it is not cheap. When started I was thinking that I will attempt test in winter. Now I thought that maybe around April so I got really upset and angry when I heard that. 

So here I am considering changing my instructor as maybe someone else would give me more time and different kind of support and motivation. The only thing that stops me is that I am anxious about strangers and that new instructor could be bullying type as current one is very calm.

269,"Ok so this is going to be long and may be confusing....

To start off I am 20 years old and my brother is 24 married to a women for 3 years and they have 3 children, 1 is not biologically his. He was always the super lady killer in hs had multiple gfs and was always with someone. He has basically cheated on her the entire time they have been together but she always goes back to him for some reason. They had moved out of town for a job of his and when they were there she found a m for m ad on craigslist and they fought about it but it was in the past. They have been back to this area for quite some time now and he has been cheating on her with some old lady that i found out about 3 weeks ago by her stepson. So fast forward to 2 days ago my sister in law found another m for m ad and the dude came over when my nieces were there(cheating is horribly wrong and especially when my nieces are there). Ad said something along the lines of man looking for a shower or something and my idiot brother tried to tell his wife that he was only there to take a shower, nothing happened, blah blah blah. Wife still doesnt believe him which i dont blame her and today she saw another like 4 ads 2 of which were girls and the other were for men.

They have been in a pretty unhappy marriage the whole time and talk about divorce but ""love"" each other so much that they never do it. Now I dont see them not getting one and the other night when he was caught about the shower, he wrote a suicide note and tried to hide it. If I try to talk to him he just pushes it to the side and whatnot. My mom keeps bugging me about what is going on with them but idk what to do. I dont want my brother to commit suicide and my mom blame me for not telling her what was happening. I am not happy with my brother for cheating and never have liked that aspect about him. Also I should mention I have 0 problems with gay people.

272,"Hi there, first time posting. 

A few years ago, my mother gave us (my spouse and I) a very large, very heavy, expensive piece of vintage AV equipment. We hauled it with us on a cross-country move and it's been sitting in a closet ever since. It was (and is) extremely powerful, but it's not something we'd ever use - we're more into smaller, digital systems, and this particular piece of equipment would need lots of additional accessories to even be functional. We have talked about selling it, as it would probably have value to a collector, and I think we could get at least several hundred dollars for it. We will be moving away from this area in a couple of years and I have no intention of bringing it with me. It came up in conversation with my mother that we were thinking of selling it, and she said that if we were going to get rid of it, she wanted it back. 

The thing is, my mother is a borderline hoarder. Their current place is filled with boxes and boxes of stuff - most of which haven't been opened since they moved 4 years ago. She had this system for decades and never used it herself. Her attachment is (IMO) purely from a place of loving ""things"". I am very confident that if we return this item to her, it will simply sit and collect dust for another several decades, until ultimately I end up having to get rid of it when she moves into assisted living or dies. 

I really, really don't want to give it back to her - both because I don't want to haul this piece of equipment thousands of miles back to her home, and because I don't want to give her MORE things to add to her stockpile. But I do feel guilty about selling it when she has explicitly said she would like it back if we don't want it. I had thought about selling it and giving her the cash as a compromise (they are hard pressed for money).

280,"For some ungodly reason, OUAC had no option but to pay application fees online. I didn't have a credit card, so I chose **online banking**. You submit your application, then pay so that they will process the application once they received payment.

I submitted my application on Nov 29. I got a confirmation email that I submitted.

I paid through Online Banking on the same day.

I only checked back Jan. 04. The site acted like I never finished submitting my application, once again asking for payment method.

I reselected Online Banking and received a second confirmation email with a completely different account number to make payment to, and called their support line about it. Before the call I had checked my bank's confirmation of payment to see if I entered the OUAC information wrong. As far as I saw, nothing. We were talking and getting nowhere in figuring out what happened when suddenly I was transferred to a 'leave-your-message-after-the-tone' thing in the middle of conversation.

I was distracted by family things for half an hour, then I checked and then the OUAC site now said my application was being processed. Sounds like its fixed, but I even called again to ask if the screen I was seeing meant my payment had been received. The person on the line said yes.

Then I check today. Once again, as if my application wasn't submitted. Selected online banking and once again received a different account number to make payment to. I reviewed my bank confirmation and I realize **I entered the account number for the recipient info wrong**. It was still to Ontario Universities Application Centre, but the Account Number was wrong. I wrote an email to OUAC just now explaining the situation (I would've wrote an email instead of calling last time but I swear their contact us page looks completely different than before, where there was no email). I got an automated reply that they're not accepting emails due to too many emails.

**So now what should I do? I get home in like two hours, where I can make calls and work on secure internet. Should I immediately call the bank first to tell them I made the payment in error, or should I first call OUAC to see if they can get the money from the account number I paid to?**

And the rest of this is angry ranting and venting.

 I don't know how the hell I entered the number wrong. It's not like this is my first time filling out online forms and such. I always make sure to copy and paste codes if I received them digitally, and then check to make sure it looks right. I don't recall whether I copy and pasted like I normally do, but I remember myself checking over everything from the spelling of Ontario Universities Application Centre to the account number and my own bank info three times and not seeing any error. And then I didn't check back for a month. Ugh. I only checked back last week because people were starting to get responses from their universities who submitted around the same time or even after I did.

And then how did I not catch this last week? I swear I looked over all the information last week to see if I could find an error I made myself before calling. How does this escape my notice on two separate occasions? And also the person I called never asked if I had entered their account number correctly, only the recipient name.

And why would they not ever contact me when as far as they knew, I submitted my application then didn't submit any payment for a whole month afterwards? And why did the site claim my application was being processed, and then I even called and they confirmed that meant they got my money, only to have it revert back a week later? This one's worse!

284,"Background info: 
&gt;&gt;My GF's father was apparently very controlling and his control drove a wedge between him and most of his family. 

&gt;&gt;A week before Christmas I decided that I wasn't happy in my relationship and I wanted to break up with my GF; but I wanted to do it after the holidays. 

&gt;&gt;The next time I saw my GF, on New Year's Day, she told me that her dad unexpectedly died after Christmas. She told me that she wasn't very close to him and didn't seem too distraught, but she hides a lot of her emotions (so I don't know if she was being genuine).


Background info ends:

I've decided that I want to help morally support her while she goes through her dad's houses sorting through his belongings (her mother and brother are also there).

Her father was her source of health, dental, and cad insurance and he paid the rent on the apartment that she and her mom shared (her parents got divorced a few years ago). When I've gotten her to talk about it she always talks about how uncertain things are (how her mom and her need to figure out how to cover the rent, how she doesn't know how she'll be able to keep seeing her psychiatrist, etc.)

Everytime that I think about breaking up with her I feel extremely guilty because of the situation she's in. Last time that she was over I peeked inside her journal to try and see what she was feeling, and on the page I opened to she was calling herself a miserable failure. From what I remember, part of it read ""if [Buckling_Blackbeard]'s friends or family ever disagree with the relationship then I'll accept that and drift out of his life and be forgotten, because who would want to stay with a failure like me.""

I know it's not healthy to stay in an unhappy relationship, but I'm seriously worried about how she'll react. Is there any way to lessen this guilt? Because I feel like a real shitbag everytime I think about her sitiation and how I'm not going to make anything easier for her.",11Jan2018,1

286,"Hi guys. I’m a 21 year old Latina female and I made a reddit account because I just wanted to vent; not that any of you really care. I made a really bad decision last year in October when I decided to go out to a club with my coworkers and drink ( I drank 7 shots to be exact). I had recently turned 21 and broken up with my boyfriend of 3 years so why not? Anyways, I ended up meeting a guy (Latino) at the club and we were just hanging out all night. I don’t really know how it happened but we ended up having unprotected vaginal sex. It lasted about 2-5 minutes because he ejaculated really fast. He did pull out but I’m still scared because there could have been an exchange of Precum. Some of my coworkers personally know this guy, and say he is heterosexual and a non iv drug user. He also recently got out of a long term relationship. I texted him and asked him for plan b just in case of anything and he went out of his way and drove 20 minutes to bring me it. I thought it was nice because he was a stranger and he could have easily said no. A couple of days later, I really started to freak out because I started thinking about how I didn’t know anything about his status. I have only been with 2 other men who were both virgin before me. In other words, I would have never slept with this guy if I wasn’t drunk. I texted him and asked him if there was anything that I should be worried about and he told me that he works for a hospital and that he gets a lot of health checkups. He told me that he would go get tested and show me his results and that I was over thinking it. I did end up stalking him on Instagram which did confirm that he does work at the hospital. My friends thought that it would be best if I blocked him and went on my own to get tested. I went 2 weeks after and took an antibody rapid test but, of course, tested negative. The three past months have been so hard because I have had weird symptoms. 

Symptoms:
1) I had a mild yeast infection a week after incident. (Which I am hoping was due to taking Plan B. I was supposed to get my period that week and I think the pill threw my hormone balance off. Plus, I was douching with how disgusted I was in myself, which I think made it worse)
2) I got a minor cold, but everyone around me had a cold. I got the cough, phlegm, runny nose 
3) I started to feel dizzy for a few weeks
4) muscle aches 
5) I thought I had oral thrush but I bought a tongue scraper and my tongue went back to normal 
6) minimal mouth ulcers and body rash (but these are quite normal for me. I have eczema) 
7) I got a weird lump by my ear but everyone has inspected it, and apparently it looks like a scab or scratch 

None of these symptoms have been severe. I have a really weak immune system because I’m always getting sick so I would think if it was HIV, it would be way worse. I’m really hoping that all of these symptoms are because of my health anxiety. It has already been the 3 month period so I am going tomorrow morning to be tested. I am so scared, even though I have already looked up statistics on CDC. I’m afraid that maybe this guy isn’t aware of his status yet &amp; that I will be one of those very unlucky numbers. 

I know it sounds so silly. I just really wanted to vent. I’ve researched HIV like never before and I know it’s not a death sentence but my family would never understand this (being that they are a very traditional Christian Hispanic family)

Wish me the best of luck, I need it!  

Btw, I’m from Ventura county, California where HIV prevalence is really low.",11Jan2018,1
287,"So i am 18 and about to start my next semester as a stats major at a pretty good state school in New York. I have always thought that i was gonna go to college and love every second of it when I'm there. But now I am realizing that realistically school may not be for me. I had a 3.0 in my first semester and had a pretty good time while I was there but I feel like the classes are only gonna get harder.

I chose a statistics major because I am interested in working as a data scientist when I get my bachelors. I'm not really interested in any of the other majors my school offers so I figured I would go with a STEM major to get an interesting job in the STEM field and make really good money. But now the more I realistically think about it, I may hate being in an office job for the rest of my life. I have always been a decently outdoorsy person and always been athletic.

So I started browsing the internet for alternate careers and becoming an electrician sounded pretty interesting. I have done a good amount of research on what being an electrician would be like and it sounds a hell of a lot better than being in an office job for 40+ years. Money is pretty important for me as well and electricians make pretty good money but it wouldn't be the amount of money I would be making as a data scientist.

My parents are paying for my school and expect to do well and finish. I think if I really wanted to do, I could do well and finish but now realizing a stats degree will only lead me to boring office jobs, I am now seriously considering telling them I am thinking about dropping and starting an apprenticeship or going to trade school. Either way I am sure I will be successful but this is a huge decision I feel like I should make soon before my parents spend a lot more money on school.

I just don't know what to do right now.",11Jan2018,2

291,"Hello everyone. I am a 21 year old girl, who is studying abroad in the Netherlands. Before arriving here, I was really excited about studying in another country. Back at home, I used to be very social and outgoing. Since I got here, I became very sad. University is a lot tougher than I expected and that makes me question my abilities a lot. I miss my family and my friends so much and I can't stop being sad I honestly don't know what to do. I feel like everyone is succeeding in everything and I don't.

292,"I'm 23, and my ex boyfriend is 24. We dated for almost two years, and broke up around end of August. 

During our relationship, it had become VERY evident he struggled from mental illness. He had been diagnosed bipolar at a younger age and had struggled from some sexual childhood trauma. Through our relationship, I bent over backwards to try and pull him out of this mentally debilitating rut he was in. I saw him punch himself in the face, bash his head into a wall, and a few other things that fall into that category. He very clearly needed help. I told him many times how important it is that he gets help because I'm not a professional and there's only so much I can do, but he always told me that I help him more than any therapist could do. Our relationship was bringing me down his rabbit hole and it was making me depressed and sad. He was never ever bringing me up. He never said mean things to me, however him having violent (towards himself) freak outs became a regular occurrence. 

I made it clear that he needs to get help and him refusing to get help, and instead making it worse (regular cocaine and alcohol use) is why I could no longer be with him.

A few months has gone by. His well being has crossed my mind many times, but he messaged me a few weeks ago saying he's doing a lot better, and thanked me for always being there for him. I was very skeptical on if he was being honest with me but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

Yesterday, my good friend, let's call her Sarah, took me out for a drink. I guess she just wanted to tell me about a couple things. She's seeing my ex's best friend (let's call him john). My ex and John live together. John told Sarah the other day how my ex has been absolutely getting out of hand with drinking, always crying, and all around falling into a deep hole more than ever before. The other day he was having a freak out, and smashed a bottle into his forehead and gave himself stitches and a concussion. Hearing this made me feel absolutely sick. 

Sarah told me I couldn't tell anyone about this, but frankly I do not care. I will not gossip this at all, however I have NO idea what route to take. He needs help so bad and I know this is just going to keep getting worse. I realize I should of done something about this a long time ago, but I didn't and I know I need to do something now. Who do I talk to? Should I tell his mother? His sister? The police? This isn't something I can just put aside. I need to be proactive about this situation. ",11Jan2018,3

296,"I am in a situation at work where I feel overwhelmed by the workload and tasks are slipping through the cracks.  When this happens, I feel beset upon from all sides – the clients, my co-workers, my supervisors, even my own self, all expressing disappointment and frustration.  It seems as though I am being made to feel as though my efforts are insufficient, which they are in an economic sense.

I am getting paid to do work and provide services, and I am failing to do the work and provide the services at an acceptable standard.  But if I try to back out of the economic deal, it feels like I am losing more than just the pay for the work; it feels like I am giving up a fundamental sense of self-worth.  I fucking resent this, so much.  I feel like my very sense of self is being boxed in, not just by the expectations of others but also by the material demands of life itself.  I can’t just not work, I need to work in order to survive, and I need others in order to work (I am not a survivalist hermit).  I have no choice left but to engage and inevitably fail.

Furthermore, this pervasive sense of imminent failure follows me outside of work-life.  It is everywhere.  It is built into how our atomized society interacts with each other, constantly picking each other apart, constantly correcting each other, constantly projecting out one’s personal experience as if it is the basis of universality.  We can’t just let others be wrong, be weak, be insufficient.  I can’t just say “I am wrong, I am a rickety and unstable person, I am incapable of performing the functions you have in mind for me”.  I am expected to treat my very existence as a serious project, and to the extent I refuse to engage in “self-improvement” (always defined by others and by the material demands of life), I am treated as though I have failed at existing, which is obviously absurd.

I am almost at the point where I actively want to be spitefully unproductive.  I almost want to be vindicated by passively watching the whole system of human productivity fall apart at the seams, to point out its futility and its failures, just as the system does the same to my own sense of self.  I want to look back at the world and its inhabitants and ask, “Why?  What are we even trying to accomplish?  All we do is consume and waste, nothing more.  Every sense of meaning we have ever had has turned out to be illusory, nothing other than a projection intended to hide the basic truth that all we can do is eat, shit and die.” 

Never has this been more obvious than at this point in history; our human society is almost completely atomized at this point.  Nobody agrees about anything.  None of our values are impervious to critique and rejection.  How am I supposed to feel invested in any outcome at all?  How am I supposed to find any project worthwhile?  How am I ever supposed to feel like I have the right to exist as who I fundamentally am, including my flaws and shortcomings?  How do I get out of this existential rut?",11Jan2018,13
297,"Basically I am in grade 11 turning 17 this year, and I've been talking to this girl for about a year and half now.

298,"This feels like a dumb thing to be stressed about but I am completely panicing!

I took over a lease for someone 7 months ago, and she told me the lease was up in June 2018 and like an idiot I didn't double check with the office (and they didn't give me paperwork on it)

So I got a notice on my door yesterday, warning me that my lease is actually up in a little over a month. I  thought I still had 5 months and haven't even started looking at apartments or deciding if I want to stay in this one. My apartment wants to know if im going to renew my lease like, NOW! 


this apartment has been great to me. Anything broken is fixed quickly, and the price is the best in the city, ive never seen a better price.  Absolutely no compaints. But I have an hour drive to and from work that is a little soul crushing so part of me wants a different apartment closer to work. 


But if I tried to get an apartment closer to work id only have a little over a month to find one, apply, move out and in and super clean my apartment. I need to replace some blinds my cat fucked up and nail holes in the wall and other things. What if the new apartment doesn't fix things and has obnoxious neighbors? Ive had awful loud neighbors before and the ones at my current apartment are super polite and quiet. I've also had apartments with cold shower water, bugs, no parking and other bad junk! Im nervous not knowing how a new one will be, and it will for sure be more $$ than my apartment is now. Overall moving really stresses me out but I could find something closer to my work which could save me over an hour in traffic every day! 

Im so anxious about this super short notice to decide. I know this is hard to give advice on since its ultimately my descision but I would still love to get some!

299,"CONTEXT - Skip to the break if you want to get to the problem. Sorry for the wall of text.

To briefly give context I'm a 21 year old student and I really do have a lot going for me. I'm a very hard worker and I've worked for the past few years freelancing making videos, taking photos and setting up a company that hits year two next month. My family taught me good ethics and I've never asked my parents for a penny. I don't congratulate myself a lot but I do acknowledge that some great opportunities have come my way as a result of the hard work I've put in. I love to laugh and make people laugh and my stupid sense of humour has always been a part of me others and myself have loved.

However, behind the scenes it's a shitshow. Frequent bouts of anxiety, stress, rapid thoughts of worst case scenarios, hanging on to bad experiences, expecting the worst etc. I had a pretty bad relationship experience about 18 months ago that for a while really threw me off balance and although I had these problems before, I feel my identity really consolidated itself around these negative habits since. I had a few months of counselling that helped steer me back which has made me better at managing my negative emotions and more objective at examining the way I feel, but one thing I've never been able to cultivate is real self-esteem.

I've never had a good impression of myself and have doubted my abilities and my confidence non-stop. There came a point in my mid-teens where I was sick of feeling lesser so I really started to observe how social skills work and after a few years I developed a very confident facade. I can public speak well, I can be social, I've even been commended for my interpersonal abilities and portrayed self-confidence by students, clients and contacts in a way that suggests it's a real strength of mine. However, my internal self-esteem has never budged. I still get the jitters when there's competition, see myself as still having a long way to go and doomed to fail, and count any progression as hopeless and minimal.

________________________________________

The main cause of stress for me is where this self-doubt meets my goals. My goals are very, very high and I know they're lofty, but I know I can't budge them because they involve me securing myself from strain like my family had to undergo to support us. I work towards them every day I can but they're so extensive I constantly feel like I'm stuck at square one, so I break them down but then the to-do list gets longer and that stresses me out. I'm trying to achieve them through content production, both in my company and in my own creative ventures, so I'm administrating entire creative processes from initial branding development to marketing and distribution all by myself. Again, I've always been a hard worker and my work is good, but mixing a lack of self-belief, the fact that I'm slowly learning so many creative disciplines at once, how long I still have to go, and how I feel when I don't work together creates a real vicious cycle that becomes all I think about when I work, instead of enjoying content production which is what I love to do.

It's frustrating because the things I listen to to change my perspective (you can probably imagine I've consumed a lot of self-improvement media) tell me that to not give up, I have to believe in myself. For me Will Smith has gone from Fresh Prince of Bel Air to Fresh Prince of I'm Scared because of the confidence he puts out in interviews when he talks about ""so passionate and competitive that I'm willing to die before you beat me, and that's why I'm the best"", which I hear and then think about how I need to be the best at what I do if I'm ever going to be where I want to be, and I can't honestly say that I believe I'm going to succeed. I have a lot of skills people my age don't often need to have and I've endured enough to know I won't stop working towards my goals, but instead of an unwavering, excited-to-create spirit, I'm worn down by self-generated negativity.

How can I believe in my capabilities and goals despite the odds of failure?

Thanks for bearing with the massive post - I don't often talk about this stuff so I don't know how much or how little to include.

TL;DR - I need to believe in myself and Will Smith cyberbullies me",11Jan2018,1
300,"My parents were emotionally neglectful and my mom was way too hard on me about school. I would dread getting my report card and showing it to her if it wasn’t all A’s. Even one B got me grounded and she took away my privacy and locked my painting stuff away. 

I recently confronted her about this. I told her that it kinda messed me up and damaged my confidence and mental health. 

She said, and I quote, “I’m not going to apologize because I didn’t know I was doing anything wrong and I had good intentions at the time.” 

Isn’t that the point of apologizing? Recognizing you were wrong, even if you had good intentions? What should I do? I know she was being hard on me so I would be successful if school but she took it too far. ",11Jan2018,1
301,"This is a throwaway account for the record.

My (16) girlfriend (15) has been continuously harassed at her school. We go to different schools so I can't really help her directly much. She has told me on numerous occasions how rumors have been spread about her and such throughout the school. She seems to believe it is much worse on her than anybody else she knows.

 At the end of the year last year she told me someone forcibly ripped her phone out of her hands while she was using it, went into her camera roll, and sent a picture to himself of her in a bra. She apparently tried to knee him in the crotch and he just pushed her away. After this incident, apparently there was a huge rumor going around that she sent him nudes. 

She says people (guys mainly) steal her phone all the time in class. Also her locker is broken so if someone wants to get in, they can just wiggle it and they're in. Apparently some guys she hardly knows went into her locker and used her earbuds without her knowing, then put them back after but stole the dongle and she never got it back. 

She has some serious trust issues, as all of the guys she has previously been with have talked to other girls on the side and showed little affection for her. 

Another time was at a party she went to a while ago. She was with a bunch of guys and those guys made very horrible comments on her saying stuff like they were going to rape her. They were supposedly ""joking"" but from the context of the scenario and the encounters she's told me about, that assumption is iffy at best. At a separate party, one guy in particular (we'll call him bob) tried to get her drunk so that she would sleep with him.

Kids have been taking pictures of her butt in school, and also one kid took a picture up her skirt. When she went to a teacher about this, the teacher did nothing. She tried going to her school counselor, and they did nothing.

This summer her and one of her girl friends did some...*things* while they were drunk...and her friend took a very short video. We don't know exactly she sent this video to, but apparently it got sent to Bob somehow.

Today, Bob told multiple people what she did in the video. By the time school was out, multiple people had come up to my girlfriend and told her about what they heard. This rumor is spreading very fast and she's having a nervous breakdown.

She has a past of cut marks on her legs and wrists. She said she talked to a therapist for a while but hated it so she stopped. She is currently on prescribed depression medication. She is now saying things like, ""It's always going to happen, it always happens"", ""I've dealt with enough of this"", ""I'm the worst"", ""I'm so stupid"", ""I just can't"". I told her that I think she needs to talk to a therapist again asap. I also told her the best course of action here is to move schools.

Her mom has been pushing her to move to the town I'm in (just one town over) anyways. I told her she needs to at least inform her parents, who are completely unaware of any of this as far as I know. She told her parents she wants to move schools. When her dad tried to talk to her more about it and asked if anything had happened that made her feel this way, and she said no. She said she just doesn't like the school or the people very much. Her dad, clearly not understanding the urgency of the situation, wants to wait at least until her older brother (a junior like me) graduates. I feel if she opened up to her parents and told them about what was happening they'd understand and take action to make sure none of this happens again. However, she is very reluctant to move schools because she doesn't want to lose her friends (as does any kid who moves schools). This is her choice and I'm trying to encourage her as much as I can to get out of there and I'm worried if she doesn't she's going to end up doing something stupid.

Does she have any recourse against Bob here? Should she move schools? What can I do to support her? What happens when she denies these rumors and Bob decides to start sending the video around??",11Jan2018,0

To some I bet it sounds like a no-brainer but I’m really conflicted. If anything I’m addicted to the internet; thinking about reducing my access to it gives me anxiety.  Anddd as I’m typing this 3 kids started screaming and playing right outside the window. Great. ",11Jan2018,1
320,"A few months ago I took a job in healthcare that involves working 7 days and then being off for 7 days. Each shift is 12 hours long. This is the schedule the hospitalists keep although I am not a hospitalist. I also do not get to leave the building or go home early like they might.

If I do nothing else such as getting groceries I am away from home for &gt;13 hours and 30 minutes each workday.

By the 4th or 5th day, I am finding it extremely difficult to maintain focus and energy. I become like a sloth.

I am not allowed to leave my station for more than 15 minutes because our patients require 24/7 monitoring. I wish I could go outside for a walk and fresh air but it is not possible. We also have no windows on my unit.

I have tried:

* working out before
* working out after work
* massage and aromatherapy
* diet (lifelong vegan)
* white light machine
* changing shoes
* calling my loved ones
* various energy drinks (quit after 3 days of trying)
* various vitamins including B12 injections
* structuring my sleep much better
* cold washcloth on my face
* walking around the building on breaks (cannot go outside or to a window)

I feel like a plant that is dying. That sounds dramatic I know. There are 4 people in my role (2 alternate daytime weeks and 2 alternate nighttime weeks) and none of the others have as much problems as me.

I'm not seeking medical advice because I already went to my PCP who gave me the B12 shots and referred me to an endocrinologist (everything was normal).

I'm asking for advice from anyone who has done this before and may have thought of something else. I'm willing to start looking for another job soon; I don't understand why other people can do this so much better than me.

322,"Hey Reddit,


So I have a dilemma here, on whether or not I should accept pay for something. Sounds ridiculous but just hear me out. I'm a high school student currently and one of my friends recently asked me whether or not I would tutor her for French class. See, she offered to pay me as well, which I just don't feel right taking, since it's her parents paying for it and such. I already help other friends on occasion on other homework, where we come over and I help them finish things up, and I don't charge them there obviously. But she's offering to pay me to speak french with her (to improve her french for a job interview) for about an hour for 4 days in a row for 40 dollars (10 dollars an hour). I would also like plan the lessons out and assign homework and such, so it would be a little more detailed than just answering questions for people who need help. I have no idea if I should accept her money for this since I already basically do the same thing for free with other people. I even offered her the chance to receive it for free, but she said that it's fine. But it just doesn't really sit right with me reddit, it just feels really slimey charging friends for tutoring, since I already do something similar for free.

 I'm looking at career choices to see what subjects I should choose for stuff like GCSE and A level, and a few that interest me are the skilled trades. I particularly like the idea of plumbing, but I don't know if it would be a good fit for me. Ever since I was a little kid I've been into tools and fixing things.

I would wait until school eases up but we'll be graduating next semester  and my window might close. 

Some info for context:
I'm a senior in HS, never really had a real relationship because I haven't really cared about this kind of thing.
She wants to be a doctor, I want to go in to the computer science field.
She is much better at school than I am and very hard-working. (Took 2 extra classes online and one over the summer because the school pays for it)

I really like cars and making A's.",11Jan2018,0
325,"This problem has a bit of history.

About 15 years ago, my brother got into an altercation with some kids at his high school. The kids retaliated by getting their older brothers (members of a middle eastern gang) to jump my brother and his friends. A few stab wounds, cuts and bruises but otherwise they were OK.

My brother thinking he was doing the right thing, agreed with the police to identify his attackers, and testify in court. A couple of the high school kids received a few months house arrest, but otherwise there were no convictions.

Since then, my brother has been harassed, assaulted, and intimidated by this gang for 15 years. There's quite a large contingent of them at this point that know what he looks like, and whenever they cross paths, my brother is put in the hospital and/or robbed.  They say that's what he gets for being a snitch.

About 6 months ago, he ran into one of them in a pub, and they wanted money. My brother gave them another $300 and told them that this was the last time, and they assured him that his ""debt"" was settled.

Well, last night he ran into one of them again, and they forced his car off of the road, and stole his wallet.


At this point, he doesn't know what to do, and the way I see it we have 3 options:


1) Go to the police.

My brother is hesitant to do this and I don't blame him.  This entire situation exists because he went to the police the first time. Frankly, I don't trust the cops to really do anything about it and wonder if going to them with this problem could result in my brother being dead.


2) Take matters into our own hands.

Essentially, fight back. Next time this happens, we gather as many friends as we can and take the fight to them. I don't know how big this gang is, or if it's the kind that uses firearms or not. It could result in my brother being left alone, or, it could result in someone being dead.


3) Flee.

Admit defeat and move to the other side of the country. My brother has good work connections here, and all of his friends are here. This would mean starting over entirely for him.


Frankly, we're leaning towards the 3rd option. We could really use some advice. Please though, if you are under 25 please refrain from chiming in on this. I would prefer any responses not be littered with opinions from people with no real world life experience. This is a serious and dangerous situation.

For what it's worth we're in Canada.",11Jan2018,3
326,"Okay so all of my 14 years of life I've lived with my grandmother, my grandfather, and my mother.

327,"I'm a young [17] year old guy and I have recently become captured by this beautiful girl, she is quite literally all I can think about to the point where I'm getting kinda depressed. I used to know her from my previous school but she moved away, up until a few weeks ago I didn't know where she had moved to and at this point I had no interest in her.  I recently found out from one of her friends friends that I am moving with my family to the same small town she lives in, I have been here over a month now and for the past week she has been making my head spin. I would love too meet her but have no way of knowing where she is a what she is up too and i feel DMing her would seem odd. On the other hand I can see that this could become unhealthy and I should forget about her but so far no luck, I have been keeping up with my usual hobbies of water skiing, gaming and hanging out with friends but I can't stop thinking about her and I have no idea why, to a point where I often find I can't sleep at night. A part of me sees this is unhealthy and weird and I don't want to devolve into some sort of stalker creep.

329,"I am an 18F. I have made a pros and cons list for both schools. One of the schools is a state university which I attended for the fall semester, and the other is a community college. 

State Uni Pros: I’ve made wonderful friends there, I don’t have to live at home, I have independence, and I feel like I’m getting a good education when I’m there.

Community College Pros: My boyfriend goes there, I’d only be taking art classes, I can work another job and earn more money, and then I could save money.

State Uni Cons: it’s almost too expensive. My parents help me pay for school monthly, but I worry it’s too much of a financial strain on my family. My dad REALLY wants me at home.

Community College Cons: I’m stuck at home. I really liked the independence I had at uni. I only had to worry about myself, which was so very nice. Everyone else I know is going to university far away. I’ll feel behind. 

I need to decide quickly.
Thank you, and God bless. ",11Jan2018,1

I'd like to start by saying this is my first apartment and I know next to nothing about this stuff. If also like to apologize if I'm not clear enough.

I just had the property manager come over and look at it and he sprayed the mold but I want other opinions of what might cause this and how to stop it.

So the first time I showered in this apartment I used the shower vent. It worked well enough, but afterwards it started leaking water pretty steadily. Then it stopped. I decided to not use the vent anymore. The second time I showered, I didn't use the vent, but it started leaking again. I put a glass down to catch the water and it stopped. 

Then the third time I showered it leaked steadily for about 8 hours. I had to put a mixing bowl in place of the glass overnight to make sure it didn t spill over. 

It stopped then started again, then stopped, and it hasn't happened since.

So 

It seems to be linked to when I shower, but there's no way to get it to stop without starting again. The mold is concerning, and the property manager said there are no pipes hooked to it, so I'm at a loss here. Any thoughts? ",11Jan2018,1
337,"I am a first time renter, I have been in this home for about 4 months now.  

In the rental agreement, I am responsible for snow removal, lawn care, etc.   There is a non-attached 2 car garage on the property, on the opposite side of the driveway as my house.

When going in to sign the lease, I asked if that garage came with the house (I originally looked at the home alone, no landlord or anything, so I had a few questions).  I was told no, that it was not part of the rental agreement.  All fine.  

But now that it snowed, am I responsible for removing the sidewalk snow on that side of the driveway, in front of the garage?  It's about 40 ft give or take some.

340,"Before I start let me just say that this is a pretty messy situation. I have been working in a particular restaurant for over 5 years now and if you have ever worked in the service industry you know there is always drama in this line of work. My female coworker began dating another man we worked with about 6 months ago. Which is fine but at the time this male coworker and I were sort of involved (sexually, not in a relationship). Once they began seeing each other I backed off and wished them the best because honestly the last thing I wanted was to be involved in some high school level love triangle. She did not like the fact that we had a past and began to find reasons to demonize me (insecurities at its finest). I did what I thought was best, I left her alone and I was nice when we interacted but she refused to communicate or socialize with me. Even when I asked her direct questions she would just stare at me and walk away. I personally dont feel like her animosity towards me is justified because this guy and I had been on and off for years and she just started working there a few weeks before they began dating. Anyways, she started making up situations where I was mean to her. She confronted me twice about being a bully and being rude to her. I explained I did no such thing and not to take every little thing I do so personally because it's never been towards or about her. She's called me foul names and taken me to HR because, as she claimed, I am out to get her. I honestly believe that she is unstable. She and her boyfriend fight about me constantly when I literally don't talk to either of them. 
Recently he started texting and calling me because their relationship has been rocky and they break up every other week. (No, I am not exaggerating, and these are two people who are in their late twenties/early thirties!) He and I have been friends for many years, long before either of us worked here, so I had a soft spot and heard him out when he wanted to vent about her to me. He started telling me that hes always been in love with me, should have dated me, etc etc. All of which I have proof of in text messages. I shut it down and made it clear I do not feel the same. Recently he was trying way too hard to reconnect with me. After calling me 8 times in a row one night, I finally told him to stop and to leave me alone. The next day he showed up to where I was out with my friends (No idea how he found me, someone must have told him) he continued trying to pursue me and kept confessing more feelings. Apparently later that night he did a bunch of drugs (why Id never date him) and was extremely messed up. He messaged his girl friend and told her some awful things, like she needed to come pick up the rest of her stuff from his house and that he was with me now. Yeah, yikes.
Anyways, lets fast forward to the following day when she confronts him and he claims that he didnt send the messages. That it was me. She believed him and went into work and told EVERYONE that I spent the entire weekend with him, that I was a home wrecking whore, that I text her on his phone, and that I STOLE his phone. She even went as far as telling my ex boy friend all of this and more. She told him things about my personal life that Ive never talked to her about and things he didnt know or want to know. Luckily he and I are good friends and he told me everything. So all in all her attempt to make everyone turn on me and sympathize with her failed. Ive worked there a long time and these people know my character, so no one really believed her. Now this morning I received an email from HR stating I am to come in and defend myself against harassment claims being put on me. I dont feel like I can get in trouble for something that happened outside of work, but I also am worried she's trying to get rid of me. She has admitted to many people she hates me because I'm technically her boyfriends ex and she cant stand the sight of me. Quitting is not an option right now I make way too good of money there and I am still in school getting my masters. I need this job. I need to know how to handle this situation. Do I go in to HR and lay it all out there? Do I expose this guy for being a shit boyfriend and her for being totally out of her mind? I don't want any of this drama and I feel like no matter what it's all going to hit the fan. I've cut him off completely as a friend at this point. Any advice on how to protect myself in this witch hunt is much needed and appreciated.

TL;DL My coworker is insecure about my past with her now boyfriend and is making up disgusting rumors about me in the work place. Now she is taking me to HR over false claims and trying to get me fired. I have people who will back me up and speak out that she is being nasty but I need advice on what I should say or do to protect myself from losing my job.",11Jan2018,4
