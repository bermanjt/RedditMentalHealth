0,"Hello Reddit! The story is fairly simple but it's got me quite aggravated. My friend [24M] and I [22M] have been friends for a few years and he is my current roommate. We were hanging out on May 4th and we both had made plans that on the 5th we would drink together during the day, plans he specifically brought up. After I got home from work in the morning on the 5th (I work graveyard 2:30a - 11:00a) I text him and asked him where he was. He was being a bit strange and wouldn't tell me where he was or anything else. Okay, that's cool I guess, just strange. Finally he says that he will ""Be home in a bit. Few more errands to run"". I assumed this means a few hours tops. WRONG. After about 7ish hours I text him, explaining I wish he would have told me that he was going to be so long, because I could have gone out with other people who invited me out for Cinco De Mayo and now I have to go to bed (which he was more than aware of). I explained this made me a bit aggravated. Instead of admitting fault, he shifted the blame, saying that I could have gone out with other people and it's my fault I waited for him. Ermm... okay. I continued to explain that when I make plans, I try to stick to them and had you not been vague and given me some details I would have known to do something else instead of waiting around all day. Anyways, he ended the conversation by saying ""Meh you’ll be fine."". That's when I went from being slightly annoyed I wasted my day, to pretty pissed, I try not to fight with bros too often, but I have recently had something happen in my life where I realized I don't need people treating me like shit. Since then, we've hardly talked and conversations have been kept to a minimum. I brought it up again but once again he's still not admitting fault, which I told him is why I'm annoyed. So, what do I do? Am I wrong for being mad? Not so much at the fact I was blown off but the blatant disregard in the final text. Advice please!",21May2018,1
1,So me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 2 months now and my older sister has been nothing but rude to her. She told me that she isn't worth my time and she isn't a good person. Well I love my girlfriend and she can't just be happy with me and she has made all my other siblings not like her either. What do I do about this.

2,"Watched a video on bipolar a while ago and it's like everything in my life just clicked and made sense, I go through periods of depression and hypomania usually lasting around a month or so each. But recently it's been getting more frequent and harder hitting. Like for the past 2 weeks I've been in one of the worse moods of my life, and I had no real reason to be. And now I'm the Complete opposite my mind is racing, I just brought mdma from my dealer, and now I can't sleep for shit even though for the past month I've been going sleep at the same time every night.

Like rn I'm been trying to sleep for over an hour, eyes shut in bed and my mind is just racing and I feel like I've become less tired from before I went to bed. I just want to do something like play my guitar, or Paint, hell I'll even revise at this point. But I wanted to go to the gym early tomorrow but now even if I do sleep right this second I won't wake up early enough to go.

Sorry if this is a strange question but could use some advice. ",21May2018,1
3,"Hi \- 

**BACKGROUND:**

Recently, I had been working on a Discord \(chat room website/app\) chat Bot. It could post images, gifs, etc. Not very well though, admittedly. I worked on it for about 3 days, day and night. This bot was for a Discord server where I was admin. However, a mod came up with one that the owner really liked. It only took him 1 or 2 days to make as well. They both decided to remove my bot. 

I know some of you have been through something like that. Where you're working so hard on something just for someone else to present something ""better"". I'm aware that he probably did a lot more learning than I've done so far, but it still hurt like hell. Someone taking the one thing you're proud of. 

**ADVICE PART:** 

My question is how do I move on? I know I can, but how do I just take a breather and realize it will all be okay? That I can get better and so forth? Feeling like I put a lot of effort into something just for it to be shot down is a pretty crappy feeling but one I'm sure happens a lot to people, especially in the professional world \(I was not making the bot for money\). I felt like harming myself someway but all I needed was a nights rest. I feel this may happen to me more as I grow as a person. 

TL;DR \- Built a discord bot for a server I'm admin in, only for a mod to make a better one and mine taken away. How do I move on from feeling like I was defeated? Where I worked on something so hard \(3 days\) for it all to be taken away by another bot \(1 day\)? ",21May2018,1
5,"My ex and I ended our relationship a bit rockily. She lied to me about why we wanted to break up and I thought she went straight to cheating on me because two days later, she was with someone else. 

We started talking a bit more with each other recently, and I found out I was wrong about a lot of things. One thing she brought up was the fact that her current boyfriend is incredibly creepy, odd, overprotective of her and genuinely a douche if she does something he doesn't like. 

She mentions that she is forced to give him his phone for her to look through it, and that he can be aggressive. I also had reason to believe that he was stalking me for an extended period of time. 

Today, out of nowhere she blocked me on all of our social media, and even text messaging. I don't have any other way to communicate with her and I won't until Tuesday. 

I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to call the police and report possible abuse but what if it was nowhere near as bad as I thought it was? Not enough grounds for police? Please, I need all the help I can get.",21May2018,1
6,"So a while back I decided I would quit soda, I told my whole family and then I made a plan to slowly ease off of it. I made it all the way through the plan and am totally off soda.

11,"x\-post from r/badroommates

To start off, I would like to say I have had my share of bad roommates. Roommates that have walked out on their lease, that have stolen from me, I've even had to call the police on one of my roommates. However, none of this, and I mean **NONE** will ever amount to the shit storm that unfolded before my eyes today. Okay, about a month and a half ago our \(me and my boyfriend\) most recent roommate moved in. He didn't have much. Just his few bookbags, so I let him use my old bed and bed set that we had put up in the extra room\(which will be his room\). Shortly after, a strong, foul odor started creeping from his room. At first, we didn't think anything of it because he \(roommate\) usually smells nice day to day. After a couple weeks, we noticed the smell getting worse and worse. We bombed his room with glade, and disinfectant spray. To no avail. We opened all three windows in his room, turned the fan on, and brought a rotating fan into the room and left it all day. Upon returning from work, seven hours later, we came home to our entire apartment smelling like **rotten death**. This is the bog of eternal stench bad.

**This was not a drill.** Gas masks \(wrapped up TShirts\) were equipped, we were armed with glade and what little hope we had left. While my boyfriend bombed the house with glade, I gathered every incense, candle, wax burner, and perfume I could find and went to work. **Two hours,** we poured our blood, sweat, and tears into making the house nontoxic again. Then, as if by divine intervention, our roommate walks in. Me, being the non\-confrontational person I am, decided not to say anything to him. As he walks to his room and exclaims, ""It smells great in here!"".

Fast forward to today, I'm cleaning the house, as I usually do on weekends. I'm vacuuming my hallway, and as I get closer to our roommates' room I start smelling **that** odor again. A chill ran down my spine. My hands started to shake. **Not again.** I can't do this again. This time I'm determined. I **have** to get down to the bottom of this. Why does it smell so bad? He's not smelly. Is there old food? Old dog poop? Oh my, was I dreaming. Nothing could have prepared me for what I was walking into. No amount of combat training, house cleaning experience, or even experience with crime scene cleanup would have prepared me for this moment. I called my boyfriend into the room with me, I wasn't fighting this war solo. We crept into his room, nieve, unaware that our lives are about to be changed forever. First, everything looks normal. The room is pretty neat, a few cups, but nothing excessive. I was impressed. My quick judgement would soon prove to be my downfall. Confused at what could possibly be causing this **unearthly** smell, we start searching the room more closely. This is when I notice. The comforter is upside down. Normally, I wouldn't have questioned it, but everything else in the room was neat, *too neat.* Oh no... I thought.

At this point, I'm terrified. My heart is pounding... this is my bed. I asked my boyfriend to come over to the bed with me and pull back the covers, while I brace myself for what we're about to uncover. He pulls it back in one swift motion, swish, right off the bed like a bandaid.

**Mortification and defecation.** The only words to accurately describe the sequence of life altering discoveries we had just stumbled upon. After my boyfriend pulled back the covers, I haven't been the same. My sheets were gone, off the bed completely. In its place, a brown stain very literally bigger than the size of my abdomen. We're *mortified*, my boyfriend drops the covers and we both shake our hands vigorously as if that'll save us from the germs we've been exposed to. **We have a 23\-19. This is not a drill.** We examined for as long as my stomach could handle \(about 10 seconds\). Enough to see the smudged handprints on the walls, blood splattered on the mattress, and a bloody napkin occupying the place where I once slept every night. My boyfriend threw the covers back on the bed, and we evacuated the scene of the crime. Once, we were out of the room and safe. My boyfriend looks at me very seriously and says there is something important he needs to tell me. Apparently, one day while he was looking for the cat, he went into our roommates room to find it, only to find a **foot long** dildo sitting in the middle of the floor.

All the pieces come together, it is anal seepage. It is **LITERALLY** the scene of a shit storm that we have uncovered. I have absolutely no problem with people exploring their sexuality. However, he has his own bathroom and shower. I'm just confused why he had to do it on my bed, with no sheets. And now I'm here, typing this. Still shaking, still traumatized. Completely unsure of how to possibly handle this situation. Help?",21May2018,2
12,"Ok I shall attempt to keep my chill intact in this.

So this past while my mum has been REALLY fucking aggravating and its really pissing everyone off. My family is composed of 4 people, me (16M), my sister (17F), my brother (8M) and my mum (50-58F?)


It's like everyday she has some dumb shit to say. No wait scratch that, every actual second. Here is an example of today alone:
She came home from work at 11PM and I was just cleaning and the very minute she came home she upset the entire house. She came in and started fucking yelling at me about not going to school on friday even though school wasnt on for me and no one showed up. after that I stopped cleaning and made myself tea and listened to music to chill. I take off my headphones to throw the tea bags back into the cupboard after a minute and i hear screaming and crying from my brother.

She says some major bs like ""Go to your dad's house because I think mabey he wont get drunk this weekend since his dole money was cut"" and it made me so mad on friday I called her all these names and she cried. Idk what to do anymore I honestly just hope she stops talking to me now",21May2018,1

17,"I went on a first date today with someone I met online. We've been talking for months, both through OKCupid and then eventually Facebook. She hid her face, only ever showing something like a third of it at a time, in all her photos. But I don't give a shit about that. I'm not the world's most handsome man and I'm far from vain, but I found out there are a few reasons she hides her face in all her photos, even candid ones with friends and family. I believe she's had a stroke of some kind, as she has some signs of it facially, and has a corresponding limp on the same side of the body. Once again, completely cool with that, I'm not afraid of that. 

But then she opened her mouth, and I flashed back to all her photos and realized that not only did she cover her face or pose strangely in every one of them, but that she also never smiled to the point of showing teeth.

Her teeth point every which direction \(fine with that, braces aren't exactly affordable for everyone\), but her teeth are also near rotting out of her face in some areas. She's younger than I am by a few years, so I don't understand how this happens. I'm not ashamed to admit that I barely brush my teeth. It's excruciatingly painful for me due to a genetic abnormality that causes my teeth to have little to no enamel. I use a medicated mouth rinse, floss probably too much and brush my tougue, but brushing my teeth is a rare occurrence. My teeth are yellowing, but otherwise appear normal \(save for having lots of fillings\). So I get having a dental issue. I'm just wondering if hers is something similar, like an actual abnormality, or if she has just been terrible at keeping her teeth healthy her entire life.

So, my quandary is this: Do I ask about her teeth? How would I even broach the subject? 

I feel like this is too personal a question to ask after only one date \(even though we saw two movies and hung out for around seven hours, so it was a pretty big date\) but I also really want to know what I'm potentially getting into. If we're being completely honest, I don't know if I'd be comfortable kissing her knowing that she simply doesn't care about her mouth health and has resigned to eventually having them all fall out or needing to have them extracted and getting dentures. Honestly, dentures wouldn't even bother me, but if the situation is as I fear those are likely still a ways off. I'm just thinking that if she's already let it get this bad, how much worse is she willing to let it get?

The real hard part is that she was very nice and we conversed well \(which is a big plus for me, because if I can't talk to you comfortably things aren't going to work out\). We are weirdly very different people when it comes to our hobbies and interests, but that intrigued me because I've always been a pretty extreme introvert and thought it'd be nice to try hanging out with someone who is so completely different from me. I'd love to see her again, but I'm really torn as to how to broach the subject with her.

Any advice here would be great.

TL:DR First date with a girl, her teeth are atrocious, and I want to ask her about it but don't want to be a dick because otherwise she's great.",21May2018,3
19,"Wassup guys! I’m a 24 year old male. I graduated from college 2 years ago with a degree in management and a 3.9 gpa. After college, I just relaxed for a year and worked for my dads tree removal company. After that, I decided to start applying for management jobs, but I was getting no calls back probably because I had absolutely no retail experience. I decided I would have to take low pay and get some retail experience under my belt, so I started working for a grocery store for 13 an hour and have been working there for 6 months. I don’t really like the company and do not want to move up with them. Last week I visited Denver, where I have a lot of family, and they have been encouraging me for years to move out there. I visit Denver all the time and love the city. When I got back this week I said “let me apply for jobs in both Denver and Virginia and see what happens.” I applied for about ten jobs and have already received 2 calls back. It’s weird how much a little bit of experience can help out. Both were from companies in Denver that would pay me between 50-60k a year. However, I’m not sure if I would really be happier in Denver. I really enjoy being with my parents, my pets, and being able to have my life long friends so close by. Not to mention, if I got a job in Virginia paying me 60k a year, I could save about 2,000 a month (I already have 20k in the bank). Saving money is very important to me because I want to save as much money as I can so I never have to stress about finances in the future. On the other hand, Denver has its pros. I’d be able to live right next to the other half of my family, live in the city (which I love), and be excited about a new journey in my life. In addition, my dream is to become a stand up comedian. Nothing makes me happier than making people laugh and I have 70 pages typed up of jokes. I just have to get some balls and step on stage. In Virginia, all the comedy clubs are an hour drive away from me, but Denver’s comedy scene is booming and I’d be able to quickly walk to a whole bunch of comedy venues. I’d be more motivated to get on stage often if I didn’t have to drive so far all the time. Plus, in college I had so much passion towards my academics, which made no sense to me because I hated school. I feel like I had that passion because I lived away from
Home, I wasn’t in my comfort zone and was on my own. I’m still a hard worker, but I want that passion back. Lastly, moving to Denver is scary. It’d be the farthest I’ve ever lived from home and I’d actually would have bills to pay.

23,"So this text could be a couple pages just due to the history of this, but I’ll do my best to keep it short. 

So, as I’ve just been told not that long ago that myself (24) and my brother (22) will eventually own my great grandmothers land. She started this up back in the 1920s, so the money has only grown over nearly 100 years. My grandmother on my fathers side had 3 kids. My father, and my two uncles. So they’d obviously come across the heir long before I do. 

So, about five years ago I had joined the Navy in hopes of getting a GI Bill of being able to go to college. About almost a year &amp; a half ago, an old friend of mine just happened to come back into my life (we had dated back in my freshman year) and we’ve been together ever since. And about 2 months ago, I got out and am now planning on going to college with my fiancé and living with my parents. So here comes the bad part. 

My grandmother has always been money focused. Having lived with her &amp; my parents about 5 years while still in high school, her &amp; I had not seen eye to eye. We forgave each other. So she moved out right after I got out of Boot Camp. Fast forward to now. So my fiancé &amp; I are trying for a kid, no luck yet. So after about two months living together, my grandma starts telling my parents to tell us certain things. Things like in order to protect my family’s assets, I need to get a prenup. And to eventually get a DNA check once the kid is born, another one with me not being on the will, as long as I’m with my fiancé. 

This, which I think is a natural response, she gets upset. She finds this to be my parents &amp; grandmother to not trust her. She doesn’t want a prenup, nor a DNA test. I trust her, I don’t think she would do such things. I’m not in the position at the money I’d be able to move out right away, simply because I’m still waiting to go to college (starting in fall).

It's pretty sad when I think about it but my happiness these days only comes when she's around, even though I know nothing will happen between us.
I feel like this isn't how a 20 year old man should be thinking. Like I'm too immature, too desperate and that I come off as some sort of attention seeker.
Even as I write those words, I feel this that life should be simpler but it's like I have a hidden desire to be depressed, to be pitied and that in itself leaves me in disgust.

25,"Hi everyone, thanks for reading in advance.

I graduated just over a year ago, and since then have been working in a field that 100% different from engineering. I have a real talent in this field, and it's something I could see myself being really happy/successful in.

My issue is that from time to time I feel overwhelmingly guilty about wasting my degree. My major was biomedical, and while I loved doing my degree, I think that I wouldn't be happy working as an engineer, nor would I excel. People are always asking me what I'm doing now, or where I'm working, and I feel as though im letting everyone down when they hear it's not engineering. 

I guess I'm wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation, and what they've done about it.

27,"Guys, after about 5-6 years, my printer found its end. It served me great. 

Since I just started looking for a new printer, I would like to know what’s new on the market but still affordable

It’s gonna be a personal printer, used only for my own needs. 

I owned a canon  and I was pleased with it so if poasible, I’d like to purchase a new canon model (but really I’m open to any model)


What I want:
- to be able to print on photographic paper (glossy, matte and magnetic) on 10x10, 10x15 , A4 or these usual formats. 
-to print on normal A4 paper
- to have a great color contrast and print quality on any paper type 
- the use of the ink to be moderate/ as economic as possible


Optional but It would be great to have it
- a scanner
- the option to print on cd/dvd 


I mentioned here basically what my old printer did.  There may be other new cool stuffs out there but I am not aware of them so you can let me know if it’s the case. 


I am open to any recommendation. 

My budget: maximum 200$

It may sound not so much but that’s all i can afford honestly. My old printer costed less and i was super pleased with it. 

Hopefully you can help me. Cheers

28,"Hello subreddit, it's been a little while, I can't thank you enough for your help and support in the past, but I wanna know if I'm depressed. My main concern comes from the fact that I don't feel much in the way of positive emotions, I feel a lot of negative. I also have not been able to feel love towards anyone in 2-3 years, after a year long stint with a girl, who in the end left because I was too in love with her and I know that's wrong to show someone you love them a lot, but I couldn't help it, I haven't been able to feel that way about anyone since, I just wanna feel the euphoria of falling in love and be able to look past all their flaws and just see them as perfection.",21May2018,2
29,"I don't know how to explain this but I'll do my best. Ever since I was little if I needed to pee and there wasn't a bathroom nearby I would panick. It's my absolute worst nightmare. When I need to pee it burns and it hurts (normal I think) but I panick if there isn't a bathroom nearby. My family loves to take road trips and its my worst fear. They get annoyed if I want to stop to pee and tell me to wait. We only stop every 3-5 hours, and I need to stop AT LEAST every 2 hours. Once I made the mistake of drinking too much and my mom didn't want to stop and I needed to pee so bad I feel like I held it 30 more minutes than I could handle and was sobbing in the car about to piss myself. It hurt really bad too. She stopped eventually and I was crying and shaking pretty much the rest of the ride home. When we go on road trips, the day before I stop drinking anything at all, and will absolutely refuse any drinks until we are at our destination. After doing this, I still feel the urge to pee at least every 2 hours, and its so hard. This week we will be driving to Yellowstone, which is 22 hours from where I live. I plan to stop drinking 1 day before we leave, and won't start again until we stop for the night, but even then I'll try not to drink anything. I fully understand what I am doing to my body, but I would rather suffer being extremely thirsty, dizzy, and nauseous then need to pee. I know this sounds absolutely ridiculous to most people, but I am so afraid of needing to pee on this trip that I am willing to do ANYTHING. I don't know if this is my anxiety or a phobia or something, but I just need advice on what to do. We leave in a few days and I'm a nervous wreck. Please give me ANY advice, I would really appreciate it. 

Tldr; Need advice on what to do so I don't need to pee on long trip. ",21May2018,1
31,"So I was once in college, right from high school. One thing after another and I'm working for a big box retailer.

33,"Im 25 (M). I met a girl 2 years ago, liked her, asked her out, but she had a BF. So we agreed to be friends. No problem. A month ago, she invites me to a show, kisses me. Says her and her Boyfriend split in February. Says she's wanted me since we met. Well we've been fooling around and fucking and hanging out a bit, and its something Ive wanted since meeting her. I caught feelings pretty quickly. 
She always wants to sleep over, or have me sleep over. Always wants to go out, drinks a lot, she's running from something. She's got demons.

Twist, they decided to co sign again after breaking up. 
AH okay.

I told her I don't think she's over this dude, or begun to accept that its over, and that thats SUPER fucking weird. But they live in seperate rooms, and apparently have both brought people home, with no hard feelings. She has been trying to convince me that she swears it is over and that it isn't like that. That it was an irrational decision toile there but that they are truly over. They have 2 other roommates, it is not just them for what thats worth.

My general feeling is that she was afraid of moving out, and couldn't handle it at the time, panicked, and decided to stay there. She is obviously working through some major demons, and I just recommended she see a shrink, which she starts Tuesday. 

She told me she loved me. I think I might be falling for her, which sucks, because once im in, its hard for me to stay objective. The rose colored glasses and all this.

So, basically, I realize this is fucked. I felt like a huge rebound/escape until I bled these feelings out to her and she assured me otherwise. I also realize the situation is insane and the obvious implications are that she needs time alone to heal and figure out what she wants. But I just really like this girl, I want to believe she isn't just ya know.. a wreck. and the sex is just.. Jesus.

34," After working solely in retail for eight years \(and mostly hating it\), I decided to give the hospitality path a shot. Despite having no experience in the field, I was lucky enough to land a job at a Hilton hotel. 

I figure not having to deal with sales goals and rude customers means hospitality will be an upgrade from my previous jobs, but I'm sure I'll face a whole new set of challenges. I'll try to shoot for the graveyard shift, as I'm thinking that'll be the slightly easier time of day to work.

If there's anyone here in the field, what should I expect? Is that Opera system as complicated as my new manager has warned me about? If you have worked both retail and hospitality, which did you end up preferring?

38,"Hello everyone, first of all I'm sorry for any error I could make in this post, English is not my first language but I'll try my best.

So, one of my best friend don't want to struggle to live anymore, let me explain his situation, I will not put too many detail cause I don't have his permission to publish them online.
He is a 17 yo with a lot of trauma (rape and a parental issuewhen he was younger, which lead to him living with a parent they can't be there for him), so he has quite a background and already tried to kill himself 3 times.
In March was his 3rth try, he did it because of flashback of his rape and a friendzone by his only real life friend ( im basically a long time online friend that met him irl only recently so... I count but not as much as a real friend ), the girl in question refuse to date him a first time in December, but finally agree in early March but run away after only one week and one date, he was broken felt alone and just wanted it to end, fortunately he failed his attempt, and lived for his family, and that girl afterward ( as a good friend) but never for himself.
One month before now, this girl, his best friend, joined him in his bed after a small party where I was, we were 4, and they slept together which was not supposed to happen, well you guessed, they did naughty little things ( thanks alcohol, I guess) , and now the girl is / want to be friend with benefit, but... The problem is that she has also many trauma, and don't want anything serious but... She let him hope for that, saying that she has feeling but don't know what they are etc.
Here the true problem :this girl is his only '' light '' as he put it, she is the only reason why he go to school and why he is not dead, it's literally his only actual friend, and this relation is what he want but also not what he want, plus the girl is realy unstable:
When she is trying to be near him, he want to live, but when she is colder, he just can't accept it and want to die, he get flashback from his rape and just can't bear to be alone etc, the girl know that but keep bringing him closer and then push him away.
What lead me to post this here is that this morning, he told me that he can't bear it and was going to hang himself in a stockhouse near his home, I called him many time and finally succeed to let him go home etc, we talked for  a long time and he finally told me that he don't think that he will pass the week, cause during class days, his best friend is not the same, she don't assume their relation in front of other and recently told him that she don't want to kiss him outside of vacations or something like that so : he think that he is realy gonna kill himself this week, he told me shitty things like how and when, I spent hours today speaking to him about why he need to live to get better and don't simply give up and die and... I don't know what to do more, I fear that one day I will wake up and he would have done his business and kill himself silently, this time succeeding his suicide. 

I hope that all this is possible to read, im sorry if this post is difficult to read, thanks for the read and possibly for the advices! ",21May2018,1
39,"I admit that I enjoy being with someone sexually but, I feel that I am not who I want to be when I am with someone in this way. In order to attract anyone, I have to try to do so, and I don't enjoy ""the chase""... I enjoy being myself most when I am not trying to impress anyone. I do not like people having expectations of me and I feel like all relationships require these things.

Having said these things, the only purpose for me to have a relationship (my only motivation) is sex. Honestly I even find 99.99% of friendships to be the same as well (expectations, impressing them, not being completely myself).

Am I just finding the wrong people? It seems like this applies to 99.99% of people though... I just want to be free of fake laughing, impressing and expectations. Any thoughts are much appreciated.

45,"So, first of all excuse me if I'm breaking some _reddiquette_ by posting to this subreddit, I've been a long time lurker and sporadic poster in other subreddits, but I've never done it here, so, let me know if I should edit something. I don't even know if I'm going to publish this TBH, I guess this is just my way of venting for now, so this is going to be **long**.

I'm 37 years old, Mexican. I've been in Canada for exactly 5 days, and right now I'm alone in the living room of the woman that just dumped me, shocked of what just happened, and kind of blaming myself for everything for not listening to myself.

It all started a couple weeks after the big earthquake that hit Mexico City last year, I was by no means _happy_ with my life, I mean, I couldn't complain either because I had a job, health etc. etc. I just was in a weird place emotionally, I don't have kids (always wanted one of those), and I have been out of a proper relationship for almost 5 years, I had the sporadic Tinder encounters but nothing that helped me to fill the void (if anything using Tinder made it worse), and also my career took a weird turn the previous month because I was doing basic stuff that didn't feel like a challenge (the pay was good though), anyways I wasn't feeling good about myself.

Then out of nowhere I receive this message on facebook from an ex girlfriend I haven't heard about for almost 18 years, she used the earthquake as an excuse to message me asking me if I was OK. At first I thought of ignoring her, since we had this very short relationship when we were practically kids, she's from Canada (half Mexican, half native Canadian) to be honest I don't even remember how we met, an online dating service I assume, but we both ended up in Mexico City at the same time (I lived in Cancun back then). The only thing I remember vividly about that relationship though, is that all of a sudden she ended it, no reasons, no explanations she just vanished, that's why I hesitated to answer back, but after a couple of hours I ended up responding.

The explanation I received about her sudden disappearance was that _I overwhelmed her_ that she thought that I was being super intense and she freaked out, she also said that once she did that, she regretted it almost right away, but never found the courage to talk to me again. At that point I'm confused because I thought she didn't have any reasons to think about me as this intense latin lover, I mean, I'm passionate and everything but at that point in my life I was just another 18-19 year old who wanted to have a good time and is basically stupid 80% of the time, at least that's how I remember my old self. So, we keep talking and she tells me her life story, she's in the process of having a divorce, her ex is an alcoholic that hit her (among other despicable things) and threatened her life and her child's. Oh yeah, she has a 3 year old. Basically it's been super hard for her, she was with him for 10 years. So I told her my own collection of bad memories with love (not nearly as bad as hers), and basically we conclude that we're in the time of our lives that playing games is just stupid and we're focusing in our self improvement and gaining back our self esteem. Before I know we're talking on the phone everyday.

At first she asked me to not call her on specific days because she had these meetings with the ex to figure out the divorce, and I decide to back off a little, I've never been involved with married women, and I don't like that kind of conflict, so I tell her that while she's in that process, it was better for us not to talk. She explained to me that her relationship it's over long time ago, and that she just needed _to get her money back_, I never bothered to ask what she meant by that, I just didn't want anything to do with her past, so we keep talking and by end of November we're talking about giving it a shot as a couple, I was super explicit telling her that I wasn't interested in a long distance relationship, so, if we were going to function as a couple we had to plan either she coming to Mexico or me going to Canada, turned out that because of the divorce, taking her child out of the country was a _no no_, so we start taking about me coming to Canada.

At this point I've noticed a few things that bothered me about the way she was doing / saying, but given the way her life went up until that point, it kinda made sense, nevertheless I told her what I thought because we had this agreement that we were going to try to be as honest as possible, after all, we're not kids anymore… we're a couple of adults who have been through a fair amount of shit, so honesty is one of those thing we see as musts to have a healthy relationship; I say to her what bothered me in all honesty and she says somethings back which I found super refreshing, and got super motivated about that… I had finally found someone who _gets me_.

Now, it's important for me to clarify that at this point I'm super engaged about the idea of _starting over_, but life has made it difficult for me in _feeling matters_, I've gone _all in_ before to only have my heart broken, so I decided to be cautious, see how things develop and come to Canada first to see if this was for real before taking any harsh decisions or allow myself to fall in love. Also important to clarify that I'm a risk taker, I'm not afraid of big changes if they serve a purpose or allow me to improve as a person, that's why I thought that it was necessary to stop my own horses before confirming that this was _the real deal_. Also important to note, that I'm kind of a disciplined guy for some stuff, nothing like a military guy or something like that, I just like setting rules for certain stuff in order to achieve stuff, and I don't mind being harsh to myself while following them. I don't know if that's the right way of doing stuff, but it's just the way that has worked for me all this time.

So, after organizing a lot, I get a couple weeks off in February, and I came to Canada. The first issue I encountered is that her mom practically lives with her, I mean she has her own room and basically runs the place, you know how Mexican moms are (I hope), So I tell her that I'm not thrilled about that idea, but I get that she being a working mom makes sense that her mom helps her, and we agreed upon finding ways to gradually fix that issue (specially the running the whole place one), she also lets me know some stuff that she doesn't like about me, small fixable stuff, you know… habits a single guy gets from a long time of living alone. Now, remember I told you that when we started talking I noticed some stuff I didn't like? well, now I was seeing the full force of this, she acted like a _pleaser_, whatever her mom said, she did, whatever I said she agreed. In my experience this is a very dangerous personality trait, because one, it's very easy to get used to have someone always agreeing with you… and start to take advantage of that, and two, the pleaser will either end up consumed by the relationship or exploding because not being listened to, so while I stayed here, we talked loooooooong time about this issue, I explained to her that I didn't find that treat attractive at all, quite te opposite, and also told her that the deal was to be honest, and always agreeing with me isn't honesty. She gave me her reasons and we also agreed to work on that as a couple. The mom issue though, after a couple days started to get obvious that was going to be the main issue, the mom was just being super territorial, to the point that once when I was helping her giving the kid a bath (I was playing with the kid while she took care of it), she complained to her in front of me, one of the many super awkward moments I'd have in my stay. It was clear for me that the main issue with our relationship was going to be dealing with the mom. was it worth it though? I even live far from my mom to avoid those kind of conflicts, now I would have to deal with a mom that was even more territorial, old-fashioned and showing all the cultural treats that I hate about us Mexicans? my first answer was no… but then, the kid happened.

Man, this kid won me over. I've always been a kid's guy, I mean, I have never had one of my own and maybe that's why I like them or maybe is because I'm not mature enough and that's why enjoy playing with kids, who knows. But ever since I met this one, I completely fell in love. I don't know what clicked on me, but something did. The sad part was the spoiling, man this kid is **spoiled**, I mean… for my standards, although cultural differences might have something to do with my perception. Just to give you an idea, the kid is 3 1/2 years old, and even though he's proven to be able to talk, he never does, he just points at stuff and immediately gets what he wants, and that's part of the issue … he's a good natured boy, that's why I fell for him, he's not trying to do bad things or _abusing his power_. But the normality of the house is to give him what he wants, when he wants it. He also doesn't have any kind of discipline, I mean, I know kids are kind of crazy but I've seen well behaved kids, they at least listen when mom or dad get angry, but here anything can be done as long as the kid smiles at the end. also when we took him out, he'd run like if he was in his house with no regard of his surroundings, for a lack of a better word, he's kinda _wild_. Obviously, since the deal was honesty, I immediately told her what I felt, first that I thought that the boy was special (for me at least) and second that I thought his potential was being kinda wasted with the way they were raising him, and I told her that saying him **No** from time to time, or forcing him say something before giving him stuff wasn't a bad idea either. I expected a somewhat defensive answer, after all, she's his mom… she's been condoning the behavior I bet she's gonna get super feisty with me. But no, super calmly she agrees with me and tells me that she's aware of the issue and she gives me full empowerment to help her, her words were something like: _""you're gonna be part of this family, and the deal was that we both would be equals on this. But you gotta understand that he went into some hard stuff when I was in my past relationship, so that's why I'm a bit forgiving with him, but we're gonna find a way of getting this fixed.""_  Man, that response erased all the doubts that I had in my mind, I belonged in this family, we would fix all this _minor_ issues with hard work and communication we're a team.

So, I made up my mind… I'm staying, I can quit my job and find something relatively easy, I mean, a mobile/frontend engineer/manager with 20+ years of experience shouldn't have a lot of troubles finding a new gig these days, right? So I told her my intentions to change my plane ticket so instead of staying for two weeks (that have almost been passed at that point) I'd stay for the extent of the 3 months my tourist visa gave me. She had a mini heart attack, I remember her face perfectly, now it kinda makes sense but back then I couldn't understand the reaction and just figured that I was misinterpreting it. She convinced me not to do it, she told me that she needed time to figure stuff out with her mom, that I shouldn't take this harsh decisions, because she didn't want to be the only one working, I mean, all perfectly reasonable arguments, I did have a story of being quick to make decisions, and this wasn't a small one, so she made sense… I decided to go back to Mexico. We agreed upon starting making preparations for our new life together, I was going to find a stable job in Canada and she was going to deal with the unhealthy behavior in her house gradually so I could fit in better, man I was excited.

I'm back in Mexico, and I'm gonna be brief about this part because this rant has gone long enough, but I managed to convince the company I work for to work remotely, I gave up the apartment I was renting in Mexico City, and since she can't have pets in the house she's renting I took my three dogs and my car to my parent's house in Cancun so she can take care of them while I settled here in Canada, sold my furniture, gave up most of my clothes, the whole deal… I gave up my life in Mexico. Obviously my friends advised me to be cautious, but I had been cautious on February, how in the world I'm gonna feel happy if I don't allow myself to trust again, she's proven her interest, I'm gonna be OK, it's gonna be super challenging, yes. But that's what had me depressed on September 2017, the lack of challenge and a family, drive, I got all of those. I'm going all in. 

She gave me no reason to think something had changed, not until Friday of last week (11th) when I told her that I finally (after a lot of hassle, you have no idea) had my side of things all figured out and I was about to buy my plane ticket. She agreed and told me that was super excited which made me even more excited. I grab my plane (that by itself is a good story, but let's skip it) and while in my way I started to note a different tone on her, normally she's super helpful and joyful but now she seemed somewhat indifferent, but I decided to pay much attention to it, I'm an overthinker so, that's no way of starting this new life. I arrive and for some reason something feels off, like she's not smiling the way she did before, I don't know man, I just saw something different, but again… I'm not going to overthink shit again, just start with the new life already, this is super exciting.

So, _my life here in Canada_ started last Tuesday morning, she went to work and I came to where I'm writing these lines to start my work, after a while when I finish my first half of the day, my now _mother in law_ (not quite but you get the idea) asks me to go upstairs and have a talk. The last time I have **the talk** with a girlfriend's parent I was 20 maybe, it was super odd but cute, since she was trying to be tough with me, asked me about my intentions and tried to be as polite as possible (Normally I don't like to explain my intentions, but hey, new life) and I went honest, told her that I was going to start a family with her daughter and I'm going to try to be as close as possible to a father to her grandkid, that I know that she has this idea of men in her daughter's life, but that I wanted the benefit from the doubt, because I'm just a different person. I think she liked what I said because after that she kind of relaxed, and I don't remember how we started talking about the kid, I just remember thinking _ok, now you have to be super careful here_. I told her that I admired her effort with the kid, because I know how tiring taking care of him can be, but that now she could rely on me whenever she saw fit, because I just wanted the best for him, and the idea was that both of us to gradually take care of the responsibilities of taking care of him. I was kind of proud of the way I handled myself, I know my mom wouldn't recognize that diplomatic guy who answered those questions. haha.

When my new partner arrived from work, I was eager to share with her my experience with her mom, turns out she got mad at me because I told her the gradually taking care of the kid part, didn't tell me why though. So communication started with the left foot, but hey, it's a small thing, nothing that we can't talk over. So the week goes by with small episodes in which the kid is clearly being spoiled, and me being around noticing it, obviously. So I start to give feedback, I mean, not instructions… just what I thought we as partners should do to tackle those things, she either answered with nodding her head or simply not saying anything. 

After she got mad at me for talking to her mom, I told her that I'd be more careful and won't come up as much to avoid any issues so she manages her mom, and that's what I did, but then… when she arrived (5pm) we had dinner together (In Mexico we never have dinner this early) and after than was time for him to go to bed (6pm, 7pm at most) and if you remember last time I came, I wasn't allowed to be _alone_ with her and the child because the mom would freak out, so the first two days I tried to be understanding but that meant that I was going to see the kid for what 1-2 hours a day? and even worse, last time I was here, the kid slept on his own bed… git his mom by his side, but in his bed. Now he's sleeping with her mom, and I tell her that I don't think that's a good idea if we're trying to gradually take him into our care, that he should sleep in his room and maybe we can both try to be with him. she didn't say anything … but on Friday, without me saying anything she asked me to go with her to help her put him to bed. I was so excited, we tried to read a story, we played with colors, numbers, etc. I was happy because we were bonding as a family for the first time since I arrived. He wouldn't go to sleep, but hey, at least we were going into the right direction, she seemed fed up for some reason, we had been in the room for like an hour maybe? and she told me, well… _he's not sleeping, I'm gonna take him with my mom_, and I just answered, why don't we try for a little longer? I mean we have nothing to lose, and didn't say anything but seemed even more fed up, but I didn't care since I was having a good time and the boy did too. Then, calamity happened. Her mom opened the room door, and started telling her in a somewhat loud voice that why isn't she taking the kid to her (she was listening to us, apparently) At that precise moment I was beside the bed in a rocking chair looking at him, and just stood there without saying a word and I just looked at her with what I believe was a _told you_ look. So she decided to say _I'm not going to take him, we're gonna try make him sleep_ to which her mom responded by kind of slamming the door, and leaving the house. She told me in a super calmed voice _I knew this would happen_ to which I just answered, well thanks for that, is a step in the right direction, we eventually went downstairs again and tired him out by playing.

So yesterday morning, everything seemed normal, we had breakfast, the kid usually goes with his dad (which I haven't met btw, he just recently find out about me and flipped out) every two weeks on the weekend and she  had to go out and I had to do some stuff for work, we see each other for lunch and after we ate he, The ex brought the kid and told her that he was already dating someone new (she told me this), and she was acting all normal, like you would expect from someone who's over her past relationship. After a while the kid wanted to do his favorite activity for which he needs our help, and I just thought to myself this is a great opportunity. We had this deal that we were going to be equals, and that if she said something to him, even though I didn't agree I was going to support her, and that the same applied for me. So I decided to use this rule and said to him that he couldn't have the thing he wanted until he said the word for it. Obviously he sought help from his mom, but her knowing of this rule didn't help him. So we spend a good hour him trying to get what he wanted and me not giving it, until she decided to give it to him. So I told her, _hey we decided we were not going to do these kind of stuff_, and she just nods, and then I started to tell her all of the things that we agreed upon, that I wanted her to make an effort to change some stuff, that if I went all the way to change all the things I changed in my life, she could make an effort to change this little things, _it's not like he's getting hurt or anything, he's just not getting what he wants_. I told her that he wasn't the problem, because he's just a kid being a kid, but we as adults are the ones that are able to change so we should do that. At this moment I could see her visible angry, but decided to just nod or ""aha"" whatever I was saying. After that I asked her to leave the room where the kid was and asked if she didn't agree with I was saying she needed to tell me, that I could see she was mad, and asked her, what would you do in my position? she just repeated ""I don't know, I don't know"" but her face was super angry. I got fed up with that and told her that I was going to go downstairs so she could calm down and we could talk about it. I ended up falling asleep in the living room.

I wake up in the morning, and she's sitting in front of me and she says… _We agreed that we were going to be honest with each other, didn't we?_ I obviously nodded, _It's been a week and I can't stand you anymore, I don't think this is going to work. You've spent the whole telling me what to do, and I promised myself that I wasn't going to allow myself to change for anyone, I know you have a point on some of the stuff you're saying, but I just don't want to change so, I won't._ I just laid there in shock, _so what does this mean? this is hard for me too, you know?_ and she says yeah I know, but I wont change. Then I told her that there was a middle ground we could find, I mean, it's only been a week, nope, she wants me gone.

At first I got super angry at her, and I was going to start a fight, you know, saying _you don't know how much I gave up for this_ or _why don't you thought about this before I came here, it's not like I hide my views in all of this_ but there was something in her face, I knew that sha had made up her mind, so I decided no to fight or say anything… I just said that I needed this week here to find out what to do next, and asked her if she was completely sure that this meant that she couldn't go back again and said she regretted what she did. She calmly nodded. I told her that I was going to be the responsible adult and I was going to be _hidden_ from the kid to not confuse him further.

So here I am, on the living room alone, with no house or belongings in Mexico, and no new life in Canada. At first I was going to move the date for the plane ticket and go back to Cancun to my parent's house to figure stuff out, but then I thought that I might as well visit parts of Canada now that I'm here… then I got angry at me for trusting once again, and then I decided to write this.

Now I feel more calmed, but still clueless of what to do next. I started writing this, because I thought that remembering all that I've been through for the last months would help me find an answer for what just happened, but you know what?  I think I don't care anymore, I feel regardless of her motives this was a very shitty move on her part. Maybe the notion of her ex finding someone else made her realize something, or maybe I am a shitty annoyance … but she could've perfectly avoided this, telling me she wasn't sure at least 6 days ago.


Anyways, what do you think? if you made this far it would be great to know your thoughts, or your suggestions, I mean I really can't move this week because I have lots of work, but after this week … I'm moving to an AirBnB, or maybe back to Cancun, perhaps go to Toronto and stay there or maybe take the long train to Vancouver.

It's going to be a shitty but interesting week.",21May2018,1

48,"So there's this guy from our high school (i'm in middle school, he's like a year older) who recently just showed up to my house to ask me out. He knows where I live because we hang out like a year ago (we aren't friends currently). So, not knowing him at all, I denied him but he just kind of hung around out my house. And then, he just kind of started touching me. I'm not really a touch person and it wasn't much but I told him to stop, and he wouldn't, so I kneed him in the balls twice.

He came back again without asking for my permission and just kind of stepped into my house and tried the same thing again, and then I ended up telling my mom about it. She laughed it off and said to ""keep things to a minimum until i start dating him"". Wow, thanks mom, real helpful.

He showed up a third time to my house with a friend of mine who said she would be showing up alone (so we could hang out) and then the creepy stalker psychopath guy was there too and then like, on a scale of one to ten, he was touching me at a seven. That's when I basically beat him up and forced him to leave. He hasn't shown up since and I'm not sure what to do because I'm afraid he'll show up again, and my mom doesn't give a fuck.

I have been masturbating almost every day, at least twice, since I was 11. That’s been over 10 grueling years. I’ve known it was a problem forever, but I can’t stop. 

I do it at home, a lot, I’ve done it in the bathroom at work, I do it at friend’s houses when everyone is asleep. I can’t stop. 

I asked my therapist for advice, but I didn’t actually get the tips I needed. 

A week ago, I managed to stop for 3 days, and then proceeded to do it as many times when I was done. 

It’s ruining my sex life with my girlfriend because I can’t manage to last with her for a long time, because of how conditioned I am to doing it. Sex with her rarely relieves me, and I’ll often masturbate a few hours after sex. 

I feel like this has the potential to destroy my relationship with her, because I honestly feel like it’ll be a year or two before my need for masturbation will turn into a need for sex, and cause me to turn to cheating. Sometimes, I think about it anyways, just to get that feeling of relief. 

And it isn’t really an addiction to porn. I don’t need it. I can do it with out. This is strictly a horrible masturbation addiction. 

It also takes up as much as an hour of my day sometimes. It severely impacts my productivity at home when I want to write or play video games. 

I’m a grown man and I need to stop, but I don’t know how. I can’t make it more than 3 days without horribly cracking. Please, give me some advice.

52,"I just recently started this job (about march 5th I think) and it started out great and has slowly gone down hill. 

My problems boil down to the assistant manager, at first I played it off thinking it was my own fault. I'm new, I have learned enough, shes just helping me. It took 2 customers apologizing to me for me to realize its not me its her. 

Its like she flip-flops between belittling me and being nice. I have listened and watched how she treats others who have just started (there is 5 of us who are fairly new) and she never talks to them like she does me. 
The first time was about a month ago I was heading to go work my area and she stopped me and in a condescending tone asked me where I was spose to work, I told her and she replied no what else? I had no idea what she was talking about and said Ya and stated the area. She got upset and started repeating nope what are you spoce to be doing? read the list read the list, as if I was a grade school child.  I got to the chart that lists what we are to do for the day and she had changed the cleaning groups to where I was to sweap and never told me. 
I said ok and walked away I had no problems sweaping, I didnt like how she had talked to me. (I assumed it was because I was new and let it go) 

Saturday the 19th of this month was my breaking point, I have been coping the best I can but I don't know what to do anymore.

She once again got an attitude in front of a customer I was checking out over me running out of change (I never had time to tell her ether she was gone of some where or I was checking out more customers) I stopped her and told her I needed 1's to which she replied ""you let yourself run out?"" in an aggravated tone, I tried to explain but she huffed away muttering under her breath to get my change, I owed the man 2 dollers. He apologized to me for making me run out of change then asked if I could just give him quarters but the assistant manager had closed my drawer and was the only one who could open it, I told him this and he just got quite. I was trying to stay polite as I could but when she returned she said nothing handed me the money for my drawer then walked off talking to another cashier, me and the customer could here her saying how we should have alarms for when we run out so it doesn't happen again. 

The reason she said this was because earlier I told her I needed quarters and she wondered off only to be called to the front when I ran out (I had 1 quarter in my register) to which she complained that I should have told her.

I have thought about telling the actual manager but after the last time we talked I don't think she cares about her workers or her customers at all.

There has been many other times this assistant manager has said or done things in regards to me in front of my co-workers and the manager her self, they say and do nothing leading me to believe this is mostly my fault until 2 customers at separate times apologized to me for they way the assistant manager has acted.

So I dont know what to do here, I want to quit but I need a job till I find something else but shes causing my anxiety to act up (I feel like shes going to belittle me or set me off every time she comes near me) which is making my depression act up.

advice?

I’m not stupid, I just have a severe lack of motivation and that has led me to staying home from school often and just not even bothering studying. This past year, I have been on the verge of depression, and I have let my distractions completely take over my life. I am a master of procrastination. I can’t just do something without delaying it time after time. I had plans to fix my school stuff, but, it didn’t work out.
My parents, especially my mom, has the mentality that IF I fail high school (I’m european so don’t take high school literally) she doesn’t think I’ve done anything worth celebrating for. Where I’m from, families throw a huge party in the name of their children’s graduation, and my mom means that if I were to fail, she would call it off.

She was a great student her whole life, but since starting when she got to college she's let her grades slip to the point where college will take her a whole year longer to graduate (3 more years instead of 2).

She took a tolerance break three weeks ago and it's been the best three weeks since we started dating, but now she wants to start up again and is telling me ""it's different now.""

However, I will not have the funds to purchase it all at once. 


At the moment, the two options easily offered by the [Lenovo page](https://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/landingpage/lenovo-financing-options/) are the following:

* Klarna (Credit Financing) 
*""NO INTEREST if paid in full within 6 or 12 mos for orders $300-$1499.""*

I apply with my SSN and believe I would need a credit score for this, which I do not have.

* Zibby (Lease To Own)
*""No credit? No problem!
Checkout Zibby's 90 days same as cash after $45 first payment.""*

Supposedly, I can apply for this with no credit score and, theoretically, I should be able to pay it off within the 90 day period (three months), as I will be working at the university I attend. In addition to this, I will be making the minimum payments out of my savings (which I should have between $500 and $600 in by the end of August). If the 90-day-period comes to an end and I am unable to complete the full payment, my parents will be willing to spot me the money, but I would prefer to make this purchase without depending on them.

In terms of rent and food (which is all I am currently responsible for), I get a payment from my university for financial aid which goes to my rent, and I pay for food with the money I earn from work as well as a small allowance, when necessary, from my parents.


**My question is:**
Would it be a good idea to do the Zibby financing option? If not, why not? Are there any other factors I am not counting which I should consider?",21May2018,3
78,"This is really hard for me to open up about even though I am using a fake account but I treat my girlfriend so horribly and I'm barley accepting that. 

I call her nasty degrading words. I have a short temper. I yell at her. I threaten to do horrible things if she ever leaves me. I subconsciously manipulate her to pity me. 

When I do all of these things I'm not thinking straight. After a while I start to realize how badly I hurt her feelings. I regret it so much because I love her more than anything. She's never done anything but be loyal and supportive.

We're both 18 so I'm not sure what to do. I always apologize and I really do mean it but I end up just doing it all over again. I don't want her to leave me.

79,"I’m [17F] currently enrolling into university for my freshman year, while my sister [21F]  is entering her final year at the same school. Both of us currently live at home, but there are several reasons why we really want to move out:

• As of right now, my parents are very overprotective in the sense that they don’t really let my sister stay out of the house past late hours. She’s old enough, but they really disprove of anything in the category of clubbing/drinking/staying out late in general. Having an apartment on our own would be more freedom for us.

• Not sure if this is an important detail, but my sister does have a car. She’s been able to drive for about a year, so I think it’s safe to say that she could transport us both to and from the university and our apartment.

• We both go to a commuter school, and it takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to get to the university from our house. The apartment we’re looking at is very close to the college (5-10 min.)

• Following my freshman year of uni, I’m transferring to a bigger school through a coordinated admissions program, where I would have an apartment on my own. Having an apartment next year while I still live in my hometown would be a great way to warm up to the idea, and help me adjust.

• My parents would likely be willing to pay for the apartment (they’re paying for tuition currently.)

So the main thing here is regarding the first bullet point I made. I feel like our argument is strong enough, but honestly, I don’t know if they trust us enough to let us live on our own. We would still definitely visit them on the weekends, and they could drop in whenever. It’s really just that we want a sense of independence.

TLDR; Me and my sister want an apartment on our own, but I don’t know how I would bring this up with our parents. Please help!",21May2018,1
80,"Long story short, I began to stop having feelings for my boyfriend that I met online after he began to cut himself for pleasure because he was exploring his masochist feelings and I was getting pretty uncomfortable, the boy I once had feelings for changing for the worse. And I've been wanting to break up with him for a while, and when I did he was pretty heartbroken but we remained as friends and he respected my choices. (If I accidentally call him a she, it's because I'm still getting use to his new pronouns).

Though it was the last week of school and I wanted to focus on getting good grades. So I stopped talking to him for a few days. I made a pretty bad choice because I should've told him that I just needed some space by I didn't and just stopped talking to him out of nowhere(admittingly it wasn't just for school, I kinda wanted to take a break from him as well.)

After a few days, his friend talked to me through direct messaging and told me to stop ignoring my ex, but just like an asshole I ignored that as well. 

Then after that, he began getting depressed from my absense and started to leave voicemails that he needs me to help him get through the breakup and honestly I got so annoyed at that point that I just ignored it as well and didn't talk to him all still. I feel horribly about it now. 

In the past he dealt with some horrible relationships, past two lovers cheating on him and his most recent ex besides me ignoring him completely. He was also very suicidal in the past, trying to commit suicide after at least five times when he was dating me (these suicidal attempts were usually after arguments.)

And after ignoring him, it lead to another suicide attempt. This time his friends were absolutely concerned, inviting me to a group chat after seeing the suicide note he left on his story alone with his profile picture changed to his hand all bloody and cut up. 

In all honesty, I didn't want to be involved in this at all. I ignored it and only watched in the sidelines. I never wanted this to happen and I feel absolutely guilty knowing this was all my fault. I only was actually straight up ignoring him after the annoying voicemails, it wasn't just for school at this point. I don't want to ever talk to him again and I feel horrible about it. 

I'm scared, what if he attempts suicide again and actually succeeds in it while I just watched and ignored? I don't know how to deal with this, I tell myself that I'm just removing the toxicity from my life but then there's the chance that I'm the cause of another human being's life. Am I a horrible person for still not wanting to talk to him even after all of this? 

I forgot to mention, he DOES get professional help. He has a therapist and his family gives him all the attention for his depression as much as he needs but none of that works for him. I don't know how to help and I don't know if I even want to help at this point, it's such an inconvenience to my life. I'm glad he's online or his over protecting friends would probably raid my house by now. ",21May2018,1
81,"So I’m a 26 year old single mother. I’ve been a nurse for almost 8 years now- I started off right out of high school with my nursing license. I’m in recovery from drug addiction now, and with my physical pain from multiple herniated discs and fibromyalgia, along with depression and PTSD, I’m afraid I’m just burnt out from nursing. I love it and would like to continue to do it but more as a side job.

So I’ve been thinking of what I can do instead. I love to write but I am very aware that it is more of a hobby than a money-making thing. I would love to publish a novel but that’s more of a side project type deal.

I’ve been thinking lately about how much I love finding cool items at yard sales or thrift stores and then selling them on Facebook marketplace or Craigslist. Seriously, selling things online is like a passion for me. An even bigger passion I have is thrifting, and going to antique stores or yard sales. I’ve honestly even gone dumpster diving at stores and seen cool things like furniture that I refinish and random things sat out by dumpsters. I just love the “hunt” of finding these treasures and then I love feeling accomplished when I can sell those things and make a profit off of something I love doing.

I also make my own lotions, soaps, and other products with essential oils as well as making jewelry. I figure if I open up a consignment store I would have much more of an opportunity to make sales and therefore make profit. I’m confident that I could keep a good store running once I get it set up. I have so many marketing ideas and ideas to run a store.

However, I’m so lost right now! I have a decent amount of items right now, and I could easily build an inventory to open up a store. However, I have a shady credit history so I know it’s going to be hard to get a loan to start a business. Also, I live in Newark, Delaware and I have no idea how to go about legally opening up my own store. What should I do to start this process, how much money should I expect to need to do this, and what else do I have to consider when I’m trying to open up my own shop? I don’t even know where to start I just know I have a dream that I want to start working on accomplishing!

Please- any helpful advice, tips, or even words of wisdom from anyone who’s started their own business/ opened up a store. I also plan on having a website for my store and offering online shopping for people who live far away. Should I start off with that!? I have so many questions!

Thank y’all so much. :)

88,"I've never lived by myself. I've been lucky enough to have lived with roommates who are also close friends.

I've never had a bad roommate situation, although there have been certain things that start to bug me after living with them for a while, such as what gets left over in the fridge and the kitchen sink. It will get washed, but sometimes the roommates will leave it there instead of rinsing it and putting it in the dishwasher right away, preventing me from being able to cook.

Also it would be nice to have a fridge to myself that I can organize to my taste. 

But above all, I've also noticed that I have a tendency to gravitate towards my roommates' lifestyle. I'll get sucked into hanging out with them if they are drinking beers or they invited another one of our friends over. I have also picked up a very nasty cigarette addiction because I have roomed with cigarette smokers for the past 5 years. I know this can easily be dropped if I were living by myself.

I'm not blaming my roommates for the decisions that were completely in my control. But I will say that they do make it more difficult to stay disciplined.

I've realized that what I have to gain out of living by myself is that I can relax after I get off work and structure my time the way I want it so that I'm productive and I'm meeting my goals. I can allocate my time better and more efficiently this way, so that I CAN have MORE fun throughout the week.

I feel like I'm being held back having lived with roommates for so long, I was adjusting to their schedule and getting caught up in the group rather than focusing on myself. The living room was very easy to get sucked into chilling since that's where everyone hung out. 

The problem is that rooming with people makes it so much cheaper. You will be paying around $1200-$1400/mo for a decent 1 BR apartment, but if I get a house with 2 roommates or even an apartment with 1 roommate, that number could drop to $600-800/mo.

I also have a dog, it's nice having roommates because they provide company for the dog. Also the added benefit of roommates taking the dog out when you're gone. 

But there is also that feeling of loneliness when living by yourself.

I don't know if I should get my own place or not.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

89,"I feel like I just killed someone. It’s a long story but stay with me.

Like anyone else, I often reminisce about the past. Maybe too often. I have this thing where I can remember anything anyone has ever said to me. I’ve had this ever since I can remember and because of this I feel like I’ve never paid attention to anyone or appreciated anything. I really didn’t have to. I didn’t understand the fear of loss because I had everything in my memory. But once I realized that even though I felt like I had time in the palm of my hand, I was a slave to it. I remembered every small things that went wrong but I couldn’t go back in time and fix it which made it all the more painful to me.

Have you ever felt like you should’ve or could’ve done something and after years, just to realize that the chances you’ve missed out on? Have you ever tried to end yourself just because you remember that one time you could’ve done something but didn’t and let your life grow miserable forever after? I blame myself and point fingers at the mirror everyday. I can never forgive myself for what I’ve done to me. Ever. 

So sometimes I blame others and despise them for not acting on the wrong or not being there when needed. I looked for you just you just wanna play hide and sEEK. WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHEN I NEEDED YOU? WHERE WERE YOU WHEN I CALLED YOUR NAME? YOU LEFT ME TO SUFFOCATE AND SHAPED ME WITH PAAAAIN. WHY 왜 WHY WHYWYWYWY? why ? hide and seek to me was the hardest thing to me.

bbut there are pleasant moments too. old homes, familiar faces, words from the past and roads from the west. It’s jsut too sad that they fly away like a flock of summer birds. Are you here to stay or for the fake play? Or you just come and go regardless of my state in the emotional place. damn you time ! but for me for once Don’t move. can you just stay where you are ? can we can be like this forever forever. eternity. What we could be.  just….. . just stay like that. Stay like that.

90,"In 2017 I made one of the biggest mistakes of my entire life. I am a gay male. I was at a party that was being hosted by my cousin. There was a boy there that I had thought was cute. I had hung out with him once before in the past and he had said he was straight but I thought he was gay or maybe bisexual. He was very nice and friendly. He was offering me cigarettes and had been telling me to drink all night. He was a few years older then me. Him and I went outside and smoked on the porch. He told that he wasn't sure if he could ever do anything with a guy. Later that night I followed  him into the extra bedroom because I had wanted another cigarette. I walked into the room a few minutes after him. He was laying on the mattress and I asked him if I could have a cigarette. He was pointing at his pockets and mumbling so I reached into his pockets to grab the cigarettes. When I reached into this pocket I kind of pulled his pants and boxers up a little bit and noticed that he had a boner. I started kissing him on the neck. He was still moving his arm around and mumbling. I laid in his arms for a few seconds and then I started giving him head. As I was giving him head he goes "" whose there"" and like turns on the lights. I got up because I was confused about what had just happened. I slept on the couch and he went into my cousins room and slept with them. He had them lock the door and said he wouldn't beat me up because of my mental issues. I have been trying to forgive myself for a year for what I have done to him but I can't. I never meant to hurt him. I thought that his boner meant that I had consent to kiss him. I sadly know now that wasn't the case. I feel like such a bad person and I don't know how to forgive myself.  I need to move on but I don't know how. I don't want to apologize to him because I don't want to traumatize him again. How do I move on? How do I let go of this? ",21May2018,1

96,"Where to begin? Well I’m 15, and I have friends that vape. I’ve vaped a few times and I’ve done quite a few times. However, I don’t own a vape and nor have I ever felt an urge to vape.  By urge I mean an addiction. I’ve never felt a rush of a need to do it. I’ve been able to go months on end without having to do it. 

To skip past a whole series of events I’ll just cut to the juicy part of the story. My friend forgot his vape at a park and texted me to get it for him. So I grabbed it and went home for my mom to catch me. Now before I go into detail about what my mom’s reaction was to this, let's just talk about what she thinks vaping is. (She thinks its a little thing that once used once you are immediately hooked. I think that in some degree she is correct but shouldn't be given too much credit.). So she freaked out and I tried my very best to explain to her how it wasn’t mines and how it was my friends. Of course she didn’t believe me and immediately called my friend in which he did confirm that it was his, as well did I show her the text of him asking me to grab it. At this point my mom believed me but didn’t fully believe me. She then gets mad at me and asks if I ever have vaped before, in which I replied “yes.”. Now I replied yes because I know my mom and I know that it's better sometimes to be honest than lie (that’s how it should always be). She asked how much and I explained that I’ve done it I’ve experienced it. She then told my father and now they're both pissed at me. I’m bothered because I’ve read other stories online of kids being caught by their parents and the parents of course gave the child punishments but didn’t fully go all out on them because they too have done stupid things as a kid as well and can kind of sympathize. But, not for me. My mom and dad are pissed even though 1) not my vape 2) I’ve only done it a handful of times.

 So my point  is that I know what I did is bad and I’m not addicted and I’ve also learned the consequences of doing it.  

But, I’m truly sad and afraid. I’ve always had a very close relationship with my mom and my dad and I would hate for them to look at me differently. And I feel like they already are. My mom acts like I’m an addict, which is really hurtful to me. I just want it to breeze pass, but it doesn’t feel like it's happening. Its driving me to a point and I’m ready to just leave for a day or two if it’ll make them want me back.
TLDR My mom caught me carrying my friends vape for him, in which she flipped. Now I’m having conseqeunces as if it seems like I’m the one who owns the vape and uses it all the time. I hate the feeling of my parents now thinking I’m a vape addict and I want them to just drop it. How do I tell them this/ what should I do about the entire thing?

98,"I've always had an issue with alcohol, and I knew it was because of stuff I repressed and suppressed from my childhood. My father and his brother (my uncle) molested me, and it has been something I've always tried to forget. I've pushed people away and sabotaged relationships bc I always felt there was this part of me I had to hide. I felt ashamed and used alcohol as early as 13 to try to numb that part of me. 

Last week, my mom visited, and we went out for drinks. I wanted my bf to meet up with us, but we had had an argument a day before her arrival, so I knew he wouldn't want to see me for a while. I got in a huge argument with my mom bc she laughed when I told her one of my dream jobs that I had seriously thought about pursuing. Somehow I blurted out that I was molested, and it was her fault bc she left me alone with them. I feel awful for saying that to her. I don't blame her for it. The whole night was a nightmare, and I won't get into all the details, but it was all my fault. I ended up calling my bf and screaming at him on the phone about not meeting me to see my mom while she was in town, and I ended up telling him about my big secret. I feel like a fucking idiot. He said the next time I went drank and lost control like that, he'd break up with me. The day or so after it happened, he basically said ""a lot is done"" meaning, I'm guessing, the relationship is over. We were supposed to meet a few days ago to ""talk"", but I'm pretty sure that means he wanted to come over and re-explain why we shouldn't be together. Idk, but I'm not going to try to fight it anymore. I wish I had told him under different circumstances bc I think it would've solved a lot of issues in our relationship - being able to feel completely open and honest with him, not feeling like I was always hiding something shameful.

I feel free. A secret I've held onto for about 2 decades is finally out. Part of me feels exposed, but mostly I feel like I'm not a prisoner in my head anymore. I told my closest girl friend about it, and she told me that her mom went through the same thing, and she described having those same feelings of shame. It sucks that she lives several states away from me though bc I could really use her support right now besides just facetime and messaging. I could really use a hug. Not bc I'm sad or scared or anything bad. I don't know how to describe it yet.",21May2018,5
99,"I'm not going to use caps lock for this because I'm being serious for the first time I've ever used this site.

First off, I have chronic anxiety and depression, ptsd and minor insomnia. I have been struggling with these aspects of my life since I was 10.
When I was in 2nd grade I had gotten into an altercation with one certain person, lets call them Dumbass. Dumbass had been getting me in trouble and had been bullying me alot recently during that time and I had enough of it, he attacked me and I threw him into a desk and that was that, he was suspended and a week later my parents decided to put me into special ed because of my ""behavioral issues"" this special ed class had a room the size of a closet that the special ed teachers would use to place us in, they would put us in holds and throw us into the room for a few minutes, it wasn't okay but it was nothing compared to when a new teacher took over for one of the older and more compassionate teachers. Meanwhile during this time I had spent 2 years in special ed hanging out with special ed kids who for me were out of the ordinary, being a special ed kid became the norm for me and I eventually started to act similar to them. Now the new teacher this woman, lets call her Evil Bitch. Evil Bitch took over the special ed branch of the school and totally revamped it, she decided that snacks were no longer allowed, no ipads or computer time during breaks and Evil Bitch also decided to do new holds that were more painful for us kids and she also made the safe room smaller. Instead of like before where we could only locked in the room for mere minutes Evil Bitch decided that the safe room time limit be extended by hours, so usually you would spend hours in this small room until Evil Bitch decided you were calm enough to join the rest of the kids. Evil Bitch turned my friends against me, she hated me and it turns out later on that Evil Bitch was a white supremacist.

Anyways she abused me in so many ways, she hurt me, she locked me in the safe room for hours almost everyday for nothing, she fucking abused me in every way possible that wouldn't leave a physical mark besides the time she slammed 4 of my fingers in a door that sliced my pinky to my pointer open. 

One day I donkey kick Evil Bitch right in the kneecap and hyper extend her leg, cops get called and charges get filed, I was lucky because charges got dropped and Evil Bitch couldn't work in our school region ever again. But the mental shit that had done to me as a kid really fucked me up.

That is what scars me and what I remember most fluently, but I was also bullied severely throughout middle and highschool, I had 2 ""friends"" who I hung out with rarely but It brought me comfort thinking of them as friends.

From my 10th birthday all the way to my fucking 16th birthday no one came to my birthdays besides my family and myself.
I was lonely and I didn't understand my feelings.

Now I'm still fucked up. I get random panic attacks like I had a lot when I was a kid and I get ptsd fucking flashbacks about shit that shouldn't even be that traumatizing but it still fucks me up. I've had ptsd flashbacks about random shit and it's different everytime AND I FUCKING HATE IT.

Seriously I don't want attention I'm not even making this shit up. I'm fucked up. Fucked up.

I'm growing farther and farther away from my family, I argue with my parents whenever I get the chance to talk to them and they end up hating me afterwards and I don't know what to do.

Don't fucking recommend a fucking councellor because those fuckers have fucked with me and abused me too.

Again, I understand that he's busy. He has made time for a friend \(long\-time friend\)/friend group twice now, even though he's ""too busy"" until mid\-June. I don't know if I should be taking it as a hint that I'm not really important, or just be patient? Keep messaging every so often, or is that being annoying? I don't hear from him really unless I message him first. Not sure if that's part of the busy, part of the no relationship experience, or just trying to politely blow me off. 

I don't want to be annoying, but I really like this guy. His reaction to the care packages was always ""thanks!"" etc, not ""you really shouldn't"". It's not like I have a ton of relationship experience myself, so I'm not sure what to think.

104,"Just got a job after school in a startup. The work is a lot (12 hours everyday) and I feel like I don't know anything at all. It's only been a couple of weeks and I am trying hard to pick up new skills. If it was just that,  I think I would make it through. But it doesn't help that I am the only woman at my workplace and I feel very lonely at work, I try talking but they mostly just look at me patronizingly. So the problem is two-fold. Not knowing what to do and failing miserably at it every single day,  and feeling completely left out at the office and having no human connections anymore.   
Intrinsically, this job is a gateway to a fulfilling career and I dont want to give up before finishing atleast an year. Quitting is just not an option.  But I also feel like a mess. What to do to make the experience better? ",21May2018,1
105,"Again.
Little back story. It started when I was in Jr high(2009ish). I would come home to my mom and step dad fighting all the time. Some days worse than others. Most of the time my mom would just leave for a couple hours then be fine when she got home. Other days she would lock herself in the bathroom and try to take a bunch of pills. She was in and out of the hospital many occasions. Being a teenager I didn't know what to do. She finally went to get help and was diagnosed with bipolar and depression. She started going to a therapist and got on normal medications. She was doing good for a few years with only a few issues. (none to serious)
Today I get a call from my brother that my step dad had to call the cops because my mom had tried to end her life with pills again. When he tried to stop her she got very upset and told him to get a gun and kill her and himself. Once the cops came she agreed to go to the hospital and get the help she needs.

Everytime she goes through these ""episodes"" she tells us that we (my 2 brothers, my step dad and I) don't love her, and that we only take advantage of her. No matter how much we call her, talk to her, visit her and go out to do fun things with her, she always feels like we hate her. It's been rough not knowing what to say or do anymore. Growing up with a mom like this is so tough. Everyone I talk to doesnt truly understand. I try to talk to my husband and he helps calm me but again he doesn't get it.

I feel so damn bad that I don't understand how or why my mom is feeling like we are better off without her. It hurts. I just dont know.",21May2018,1
106,"So I live in an shared house in the bottom suite. My neighbors in the upstairs suite are constantly making noise. The three kids that live up stairs have no understanding of how loud they are. They are constantly stomping (to the extent that my door shakes in it's frame), throwing temper tantrums, leaving bikes, scooters, etc in front of our door. At one point they tore the bug net of one of my windows. Their mother does nothing to stop them from misbehaving. Even the oldest, 15 years old, is incredibly prone to temper tantrums. She often just lets her kids scream and fight each other with no intervention. I have asked them to be quieter several times with no luck.

112,"Over a week ago I received a fairly expensive computer monitor used for graphic design work. Upon inspecting the panel I noticed at least a couple faint horizontal lines going across the screen when I was viewing an all black screen. I called up viewsonic(the manufacturer), to see what the issue may be, and the man I spoke with concluded it was an issue with the panel.

I reached out to the store I purchased it from and explained the issue and the guy said he would process a return label and that I should see it within 24 hours. Time passed and I did not see the return label, so I called the store back up. I spoke to the same guy and he said he was glad I called because he got an email from higher ups that wanted to know the reason for the return. I reiterated that it was defective and he said he sent out the email. 

I waited over the weekend and did not hear back early next week. I called the store again and spoke to the same guy and he said he would call the upper management and get back to me. I did not hear back for a few days, so I called back and spoke to the same guy, and he said that he would like for me to take photo's of the defect and send it to his personal email; and that they can decide if it is indeed defective.

In frustration I told him I don't feel like I should have to do this, and I already have the monitor all packaged back up. What should I do in this situation?

What I'm worried about is if I do send the photo's, that they would not agree that the panel is defective, and avoid allowing me to return to monitor. 

I originally asked for a replacement and they said they couldn't do that, rather Id have to return to monitor and place another order. I already ended up getting a different monitor.

What is the law regarding someone having to provide photo's to return a defective product to a store?

113,"I wake up, go to school, go to work, play video games, and then sleep. Rinse and repeat. 
I can't imagine what people do besides that.

I hear about people going to beaches, clubs, movies, concerts, parks, etc. But none of that makes sense to me.

Beaches are littered with trash and animal feces. The ocean around it is probably severely polluted. I'm a bit too unattractive for talking to others with out a shirt on to not come off as creepy. I'm 5'8 and 19 years old. I have a beard which is near impossible to trim because it just grows back. I'm fat.

Clubs are annoying to me. I went into one once. People were standing around and talking with their friends or dancing. I'm not a fan of alcohol. Drinking it makes me feel retarded and sick. The concept of dancing is also retarded. Moving your body in response to audial stimuli in a semi-rhythmic fashion sounds like something a mental patient would do. It looks like that too in most cases. 

The idea of going to a theater is pretty trivial to me.
Pirating the movie a week or two later and watching it without the distraction of other people and with better audio quality provided by good headphones is a much better viewing experience. My couch is very comfortable.

Concerts are very much the same way for me. I'd rather listen to it without the distraction of a crowd. Much easier to do with headphones.

At a park you show up and you look at plants or something right? I understand a picnic or something with friends, but there's nothing to do really. It's not like I can play on the playground like I did when I was 5.

Nothing in the outside world intrigues me. Alot of the things that might catch my attention cost way too much money and time for me to consider it. I can't afford health insurance but I make too much for benefits.

I'm days away from graduating HS. I'd especially like a girlfriend. Someone to talk to and play video games with. Or watch a movie. Maybe go to the gym? Sex sounds fun although I don't have much of a drive.

I'm in an awkward position where I start college in the fall, but I'm already living on my own, and have been for a while. I kinda had to become an adult really quickly midway through high school and provide for myself. I've been successful but other people on their own are much older than me. Other high schoolers don't understand how or why I'm on my own, or how that effects my social life.

I'm certain I don't have an anxiety problem, it's just things don't really interest me. I'm not socially connected and I've never really had time to be up until now. Approaching my desire for social interaction or a girlfriend is really alien to me. I don't have much experience with it personally. Nobody has ever approached me and I've never approached anybody.

I listen to conversations at lunch, between customers at work, or here and there inbetween. They all seem to be without real substance. ""He said, she said"" type conversations which only carry meaning within their own little bubble. Nothing beyond that usually. I'm not sure how I'd interject or talk to a majority of people who only seem to have those kinds of conversations.

I only initiate conversation if I want something. ""Do you have a spare pencil?"" ""What time is it?"" ""Can I get an Oreo McFlurry?""

Likewise people only initiate conversation with me if they want something in similar fashion.

I'd like to be social and I'd like to have friends but I really don't know how.

TL;DR - I am having trouble understanding the setting of social interactions and how to initiate social interaction because it's largely illogical or alien to me.",21May2018,13

122,"I am a 19 year old girl whose only friends are 4 guys and my boyfriend, all 21. We get together often to play DnD and Pokemon Go and watch bad tv shows and stuff like that. 4 of the guys including my BF have been friends since elementary school, I kind of dropped into the friend group in the middle of high school and the last guy just came in a few months ago.
My problem is that I'm interrupted when I'm talking _fucking constantly_. Even my boyfriend does sometimes. They really don't do it to each other that much. For most of them I'm able to just say hey, I was fucking talking dickhead. One of them kept interrupting me during DnD so I had my character beat the shit out of his character. He doesn't interrupt me anymore.

My problem is with one of the guys who's been in the group since elementary school. It gets so bad that I will just be talking and everyone's listening and in the middle of the sentence he just starts talking. So not like it's kind of chaotic anyway and he interrupts me, like straight up I'm talking and he just decides to start talking. He doesn't do this to anyone else and it drives me up the fucking wall.

I've already asked my boyfriend to maybe say something when I'm interrupted because they don't listen to me but everyone listens when my boyfriend talks. But I also think I'm just going to message this guy on Discord and talk to him about how he interrupts me constantly. I don't want to be accusatory or anything. Part of me is just afraid of being _that uptight bitch_ even though I'm really not. But also we've been friends for 4 years and never really talked because he's really closed off. We have a really awkward friendship for some reason and I don't want to make things contentious.

So I'm looking for advice on how I can word this message to him and perhaps other advice on how not to get interrupted in general. It's a pretty big issue in my life as you can see.",21May2018,3
123,"I've written about this several times hopefully this will be my last.

To make an extremely long story short, I have an extreme crush on a girl at my church, she's 17 I'm 16 nearly 17. I've had a thing for her ever since we met back in July of 2017. In April I felt it was time to tell her. I asked a mutual friend what to do and she said I should do it. I decided on giving my crush a letter, sort of like a secret admirer note without the secret. I was set on it, I waited and waited, for the right time. A few days ago, a friend of mine found out about my situation who isn't one to keep secrets.

So me, him, and the girl's brother who I'm also good friends with were in a video chat and my friend sort of exposed me to her brother. Her brother sorta laughed it off but told me to keep dreaming, which upset me a lot. The letter is out, I planned on texting her one night just to ask her on a date, well my friend thinks that's a dumb idea. He thinks I should talk to her more, but I've had more than enough time to do that and I think it's time to make a move. Another problem is, the friend is sort of hard to read sometimes, and apparently he likes the girl now as well, so I'm afraid of him telling her things or just outright lying to her about something I didn't say.

He recently told me things that the girl has said about me which  I don't know are true or not like he said that she thinks of me as her brother and that she doesn't like me. I don't know what to do anymore, should I give it any more time? Or should I make a move and ask her out on a date.

128,"I have a dilemma right now. Bear with me, this will be a bit of a story. 

This past week, I was given an excellent job offer in the field I’m going into. I graduated from college just two weeks ago, and I admit that I was thrilled with the offer. There are many pros about taking this position for the time being since it’s a pathway into what I want to go in. 

However… the position is located in a city/valley where I grew up and experienced significant trauma. This includes the first 13 years of my life being abused by my own mother, several instances of rape throughout my teenage years, and some other painful memories/failed relationships that catapulted my mental state into a state of living Hell. 

Currently, I live an hour and a half north of this area. Where I live now is where I just finished college. Before I moved here to my current home (it’s been three years), I was struggling with depression and serious symptoms of PTSD (have been privately diagnosed in the past). I was a complete hermit and did not want to stay in my hometown any longer than possible and swore that once I moved away, it was permanent and that I’d never go back. When I made the change in locations, my own family saw the change in me as well and literally considered me a different, better person overall. 

The dilemma I’m facing is this. If I take this position, there will be many pros to it. Also, the area isn’t the worse to live in as well. Living expenses are relatively affordable with the right salary and there is an incredible amount of recreation and social events that I can take part of, and the beauty of this place is incomparable with many other places in the world. And, I only intend to take this position for 1-2 years at the worst. During this time, I could eliminate a significant portion of my student loans, which is another major goal as well.

But… the cons are equally comparable. When I first interviewed for this position, I literally only went in for the experience of interviewing. And it was a great interview! But when I got back home the same day of the interview, I was literally praying that they wouldn’t offer me work because I knew I’d want to take it despite my absolute hatred for the location. The following day they called me back with an offer. I requested some time to think it over, hung up, and cried. I knew the dilemma I was facing right then and knew I needed to think it over a good bit, since these decisions should never be taken lightly.

Also…looking over a valley and being reminded of the past… the effects of an abusive mother that my entire family is still reeling from… the times I was raped and faced the worst moments in my life – ones where I truly wanted to end it all… the dark depression I was staggering through before moving away to where I am now… and always having that fear of running into someone who is tied with any of those parts of my past… I don’t know how I’d be able to handle it all, every single day. I just want to move on.

I have to consider my mental health. My mental health, stability, and ability to move on with my life and be happy. I don’t know if I could achieve that goal while starting my career in a place that reminds me of so much that I’ve worked very hard at trying to get away from for the past few years. 

Now before you ask, I’ve talked with family and friends. A lot of people are encouraging me to take this job, but they also don’t have the understanding of how significant these triggers are. It’s sad how many people still don’t understand the long-term effects of childhood abuse and rape and how it literally is something that can’t be shaken off at the throw of a hat. I’ve had therapy in the past… successful, yes… but still didn’t eliminate the memories that haunted me every single day while living in this place. And, I even talked with a local crisis line for sexual assault just before I started typing this out – we both agreed this was a heavy decision. 

Right now… I don’t know what to do. I’m confused. A bit lost. I want to work in the worst way, but then again… my mental health is more important than anything else. A part of me feels that if I were to take this job, a part of me would regress into bitterness and anger and that it could become a permanent part of my personality. 

What do I do? I need help.  ",21May2018,1

The house if absolutely filthy and there’s construction currently being done on the kitchen making it impossible for us to cook. My roommates although friends hog common areas and the place is often in such a mess there is a stench and i haven’t had company in almost a year. 

The reason i moved here initially was to get away from my strict/obsessive mother and narcissistic father. They are South American devout catholics and my age doesn’t really mean much to them. In their home im forbidden to spend the night out, friends aren’t allowed to come to my room, and my parents are often in my room rearranging my things without my notice. I am a frequent marijuana user (scaled down to as needed to save money) for my anxiety and insomnia and they are extremely intolerant of my anxiety/depression and marijuana use by anyone in general. For the most part they don’t know i smoke but a few years ago i was caught by them where they made a huge scene complete with tears and screaming. If i were to move back id be questioned about weed upon entering the home.

 I have voiced my opinion about respecting my privacy and nothing has changed. They don’t see it my way. I bring in about $800 a month. With rent being 400 after food gas credit card bills and utilities I have less than $60-80 left per month. This makes it difficult for me to save or try to find a new place. Living in Atlanta, it’s difficult to find anything below 600 with roommates. My hours at work are fixed and being in school I cannot get a second job. 

Purchasing a condo has crossed my mind but probably won’t happen in the near future. My potential roommates have dropped out and the chances of me figuring something out in 10 days is slim and stressful. I have about $600 saved right now for a rainy day but im willing to part with that for a better situation. 

If anyone has any advice for my situation id appreciate it so much as lately anxiety won’t allow me to brainstorm this without going into a panic.

Uh, we aren't completely strangers but I can't really say we are friends only because we aren't close enough. Like we don't know anything about eachother, just our names. So I'd say aquintance is most appropriate.

She has initiated small talk with me before, and she have talked to eachother when we were alone outside walking to different classes before nothing flirty ( to me ) just small talk, she comes across as a nice kind person to me, I would think she'd talk with anyone but again I don't KNOW her well. 

 Two weeks ago, we all had to present an assignment to the class, so after class was over and everybody was getting ready to leave and I came up to her and gave a her high five ( I usually do that with her when saying bye ) and said "" Hey good job with you're assignment "". Her response was "" Thank you good job on you'res to, I was like you actually took the time to the extra stuff! "". Her body language was like this, she was near a counter and she rested her elbow on the counter and had her head resting on her hand, and then, you know how when some kids in school are laughing at the teacher, but they lay there heads down and have there arms folded to hide there face so the teachers wouldn't noticed? That's what she did briefly but she wasn't laughing ( I don't think ) she was smiling though, but not sure if it was signs of friendly behavior or interest. I always assume friendly because I can't tell.

I then asked her about her standing on a desk and having it collapse apart in the hallway when she was trying to hang something on the wall. She laughed told me. Again I can't read girls well, but she definitely seemed into the convo and kept it going, now it wasn't a long talk at all because I got distracted, a friend came by and asked me if I seen his wallet.


Last Friday, I went to that class, I have not gone to the college during that week so Friday was my day back. Once the class was almost  over and everyone finished there work, I went up to the professor to ask about assignments I missed and he told me he'd be with me in a second. So I waited and the girl ( that I'm speaking of ) sits near his area so I'm near her because I'm waiting on the teacher. I see her packing her stuff for the next class. I was tired and out of it so I was zoning out alot. Then class was over.

I was starring at the floor panels on the ground next to her and all of a sudden she turns her whole head around and looks at me (  she was slightly turnt away )  and then I look at her, I was about to just politely smile and wave just to break the awkward feeling I was getting, but she quickly looked away and turned back around packing her bags. It was like two seconds. After she finished she turned her head to me and said "" Hey I'm about to head out "" I was starring at the wall when she said that because I zoned out again, but I just said "" alright then "" and held out my hand to high five ( as usual ) and she high fived back and walked out and said bye to the teacher and not anyone else eventhough there was still people in the room. 

I hope she didn't turn around because she thought I was starring at her from the corner of her eye, like I hope she didn't think I was creeping. When she had looked at me, she didn't smile but didn't look bothered or put off either just had a normal facial expression. I'd say we looked at eachother at the sametime and she just quickly looked away and turned around before I could try to break the awkwardness. I was resting against the wall so she wasn't looking behind me. I kinda thought she was going to ask me something at first. I've never caught her starring or glancing at me before so I don't know.

I don't know if this is a bad thing or not. I hope I didn't screw up :(. ",21May2018,2
137,"Hey, so here is a brief synopsis. My friend and I have had a tough go at college. She has been working her ass off since she was 15, multiple jobs through high school and then working 40-60 hour weeks managing while also getting two majors in college. She had briefly dated one guy but overall she has pretty much been alone. 

Back during a holidays her work hired a new guy and he asked her out. They had sex pretty quick (he was her first) and he told her he loved her within like two weeks of dating. Now, I'm not judging this bit, my boyfriend acted a bit like this when we first started dating so I get it. 
What I am worried about is that her boyfriend (now fiance) is undocumented, he overstayed his visa and the only way he will be allowed to get another visa is through marriage. I want to believe he has the best intentions but it's hard when he proposed to her after less than six months of dating. She told me it will be a long engagement but what is stopping them from just running off to a court house. 
I don't know, I just can't imagine bringing my concerns up to her because she is my only friend and there is no gentle way to say ""I think he is using you"". 

TLDR: my best friends first relationship has resulted in a quick engagement but the guy is undocumented and could be using her to stay in the US. ",21May2018,1
138,"Hey there reddit peeps, 

So yea as the title says, I like many others went on tinder not expecting much just wanted to see what was out there and talk to different people. I saw this profile pic of a pretty Latina sort of middle eastern looking girl and just like any guy out there I swiped right, not expecting a swipe back and not realizing until later she lived a million miles away (5,587 to be exact). I go back on the app the next day found out she swiped right. I go through the account and realize that this can be some type of catfish or scam because of the distance(I’m located in NY). I left it alone couldn’t think of any Lebanese puns at that moment but surely enough she messaged me first(first girl to ever do this to me on the app). So whatever I went along with it, we hit it off really well seems like we got the same personality, likings and what not. I find out later through snapchat and WhatsApp she’s actually real ! We’ve been talking for a while and since the beginning we’ve been half joking half serious about meeting each other. I’ve looked up prices and stuff It most likely come out to under 2,000$ for the trip there including food and other expenses but I’m wondering a lot of things such as:

-I’m new to snapchat so how weird or common is something like this to occur ? 

-Hows Lebanon as a country right now ? Don’t know much about it.

-I don’t think I’m being catfished because of snapchats videos we’ve sent to each other and talking over the phone but maybe I could be wrong ? 

-Would anyone want to come to Lebanon with me to be shown around by this beautiful girl and some of her college friends? Don’t really want to go alone. 

-What are some important thing I should ask or find out before I become to committed in this ? 

So yea I doubt I’d be able to go this summer I don’t have the money at the moment sadly but I’m preparing hopefully for next summer if possible. I really hope everything is real this would be some experience that’d I’d love to record and share with everyone on here if it were to happen. Thanks in advance for any advice you guys can offer i greatly  appreciate it. If I find out anything important I’ll definitely let you know. My heart hasn’t stop pounding for this girl but I’m trying to think more with my head.

This weekend my friend told me I was the best applicant and that monday morning Id be getting a call to say I got the job and negotiate pay.

144,"So almost 3 months ago, I (22y/o, F) went to a weekend long music festival. On the second day, I met the most incredible guy (24y/o, M). We hit it off immediately, and I felt as if I had been friends with him for years. We spent the entire rest of the festival together, slept together (in both senses of the phrase) in the same tent, I met his group of friends that he came to the festival with and they all seemed super happy to see us happy together. We even talked about visiting each other (we live in different states, but not too far), talked about going to Burning Man together (it is both of our dreams to go one day), talked about our families and lives back home, realized how much we had in common and how similar our lives and goals are, and he could not stop saying how much he wished we had met on the first day of the festival and been able to spend more time together (and I would have to agree). I’ve been to plenty of festivals and have been with plenty of guys (long and short term), but I have never once wanted to use the word soulmate until now. I realize I am still fairly young, that it was only for one weekend, and that I probably sound crazy. But my gut tells me that this guy is something special, maybe even once in a lifetime. And that I might be letting something good slip away too easily. 

Well, we departed the festival, assuring each other that this was not the last time we would see each other. We texted for a couple days. Then, after a day of silence, he texted me (one of the longest, most heartfelt texts) to tell me that he had a girlfriend, that they had broken up before the festival but that he got home and realized that it was wrong of him to throw away his relationship so easily, even though they haven’t been good for a while, etc. Of course I was heartbroken, but what could I do? I have to respect him for his commitment to his relationship. 

So after about a week of crying, I decided I needed to try to accept the situation. But the more I thought about it over the last couple months, the more I feel like I have to do something. The last thing I want to be is a “home wrecker” and get in the middle of his relationship, but it makes me so sad to think that he is in a relationship where he is unhappy. Am I wrong to reach out to him? I realize most people will probably say he is just a player and was leading me on or rebounding, but I really have a good feeling about him and think that that wasn’t his intention.

The title pretty much says it all.  People who meet me generally don't care to get to know me, and when they do, they don't like me.

I have no delusions about why.  I'm boring, self-centered, extremely needy, insecure and I sometimes act arrogantly.  I also have difficulty with social cues.  It's been suggested that I may have borderline personality disorder or Asperger's or something.

For big periods of my life, I've worked around this problem by keeping to myself, but honestly I'm a little lonely.

What's a good way to get low-pressure human contact with people who are willing to put up with how off-putting I am?

148,"I often feel out of place when out in public. When I'm talking to someone I feel as if I can't ever think of things worth talking about (or something that can keep a convo going longer than a few mins). Even with my own brothers and sisters I find it difficult to be social even though my family is very close. I'm used to being at home and just living a relaxing boring life playing video games, doing school-work, and watching movies. I'm a sophomore at a small college now. I'm majoring in software engineering and I'm really into computers and programming. I'm 19 and I don't think I've ever had a real friend where I've hung out with them in public or even at someone else's house. I've had ""friends"" but only the type where the only time we talk is in school, never anywhere else. I did go through a depression phase back in high school, but overall I'm pretty content with myself now. I never feel the urge to go out and do something new. For example, my brothers invited me to a club, but I didn't go because it just didn't seem at all appealing and plus I can't dance. I'm not very awkward I'm just a very chill person that doesn't talk much, or rather, doesn't mind it being quiet. 

I've tried going out and doing stuff in the past repeatedly but I never find new friends. As someone who's lived 19 years of life being introverted, I want a friend.

150,"**TL;DR:** Struggling to learn, retain information, find motivation, and really just do anything with my life. I'm smart but I can't seem to get out of this slump. While depression could be a part of it \(I don't feel depressed\), I'm having severe issues with my mind and mental latency. I use to be so bright and resourceful, and now I can hardly read a complex article without exhausting my mind and it completely shutting down. Because I can't learn, I can't apply what I've learned, and I'm making no progress in life. I'm pushing 30 now and have no technical skills, a horrible resume, and I'm failing miserably at my goal of starting a business and improving myself personally. *I can't even figure out how to start figuring things out*. I feel like I don't fit in, and due to my unique psychology, it would be incredibly easy for me to end up 60 years old, working at Walmart, and hording objects in my rented apartment. I don't fit in with the traditional American work ethic, and ultimately I see myself doing anything but sitting in some companies office 9\-5 \(even if it is more demanding, or involves sitting in my own office\). I am looking for any advice whether it be nootropics, books, videos, or otherwise. I don't care if it's business related, motivation related, or learning related**. /TL;**DR

I've always been fairly smart. I was a gifted child with my IQ testing at the \~99.7th percentile. I never excelled academically as a child due to ADHD and social anxiety, but the second I entered college I received straight A's, top honors, two degrees, etc.

Initially college wasn't the plan, but I was pressured into it. Before going to college I began teaching myself Affiliate Marketing and found some limited success with ranking up web pages and writing quality content. I never managed to make any real money from it \(1 year\), but the drive, focus, and ability to engage in and digest challenging lessons, and develop and apply new skills was ever\-present for me. I was 21 at the time \- deadset on doing something unique and independent with my life. Something outside of the status quo. So I sat there and I did it. I just... did it.

Unfortunately, when I went to college I was forced to give up Affiliate Marketing due to time constraints. My main degree is in business \(emphasis in entrepreneurship\)  which I primarily chose because ""I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do"". My lifelong goal has been to start my own online business/learn to pay myself, but to my surprise every single thing I learned at college was 'liberal arts' \- highly conceptual with no substance \- and now I have no appreciable skills. Instead of teaching me ""how to start a business"" \(in any single aspect\), the degree taught me that ""how to pursue venture capital"". Sure, I can get any entry\-level $15/hour job I want sitting in a cubicle \(think yelp, customer service, etc\), but frankly I don't fit in with typical, corporate, career driven individuals very well \(to the point where I've gotten fired because of it\); and it is impossible for me to reconcile any sort of life that involves my wasting away at the traditional 9 to 5, saving my money until I'm too old to enjoy it, and overall just spending my entire life working 'all day every day' at a company, as if somehow that constituted any sort of *""life""* at all.

My exact problem is: I'm experiencing a ***severe*** post\-college slump, mental weakness, and a lack of motivation. It's as though I spent all of my mental energy and money getting a useless degree, and now I'm too burned out to learn anything, get my life started, or start developing the type of lifestyle I want for myself. As though I wasted my prime getting a degree when I should have been developing a real skill or building a business. Furthermore, I think my capacity to succeed in school with relatively little effort has been crippling for my self\-discipline, and that curriculum\-based learning has gimped my self\-determination \(its so easy when you have a boss or teacher handing you assignments; telling you what to do \- the lifestyle they've been teaching us since preschool\). Graduating at 26 didn't do me any favors either; it's relatively late in life to learn ""you know nothing"", ""you can't do anything"", and ""you don't even know where to start"". However, due to my ADHD, moving between 3 different states in high school, and being behind in mathematics, it was a forgone conclusion.

I worked briefly for 2 startups after college \(was layed off after 2 weeks at one, and after 4 months at the other\). I then spent a year a blue\-collar job where I was fired for my personality. After that \(a year ago\), I moved across the country so I could lower my cost of living and start developing a business. I had been living in the Pacific Northwest, hated my job, hated the hours, hated the weather, hated the traffic, hated the social/political atmosphere, hated the culture, and of course hated the cost of living. This is important because I feel it was a huge turning point for me even if it did end up being kind of a non\-starter. I quit smoking weed, put my confidence into myself and my capabilities, and made a long overdue change that I think I desperately needed. By merely cutting my cost of living in half, I was certain I was setting myself up for success. However, within that year I haven't managed to follow through with even *beginning* to build a business or any technical skill. My most recent job was a highly demanding typing job that payed very little, and I feel like it may have conflicted with my pursuit to build an online business \(it is difficult to type 100wpm for 6 hours straight, then get right back on the computer and start learning\).  To make matters worse, I have very little job experience, no references, no real technical skills, and huge gaps in my resume. 

My concern is that it feels like my brain simply cannot figure anything out anymore. I have no mental latency or resilience.  I can't  figure out how to start building \[any type of business\], or do much of anything. I try to find online resources on business development, but it's all bullshit marketing hype and fake ""systems"" anyways, so I move on. I can't manage to read an entire book, and even if I could I can't figure out which one are worth reading. I can't even settle on some random marketable skill to teach myself \(so at least I'm learning **SOMETHING, ANYTHING**\), let alone focus on it or actually learn it. Overwhelmingly, the biggest concern is that I cannot seem to learn, apply what I learn, or make any progress towards being a more valuable human being who earns more than minimum wage. This has sort of snowballed into other issues: I can't manage to make friends because I didn't have a traditional job \(my most recent job was work\-from\-home position, and apparently adults only make friends at work\). I can't manage to find a suitable new job because of my lack of skills, poor resume, and frankly my disdain for American work ethic and work life makes this a self\-perpetuating issue. I can't get on Tinder and meet women because I can't make it to the gym, and I can't make it to the gym because I've got so many other priorities \(like making money\) that are higher up the hierarchy. 

Now I know a lot of these issues are symptomatic of depression and anxiety \(and perhaps that's part of the issue\), but it feels like I'm having a much more fundamental issue. Yes, I am overwhelmed with so many responsibilities that I'm neglecting *all of them* rather than jus*t picking one and doing it ""one step at a tim*e"", but I simply cannot make my mind to try, learn, think, engage, digest, or apply anything. On the off chance that I can convince it to try, my brain cannot seem to retain any information. On the off chance that It does retain information, I cannot figure out how to apply it. It feels like there is actual physical damage to my brain \(there has been some drug/alcohol abuse in my life, but nothing that's ever developed into a genuine problem\). I feel like I've lost a part of myself and I will never get it back.

The reason I provided context about 'being smart' is because that's what really drives this home for me. I use to be so sharp with so much potential. I use to have a child psychologist pay me to take tests because of my ""gifts"". I swallowed what America and my parents were selling me, I went to college, and I succeeded with flying colors. Fuck, I even use to be funny, but now 80&amp;#37; of my jokes fall flat. My mental latency has dissipated. *I can't even figure out how to start figuring things out*. On top of this I can't generate any motivation. I can't push myself to find a job \(even part\-time\). I can't push myself to learn. I can't push myself to get laid, to get get healthy; I can't push myself to do anything. I feel dumb. I feel mindless. I cannot focus, I cannot retain, I cannot engage, and I cannot apply. And even if I could, I can't find the motivati**on. I cannot push myself to TH**INK!

I am seeking any advice. Nootropics, books, videos, epiphanies. Anything. Whether it be on business, learning, or motivation. I've found some help from micro\-/dosing psychedelics, but even that is fleeting \(whereas in my early 20's one shroom dose would improve my psychology for 6 months\). Where does one even begin developing skills outside of 'working for a company for 10 years'? As someone who *HATES* programming, does anyone have any recommendations for other marketable skills I could teach myself online? Maybe some awesome certification I could get that would guarantee me an alternate path. Any ideas on part time jobs an unskilled college grad could get that fly under most peoples radar?I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for. Anything really

**P.S.:** I don't feel depressed. I understand that depression is still possible even when you don't ""feel it"", but I also have no healthcare insurance, so unless anyone knows of some websites I could use to self\-medicate, I can't afford a psychiatrist/psychologist/prescription. Also, I feel like a lot of my motivation issues stem from the fact that I cannot figure out a way to develop the type of life I want for myself, so perhaps that is the more pressing issue.

Thanks in advance for any advice. ",21May2018,2
151,"So, the tl;dr is basically I liked a friend of mine a while back but I got in another relationship at the time, but now we’re both single and just started talking again and I’m a stressed boi, help plz

But here’s the full story; so I’m an actor, working semi-professionally now but at the time this all started I was mainly doing college productions. I met this actress (for the sake of not using real names, let’s call her Carrie) during one of those shows, and it was clear we were both pretty awkward people (most actors are, fun fact!) so in-person conversation was pretty minimal to start.

At least, until we got put on stage for a scene where our direction was to stare at each other for the entirety of the scene in the background; not the most conventional way of breaking the ice between two people, but break the ice it did! We started talking quite a bit more after that, and we’d talk for hours over Facebook message about all kinds of stuff.

So I did what any reasonable college student would do; I asked her out to the movies, and she said yes! The day of, there ended up being an emergency so she couldn’t go, which I still believe is actually what happened, but I lacked the composure to ask again. I like to think it was due to pride, but honestly I was just scared I was pushing it.

However, before I even had the chance to build up the courage to ask her out again, another girl in the show (we’ll go with Karen) confessed she liked me almost immediately after breaking up with her previous boyfriend; I should’ve seen at the time that I was getting roped into a rebound relationship for her, but I was honestly so down about the Carrie thing I kinda just let it happen.

Karen and I dated for about three months before I broke up with her; it lasted through the first show, and most of the way through the show I was in after that, which Carrie also just so happened to be in.

After that, I did two more shows and hardly said a word to her until just about a week ago; I went and saw a show she was in and we talked for a solid five minutes after the show, catching up and whatnot (which just for a frame of reference, when actors come out for you to talk to/congratulate, you’re lucky to get 30 seconds to talk to any of them) and all that awkward, cutesy tension was there, like we picked up right where we left off on that.

So I guess the question isn’t a matter of a simple “does she like me or not”, because at this point the important thing for me is that my mind’s made up on whether I like her, which is a resounding yes. The advice I’m looking for is more how to go about it; do I try to do a dinner/take-her-to-a-musical kind of thing? Do I get her flowers if she says yes or is that too much? I just feel like I’m Jim and I’m trying to date Pam and it’s just so frustratingly difficult to get there.

I lost my money in the bus and my sister helped me and treated me and my friend to lunch. She was so happy and this was just Saturday. I ignored her text yesterday because I didn’t know what had happened. 

Anyone who had to console someone about a death please what do I do? My sister is very close to me (yet I didn’t respond to her message). Is there a right way to do it? How do I not feel guilty, or is it okay because I didn’t know the circumstance? 

Thank you.",21May2018,1
158,"I’m a high school student and I’ve built a reputation around my school for being a quiet, introverted kid. Personally, I feel like I’m not super shy and I do have a lot of friends but when it comes to talking to girls I do not have enough courage to talk to them in any way that involves romance. I’m decent at flirting over text but when it comes down to face to face conversations, I just can’t do it. The only times that a girl has ever talked to me in a romantic way is if she hit me up FIRST, and those relationships didn’t last long because of my struggle to communicate verbally. You may say that relationships aren’t important in high school which is probably true but I just need some way to be more confident or else this shyness towards girls may carry on later in life lol. Any tips or tricks to becoming just a more confident person in general would be appreciated as well.",21May2018,1

161,"Not physical fights, I'm way too much of a softie for that.(I took boxing classes at my gym once, I quit after the first class because I didn't want to hit my sparring partner) For me, it's arguments.

I have no idea how to not be argumentative. I grew up in a house where you basically *had* to be ready to defend your point like you were going before a grand jury in order for it to be given any consideration, and the older I get, the more I feel like that's impacting my relationships in a really unhealthy way. I'm always looking for something to argue over, even small, inconsequential things. The instant someone isn't 100% agreeable and completely eye-to-eye with me, I start playing out scenarios in my head, things I think will turn into an argument, points I think they'll try to make, responses to their points, responses to their responses, on and on and on and on. If I think there might be a big fight with someone in the next day or two, it'll literally be all I think about. It fucking consumes my mind, and I hate it, but it's how I grew up, and it's always been this way since I was a kid, so I have no idea how to *not* be like that.

The thing that makes me really upset though, and the thing that pushed me to make this throwaway account and this post, happened earlier today. One of the arguments I've been ""prepping"" for a lot recently finally happened, and it actually resolved fairly amicably. The root of everything between the two of us came down to a misunderstanding, and once it was worked out, both of us realized that we had nothing to be upset about. Problem solved, everything's good, right? Except instead of being happy about it, only a few hours later, I was analyzing my interactions with them and trying to think of other things to get into an argument with them about, and going through the exact same ""prep"" process in my head. Things were resolved! Everything should be fine! Yet instead of being happy and carrying on with a conflict-free day, I was almost disappointed that things had been resolved without anyone ""winning"" the fight, to the point that I was looking for new points of contention to get into arguments with them and prep myself for.

This is a toxic fucking mentality, and I know it is, but I've been like this since I was a kid, so I have no idea how to change it. The one time I tried being less argumentative a few years ago, I ended up being a pushover and getting taken advantage of repeatedly. I have no idea how to find a middleground where I can stand up for myself without turning into this asshole who's spoiling for a fight and ruining his relationships.

***TL;DR*** I seek out arguments. I play arguments out in my head to prep for real arguments I think might happen. I look for things to argue over even where there's nothing worth fighting about. I hate being this argumentative ass, and I don't know how to change. Help?",21May2018,1

Without giving too much away, I'm a teenage girl living with my parents. I forgot to make their bed this morning and they went crazy, screaming at me, forbidding me to talk, and punishing me by making me clean my bathroom and do their laundry. My mother threw the dirty laundry in my face and threw my backpack on the floor next to me, then walked away screaming ""FUCK YOU, [my name], FUCK YOU"". My dad told me if I keep choosing to live like a slob I need to find somewhere else to live.

I was cleaning the bathroom silently crying, feeling like I want to die, so I looked up text-based crisis hotlines and found one. I have to conceal that I'm texting or that I'm crying because my parents seeing either will make them more mad.

The hotline just gave me a couple links to mindfulness/meditation audio tracks (useless, because I specifically said I was texting because I can't make noise) and then links to the anxiety and depression association of America homepage. Then she said asked me to fill out a survey of my experience, and that was the end.

My dad has his issues at times, but offered to move out to an apartment while they worked things out. My mom didn't like that idea because she didn't have full custody of my younger brothers (all under 10). I'm 18 so I can leave if I want to, however, I feel like its wrong for their sake. At first, I thought my mom was in the right, as my dad did have some issues (manipulation primarily, and this isn't saying my mom is flawless), but today she went straight to them without even allowing me to request him to leave (he would have left as he offered it before, and I'm assuming a restraining order gives you the option to ask him to leave before you involve the police). My dad somewhat trusted me with his opinions/thoughts, and I shared them with my mom thinking it might be beneficial. Well, turns out she had no respect and just wanted to humiliate him. She didn't even allow him to see my brothers before he left. I was put in the middle of this situation by both of my parents as they were ""asking"" for my advice because I'm ""older"" now (I really didn't want to be involved, I just had my finals last week and am finally getting some free time), and now I feel like I'm responsible for this entire situation. I haven't eaten all day, and my heartrate feels ridiculously high. My mom doesn't seem interested in communicating with me right now, shes technically ignored me since it happened, and has hid my brothers from me (unsure why, I've never said/done anything stupid, it just feel like she doesn't trust me all of a sudden). I don't have many friends here and have nowhere to go, and I feel like shes trying to use that to her advantage. According to my dad, her restraining order also has my name on it (he quit contacting me after he noticed). If I'm 18, is that even legal? Don't I have to approve of it? and if so, how would I correct that? Also, is there anything I can be/should be doing in this situation? I feel like I've just destroyed my brothers lives while trying to do the right thing. At this age I can just leave somewhere if I need to, but my little brothers are my worry. Sorry if the formatting/writing is bad, I can't think right now.

Currently I am considering moving out, I've brought the topic up with my parents to ask them for advice on it. My mother is, whilst apprehensive about her last child living at home leaving, supportive of it if it's what I want. My father on the other is very against the decision.

When I mention it to him it's usually met with him saying ""Look forward to having no money"" and ends with him dimisively telling me to do what I want just know the consequences.

Shit went down when I was little and long story short I can only feel lust or love for someone and not both. I care so much about him but whenever he confesses It kind of hurts my feelings a bit because for a little moment it felt like we were on the same page and were the best friends in the world and it makes me feel weird thinking about how he might see me in a lustful or romantic way when my emotions are more like a strong platonic love. He is the only person besides family that I feel this strongly about and he is most definitely my most important person in the world and I wan't him to know that without leading him on in a romantic way.

176,"This is a throwaway account.

I want to preface that I've been friends with, lets say John Doe, for over 8 years now. I have more than friendly feelings for him, but it's been clear that nothing like that would happen between the two of us. That still hasn't made him any less of a best friend for me, and I've done my best to always be there for him.

Lately though, he hasn't been talking to me. Like, at all. He's still active as I know he's playing games with some other friends, but usually he tries to get a response to me or something. He tends to get this way whenever he has a new interest of girlfriend potential, and I know this because this has happened nearly every single time he's gotten a girlfriend. This is the first time he's fully shut me out though, and I don't know if I'm the problem or what. 

Lately it's been making me really depressed and wanting to hide from most everyone, not that I don't enjoy hanging out with my other friends, but I feel whenever my own best friend completely ignores me I just don't feel like I deserve any friends at that point.

Another friend of mine said that my dependency on him was too strong and that it needed to be adjusted, but he's also been there for me more than anyone else has, including my own family. He was more accepting of my own issues than most people I talk to today, and me and him have been going back and forth in trying to help one another with mental issues. 

But now I've been shut out and I don't know what to do.

I have abandonment issues due to multiple abusive relationships, and I feel like this has a key factor in it, but I don't know what to do anymore. I can ignore the issue whenever I'm playing video games because I can concentrate, but the second I stop I just think about it and it makes my depression spike up.

Am I too dependent on him? Am I the unhealthy friend out of the two of us? Is it just an unfortunate situation to be in? I don't know what I should do. I don't want to bring anything up because if I mention that he ends up ignoring me whenever he gets a new girlfriend, I don't want to start a fight with him. I just want him to talk to me.",21May2018,1
177,"This was about a month and a half ago. I booked a place through Airbnb, and the... Ahem, ""lady"", booked the place out from under us for more money, then intentionally refused to respond to me until 2 days before I was due to arrive, and both myself and my boyfriend were calling her.

I went through the rules Airbnb ""assures"" you as a guest. Mostly that this lady was supposed to cancel 2 WEEKS before, has to give me notice, and that 3 cancellations on her end would mean she wouldn't be able to advertise on Airbnb. She had 7 cancellations in less than a year.

I love my boyfriend, but he just wanted this over and got a hotel room for 2.5 times what the Airbnb had cost. I made the mistake of cancelling, because I knew 2 days out on the cusp of a massive gaming convention meant whatever place they were going to find us wouldn't even be in the same city, much less the walking distance the apartment would have been. I asked Airbnb to at least help pick up the tab, it was on their watch that this happened, and they gave me $175 Airbnb credit. And a full refund. I do want to say I got back every penny I spent.

So my question is, do you think I can go to a news site with this? Or is there something else I would be better doing? Because I'm livid this was allowed to happen when their rules explicitly stated that this should NEVER happen.

179,"So let me start this post off by saying this person is completely psychotic and is using people to get to me and it started with my girlfriend.
Today my girlfriend was at work and her cousin came into see her. She was so excited that when he told her to come outside he was talking to someone in a jeep well come to find out its a past friend of mine. Her cousin said get into the jeep and she said no a bunch and he picked her up and put her in the car. She told me she just froze and didn't know what to do. Well her cousin and that past friend of mine questioned her to no ends about how she is doing and where I am. My past friend wants to get to me because I told his whole family about how he was abusing his girlfriend. Well my girlfriends sister told my girlfriends cousin that I am taking all of her money and not letting her talk to anyone because ""I don't find them fit enough to talk too and I am also a control freak"". Too add on aswell she kept getting asked where I am and to help them get to me. Well this past friend asked my girlfriend when she got in why she looked so terrified of her. She said she wasn't, they kept locking the doors on her and trying to take her she said. She finally escaped by holding the door lock open since it was a sliding lock. She went into her job and cried then proceeded to call me about what happened. They told her if they say anything they'll hunt her down. I said to her that she needed to quit that job. Honestly I feel in a sense that my girlfriend was going to get raped again by this guy because he also raped another female friend of mine. This is all surfacing now which is scary because two girls close to me now have said something. I called the nonemergency number and had an officer come out and talk to me he asked me if I would like to have him go talk to them to see what is going on but I just said i would like a report made up. So he filed a report about it so its known. My question is did I do the wrong thing out fear? These two guys know where I am staying I own guns and will use them to defend myself. But my girlfriend sucks at shooting a .357 and I told her if they try to come in you just shoot at them. Someone is home at all times with her since we stay with family members but still. We planned on going to get a No Contact order filed for these two men. But should I have had the officer say something, the only thing concerning me is what if the police couldn't do anything and it just pissed him off even more to hunt me down.




This past friend of mine I moved in with and he raped my girlfriend when they first met each other. He also beat his girlfriend that he is currently with also I've experienced it first hand. I've seen the poor girl after she has been just harmed where both of her eyes were swollen shut. Well I managed to get out of that situation because a friend of mine and his at the time said how he was going to force my girlfriend to have a threesome with him and his girlfriend. I use the term force because she is still shaken up about the rape, she never said anything to anyone but me. ",21May2018,1
180,"Hi Reddit, 

I'm writing this post to ask for thoughts/opinions/advice with regards to my current situation as I currently am feeling completely lost. In an attempt to summarise before going into details, I essentially find myself stuck in a state of debilitating uncertainty with regards to whether my degree (and therefore) career choice is going to provide me with the sense of meaning and purpose that I undoubtedly need to merely function as a human being in day-to-day life. Other disciplines exist that have interested me greatly since early high school, however I have decided not to pursue them due to pressures my parents (particularly father) have exerted with regards to financial security, and the unquestionable importance of a well-paying job in being happy/fulfilled.

I am a 20 year old male, currently studying Computer Science (in my 2nd year at the moment), and as of the past few months I have begun feeling myself fall into this awful, passive, apathetic, ""going through the motions"" state of being. I feel paralysed and unable to focus on my studies as I seem to obsessively fixate on thoughts in my head regarding whether I'm truly living the life I want to live. I find myself constantly daydreaming about being awesome and living an awesome life (similar to Walter Mitty), and constantly 'procrastinate' by binging on self-help videos and resources related to self-actualisation.

The reasons for studying Computer Science that I told myself after finishing high school were:
- I enjoy mathematics (corrected; I actually enjoy problem-solving, which mathematics happens to provide an abundance of).
- Computer Science pays well.
- I was interested in robots as a child and thought AI may fascinate me.
- I displayed impressive mathematical ability in elementary school.
On top of these reasons, there was also an absolutely colossal pressure from my father to pursue ""computers"", as he personally believes it to be where the future is headed and what the most ""in-demand"" discipline will be. On top of this, he (like many members in my family) suffers from mental illnesses that have put him in a state of depression and desperate reliance of me being able to succeed. He has told me that my going to university is literally the one thing that keeps him from committing suicide. 

On top of my interest in computer science that I have expressed above, I have also always had a keen interest in Psychology and Music. These are in fact the alternative career paths that have been assertively parading in my thoughts and causing my distress. 

Music:
My father, being a musician, taught me to play piano and develop deep appreciation for music (and art in general) from a very early age. Music teachers in Elementary and High School all praised me for being a gifted musician in their eyes and would give me extra time and resources in acts of encouragement. At around the age of 16, without going into too many details, I suffered an acute bout of mental illness (primarily depression/anxiety) stemming from the psychological toll of traumatic childhood experiences beginning to resurface in my mind. I was placed into a mental institution for 2 years and then released, thinking that I was now a changed person. Without going into details, I have always felt a profound need inside of me to channel these experiences of my life into a beautiful work of art, in this case music. I feel so certain that having just one piece of art to my name that beautifully summarises and creatively expresses these times is a mandatory step in getting my head right again.
The issue is that I have adopted a perfectionist mindset with regards to pursuing this goal, to the point where I feel that only by acquiring a complete formal musical education will I have the confidence to not constantly throw ideas in the bin and actually grow as an artist. The idea of pursuing music as a career is also wonderful however my father has pointed out the many logistical problems associated with that which has made me decide not to pursue it. Hence I feel stuck in a rut, having to be so occupied with these Computer Science studies that I've now lost vision of, that I no longer have the time to develop these artistic skills (I also work a full time job).

Psychology:
I have always had a keen fascination for the human mind and how it works; how and why people think the way they do. Maybe it stems from the long history of mental illness in my family and the fact that I also suffer from mental illness. That possibility is in fact one of the things that deterred me from pursuing it in tertiary education, as my motivation for learning the discipline would be stemming from selfish roots (wanting to know what's wrong with ME). However, all my life people have commented on my keen listening ability, compassion, gentleness, and most importantly, ability to understand people and where they're coming from. I have a keen fascination in analysing and understanding people; I do it all the time accidentally with the people I interact with in day-to-day life, for better or for worse. One of my friends has even jokingly said that I am his 'personal psychologist'. Another reason that Psychology appeals to me is the idea that I am directly helping people. When I think about it I start feeling butterflies in my chest, as though the act of helping others could be my source of purpose and meaning in life; a step towards true self-actualisation. Personality tests that I have done (which may be rash of me to use as a piece of evidence) in the past have also pointed me in a professional direction of this type; I'm an INFP according to 16 personalities, and its description does resonate with me greatly.


I suffer from ADHD, and wonder if, in a vacuum (without every having begun study in computer science), if I would've in fact been equally interested in all 3 disciplines. I wonder if, because I've been studying computer science for a year and have done 0 study in these other disciplines, that there is a bias; of course computer science would seem stale in comparison to things I haven't begun yet, which are new/fresh and exciting. Maybe if I did switch degrees to Psychology, I'd get bored of that in a year. I don't know for sure, and this doubt stops me from taking any action. This is stacked on top of the general anxiety related to switching degrees; looking like an idiot, humiliating yourself, ignited further complications with my parents.

Should I continue with my degree in your opinion? Should I change? If either, what advice/thoughts can you share that may help realign my mind to the right head-space that would allow me to be productive with my time again instead of wallowing in existential depression?

Thank you so much for reading.

181,"There's someone that I was friends with when we were really young\- just a few years old which i can remember some of. We were around each other a little more when we were 16\-18 \(i'm 21 and they're 20 now\) because of our families having a marriage between each other but we were never able to really become friends. I found out something about them from my mom like last year that I think they're trying to keep secret and I'm not supposed to know\- but it's something we share so I really want to talk to them about it \(especially because I have no one like that to do that with now\). We have a lot of stuff in common in general too though so being friends would be cool. 

So far I just added and messaged them on facebook a tiny bit\- that just pretty much asked about how they were doing. Adding to this is that I just don't really do much irl. I have one irl friend and we only meet to pretty much just talk for a night once a month or two. So I generally just don't know what i'm doing here lol. 

I want to go from here to sharing the thing we share \(i'm keeping it secret too atm\) and hopefully being friends and knowing each other irl. How do I do this exactly? I have no idea what i'm supposed to do\- should I ask about meeting or just talk online for a while? What kind of stuff do you talk to someone about that you barely know now?

Well now I'm not homeless, and I make more money than I ever have, better living situation, but feel the worst. I've been depressed ever since I was a kid. I've always had something wrong with me. When I was a kid I always heard different things, he's autistic, or he's got adhd, or he's got abandonment issues. I was on stimulants for adhd(Adderall and Vyvanse) from ages 7-17, until I decided to quit, because it was making me feel emotionless, despite helping with my ""motivation"". I think that has a part to play in why I'm fucked up.

Despite whatever is wrong with me, I need help, and I don't know how to get help at this point, being trapped and all. My health is shit, I have quite high blood pressure and pulse, constantly, and I can totally feel it. I get chest pains. I'm pretty sure I have sleep apnea from working with weird powders, and from smoking and being overweight. I am a shell of who I was just 3 years ago when I was 18. I feel like I've lost a lot of intelligence too. I am so emotionally fucked up, I don't even know what to say, and I lack the ability to even communicate it. I don't ever have time to take care of myself because I always end up having to work to survive.
I can't join the army, I can't go to college. I just need help, and I don't have time for help. I'm literally at a job where I can't be late or miss a day or I get fired. I've quit a d got fired from so many jobs. I just can't do it. I am still so fucked up from everything that's happened in the past I can't move forward. 

If anyone has any advice, If I should move somewhere else where I can get help, or where I can go. I need help I am so lost. I'm going to kill myself if shit keeps going this way, I'm EXHAUSTED.",21May2018,1

184,"I (19m) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (19f) for about 6 months. We are crazy in love and have always had a really great time together. However, things have been declining the past few months. It started with her becoming verbally harsh with me, often elevating arguments to the point of her screaming at me and berating me. In these past two days, it has been particularly bad. Yesterday, we were arguing in her house about something trivial, and she got extremely angry and pushed me, I stumbled and then she pushed me again hitting me into her dresser and knocking things over. Today, we got into another argument and I told her ""do not touch me"" and she didn't when we argued whilst laying in the bed. I got up and said 'I am going to go get water' and she freaked out, jumped up from the bed, and grabbed me in an attempt to restrain me from leaving. I pushed her off me back onto the bed as light as I could because I've made it very clear in the past that phsicla restraint is abuse and wrong. Her reaction was to slap my hand and phone as hard as she could, which sent my phone flying to the wall. It cracked. I've never once hit her, or pushed her, or even yelled at her. It all feels very one sided, and I am starting to believe that I am a male in an abusive relationship. Am I, or am I exaggerating? I feel hurt and sad and I don't know if I deserve any better. She always assures me we are soul mates, and that this is all a result of her anxiety. Any advice? Thank you.

i am a 22 year old college student (computer science, second semester) from Germany. And I am also working part time (20h/week) in order to be able to pay for rent/food etc.. The uni itself is already pretty time-consuming for me because im new to programming and have to put in a lot of time and effort to not fall behind in uni. 

I have/had friends that constantly asked me if I would go out partying with them or something like that but I really cant afford that at the moment. Most of them have cut me out of their lifes by now or just stopped contacting me (which I understand).

187,"It's after 2am. I was still up working on something, and my boyfriend was asleep in our bed (we live together).

We've been dating for two years (We're in our early-mid 20s) and I have learned that he snores somewhat loudly (he doesn't snore if he's on side) and sometimes talks and does funny things in his sleep. That has never really concerned me until now.

We also confide in each other a lot, so what just happened seems completely out of the blue. For a bit of context, he loves being naked at home and if I see him naked unexpectedly and I turn away to give him privacy, he always laughs and says it's fine. I see him naked every day. I'm not like that...I prefer to be clothed unless it's really hot in the apartment (we have no AC) or unless I'm being intimate. I ask for privacy when I get dressed, and he's fine with that. We're just different in that regard.

I was on the computer and I heard him say, ""Oh damnit!"" I ignored it at first, thinking that I should just let him go back to sleep. Then, I heard him get up and run toward the bathroom.   By the way it sounded, it seemed like he peed or shit himself or something...I wanted to see if he needed help since he sleeps naked and it would have been a mess to clean up. 

I walked over to the bed, and he yelled, ""Nononono, go around the corner!"" I notice that he's cupping his crotch. His tone of voice is extremely urgent, so I quickly do that. I'm facing away from him when he again said, ""GO AROUND THE CORNER!"" This guy is the calmest person I've ever met, and I've clearly gone around the corner by this point, so I was just confused. I just said, ""I'm not looking!"" 

A bit later, I go over there and say, ""Um, did you  wet the bed? I can help..."" 

He said, ""No...I was just embarrassed about you seeing me naked."" The way he's talking isn't...right...and I realized that this whole thing is probably another bizarre sleep-walking thing. 

Since I see him naked literally every day and almost all the time, and I think that he's sleep-walking, I just say, ""That doesn't make sense. Why did you feel that way?"" It seemed like he was waking up,  so I said that to get him back to reality. He then starts using a really rude tone with me, and says, ""I don't know..."" He started acting rude, so I told him he needed to go back to bed. I was shaken, and I didn't want to deal with him yelling at me for no reason. 

A free minutes later, he was laying on his back on the bed. If he falls asleep on his back, he snores. He was awake, so I asked him to face the other way so I wouldn't have to get him on to his side later. He told me to shut up and go away...

I have no idea what just happened. Is this a thing that sleepwalking people do? He doesn't ever act like that...it also creeped me out that he would freak out that badly because of a dream. 

I've been sexually assaulted, and he knows that. The way he acted was almost reminiscent of that of a trauma victim...

How should I approach this with him tomorrow? ",21May2018,251

190,"What do you do when your friend is obviously trying to compete with you and is doing so in a mean-spirited way? Do you call them out on their asshole behavior, or is it not worth it? What if that person is high-strung and argumentative by nature? 

Or, The Saga of Tim. Or, Midlife Crisis is a Bitch. 

I've been friends with someone, we'll call him Tim, since 2005. We don't live near each other, so our interaction is only social media and online and various meet ups for our common interests in anime. Tim is about 10 years older than me and is now in his early 40's. He's what I would consider successful in his field, which is similar to mine, and I respect(ed?) him for the longest time and looked up to him like a big brother because he works very hard and has a lot of experience under his belt. We're both in artistic fields (I'm in comics/illustration, he's in computer graphics/sfx), but don't necessarily have the same skill set that would warrant competition for jobs.

The past, in a nutshell:
- Met Tim through a big group of friends with similar interests. 
- Tim was super energetic, fun to be around, funny, and generally had everything I wanted in life when I met him. He lived in a cool city, had lots of money and contacts in the industry, and seemed adventurous. I wanted to be like him, but knew I'd have to find my own way.
- Noticed Tim had a tendency to show off and be a ham, but it was a likable and funny quality.
- Was surprised Tim was older than me by that much because of how much he acted like someone in my age group at the time (20's).
- Tim was dating one of women in the group and she was/is lovely and a very nice person.

Things start to get weird (maybe about 5 years ago):
- The group mostly broke up and went their separate ways due to getting married, moving, and changing interests/careers...but I kept in contact with all of them because I'd had such a great time when the group was together. 
- Some of the group members weren't on speaking terms with each other for a while, and I was the only one they were all ""good"" with. But it was relatively drama-free (no gossip, not asking me to take sides, etc.).
- Things continued this way with me keeping in touch on social media for a few years, and all the while Tim kept giving me advice and encouragement about my career.
- One of the last times the group was all together, Tim was really obviously starting to irritate his girlfriend and kept egging her on to show off in public. She was obviously embarrassed when he made a crack about her being frigid in front of everyone, and then Tim got passive aggressive and snippy. This made me uncomfortable because up til then I'd thought of Tim as a guy who had everything under control and knew how to take things as they came.
- Then, Tim contacted me out of the blue and told me he was depressed because his girlfriend broke up with him. I saw this coming, but I was still sad for him because I thought they were an awesome couple for the most part. She is still my friend. 
- Tim started to gain weight and got out of shape (prior he'd been pretty shredded- lean muscle and athletic) and I noticed he posted more photos of him out partying. 
- Tim eventually got a new girlfriend who is about 12 years younger than him.
- During this whole thing, I was in the process of getting my own career off the ground. I had spent some years being depressed and wasn't doing so well, but I knew it was my responsibility to get myself out of it. In hindsight, I think Tim just enjoyed giving me advice and saying ""you'll get it!"" because it made him feel good to be superior to someone during his difficulties... and also because I sort of think he didn't really believe I would ever actually make it.

Tim becomes kind of an asshole (3 years ago to present):
- When I went back to grad school to get my master's degree and enhance my skills/portfolio, Tim made a passive aggressive post on his Facebook about how he doesn't need fancy grad school to be successful, because he relies on his abilities, smarts, and his creativity instead of spending $100K. 
- Tim knows my money is tight. He begins posting incessantly and tagging me in the posts and messaging me about new, super expensive (like $200 jeans) items he's bought.
- Tim starts challenging me to keep up with his collectibles and merchandise purchases by implying I'm not as big a fan if I don't spring for some of the anime goods he's getting.
- At this point, I found out that Tim had not in fact even seen half the anime he claimed to. A mutual friend commented on his post and pointed out that he hasn't even watched them.
- Tim's partying, drinking, and spending excessive amounts of money and flagrantly posting/bragging on social media hits an all time high. His posts always have some reference to ""Don't you wish you lived in ____ too?"" and ""I'm where it's at"" and other peacock-y bullshit.
- By the time I graduated, I'd worked my ass off to improve my skill and had a respectable portfolio. Tim began commenting on all of my posts with my artwork, still being super upbeat and positive...
- ...until Tim began to try to draw in the same way as me and failed miserably. His drawings were and are embarrassingly bad. I don't judge him for it because I know he has different skill sets. But these were awful. 
- Tim's joking around became edgy and mean spirited. He made a post about how his other friend will be out of a job soon because the industry won't need traditional artists anymore. Then he posted an article about why SFX people (Tim) are more in demand and needed. Bullshit, they're both valuable. And why would he post that unless he was trying to put people down? His friend responded with a fuck you and stopped interacting with him.
- I recently lost some weight and put on lots of muscle. Tim ended up joining an expensive Cross Fit gym...had someone take photos of him working out and bragged that he worked out at 3am. He lasted two weeks before he stopped. When I expressed a desire to cosplay as a certain character bc of my newfound fitness, Tim sent me a message with a photo of the costume that he ordered online (craaaaaapppy quality) and said ""LOL look what I got."" 
- When I did cosplay as the character in a homemade costume, Tim demanded that I make him one because his costume was busted. I declined, citing being too busy with work. (true). Keep in mind, this is a 40 something year old man reacting like this.   
- Tim traveled to Japan, and tagged me in the photos, with a comment: ""weren't you going to go lol? When's that going to happen?"" Then he posted a photo of himself with his new camera taken by ANOTHER camera in business class on the plane, and tagged me in the post challenging me to fly business class. 
- Tim has started to trace his drawings in order to post a drawing a day, which is the same challenge I'm participating in. He's not good at tracing and it's embarrassing to see. 
- Tim sent me a private message telling me he wanted to remind me to follow his instagram account so I could see what he was posting. I saw. I didn't want to follow because his drawings made me so uncomfortable. I ignored the message.
- Tim traced a couple of photos that I could tell were supposed to be ME. Photos I posted on my Facebook. And they were not flattering and they were captioned in a mocking way. 
- I did my best to ignore this bullshit and continued drawing away and posting when I could. I'm doing pretty well with it, if I say so myself. But Tim decided he would start to copy what I was doing in terms of themes of drawings, and then claimed he had the idea pop into his head.
- Tim's recent posts made the excuse that his drawings weren't as detailed ""as some people's"" because HE ""has a social life lol"" and then another post stated he would spend ""a ridiculous amount of time like some people do, but he's actually got work to do."" Tim knows I'm a freelancer and I work from home and I'm waiting between stages in one of my jobs right now. 

I'm just... tired. I can't even think about Tim without feeling drained and angry. I hate how he has changed from a supportive and fun person into this asshole. I never realized he was like this, and I am not sure if I just had rose tinted lenses before and clung to the friendship because I saw him as a mentor... or if Tim was just always a jerk and I was too immature to notice. I'm not sure why Tim is targeting me so much, because I've never been competitive with him. I have admired him, yes. But I don't return his competitive edge. 

It's coming to a head soon, because I AM going on my own trip to Japan and I know I'm going to want to post photos. I am worried about Tim seeing because he has the resources to go on a whim. I just have a gut feeling that Tim would try to ""hang out,"" aka ""try to egg me on to buy things out of my price range and brag about things he buys and make the whole trip about him."" My girlfriend is going with me, and she even said she thinks we should keep it a secret from Tim, if that tells you anything about how pervasive his competitive issues are. 

So... should I unfriend Tim and just cut him out of my life? Should I talk to Tim? (Risky, he's a hothead and seems to be the ""I'M ALWAYS RIGHT"" type...and I am going through enough stress right now without having to argue or back up my statements to him). Is Tim salvageable as a friend, or do you think Tim is someone I should stop caring about? I think he's having a midlife crisis or something, but he's making it hard for me to sympathize because he's turned into such a jerk.

Thanks for reading if you got this far. I'm sure other people have dealt with this sort of thing, but most articles I find online are about women and their romantic competitiveness. Nothing romantic going on here, but it's certainly putting a damper on my enjoyment of things. I have to take responsibility for it and not let it bother me as much, but I'm not sure what step to take in order to facilitate that change. Thanks again.

191,"Okay so I had a massive 5 paragraph entry but I'm going to try and condense it.

My friend Bob has many mental disorders and is not in a good place because 5 months ago his girlfriend of 3 years left him. Depression, night terrors, trust issues, etc.

Dawn also had a boyfriend of 3 years that she left because he was going to leave her because I assume he realized she was crazy. Mania, Bi polar, anxiety, depression etc. Dawn also has a drug problem, (Bob doesn't) she's done every drug under the sun seemingly and loves it. Meth, crack, LSD, Molly, shrooms, coke, etc.

So they're both pretty messed up mentally. Neither are beyond saving, but they do need medical help that neither are getting.

So Dawn broke up with her boyfriend last Sunday(13th). We went on a school trip on the 23rd(she snorted two lines of coke before getting into the car). On this school trip these two people who have never talked before, stayed up all night talking to eachother (4hrs) and it was announced that they were dating in the morning. So right there is an alarm bell, right? I don't care what you talked about (they just talked, I know) or for how long, you don't start dating someone after one night. Anyways, after a night of what I know was them talking about their shitty lives and brains and exes they got together.

Everyone I've talked to thinks this relationship is a bad pairing and a shitty idea, and because I'm his friend I feel obligated to say or do something. 

So the problems I see here.

1. They started dating after one night
1. Dawn does a ton of drugs
1. They are both mentally unwell, creating a very volatile relationship
1. Bob said that he loved her on day 2 and I presume she said it back
1.  Dawn is bringing him to a rave next week with drugs galore
1. She's just overall crazy and a bad influence on him. 

So my internal problems are: 

Do I talk to him about it? Do I say I don't support the relationship and that it should end before something happens? 

Do I give my mom the go ahead to tell his mom about Dawn's drug use and mental instability? (this would mean no rave for Bob) 

Do I just keep my mouth shut and nod along? I feel like a good friend would say something but that would make me a bad one in his eyes.

 Like seriously he needs to focus on himself, his school and his future before he messes with a girl, especially a crazy one. 

I want my friend to be happy but I don't think this is the way. I'm very worried about the influence she will have on him, and the control and damage she could do. There's more to life than magic mushrooms and there's healthier ways to be happy than an unsound relationship. 

Any questions please ask away, I left out quite a bit of detail so anything you need just ask.

195,"hi guys, never been on here before, but i have a very big question to ask and i need some advice. So my girlfriend (Holly) has had family issues for the past 5 years where her mum would control, verbally abuse and just ignore her existence for the past 5 years on and off (sometimes she would sometimes she wouldn't). now i have only been with her for 6 months but we both think we have an incredible connection and we are moving quickly, so this promotes me to really want to help. recently, as in the past 2 weeks, her mum has said really disgusting things to her. Such as "" i wish you weren't here, everything would be a whole lot simpler if you weren't here, you are a cost to this family that is not needed, you are pathetic, you are a disgrace to this family, your education is a waste of money you aren't doing well enough"" and so on, you get the gist. Holly doesn't deal with with things said to her and takes it very personally and acts like they mean it when its actually not true. so when her mum said things like that to her, she takes it personally and says she really is pathetic or worthless. but Holly's dad, he doesn't believe what the mum is saying to her, or either doesn't care about what is going on. This is really affecting her life, her school, and our relationship. She takes her anger out on me, which also makes me feel pretty shit but i realise that its not her really meaning it, its just her family. But this made me realise. i think the mum is being either mistreated or not loved enough by the father and this causes the mum to take the anger out on Holly. And ive discussed this with her, and she brought up that she thinks they are only together look after the autistic little brother who is age 11. this will make the relationship very weak and cause them to be unhappy. but sometimes she questions her existence in this world, like why is she even in the family if she isn't wanted at all and isn't loved at all. Her mum excludes her from dinner, breakfast and lunch and allows her to starve. The big question is:

**What can i do to help?**
Im trying my best to help and take her mind off things, try and make her realise she is loved by everyone and is loved by me as well. What is the best way to help?

I'm a foreign student in Japan, and it's my second year in the university. 

Something happened last week, I received news from my family that my Dad has GBM brain cancer, and he only has one year left to live. 

And around the same time, a friend of mine is about to create a company in Tokyo, and he decided to hire me full\-time.

After thinking for a few days, I decided to quit university and work for him. but before that, I'm going to take a few months break from the university \(still on student visa\) and go back to my home country.

Here comes the problem, I've been staying in Japan with a student visa.  It seems like to get a working visa in Japan, I must have a bachelors or master degree. Before I came to Japan, I went to a college and got a Diploma in Computer Science, which doesn't work for me at all.

So, what I'm planning to do next, is to buy a legal bachelors degree from somewhere.

Do any of you fellow redditers know where can I buy a legal bachelors degree?

Note: The reason why I decided to work for my friend:

1\) Financial problem on my side

2\) Taking a few months break from the university will delay my graduation by 1 or 2 year.

He went out with her for about 2ish months and then just being a cunt to her really. Sam started using her and manipulating her and eventually just blocked her after loads of fucking her about. Poppy was going crazy mentally and I was there for her most of the time because I felt bad for her about what Sam was doing to her. There was no other reason for me trying to help her other than me feeling bad for her I wasn’t attracted to her just felt it was the right thing to do as my old mates were starting to be cunts to me anyway. Sam broke up with Poppy and she was going crazy for about 6 months constantly crying about missing him and wanting to be back with him no matter what. She would literally do anything he asked her to because she just wanted another chance. I helped her and would talk to her for about 2 months after the break up until it got to the point I couldn’t deal with it anymore because it was the same shit over and over and I just couldn’t deal with it anymore. It was starting to annoy me, and I wanted her to just move on already. Towards the end of this I for some reason started to become attracted to her which was scary for me as I didn’t want to fuck up our friendship but then I also didn’t want to feel like shit being around the person I was attracted too. To combat this, I decided to stop talking to her completely for about 3 months to the point she wasn’t on my mind at all which worked wonders. I was no longer attracted to her and felt good. Because I felt happier again I for some reason got in contact with her again I can’t even remember why or how. I started meeting up with her again for about the past 2 weeks just going on random drives or chilling in car parks talking about shit. She was now completely over Sam and was moving on. During this I wasn’t attracted to her again and was happy just hanging out with her. Now at the end of these 2 weeks of hanging out with her pretty much every day for 4 hours + in the evening and her sleeping round mine a couple of times I’m scared because I can feel I’m starting to like her more than a friend again… Last night she stayed at mine again (not in my room for some info) and I drove her home and just told her “I don’t think I will be seeing you again for quite some time because I’m stupid” she was super tired and a bit stoned and just said “yeah sure whatever” in a sarcastic jokey way. 
Anyway, my issue is that I am starting to like her more than a friend again and I love spending my time with her and making her happy or just listening to her. But I’m pretty sure she isn’t interested in a relationship with me. Am I smart doing the same decision as I did last time by just not talking to her for a few months or will the cycle just repeat but worse? I would tell her how I feel but I am scared to ruin our relationship. It also doesn’t help that I introduced her into my current group of friends and now she enjoys hanging out with a couple of them, so I feel I am going to have to stop talking to them as well just so she isn’t on my mind ever.

Anyway thanks for reading hope someone can help.

224,"I really need as many third party opinions as possible. So the story is that I met my boyfriend at college seven months ago when I was sixteen and he was eighteen. We're both Indonesians studying in Australia. He's muslim and I'm a Chinese-Indonesian and Christian. A month after meeting, we started dating. This unexpected for me because I always told myself that I would date someone only after I had known them for quite a while and we were good friends first. 

It was a bit awkward at first and we encountered issues about him struggling to open up to me. We got over it but encountered other problems. First, we went through this cycle of experiencing a few days of bliss followed by an argument. This continued for some time. The second problem is that I couldn't stop thinking about how both my parents and his wouldn't approve of us dating. Although I have never confirmed to my parents that we were dating, my parents briefly met him and told me definitely not to date him because he is not of Chinese descent and a muslim. Additionally, my youngest sister who I am extremely close to does not like him.

For a few months, I tried to ignore it but today it just overwhelmed me. After I confessed that I felt like we were in a pocket fantasy world detached from the real world, we both started crying and he offered to just be friends. I said yes but I feel selfish for breaking up with him and still trying to stay close to him. What should I do? Did I do the right thing?

We had been really good friends for 6 years, and he would always be respectful, caring, and was a very beautiful individual. He had move after he kissed me and I thought that we were going to be together. 
After he left that being my first kiss I told all my friends, and unfortunately that included his ex girlfriend. When I first told her she was angry which I expected, but what I didn’t know is that she was never my friend. She ended up twisting the story I told and attempted to turn all my friends against me, it didn’t work and nobody believed her. However some did and the two (18M) were mad at me for telling but I respected her enough to tell her. 
But after I found out that another girl was spreading rumours about the guy I kissed and had said he refused to use contraception or pay for plan B. After he came back he thought that I had been spreading those rumours. Everyone was telling me that he was a horrible person, and I had always defended him. This girl (18F) has ruined his reputation and has caused me and my two old best friends to all go to therapy.
Eight months later.. I cleaned his name and my friends know that she was lying however I have lost contact with both (18M). And the girl who had spread the rumours is still close with them.

I want to report her, she lied about sexual assault. And she has caused many problems between all of our friends. She is a compulsive liar and could’ve seriously damaged his reputation and which can affect his career.

227,"I come to this subreddit after years of struggling with porn and trying to kick the effect it has on your life. Im not a bad looking guy, and aside from a curvature of the spine, i have an average, well taken care of body. Im a social human being that can be described as introverted when talking with women.

I now have immense regret and disgust from a mistake that I made recently, and jas left me little hope of a happy life and any chance of being in a loving relationship.

I recently had the opportunity to travel to Europe, and the last few days of the trip were in Amsterdam. Unfortunately, I made a horrible mistake and indulged in the Red Light District while there. Whats worse is the fact that at 29, it was my first time having intercourse, and have given away something so special to someone who cared nothing for me, and just wanted money. What have I done?

How can any women desire me after what I have done? I never would seek out this type of interaction in the states, and this was purely an opportunity that was thrown in front of me, and I gave into temptation without any red flags being raised.

I know i have a problem, and have no doubt that the guilt, shame, and disgust in myself for what I have done will help kick the porn habit. This is my first time realizing im a human that makes mistakes, and I just don't know how I can have a happy life knowing what I have done, and the fact that my friends and family would look at me in disgust if they knew.

I have drifted from christ in past years and am tryinf to find my way back in hopes he can guide me. I am also getting tested for STD's, and going to seek therapy. 

Ultimately i want god to know that all I want is to move on from this and live the life he wants me to live, but if the shame and guilt I have felt over the last 3 months is all I can look forward to, im ready for god to take me to heaven so that I can be at peace, because this is no way to live.....",21May2018,1

My mom complains she doesnt have a car but only bec my bro ‘borrowed’ it and never gave it back.

229,"Hello everyone. I'm posting this primarily to vent, but also to hear your thoughts.. i guess its often that people just dont want to deal with plain sad, not overly positive talk? 

I have an old friend with whom I didn't talk much until recently when we both started uni at the same faculty. We usually small talk, nothing much.

Today, while having not the best day, we talked through messenger. While chatting, he asked me why was I having a bad day. i said i didn't feel like changing it for the better (a stupid answer). the conversation then continued to the part where i said how much i didnt want to go to a party and how i find it stressful and that there will be too much people ect. He replied: ""with an attitude like this, why dont you just stay at home always"" and i said that as a matter of fact, i do stay at home and dont go out much. (its very stressful for me to attend any social events and all my friends live in a different city than me) He then concluded by saying: ""eh, i dont feel like talking to you anymore. I  tried""

Now as a person with some mental health problems, that i have not yet treated , i found that quite hurtful. Was this really trying? I understand that this person didn't know that i would just lay it all there.. how i dont adore social events and how i have almost no will to change my days for the better. Still i trusted that this person just wanted to hear me out and maybe give some advice.

I dont have much experience with opening up to people. I've only told my SO about my mental health problems and the issues i have. Maybe this experience was just a learning point. Not all people, that i consider to be friends are going to listen to me, understand, give advice and support me. It's just so triggering hearing that a person doesn't want to talk to me just because the things i say may present an inconvenience or an unpleasant topic. i know that i should probably just let go of this and forget it, but i know that experience will stick with me for a longer time.",21May2018,0

233,"My last relationship failed due to a clash over her appearing miserable whenever we met\- our last date, she seemed disinterested and just lacking in any kind of enthusiasm for meeting up. We had broken up before because I behaved immaturely and selfishly when she was ill, pressuring her for sexual contact, but agreed to try again when she'd forgiven me. I feel and felt guilty about it throughout our relationship, with her calling it ""borderline sexual harassment"".

My problem now is that I'm feeling like during the relationship we had incompatible sex drives\- she'd never or very rarely initiate, claiming that I always did and never gave her a chance. I admit I did so whenever we were in bed together, and sometimes during the day if we were alone, and now I'm terrified that I pressured her\- she would say no, only to participate enthusiastically if I persisted and asked again following some physical stimulation \(e.g. mutual kissing, nipple massage, nipple sucking\). It felt like I was negotiating her into sex a lot of the time, although during sex she seemed enthusiastic about the prospect and afterwards when I asked if it was good she would respond with either a smirk and a jokey claim that 2 orgasms was ""ok"", or in the event I finished too quickly she'd pat me and laughingly say that it doesn't always have to be perfect.

There was never any question of threats, physical force, blackmail or coercion\- just pestering, which she would occasionally mention as a problem when we argued. When I'd ask if there was anything wrong with our sex life, she'd never intimate that she felt my initiating was a problem, instead mentioning that she would appreciate certain positions, or that certain positions were uncomfortable.

My fear is that she felt pressured to consent to sex after pressure during our relationship; I never wanted to do this to her. Am I overanalysing due to an isolated incidence of immaturity?",21May2018,1

237,"Hey Reddit. 

I got up this morning, got on the couch, turned on the TV, and did nothing except browse reddit. It's been this way for weeks. I don't feel like doing anything anymore.

On weekdays, I get up, go to work, after that I'll do the shopping, get home, make food, do nothing, go to bed. 

I don't know when this happened but it seems to me I've lost all interest in doing anything. I used to be into videogames, photography, playing guitar, but lately none of these things seem enjoyable to me. I thought that it would pass, but everytime I try I feel like I'm forcing myself the entire time. 

The weather outside is nice, but I don't feel like going outside. At the same time I don't feel like staying inside, either. 

I feel terrible because there are many who have worse problems than me and I feel like I don't have a right to complain just because I'm bored. But I'm bored all the time. I think I might just need a new hobby, but I don't know what, because I can't muster up any interest in anything.

238,"My mom is in her 50s and is constantly going after men who are young enough for me to date (20s-30s). It’s not really problem for me until recently she’s started acting really weird and possessive over a mutual friend of ours who is my brother’s age. She no longer treats me like a daughter, she treats me like competition... frankly, it’s disgusting and sad. She has prioritized her relationships with men over her relationship with my siblings and me our entire lives, and I’m the only one of my siblings that still has a relationship with her because of it.

I recently told her, after she harassed and bullied me in front of this guy and her friends, out of what I can only suspect is a deep rooted insecurity, that I didn’t want to see or speak to her for a while. I made the mistake of saying I thought he was attractive in front of her, and she went on to make snide comments about the way I was dressed. I have no interest in dating this person and any threat she perceives is of her own creation - though, I still find it completely disturbing and inappropriate that she would be emotionally and physically attracted to a kid young enough for her to have given birth to. Another incident, we were out drinking and the next day she gaslighted me and lied to me about my behavior from the night before. I had 4 drinks the whole night, from 8pm to 2am - I was tipsy but by no means did I black out and forget anything. I even went back to corroborate her story with the people she said were there as witness, and no one knew what she was talking about. 

I guess I’m asking, what would you do if this were your mom or dad? Would you take a break from the relationship too? I seriously think I’m going to need therapy for this one. Ever since her third divorce it’s like she’s digressed into Regina George trapped in a 50+ years old body, and I can’t keep being the punching bag for her insecurities to lash out on.

The migrant crisis has meant millions of muslims have come to Europe. There's been a lot of islamic terrorism.

Europeans have low birth rates, so it's likely millions more will come in the next few decades to keep our country going. 

I don't want to sound xenophobic, I'm just scared what this will mean for our future.. Will muslims start to get things like sharia law implemented? 

I've read books saying that several european countries will be islamic by the end of the century, so I 've come to the conclusion I want to move away before it gets too bad.

So I guess I want to know is if you guys think it's worth moving out of europe due to this? Because I don't know what to d do for sure and when I try to ask for advice I just get called racist.

I'm just scared our way of life is going to change.  I don't want to live in a muslim country. I know it isn't one yet, but from what I've read \- surveys, books \- it's going to happen in a few decades. ",21May2018,4
241,"I learned this weekend that my ex-best friend's (from 16-17 years ago) brother passed away two years ago. She and I were super tight back then and her brother was an amazing person that I wasn't close with, but he was kind and warm and just a great person. 

We stopped speaking because I was not a good friend to her. She was having a difficult time and I was not available to her even though she had always been available to me. I'm pretty ashamed of this and really hope that I have learned to be a better friend and person in the years since. 

I am wondering if it is okay to send her a note saying that I just learned about her brother's passing and what a great person he was and how sad I am for her and maybe share a memory or two about him. I didn't plan to say anything about why we are not friends any longer and not trying to become friends with her again and definitely not making this about me, but her brother was an amazing person who meant a lot to her and yeah. Is this socially acceptable? I also worry about dredging up things for her, obviously she knows he is dead, but I don't want to make her life worse.

Also, like me, she is a pretty private person, and I would have to search and possibly pay for her home address to mail the note and I worry that is too stalker like. Any thoughts? Thanks!",21May2018,1

243,"Title is bit misleading, but I didn't really know how to summarize it for a good title.

Let's just call the girlfriend Emma, and me the guy, Jake for the rest of the post...

I've liked Emma for most of my college career \(we met in college\), but she had a boyfriend. Skip 4 years and the Emma broke up with her boyfriend for a couple of reasons, but Emma started to like me during the last couple months of the relationship which was another reason it ended. Skip forward another 3 months and me and Emma finally start dating, its wonderful. We both go into things knowing this is a long term thing, and marriage was kinda the end goal \(this is common for South Asians/Muslims\). Things are going great, but occasionally through the relationship Emma would worry about the future in terms of how she would fit in with my family, and on top of that Emma isn't sure about her career yet which added on the pressure.

Last week Emma broke up with me because the pressure was too much to handle, and the anxiety of the future was too much for her. After Emma and I spoke about it, it seems like Emma still has feelings for me, but the pressure surrounding the relationship coupled with the own future uncertainty became too much. From talking, it also seems like this relationship isn't something that's dead, but something we can revisit soon, since she still has strong feelings for the person I am.

I took the breakup relatively well because I knew the future was a stress point for her throughout our time together, I just didn't expect it to be bad enough to end things. I understood her points and they were all valid, which is why we decided to stay friends, because I truly don't have anything against her. I also took a lot of the blame, because maybe I was a bit too forward with the future stuff in the beginning, which in hindsight set us up for failure, but thats debatable since some future things are really important to me and her, and we made those clear early on.

Now, since we are friends, but also exes, its kinda hard to stay in this gray area for so long, and I don't really know how to handle it. We're friends, but its still odd not to talk all the time, and at random points I just get sad. I feel like we're friends with a bit of strain, but since I know she still has feelings for me, I feel like I'm just waiting for a good opportunity to try and start things up again, but thats a very anxious way to live.

Anyone have any idea as to how I should handle this time ""apart""?

However so far I've worked 7 days a week (I'm ALWAYS on call) and I don't get any designated breaks - even for lunch. My breaks consist of me saying ""hey I'll be back in 15 so I can pick up my lunch"" then I eat it at my computer.


I understand start ups work all the time. The pay is amazing, and I'm happy with that. I'm just having a hard time realizing that I have to work 24/7 and now they want me to commute to an office, too. The only redeeming factors right now are they pay, and getting to work from home.

I told her and broke up with her.  We were sort of on and off up until August of 17. I did what I thought was going to be best for her happiness and our growth as individuals. We connected on a real spiritual level,  but both recognized we were at different points in our lives. I wasn't ready and know I threw something special out, I couldn't hold her back though.

257,"Long story short, if anybody works for United or another airline company, I’d appreciate any insight. 

Basically, my flight back home to San Diego from Detroit was set for Saturday, May 19th. The flight was delayed and rebooked for Sunday night (I would have missed connecting flight). I didn’t receive any notification of them rebooking my flight until I got to the airport and spoke to a representative because there was a problem with my ticket. 

That was inconvenience #1.

Come Sunday, I’m sitting at the gate and ready to come back home when there’s ANOTHER delay that will cause me to miss my connecting flight. Rebooked for Monday morning.

TODAY:
DELAY DUE TO TRAFFIC CONTROLS. I’d miss my connecting flight. I practically begged for the representative to check all airlines and get me in SOMEWHERE. She was able to get me on a nonstop with Delta. That flight leaves at 4pm and I’ve been at the airport since 7am. 

I have missed a day of work, it was a 35 mile commute each way to the airport, I paid for a checked bag through United earlier this morning (and had to pay again when they changed to Delta).

258,"I live in a three bedroom apartment. My old roommate moved out and we needed to find someone new. A friend told us his friend was looking for a place, but she had a dog. Let's call her Lisa, and the dog Sandy. We were told Sandy was old and docile and house trained, and we liked Lisa a lot, so we went with her. Sandy is also not very big so I felt like it wouldn't be a huge intrusion, and that a lil pupper would be a nice change of pace around the house.

Pretty early on we learned Sandy has some issues with going to the bathroom in the house. We chalked it up to her being disoriented and excited by the move, but it's been a few months now, and it still happens.

The first and current solution is that Lisa would keep Sandy in her room when she was gone. I was partially against this because I didn't want this dog to be locked up all the time, but I also didn't want to be cleaning pee and poop out of my living room every day since I'm the one home most of the time. 

I know for a fact that Sandy continues to go to the bathroom in Lisa's room. I don't know how frequently this happens, and I'm fairly certain she cleans it up as soon as it happens, but I've seen the aftermath before. 

At this point I can't tell if it's incontinence from old age, or insufficient training. The dog is 16 years old, but is still very spry, and can run and jump fairly easily. But she also has to be repeatedly told to get off the couch. I know 16 is damn old for a dog, but I honestly don't know a lot much else about dogs.

On top of this, I fear that Lisa doesn't always give Sandy enough water out of fear that it'll make her more likely to pee in the house. This dog is always trying to get a drink of water, whether it's from a toilet, or a stagnant puddle of water outside.

This situation needs to change. Before you judge Lisa I want you to know she is a very caring person. The reason we're in this situation is due to a number of factors. First, she can pay rent and buy groceries etc., but I don't think she can afford an expensive vet bill as she's had some unfortunate unforeseen things happen recently. Second, she likes and respects us as roommates. She's mortified more than any of us when Sandy pees in the house and doesn't want us to have to deal with it. Third, she loves this dog, and I feel she's afraid to consider alternatives. It's not that any of us are uncaring, we're just caught in a difficult situation, and there's a lot of cognitive dissonance going on. But still, something needs to be done.

So what do I do? I guess my big questions are how do I confront my roommate, and what steps should I suggest that we take? I want to stress that I really do like my roommate, and while I'm very troubled by this whole situation, both for my wellbeing and the wellbeing of Sandy, I don't hold it against her because I think she's at the end of her rope too, and isn't equipped to figure it out, as many of us find ourselves from time to time. It's not an excuse, but I'm able to see both sides of it. I'm confident we can find a proactive, effective solution, I just don't know where to start.",21May2018,1

I like my therapist, I like going to sessions and I have learned some mindfulness techniques that help me some day to day. But overall I still feel my anxiety is crippling. I have 2\-3 severe panic attacks a week where I hyperventilate and sometimes inadvertently injure myself. I frequently can't do basic tasks like go to the grocery store without panic. My panic attacks are frequently accompanied by vomiting which makes them hard to ""push through"", especially in public. Even when I'm not having a panic attack, my anxiety stays with me \(in the form of nausea, vomiting, sweating, dizziness, racing thoughts, crying\) 24/7. I'm never not anxious.

268,"Hi! Unfortunately (for me and maybe some others who can relate) the title is true. Before anyone is quick to ask what I could have possibly done, please read my explanation.  

I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years. He's awesome and we've always been crazy about each other, never had any real problems (other than silly fights which are inevitable in a relationship) that can give an in law any reason to dislike you. At the beginning of our relationship I've had a person ask me how my ""mother in law"" was treating me. (She was friends with my boyfriend's sister) I thought it was a harmless question, and now I understand why she asked.  

My parent's love my boyfriend and see him as a son, they always engage in conversation and my dad loves spending one on one time with him. On the contrary when I'm at his house, his mother never comes out to talk to me (unless she is forced to and by this I mean she needs to go into the kitchen and I'm there). My boyfriend told me not to over analyze it because she just enjoys being in her room and she's just not a people person. I've been taught to always respect people who are older than you, and especially be respectful in their house. I've never shown much PDA at his house for this reason, in case she frowns upon holding hands before marriage. (Gotta play it safe right?) I've always tried to hold a conversation in case I do get to see her when she's outside. And even so I choose my words carefully and always make sure the conversation can in no way upset her or anyone so it's mostly ""nice weather we're having"" chatter. Even though I find it a bit unnecessary to add this, I know theres a chance it might come up; No, I made sure to never wear anything revealing or 10 inch heels. (I have no problem with anyone who does prefer this and actually wish I can be a little more loose infront of his mom) I am just so paranoid that I made sure to never wear anything too risky, in case that could be a deal breaker too. (She's always talking about what people wear and how she hates revealing clothes).  So what's clear so far is maybe I wanted to impress her, and get her approval really bad. Which I did, everyone hears those awful ""monster in law-stories"" and everyone wishes they could have a MIL that they could have wine with.  My mom had a hell of a time with my grandmother which was her MIL and I didn't want that. 

So here's what actually made me realize she hated me. About a month ago, my boyfriend had a really bad fight with his mom. Not infront of me of course, and totally unrelated to me. It was a disagreement between them. I was there when it happened, I heard it all but from another room. So it didn't happen infront of me. After the fight I told my boyfriend that I should probably go home and I said I was sorry that he was upset. I knew what the fight was about and it has absolutely nothing to do with me. So after the fight my boyfriend spent nearly all his time at my house even sleeping over everyday to avoid his mother. Flashforward, it was mothersday. My mom got a lenghty and sweet text from my boyfriend thanking her for all she does. As one would do, I didnt think twice about sending his mother a message. I haven't seen her since the fight and it had nothing to do with me anyway so why not? I chose a cliché but cute mothersday picture thingy from google and I wrote a sweet message thanking her for whatever it is that she may have done for me. And told her how good of a mother she is. Blah blah. Only to find out she blocked me. I was in complete shock, I've always been nice to her, I've always been respectful, never rude, I've always gotten her presents and even went shopping with my boyfriend to help him choose the perfect gift for her for that exact day. My name was even on that gift. And she just blocked me, without me even saying anything to her. Prior to that we spoke about nice things, it wasn't a meaningful conversation but it was the best we've had for a while. I checked on facebook too and she unfriended me. My boyfriend said not to worry, and his grandmothers told me that they adored me and that she'd come around (bother her mother in law and her own mother) 

Yet I can't help but feel so hurt,  and unwanted. We are thinking about getting married soon and starting a family when the time is right. And now I'm afraid of getting married to him, because of his mother. I acknowledge the significance that a mother has and I would never get in between a mother-son relationship. I just feel like no matter what I do, I just could never win her approval.  Can anyone please help me with advice? 


*side note: I asked my boyfriend's dad to give her the message for me so I reached out anyway. 


Long story short: My boyfriend and his mother had a fight, it had nothing to do with me. I've never done anything to her. And she blocked from everywhere after the fight. Found out on mothersday.

269,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl in that group walked up stairs with some other girl  to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and giggling/laughing a bit couldn’t make it out fully. a while later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and I looked at her and she didn’t look away (she politely tightened her lips together like a pleasant smile idk how to describe it)  and  then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whisper to her friend the brunette girl 'that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and the brunette girl asked over at me ‘excuse me’ twice then I looked and then she asked ‘how do you get a job in here?’ I answered and walked towards her because she asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well and said she’s weird (but the blonde girl was like ‘aww no don’t say that’ etc) the  brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit....yer know’ and then  looked at me then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' and they all laughed I just walked away.

270,"So I am going to try to make this as short as possible.

I (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for about 7 months now every thing is great we’re compatible we enjoy doing all the same stuff and the plus side is my best friend of 10+ years is my boy friends best friend’s girlfriend, so the 4 of us are together almost always.

Background: my boyfriend had a previous girlfriend 8 or so months ago… aka yes they broke up and very very soon (a month or so after) he and I started dating. I knew my boy friend before we started dating because I met he and his previous girlfriend last year through my best friend who I mentioned earlier, because she and her still current boyfriend (his best friend) roomed with my boy friend and his girlfriend back when they we’re together. Hope that made sense. My boy friend and his ex were together for 6 years, senior year of high school until now.

The issue here is that he has a female cousin the same age as he and they used to be like brother and sister. They grew up together, even lived together at one point and were always hanging out. Well his cousin has been best friend with his EX since they were in middle school which his how he got introduced to is ex. His EX and his cousin are still best of friends and it’s creating a large issue for me at least. He broke up with his ex because he had lost interest, and not because he is a horrible person or for lack of trying. Over the time they spent together she gained almost 70 pounds and he is very into fitness. He tired to get her to go to the gym and very sweetly invite her with him and told her he was only here to help.

I know this because I witnessed it when I was around all of them when I would come over to hangout with my best friend. I could see their lack of passion, love, effort, and fun whenever I was around them. I could tell he wasn’t happy but he never made her feel not special or loved. I noticed all this when I was merely a spectator and to be honest every one expected them to get married but he knew he would have been compromising his own happiness to make everyone in his family happy. He spoke to his friends her friends his family members about the weight gain and what to do about it and they all told him to be quiet and deal with it, which if we’re being realistic physical attraction is IMPORTANT in a relationship. I’m not saying it’s everything because it is In no one that important but biologically physical attraction is a must in any romantic relationship.

As I have learned being with him he still found other parts of her beautiful and he loved her in a way that one loves anyone they have been with for a period of time but he wasn’t in love with her and he had checked out emotionally a long time ago, which is wrong on his part because he should have told her he wasn’t happy and moved on already but he was going to stay with her because he didn’t want to ruin his life or upset his family. She is 24 and he was her first and only boyfriend so he was also afraid she wouldn’t ever recover from this, but he made the choice for himself and for her that it was time to end it so he could be happy and she could find someone who she deserves to be FULLY there for here in the relationship. They split and he ended up staying with my best friends boyfriend.

I would go over there obviously to see my best friend and her boy friend, and he and I had just always clicked always got along we had the same humor and we loved discussing the gym etc… few weeks flew by and I was over there every day to hangout with him, eventually we were dating.

I’m going to end it here, his cousin refuses to hangout with me being there, she has made no effort to get to know me. She hasn’t spoken to my boyfriend about us at ALL not even acknowledge my existence. She invites him to her house and says please come alone. When my boyfriend in more or less words said he’d like to include me via text she never responded and even ignored him on his birthday (petty and immature in my opinion.) I get it, her best friend is his ex but I have been nothing but sweet and loving and I treat her cousin and family with respect.

PLEASE help me I need advice on how I go about this situation, do I reach out to her and let her know I want to get to know her? Let her know I mean no harm, there are more details but to avoid making this a fucking book I’ll end here. Oh and my boyfriend let me know his cousin has always been a little crazy and irrational and is known for being a “harsh bitch” for no reason, and I know she is like his sister so he is coming from a good place. 

TLDR: boyfriends cousin doesn’t want me around because her best friend is his recent ex of 6 years.

272,"Hey there reddit peeps, 

So yea as the title says, I like many others went on tinder not expecting much just wanted to see what was out there and talk to different people. I saw this profile pic of a pretty Latina sort of middle eastern looking girl and just like any guy out there I swiped right, not expecting a swipe back and not realizing until later she lived a million miles away (5,587 to be exact). I go back on the app the next day found out she swiped right. I go through the account and realize that this can be some type of catfish or scam because of the distance(I’m located in NY). I left it alone couldn’t think of any Lebanese puns at that moment but surely enough she messaged me first(first girl to ever do this to me on the app). So whatever I went along with it, we hit it off really well seems like we got the same personality, likings and what not. I find out later through snapchat and WhatsApp she’s actually real ! We’ve been talking for a while and since the beginning we’ve been half joking half serious about meeting each other. I’ve looked up prices and stuff It most likely come out to under 2,000$ for the trip there including food and other expenses but I’m wondering a lot of things such as:

-I’m new to snapchat so how weird or common is something like this to occur ? 

-Hows Lebanon as a country right now ? Don’t know much about it.

-I don’t think I’m being catfished because of snapchats videos we’ve sent to each other and talking over the phone but maybe I could be wrong ? 

-Would anyone want to come to Lebanon with me to be shown around by this beautiful girl and some of her college friends? Don’t really want to go alone. 

-What are some important thing I should ask or find out before I become to committed in this ? 

So yea I doubt I’d be able to go this summer I don’t have the money at the moment sadly but I’m preparing hopefully for next summer if possible. I really hope everything is real this would be some experience that’d I’d love to record and share with everyone on here if it were to happen. Thanks in advance for any advice you guys can offer i greatly  appreciate it. If I find out anything important I’ll definitely let you know. My heart hasn’t stop pounding for this girl but I’m trying to think more with my head.

273,"I've written about this several times hopefully this will be my last.

To make an extremely long story short, I have an extreme crush on a girl at my church, she's 17 I'm 16 nearly 17. I've had a thing for her ever since we met back in July of 2017. In April I felt it was time to tell her. I asked a mutual friend what to do and she said I should do it. I decided on giving my crush a letter, sort of like a secret admirer note without the secret. I was set on it, I waited and waited, for the right time. A few days ago, a friend of mine found out about my situation who isn't one to keep secrets.

So me, him, and the girl's brother who I'm also good friends with were in a video chat and my friend sort of exposed me to her brother. Her brother sorta laughed it off but told me to keep dreaming, which upset me a lot. The letter is out, I planned on texting her one night just to ask her on a date, well my friend thinks that's a dumb idea. He thinks I should talk to her more, but I've had more than enough time to do that and I think it's time to make a move. Another problem is, the friend is sort of hard to read sometimes, and apparently he likes the girl now as well, so I'm afraid of him telling her things or just outright lying to her about something I didn't say.

He recently told me things that the girl has said about me which  I don't know are true or not like he said that she thinks of me as her brother and that she doesn't like me. I don't know what to do anymore, should I give it any more time? Or should I make a move and ask her out on a date.

278,"Hello everyone, I didn't want to post this question, 

because I swear I have all the answers, but the situation

Will. Not. Stop. Playing. In my head.

So here I am, hoping to hear advice from others

regarding this matter.

I met someone at work, and I ended up taking them home one day. Found out we had way more in common than I'd ever imagined, it was like looking into a freakin' mirror.

The third day of knowing this person, things got way too emotionally involved, both because of our childhood traumas but also because we were both still obviously very ill.

I know I am \(starting getting jealous when I saw her talking to a guy I'd consider more attractive than me, 

EVEN THOUGH HE IS GAY. SERIOUSLY BRAIN?\)

And just too many other unhealthy habits surfacing.

All I had from her was that she ""knew"" something wasn't right with her. She mentioned that she'd spent so much time isolated, that she'd feel herself,  ""go crazy"". I do the same, but I don't feel ""crazy"" per se, but 

I do like recharging my batteries in peace; It can get lonely\).

Although, I'd argue I am an ambivert, whereas she stated introverted. Regardless, we spent 6\+ hrs in my car crying/

holding each other. Freakin' unbelievable. \(Day 3\)

On the fourth day I took her home, she was telling me how we ""know so much"" about each other, 

and how we aren't exactly strangers. Personally, to myself, I thought, dude we exchanged a lot of words, but we're 

coworkers; Acquaintances at best.

I did say ""Well, but look at how things are right now, perhaps it'd be best if we just stuck to talking at work? Besides I don't want to hurt you."" To which she replied ""I think I'll decide who I talk to and about what :\) and there's

nothing you can say that can hurt me :\)"". \*Sigh\* That turned out to be untrue.

To back pedal for a moment, on the 3rd day I took her home, she stated the next day at work that she wasn't able to sleep at all. The fifth day, where everything went down, is the second day she said the same thing.

On the fifth day, something was clearly wrong, and I could tell, during the last break at work she pulled me aside to an area away from others. She stated ""Remember when we talked Thurs about the whole staying up all night \(Wed\)

thinking because of the weight of what we talked about? Well it happened again last night, and I think it'd be best 

if I found my own way x from now on"".

I was immediately upset, but I realized this was the best time to excuse myself indefinitely from our communicating.

I stated to her ""Ok, well then we should just delete each other's numbers and stick to just talking at work then"".

I found myself getting very emotional, so I attempted to walk away from the situation. She gently replied ""No, wait.."" and went to grab my arm, she grabbed it, but stopped and said ""You know what, let's just fckng do it your way"".

But I did NOT want that type of response, it seemed very hostile and unnecessary, so I attempted to reconcile with her. ""No wait, wait, that's not how this.."" \(I was going to say conversation is going to end\), ""NO, STOP, DON'T FCKING TALK TO ME, DON'T LOOK AT ME, DON'T TOUCH ME"".

Woah, completely took me off guard. Went back into the training room with her, alone, because everyone else was on break. and I asked her if she could please tell me why she was so upset, that I was willing to talk to her at work, but considering the circumstances..

To which she flailed her hands in the air and let out an ""UGGGGGGGGGHHH"" and ran out of the training room.

It's been over a month so far, in the beginning she wouldn't even glance in my direction, let alone talk to me.

But she indirectly spoke to me in response to others questions, and sometimes blandly to generic questions I'd

ask. Every attempt I made to help her, she'd reject it instantly, regardless if the technique was the correct one, and she'd tell me to not concern myself with her. \(In the first two weeks\)

\(The past two weeks\), I've overheard/seen things that are indicative that she still cares, and just wears that veil for whatever reason now. \(One day when I was upset, I heard her ask another person what happened, as to why I was so upset, and as soon as I approached the conversation after hearing it, she looked up and said to the guy ""I'll ask you more about it later"".\) \&lt;\-\-\- And there's been many other instances of this.

 So I called her, about a week ago, and said: ""S, I am really sorry, I realize I handled that situation

wrong, and I hope you can forgive me someday, because I miss talking to you"". Her response: ""I'm out right now with friends and I've had a few drinks, so I can't talk about anything serious right now."" ""Ok well, can I talk

to you at work sometime""? ""I don't know man, I have to go though"".

...aaaaaaaaaand nothing's changed. I asked my therapist, she says perhaps she's conflicted too, but regardless. She

mentioned writing her a letter, but honestly I am just so burned out and worn out, I just don't want to do anything

anymore. But I'm SO FCKNG STUCK ON THIS, it's unbelievable,  I asked my therapist why I want her attention so freakin' badly, and she asked ""Did you have issues getting attention from your parents in childhood""?

HAAAAAAAA, what a joke, pisses me off so much, it's like, \*Brain\* WELP CLEARLY THIS IS AN UNPRODUCTIVE WAY TO HANDLE THIS SITUATION, LETS DO IT ANYWAYS. But she responds with ""That's why you're here, these things are automatic for you, that's why you have to change the way you think"".

So whatever, this has been weighing on my mind for a while. If there's anyone that can just repeat the same stuff I've heard from everyone else ""GET OVER IT, LET IT GO, FOCUS ON  YOUR JOB, STOP WORRYING ABOUT HER, IT WAS ONLY A FEW DAYS WHY ARE YOU STILL HOLDING ON""? \(Tell me about it, it's literally been 10x the length I spoke to her, no wonder it takes me so long to get over ACTUAL romantic relationships\).

Or if you've a new take on the situation I'm all ears.

P.S. I'm not worried about her saying anything to HR etc.,

she's not like that, and I'm simply saying this to the ""LIEK OMEGAWDZ SMEXUAL HARASSMENT STEER CLEAR"", crowd.",21May2018,0

282,"23M here. 

3rd draft. It’s late and I wanna get this off my chest before I go to sleep. 

I lost a good friend a few years back. Because I was a self absorbed stoner to busy getting high to do anything meaningful with my friends. 

We got back in touch with each other about 2 years ago. They (him and his gf and friend group, people my and my gf we’re friends with) started off by inviting us to their house parties. Which I’ll be forever grateful they even wanted us there, parties were things like birthdays, New Years and stuff like that. 

Then, must’ve been a birthday party mid-late last year, I got realIy fucked up expressed how much we wanted to be back in their lives. We missed them greatly. And I’m an honest drunk. My emotions pour all over the place. 

2017/18 (late 2017 me and my gf quit weed, yay!) New Years party I wanted to enter the new year with a load off my chest. As soon as I got to the party I went up to my old friend and spilled my guts, admitted my wrongs and faults as a human. 
Apologised for the breaking point of our friendship. Hopefully he took it on board. I think he did. 
I’ve also expressed to his gf, who is one of the nicest, happiest people I’ve ever met, how much we want to be involved in their lives and somehow be accepted by the group again. 

Things are goodish now (very grateful or that). I want to be more involved with them than I am right now. They go to a pub every week or fortnight near them but we’re never invited. We’ve invited them to our pub. Haven’t had the chance to organise anything. 

And that’s the thing. With their close friend circle, organising doesn’t need to happen, but we’re on the outer circle and we need to be fit into their schedule somehow. 

I’d like to be able to just send a text “pub?” And go. Y’know? Not. “Oh on this day of this week at this time til this time we’re free”. 

How can I get back into their close friends? 

I don’t want to annoy them. Or maybe while I’ve been at a party I’ve said the wrong thing a couple of times. Idk...

Am I over reacting? Is this just what being friends is like as an adult? We’ve all got so much stuff on rn it seems but if we can’t get together for a drink or 5 it seems like I’ve done something wrong. 

Or is it harder because I haven’t been there for them through so many years? 

I don’t want to lose these people. They mean the world to me. 

I’m so stressed lately. 
This situation isn’t helping and I just get lost in my head. Not feeling very good rn. 

I get more distraught over this than I realise. I’ve lost a lot friends for various reasons since I was about 15 and keep wondering if everyone is just better off without me. Weather I move away or off myself they can just continue on with their lives. I haven’t thought like that in years. And it’s scary. Help anyone. This really spiralled. ",21May2018,1

When I dropped out I was super sad for a while but then just kept telling myself that I’ll do something in the new year, after the summer or whatnot. I feel like this was mainly because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and felt I had no options to get a good career.

Long story short I quit my part time job in retail in the new year to get some work experience and have now been unemployed for about 6 months and it’s been so long that just thinking about this makes me so depressed because I feel like a loser and everyone else is out making something of themselves.

285,"Ok, so our story starts like 2 years ago and this is when I got really close to this girl in my class (that we'll call Sarah) and we pretty much became best mates and I was really happy with that. We were both in relationships but while Sarah was having one or two short ones, I was in one that lasted nearly a year until I got dumped over text. Out of all my friends she was there for me and of course I kind of fell for her but didn't say anything because I really liked her and didn't wanna ruin our friendship. Sarah had been single for a couple months and told me she liked someone but didn't wanna ruin the friendship, and I told her that any guy would be lucky to have herand she should go for it. Me being a dense idiot, I didn't realise till later on Sarah was talking about me.

This brings us up to about a year ao, I dated this girl one of my friends told me had a crush on me and she was nice but there wasn't really a spark. It was here me and Sarah drifted a bit and I didn't know why so kept trying to talk to her. Sarah got back together with her ex but broke it off not long after and it was her friend that told me that Sarah liked me and didn't really like being back with her ex. So me and the girl I was curently with had a pretty much mutual break up and magically stayed mates and then I tried to talk to Sarah but choked and couldn't do it.

This brings us to now. While we're still friends, there's not the tight bond we used to have and prom is coming up soon. I don't wanna date her but more just wanna be her friend again but don't how to approach the subject.",21May2018,1
286,"Hello there,

I don´t have many social interactions and my surroundings don´t offer too many leisure activities, so movies, reading, series, anime, all those things play an important role in my life.

However I often feel like I am not really enjoying them too much, especially compared to other people. Often I see people being totally hype about something and I myself am rather calm about it. I also never cry because of fictional things and am just more detached. Sure, I am an introvert, thats also a reason, but even then: It happens only very rarely, that I really sink in in what happens, lose myself for a moment and am really thrilled and carried along.

Its not the medias/cultures fault, I watch/read many different things and generally appreciate them a lot, I just often can´t really enjoy them while watching. And since those things used to be my biggest source of enjoyment, I don´t want to just stop.

When I was a child, or actually for that matter just a few years ago, everything had this ""magic"" or ""fascination"" to it, nowadays I often feel like its just a bunch of pixels on a screen or characters in a book. I wish I could get really immersed in those things again, but I don´t know how to do it.

It´s not easy to describe since the problem is so immaterial, I also don´t know, I just want to really feel like in the scene again and empathize with the fictive characters more, instead of being indifferent and calm.

I sometimes go to a pub quiz with a friend and her housemates - I live with my partner, so she was kind enough to invite me along to the pub quiz they go to every week. It’s nice to get out and socialise with people other than my partner, so I was really appreciative of this. 

She’s a bit bossy, though, and refuses to put down an answer on the pub quiz if she thinks it’s wrong, even if the rest of the group is saying otherwise. I was texting my partner about her, saying this: 

“I don’t want to go to the pub quiz with Alexis. She’s the worst.” To which he responded “the worst?!” and I said “LITERALLY the worst.” Just a really stupid, juvenile, joking conversation between me and my partner that I didn’t think would be read by anyone but him or me. 

During the pub quiz, I stupidly went to show her something on my phone. Of course the text was there. I’m not sure if she read it or not, she didn’t say anything but hasn’t been that keen to text me lately. I’ve tried texting, and she’s replied, but has seemed really abrupt.

So let me paint the picture: 2 dear friends of me have been married for quite a few years.

300," Hello reddit community,

I've had this question in my head for many years now but it either gets pushed away because it's too hard or I never get the answer I'm looking for. I'm not sure what is right or wrong in this situation and just wanted someone else's view on it. 

My father sponsored my overseas university education and has probably spent around $250k for fees and living expenses over the span of 7 years. 

Growing up I was always told that I would have a better future and education and that I would study overseas. I've now completed my degrees and working in a well paid job. Since I've finished studying it has often come up in conversation with my dad (often when he is under financial stress) that he expects me to pay back. This has never come up before I decided to study overseas. He says things to make me feel guilty or to suggest that I am ungrateful. The problem is that the situation is not so straightforward (maybe it is to some people, I'd like to know what you think)

A few things have happened that may help put my dilemma into context:
- he cheated on my mother multiple times and never treated her with respect
- he decided to move me to a country to study because it was convenient for him since his new girlfriend was living here (this happened when he was still married to my mum)
- when I had a major accident the first thing he asked was whether I would be compensated for my injuries because money was his number one priority
- for many years he has struggled financially because of bad decisions, illegal borrowing and tax evasion
- due to his financial issues, for a very long period of time money would be the only thing we would talk about
- he does not financially support my mother who has never worked. I support my mother with my salary
- he has a new family and baby that he needs to support
- my mother has expensive medical bills and it's very likely they will only get more expensive
- I have already paid a $15,000 student loan that he borrowed many years ago that I never knew existed until recent times
- I have a mortgage to pay
- I see him once every few years

Despite everything that happened I decided to push it aside and just move on with our relationship and try to make it a healthy one. 

My question is - should I be paying back this $200,000 loan (he said he would give me a $50k discount). He also said that I could pay it off in 20 years like a bank loan. When I think the relationship with him is improving, somehow money comes up and just takes me back 10 steps. He talks about it like he is trying to teach me a lesson in responsibility. 

What would you do? I could probably afford to pay it back if I lived on a tight budget (no holidays, no car, etc) and if I didn't prioritise saving for my mum's future medical expenses. ",21May2018,1

302,"Let me preface by saying I was a biology major in college - I understand that watching porn and masturbation is 100% healthy, normal behavior. I also know that masturbation is GOOD for your health. Despite me knowing this, I've always had a problem in every relationship with my boyfriend's watching porn. 

In my eyes, if I'm not getting off by looking at other men and they're the only one I have eyes for, it's not alright for them to get off by looking at another woman. I never brought it up to any of my boyfriend's and it's not like it was a deal breaker in a relationship or I was controlling about it, it was just something in the back of my head that would put me on edge. I had extremely low self esteem as a teenager and that probably was a source of it, but I'm comfortable in my body now. Obviously I have off days where I can swear my hips are getting wider, but I'm fairly confident even on my off days. So now that I'm older and more confident, I still have problems with the idea of my boyfriend watching porn and I really don't think it's an insecurity issue at this point in my life.

I have been with my current boyfriend for two years and we have lived together for a year and a half. Our relationship is as perfect as a relationship can be and I'm so grateful to have him in my life. He's the only one I've opened up to about this and he understands where I was coming from. We have sex very often and he has lots of pictures of me, so if I'm not around and he does have to take care of business he can look at me while he's doing it. He even said he wasn't much for watching porn to begin with so he has no problem without watching porn. Let me clearly state, I never asked him to stop watching porn or gave him an ultimatum or any of that craziness. He's so understanding and I can say with 100% confidence he hasn't watched porn in almost two years and he's perfectly content with that. I can, however, honestly say if he told me he jacked off to another woman I would feel deeply hurt and somewhat betrayed. That being said, I don't think it would be a deal breaker whatsoever. 

I've read posts of people talking about similar situations (not on Reddit, I'm new to the whole Reddit thing) and in the comments people put them on blast for being agains their significant other watching porn, so I'm just wondering is it absolutely ludicrous for me to feel this way? I can't be the only one who thinks like this, right?",21May2018,2

307,"Hi everyone, 

My boyfriend and I got a puppy together, he mostly bought it because I begged him for a puppy. We’re still pretty young, live together with his parents, but pay rent. We had the puppy for two weeks, but just last night decided to give him away to a better family. As much I love dogs, we were just too selfishly busy with our own lives and were barely even home to play with the little guy. On weekends we just went out and when we were home, we barely even gave him attention. He always played by himself. So my boyfriend and I talked about it, decided we just aren’t ready for a puppy right now, we didn’t think this through. We’re never home, like I mentioned and our room is too small. (we live in a computer room-turned it into a bedroom) So now the little guy is with a good family that even has another dog and is going to spend good time with him. But we’re just so hurt as it was our first dog and we love and miss him so much. Was it the right choice to give him up to better family? I know we probably sound so irresponsible for this, I know we are for making this choice. But his new family is even nice enough to let us come visit him, but I don’t know if that’s right..

Hey guys,
Here a situation I encountered days ago.
I am a brown person, who is not good looking. And i am not saying that not to make you feel pity on me. In fact, i was approached by girls and I rejected them based on their appearances. I don't mind that. I myself was rejected countless of times to the point where I stopped trying approaching girls ( 7 years ago ). it has gotten to the point where I try to avoid a girl I like or I am attracted to. I keep a distance, I don t look at her ( just to make the feeling go away).
I am not awkward socially. I am a confident person and I talk to girls (the ones I am not attracted to).
Let me get back to my story.
So a few days ago, I was on a train heading to my town. and the train was crowded. I sat in front of that girl.
A beautiful blonde with green eyes. As always, I moved my sight away from her and gazed into the window. 15 minutes later I turned my head and to my surprise she was looking at me.
Instantly, I switched seats and checked on the window my reflection. I thought there was something on my face. I even checked my zipper.
Anyhow, everything was fine. I didn't give it much attention but then after another 15 min. I looked back and she was looking at me (remember I switched seats).

Being inexperienced I looked away. What should I have done in that situation?

I know I am 26 I shouldn't ask these stupid childish questions.
but I need to learn so that next time I won t do the same mistake, you know and try to do something instead of looking like a fool.",21May2018,3
309,"So my mom go her car repossessed (lost her job and her ex stole her 401k hardship money so she couldn't catch up on the payments). She asked me to go with her to the dealership to get another one. Well that process didn't go too well and they said she either needed a cosigner or more money to put down. She only had $500 to put down. I told them I could match that and they said they need $2500 total. My mom looked really discouraged because she doesn't have that much. My credit score is 753. I offered to cosign. I've never owned a car before because I live in the city. The guy was talking about how she could refinance in 6 months to a year. I figured ok that's not too bad. After doing some research after the fact I realized being a cosigner is a shitty position to be in. 

The application ultimately got denied because we don't live at the same address. I was secretly happy because it felt like a 2nd chance to back out. The dealership of course wants their car back and everyone is trying to pressure me into signing new paperwork. 

My mom handles money at her job and told me about how she did something that could've gotten her fired if she got caught. That was the ultimate last straw for me. I make really decent money and don't have any debt. I don't want this to potentially ruin my good financial choices.

I just don't know how to word this to her. She's really sensitive and this is a shitty position to be in. I feel like I kind of gave her hope just to take it away. I know I'm an adult and owe her no explanation after ""no"" but I want to make sure I preserve our relationship.",21May2018,1

I'm going *crazy*. I love my dog, so much that when I think about finding her a new home I get really upset. However, I can't handle the way she makes me crazy. For you to fully understand my position, you'll need her origin story. Me and my boyfriend were considering getting a dog together, putting a lot of thought into it and saving up the necessary funds etc. We had even decided that we wanted a black lab or a mix of one. 

   Then, coincidentally, an old friend of mine from school posted a dog that she was giving away. Her husband had found her on the road on the way home from work and they couldn't keep her because their house was already at max capacity, with her expecting twins. This dog was *so cute.* She was a tiny black lab mix \(with what at the time we thought might have been chihuahua\) and a very well mannered and tempered puppy. She was a quick learner, she loved doing and learning new tricks. She was almost immediately leash trained, I was very impressed to say the least.

   Fast forward about three months, I'm having health issues. Which caused me to be home from work for several months. During this, I'm working with my dog. Continuing her training, teaching her a new trick almost every week! Then all of the sudden, as if over night, she changed into a completely new dog. She stopped listening, started doing everything that we had worked so hard to teach her not to do. I was Immensely upset. For months, I had been working to teach her to be a patient, polite dog. And then, as if she was trying to spite me. Everything changed. She started tearing up the couch, newspaper, toilet paper, shoes, even things that make absolutely no sense like my makeup! One day I came inside from the porch and the carpet in my hallway was completely peeled away from the wall like a banana. I literally just started laughing, maniacally. I believe this was the day that I *completely* lost it .

   I thought the worst was behind, I was *wrong.* Christmas 2017 was a *nightmare*. The actual holiday went over great. However, within a week of getting all of my presents, she had found almost all of them. I'd say close to 70&amp;#37; of everything I got was destroyed. And she was a **ninja** about it. We have a shoe rack, that *she shoul*dn't be able to get to. But some way, somehow, she finds a way. I now own two pairs of shoes at this point. I'm scared to get new shoes, in fear that she'll just tear them up. And on top of all this, she **was comple**tely crate trained and now she can't be in there at all or she freaks out. I'm going to be starting school again in a few months and I don't think I can handle taking care of her while I'm trying to focus on getting good grades. 

We have already tried bringing her to a no\-kill shelter, and she escaped. I spent hours trekking through the mud and woods surrounding the shelter to find her. And I cried when I did.

Missing hanging out with my friends and talking about how I was going to spend time with my dad. Then it would get dark and my mom would call me in so I could wait inside. He'd either say he'd get me tomorrow and never come or he'd come around 10-11 pm and it was too late to do anything. I've never spent the night at his house so he just got me some fast food, had me eat it in the car and send me back home. Around this time my mom started seeing my stepfather and I pushed him away a lot because I wanted my bio dad to be for me and couldn't understand why he wasn't. I told my father about him and he flipped out and told my mother she had no right to have me around some other guy. Eventually I let my stepdad in and see him as my father. He wanted to adopt me but my father wouldn't let him. 

That's when I realized what an asshole my father really was and stopped taking his few calls and he didn't bother. When I turned 18 he petitioned the court to terminate child support. He could file for that on my birthday but couldn't even call me on the right day. After child support was over he tried to call me regularly but I've kept him away for the most part, only answering a call here and there. Finally he left me a message saying my brother and sister wanted to see me. This was shock, I had no idea I had any siblings through him. He said I have an older brother and a younger sister. My mom didn't know anything about it. He wouldn't tell me anything about them unless I saw him in person, so I agreed. He basically said that he always did right by me because he paid child support like he was supposed to and I have no reason to complain. Then he said if I tell him to kick rocks he'll stay gone. A part of me really wants to tell him off because he was a shit dad but a part of me doesn't want him to be a 100% gone? It's not like he deserves any loyalty but he still has a sliver just from a biological standpoint I guess. If I tell him how I feel he won't be able to handle it and he will leave. I might finally get some closure but I think I'll feel guilty. If I don't tell him then he'll basically absolve himself of any wrong doing. I don't think there is a way to make up for the past but there might be a small chance of moving towards something else. I also wants to reach out to my siblings because it sounds like he's estranged from them too and this is a manipulation tactic against us. 

TL;DR! -should I tell my absentee father what a shit dad he was and lose him forever or should I keep quiet and let him absolve himself, try to skip over the past and find out about my siblings. ",21May2018,2
324,"I'm very anxious about this post because I'm afraid I'm going to be told I'm just being whiny. I started at a popular company's IT department last June after I graduated college. I was offered a specific job title with a specific job description but when I was placed my direct manager changed my job title and placed me on a team that did something completely different from what I was offered. I brought this up multiple times with my line of managers but when I felt that something shady was going on, I contacted the sourcing office that placed me. They and HR didn't know that I was moved to another placement/team. Higher up managers in HR found out and moved me to another division where I could do work that I was actually offered. Unfortunately, the relationship with the former managers and team members were never great (they treated me horribly) and my former direct manager called my current direct manager.  I'm not sure what their conversation was exactly but from the talk my current direct manager had with me after, it seemed as if a lot of untrue things were said. 


Ever since then (early fall is when I was moved), I've had a bad taste in my mouth for the company. I'm trying to swallow it and suck it up because we could use the money right now. In my current placement, my line of managers and superiors are all men and all of my team members are men (I am a woman). My team members are great for the most part but they do make comments about my weight on occasion or talk to me like I'm stupid. Two team members in particular ""jokingly"" claim that I break something (technology or production wise) very loudly in front of others or my manager almost daily even though I have repeatedly told them to stop or say that I feel like I'm being singled out. This in particular has been going on for months. Friday was the last straw and I asked to talk to my manager privately about the matter. He told me that if I actually broke something (they were claiming that I introduced bad code to an application that I have never even touched before) that he would find out and that if what I said actually was true that then he would talk with them. Of course I cried which I feel half bad about and also half idgaf about because I'm pregnant so hormones. He told me that I was being emotional and when I apologized for not being professional and blamed the pregnancy hormones he said ""oh come on don't blame that, it's not the pregnancy"". I asked him to elaborate on his statement but he just stared at me. 


Then he brought up my supposed lacking performance. He gave me a really bad performance review a couple months ago. When we sat down to talk about it all he said was that my turn around time wasn't good. I said okay I would work on it but when I ran a report of my task turnover, it was the same as everyone else's. Then I began observing a bit more and noticed that he only ever pressures me at our daily team members about when things are going to get done. He once assigned a task to me and asked me when I was going to finish it already... When he just assigned it to me 5 seconds earlier. He also treats me like a secretary instead of a technical worker, piling his paperwork and meeting setups on me. So on Friday when he brought up my lacking performance as I'm in tears talking about harassment, I asked him why it was relevant and if he had a more specific example of my bad performance. He said it was relevant because I was accusing him of listening to other's opinions of me and factoring that into my performance review  (I wasn't, I was making a formal complaint about harassment, he brought up my performance).  He then assured me that his review of my performance was genuine and real and didn't have anything to do with these guys joking about me breaking things. He then said that my company is raising the bar and he ""gently threatened"" my career. I called him out on it and said should I be worried that I'm going to be fired and he said ""it's very hard to be fired from this company"". I just ended up shutting down for the rest of the meeting because it was clear that I wasn't being taking seriously and if anything I made things a lot worse for myself. 


I guess I really just don't know what to do. I had so much anxiety today about going into work that I took the day off to try and relax. I'm worried that all this stress isn't good for the baby but I don't know how to survive it for now until baby comes in December. I feel like no other place would hire me and with our rent right now, I wouldn't be able to quit. 


Any insight would be appreciated. I am just one year out into the real world but is this really how it is everywhere?

325,"This girl and I have been friends for about a month now, going to the same college. I confessed my feelings for her and we went on a date a few weeks ago. I thought it went pretty well but at the end she said she just wasn't ready for a relationship and wanted us to stay friends. It hurt at first, but I accepted this and now we're good friends together. Earlier in the year I had made a plan to stay with my uncle in Los Angeles for a week in July since I am wanting to move there after I graduate. For whatever reason I really want to invite my lady friend with me for this trip. I just keep imagining us having this awesome, movie like summer in LA together. I'm not thinking this as a subtle way of trying to get with her, like I said we talked about it and as much as I still like her and would be thrilled to be in a relationship with her, I still really appreciate our friendship. So would she think I'm weird/have ulterior motives if I asked if she wanted to tag along with me to LA for a week in July?",21May2018,0
326,"Coworker seems to have some sort of ego disorder. If he receives any sort of positivity(friendliness, praise, agreement) it turns his ego into this massive monster. Develops this sense of superiority and entitlement. Which turns him into a very greedy, lazy, inconsiderate, backstabbing weasel. Which in turn causes everyone else to get very fed up with him including management.


If you try to talk to him about his aggravating behavior he just thinks you're being a hater or your just jealous of him which boosts his ego even more.

The only thing that brings him back down to earth is when EVERYONE gets fed up with him and he recieves absolutely no positivity. He becomes very depressed and miserable but when he's in this state it's the only time his personality and behavior is at all acceptable. He actually becomes a decent, friendly and helpful person.

The problem is that now he's become a decent, friendly and helpful person, he starts receiving prositivity again. Which triggers his ego to act up all over again. Some crazy vicious cycle.

He hates my guts because I constantly point out his terrible behavior to everyone but at the same time seems to desperately want to be my friend and at times has been very clingy with me. He very desperately wants to be friends with everyone. But he treats everyone like shit when he feels good about himself. 

I've resorted to absolutely ignoring him and avoiding him but at the same time i feel bad that im doing it. He's a very lonely and sad person.

329,"Well pretty much exactly as the title says...

Even now there’s a part of me that is scared they will find this account and know it’s me... I’m going to try my best to explain my issue without giving too many specifics.

Heres the background: friend dates scumbag, scumbag does scumbag things, friend gets crushed, friend takes him back, I did what I thought was right and tell her I was worried for her and I don’t trust scumbag, friend kicks me out of circle, I turn to reddit for advice (didn’t want anyone we knew talking about her, and here it’s Anon and usually unbiased and I’ve gotten decent advice before), friend and her boyfriend find my account, next thing I know I get these comments from a “lurker” saying how I was crazy and had no friends, no boyfriend and I should go back where I came from (I’m not from this town), friend says it’s not her but it was oddly specific and I have a gut feeling... 

I have been hurt a lot in the past. Years and years of trying to be close to someone and they shit on me. I try to help people and I get burnt. I try to be better and I get kicked down. I know how my friend is, I’ve heard her talk about people before, there is no doubt in my mind that she has gone and talked about people about me and made me be the bitch in this... yes, literally for saying I think she deserves better than this guy. 

Now, I feel like I’m being watched all the time on all social media. Like she, her boyfriend and all of our friends (or perhaps ex-friends) are watching just waiting to talk about me later. I’m tired of getting stepped on by mean people and catering to everyone else in my life. I want to be selfish and take care of me for a while, but I just have this feeling that there will be more drama if I do. I want to learn to be more positive, secure in myself, and happy with who I am, but I feel like they’re just waiting to jump on me and call me fake and a liar for even trying. I want to have these meaningful friendships with genuinely good people, but I feel like someone is just going to come out of the blue and say I’m trying too hard. I want to improve in my spiritual life, but I feel like they’re going to call me a hypocrite because I’m not perfect by any means... Honestly, a part of me is thinking of moving... Pathetic, I know, I just want to be somewhere where I can be happy without being criticized all the damn time. I try to be a very open hearted and loving person, but these past few months have just made me want to be closed off to everyone. People just hurt me anyway..

330,"I've been renting a private apartment from an older couple for like 10 months. There are 3 rooms (each go for equal price) but since landlords have trouble/don't bother finding any tenants, I get to live by myself which is pretty sweet.

Anyways, I'll be away for 2-3 months but am planning on going back here and live here after summer, but do you think it would be a dickish thing of me to tell my landlords that since I'll be away for 2-3 months I won't pay for that period? (Note: I don't have any contract and no depositum, because apartment is pretty low standard)

Is there maybe a way of asking them nicely and not sound like a greedy jerk?

It's unlikely they'll find any other tenants because they told me that they have trouble finding ones, since there are so many people renting houses in the area etc. I think they even stopped looking for people because they kind of gave up.

How can I approach them with this issue?

332,"The thought of ending our relationship has been on my mind a lot lately, and I want the thoughts to be gone. 
We have been together for 10 months now and everything has been up and down(just like any other relationship). As time passes, there are small things about him that are starting to annoy me, and I don't know how to go about handling them. To begin, when we argue, the blame usually(always) gets thrown on me... Even when it's not even my fault! Of course, I TRY and do my best to understand both sides of our fights and arguments. If I'm not completely at fault, I still try to figure out what I can do to avoid such instances from happening in the future and how I can make things better for the both of us. If he's wrong, he will NOT admit it! Even if it's obvious that he did wrong, my partner will completely ignore his faults and throw the blame on me and what I did wrong to lead up to the current situation. 
Here's an example: The other day he was grabbing his meal for work out of the refrigerator, but notices there was a tupperware of food sitting outside on the counter. He automatically assumes it was me who moved the tupperware from the fridge and proceeds to go into an argument about the situation. Mind you, there are two other young individuals whom live in his home as well( bf's nephew who is 20 &amp; bf's daughter who is 10). I argue back and tell him, that I didn't go in the refrigerator yet and to ask his nephew if he did it... My boyfriend ignored me. I told him not to assume that I did something when it wasn't even me who had done it to begin with. He still ignored me and changed the subject. I called him out for doing that. 
He can't accept being wrong sometimes and its very annoying. It's the same thing when it comes to his daughter as well... He tries to push her on me sometimes(responsibilities), and tries to make me responsible for her. She's only 10 and she lives with him part-time(3 days), and stays with her mom for most of the week. 
I understand that his daughter comes before I do. I completely get that. I just don't feel that the responsibility of a child needs to be rolled over to me. I've babysat, I've taken/picked her up from school, I've picked her up from her grandparents, etc. I've done a lot for this young girl and I feel like I have the responsibility of a parent, which I do not want. It's even gotten to the point where my boyfriend won't even ask me sometimes to help out; he will just assume. Example: ""Brittany's mom is going out of town for a few days, you'll need to babysit for me while I'm at work."" I don't think that's right, but if I say something or don't feel it's right, I get ignored and he gets upset with me for small periods of time. He'll even bring up how i'll do favors for my friends, but not for him(which is wrong). 
It's just little things such as these two instances that make me want to end it all, but we do have good memories, good times, and good things that we both do and enjoy together. But seriously, am I over thinking this situation or is my gut telling me the right thing? Please help. 

TLDR: I've been having thoughts of breaking up with my boyfriend for a few weeks now, but I don't know if its really the right thing to do. He can't accept being wrong when we have arguments/always blames me, and he pushes the responsibility of his 10 Y/O daughter on me sometimes without asking, and it's becoming annoying. ",21May2018,4

346,"I wouldn't called myself depressed or anything, to explain my state let me dive deeper into what happens to me:

Almost every morning I just wake up without any will for school, all I want is just to do something else. I wake up, I dress myself check my phone eat etc. all with disgust, I barely eat anything actually, every time I check my phone I enjoy memes I watch but whenever I look at the clock my mood falls completely off, seeing I don't have much time before I need to leave.

I barely force myself to leave the house. On my road to school I daydream about nice things I could do or about subjects I like, completely forgetting about school. When I get in class I have the wish to focus on the lesson but my mind is just telling me not to. Everything is boring, uninteresting, if I don't fake the fact that I am focused on the lesson my teacher complains and depending on who could put me a bad grade.. In the end I start looking in empty spaces thinking about anything else rather than the lesson. I just don't want to hear any sound from the teacher, or write something down. 

It gets so bad to the point where I am dead. I can't really respond to people properly, I end up losing focus onto small things, sometimes when I feel like this and I have a test I just leave the test empty, because I just don't want to think about what is in it.

It's ironic because I am at the top of my class sort of statistically, I am in the top 10 of the class out of 30 people and my grades are decent, but I feel I will drop out very soon and end at the bottom.

When I feel like it I can be an amazing student, when I feel like it every test feels easy and fun to complete, classes don't worn me out this much, I manage to find happiness into smaller things and continue my day...

But most days are just me being dead. There are several days where I find happiness just by my fake figured world, or days where I am happy just not listening to anything around me. The reason why this heavily bothers me is because there are people in my class that are everyday happy and willing to live and to enjoy anything around them, nothing could make them worn down. No matter how much sleep they get or how their lives really are they all focus on the lessons and feel alive. I only feel alive when I manage to talk to others and make them laugh, otherwise I am dead.

**So I tried fixing myself by doing:**

* I tried to sleep more/less. More because more sleep means more energy and less because sometimes when you sleep too much you feel like waking up from a coma and you need several hours to be awake. No effect. I feel the same. Sometimes I can't even try to sleep longer because going to sleep sooner feels like a wasted time I could've used to make something entertaining. 

* I noticed I can wake up alive and feel good for the rest of the day whenever I know the day tomorrow is gonna be good for me. For instance when I went to my school trip I slept 3 hours because retarded room mates but I stayed awake at my max for 12 hours until I collapsed. Same in the weekends, no matter how much I sleep I wake up decently happy and ready to go. But I can't fake myself into waking for school like this. It just doesn't work.

* I've tried making fun things at school. Whenever class starts they all fade away with my enjoyment.

This really bothers me. I hate the fact that I can't seem to enjoy any day I go to school, every morning I wake up stressed and depressed when I don't have real depression. I feel depressed when I think about school but leave that aside and I can find happiness in a few moments. And the thing I hate the most is that there are others around me able to somehow pass this. I envy them. They aren't amazing humans, the people I envy have shit personalities and don't think straight or realistically, that type of people, but they still fucking enjoy themselves. They don't feel ANYTHING.

I currently go to school with a relatively small class, we see each other M\-F for about 6\-8 hours a day. A lot of us are hopeful and aspiring pre\-med students too, who are in this years cycle. While there are lots of nice people in my program, there are a few that aren't, particularly one.

Let's call him P. P is one of the rudest people I've ever met in my life. He's selfish. He's arrogant. He deliberately goes out of the way to exert that he has more money, more power, more everything than anyone. We went out for lunch together with another one of our friends, who decided to go with a cheap option of food because he was trying to save money after seeing the thing he wanted was too expensive. P took the liberty of specifically ordering the item that our other friend wanted and announced that he was getting it just to rub it in friend's face that he could afford to eat it.

But that isn't just it. He's smart, which I admire and respect. He brings interesting ideas to the table. But he's condescending for no reason. He feels that the individuals who have mental health concerns in our program shouldn't be allowed to pursue the degree that we're all studying for. He dehumanizes disability and puts people down below him. But he has explicitly stated that he solely intends on going to medical school to make money. P's dad is a psychiatrist who has some pretty shady prescribing behaviors, and I've heard P casually refer to future patients as money makers. He's manipulative enough to seem like a decent person and was able to get into medical school and his behaviors have gotten worse. This person is just awful. I'd be terrified if I were a patient in his hands, but now I'm wondering if I should do something about it, like email the school he's going to medical school for with screenshots of his behavior. I know I'm being nosey, but that patient could be anyone. That could be my brother or my mom or any one of my friends. He doesn't care about any of them, he just cares about getting their money so he can get a flash car to show off. What should I do?",21May2018,1

Now, over a month later, he emails me saying that management has requested the $60 fee for running my credit report. Is this ridiculous? I emailed him back explaining why I thought it was and he said he understood but that ""he'd rather not make this an issue for me"" which sounds to me like a threat. Is there anything they can do? I realize they have all our credit info now, but honestly, this is the craziest thing I've ever heard. We didn't sign anything, we didn't talk to anyone other than the agent.

My parents drink. I don't know if it's enough for them to be considered alcoholics so I'm asking for advice. No one has labeled them as alcoholics. No one has told them they should slow down or quit. They don't do anything to stop. 

They drink every night. There's usually always a drink before dinner. Then a few after. Together, they go through like two bottles of wine a night. That's after their usually martini. Wine, prosecco, margaritas, rum and coke, gin and tonic, you name it, they probably drink it. 

Whenever my mom accomplishes something physical, like doing yard work, she drinks a few beers. Understandable, she worked all day. But she's not allowed to drink beer. Or much alcohol. Her doctor put her on a diet of no carbs and if she wanted to drink, she could only have ONE glass of red wine. 

She goes through bottles of wine when she's by herself. I don't know how much my dad drinks because he's always away on business trips.  

My mom has also started to I guess drink and drive. On three occasions, while I was in the car, she's had a beer before or while driving. Today she did the same thing. 

I know she can't get drunk on one beer but I mean, she already has a DWI. Both of my parents do. I was in the backseat of the car when they were arrested. 

During party's, they drink a lot. Yesterday at a city celebration they each downed like nine bottles of beer. That's after my grandfather's 70th birthday party where, after my grandparents left, they preceded to get drunk and come home at 3 am. 

Just a few years ago, my mom, aunt and uncles were eating dinner in town. I was exhausted and ready to go home. No one wanted to leave so they told me to suck it up because they wanted to have a few drinks. So I suck it up. 1am rolls around and we're the only ones awake in town. My mom is smoking with these guys on the street and my aunt is fighting with my cousin. My drunk uncle took me and my cousin home. My mom walked in at like 3 am and she didn't know where my aunt was. She had to call her dad at 2am to come get her in the middle of the night. 

This probably sounds small to you guys but this shit has fucked me up. I can't sleep at night because I'm always thinking of this. And I have to bottle it up because I can't talk to anyone near me about this. No one stands up to this behavior because my parents tell me to shut up about it and not tell anyone. My brother doesn't even seem to care any more- which I mean, he shouldn't cause all this shit happens when I'm around. I want to tell my extended family but I can't because all it will do is cause a huge fight and at the end of the day, I'll still go home with my parents and my mom will make my life hell because she's a narcissistic asshole. 

I don't know what to do anymore because I'm just sad now. And whenever they drink, I don't give a fuck but when I see alcohol, with any one, I get all anxious and paranoid and I don't want to live my life avoiding places or people because I can't stand the sight of alcohol. 

It's gotten to a point where I don't care what happens to them as long as it stops affecting me. I don't care if they get a divorce or kill each other, as long as I'm not there. 

I've brought their drinking up several times but my mom tells me it's none of my business and I shouldn't concern myself. Whenever I talk to my dad about it he just goes 'yeah, we should probably stop,' and then proceeds to open another bottle of wine and forgets all about it.

 My mother denies that they're alcoholics, that my grandparents are alcoholics (which they are, my grandfather goes through a bottle of rum like every two days; he's constantly drunk) and that they only like to drink cause it feels good. 

I feel so alone right now. Please, give advice.",21May2018,2

368,"I've dealt with depression since I was about 11, I'm now 20. Several things contributed to it, including feeling like my parents disregarded/invalidated me and a secret internet relationship around age 13 that may have been emotionally and/or sexually abusive. They found out about that and ended it, I got in trouble, and we never talked about it again. I still don't know how much they know. If my parents knew at any point that I was depressed, they never talked to me about it. My sister had a similar experience (eating disorders they didn't see) and when they thought my brother was depressed in high school, they really freaked out and went into super-helicopter-protective-emotional mode. My mom especially.

I think my parents mean well and they're good people, but I have always considered my friends closer family than blood relations. Two of them I trust are strongly suggesting therapy, but if I go, especially while I'm home for the summer, I'll end up having to tell my parents why. I feel like if I say ""I'd rather not talk about that yet"" it'll just freak them out, but I also don't know how to tell them I've been depressed for nearly ten years and they've done nothing.

I fully intend to find, plan, and pay for this all myself. I work for my dad's company right now, which is how I have insurance, but that's the only level of involvement I plan for them to have, and that's only until I get a different job. I just want it to be my decision and on my terms.

I'm a 20 y/o male college student in a bit of a pickle right about now. About a year ago, I hooked up with a certain female we'll call Jessica for the sake of storytime. She was in my Calc class and I asked a homework question, and she immediately proceeded to send nudes and silly me decided, screw it, I'll smash. I was in the process of getting over a long time ex girlfriend and was dealing with feelings of depression and loneliness, and thought that some action would get my mind off of everything.
That was a bad move. A horrible, terrible, bad move. 
Ever since then, this girl has harassed me nonstop. She will never leave me alone. She harassed me by text, Insta DMs, facebook, the whole nine yards, asking to ""lick my body all over"" and ""date me"" even when I say NO a thousand times. Naturally, I blocked her on everything. That didn't work. She used alternate phone numbers and called me daily, fake insta and facebook accounts to sexually harass me from, saying she will never give up no matter what I do. This girl is literally insane and no matter how many accounts or numbers I block, new ones pop up every day. She tried stealing my facebook account and was almost successful, god knows how. I don't know what to do at this point, I'm legit scared she'll hurt herself or make false claims to get back at me for ignoring her. Should I file a police report? Report it to our university?

374,"Hey Gang. My first time trying something like this.

I'll give you the background first:
I've dated this girl (let's call her Jess) for a year and we're both madly in love. Like it couldn't be going any better. I'm 21, she's 19 and in her last year of high school. She lives with her younger brother, mother and step-dad. Her step-dad has his own daughter too, but she lives in another house. However, Jess's bio father has remarried and has 3 kids with his new wife. So a pretty confusing family situation.

I eventually met her father, but didn't quite like the way he treated her and even how he spoke in front of his kids (they're only 4 and 6). He only seems to want Jess around so that she can babysit his kids and he can do his own thing. He's that stereotypical douchebag, type father who no bf really wants to meet. I could elaborate more, but just know he's not a good person. He's not exactly evil, but he's definitely not a good person. Drinks a little too much, is undermining to his wife/kids and is all-round judgemental prick. Something he did also caused the divorce with his ex-wife (don't know what though).

My gf and her brother visits their father roughly every 2nd weekend. She openly speaks about how her parents divorce (she was 9 when it happened) messed her up in many ways. I always felt like there was more to it and she recently opened up about it. She revealed some fucked up things her father did. It's not recurring or periodical abuse, but these are the only instances I know about.

Instance 1:
Soon after the divorce her father lived alone. Jess (9 y/o) and her bro would visit him at his apartment. Every night he would take a shower just after dinner. He would dry himself, but walk butt-naked to the living room and watch TV with the 2 kids for hours without getting dressed. Naturally, she told me how uncomfortable and awkward she felt. She told her mother one day and she flipped out and phoned the dad. It never happened or got mentioned again - he also never offered any apology but rather pretended like it didn't happen.

Instance 2:
Shortly after his remarriage, Jess (12 y/o) and her father visited his friend one night. Late in the evening, when he was extremely drunk and the other people had left the room, her father her and kissed her. Tongue down her throat for a good while, grabbing her forcefully despite her crying and struggling. They left shortly thereafter. Same deal: no apology and no mention of it at all.

Instance 3:
One weekend whilst staying at her father, some guys broke into the kitchen adjacent to Jess's (15 y/o) room. Most likely some troubled teens messing about. She didn't wake up, but her father burst into her room convinced she sneaked some boys into the house. He went total apeshit and raged at her. He grabbed her phone and stormed off. He came back to demand she unlock it so he could check her messages. At this time he freaked out even more and grabbed a nearby bat and started beating her. He accused her of letting guys in the house and lying to him (she genuinely had nothing to do with it). When he went through her phone he saw that weeks ago she had sexted a guy and beat her even more. Jess went to her mom first thing in the morning. At the time she was seeing a councilor at school who noticed the bruising and tried to push her to report it, but she declined. Again, no apology or mention of it ever again.

Instance 4:
This actually just came up as a casual topic of conversation and was not one of the instances she declared as ""abusive"". Jess hasn't even realised it's obviously indicative of some abusive behaviour. Just a few weeks ago she was at her father's place with his family and her bro. Again he had a bit to drink. Her bro (13 y/o) and his step sister (6 y/o) always go at each other in competition for their father's attention. This night they repeatedly went at it annoying everyone. Eventually father flipped his shit and went into one of his swearing rages. He gave both kids a few solid hits to the head before storming off. Now I know it's not the most hardcore abuse, but the way it was described is definitely abusive in nature.

Jess says she loves her father, but she realises that he's not very good for her. She has a relationship with him more because she feels obligated to because she is pressured to go visit him. She went through periods after the above instances where she wouldn't visit him for 6 moths to a year. I am adamant that he is extremely toxic, abusive and undeserved of a relationship with her. Trust me, the time I have been in his company is enough to realise that he sees Jess and her bro more of an administrative issue than anything else. I fear for her safety because he is the type of person who does real damage when he is upset with someone. At the moment, he is perfectly happy with Jess, but that could change instantly.

Here's my predicament: do I convince her to rid of the relationship she has with her father? More bad than any good has come of it and these are only the events she's been willing to talk about up until now. I can't help but sense there are other events. The financial support he gives is also limited and now that she'll be moving on to college and working part time it is not needed. I guess I just need advice on how to guide her to cutting him out of her life (without pressuring her to do that, but leaving the decision up to her).

375,"In high school. Gay male. Met a friend at the start of this year. Call her Gloria. Became best friends with her. She put all her trust in me, but I fucked up a few times. I'll list them here:

1) A dude, call him Alex, tried to sexually assault Gloria repeatedly. She gave permission for me to tell his girlfriend after some talks (another friend), but without saying Gloria's name. Friend name-dropped Gloria (guessed because of talking to Alex), like ""so what did Gloria say Alex did again?"", and I kept talking. That confirmed to her that it was in fact Gloria, and I couldn't hide it after that, so I admitted it. Gloria was hurt.

2) Gloria's other friend agreed that she was oozing darkness. After spending hours with her every day, I slowed down for two weeks, one of which I was on vacation. Returned her texts, but I didn't initiate. She was aware I was with my other friends at some points. Asked if I was hurting her and she denied it, but later told me she was hurt.

3) Worst one here. Regret it profusely. Gloria has bulimia and body dysmorphia. Told my sister and my mom about it one night and felt awful, so I told her. This was when she was recovering from me not talking to her. She said I was on thin ice.

After some time, she said it wasn't working out anymore. That our friendship became a trainwreck. I agreed. We stopped talking in classes. Throughout all of this, a boy asked her out. I watched their relationship develop from her saying he was ugly and she didn't even really like him to them getting closer than her and I and him cursing me out when I did anything wrong. He more or less replaced me.

Eventually, we began talking a little bit, and she would mention things that were personal, so I thought she wants to be friends again. We joke around still but sometimes she seems put off by me. 

Thing is, she has me removed from all social media. Uninvited me to her party a while ago that already happened. Should I reach out to her or does it seem done?

382,"Hey all,

I’m unhappy with how my life is playing out, and I know I’m the only one who can change that, but I have no idea how to start.

First off, I hate my job. Everyone says that, right? I’m a domestic cleaner who earns a couple pennies above minimum wage per hour. Recently my hours have been cut so I’m earning £140 a week. After I take rent, driving lessons, food shopping money out, I’m left with about £50, which I’m trying to save to get out of here and into my own place. I want to look for another job, but I don’t know where to start with *that*. My job isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s monotonous, the hours are erratic and there aren’t enough of them anymore. The main reasons I’m staying in this job are 1) I don’t really have many skills or experience at age 24 that are useful in a workplace environment. And 2) I’m FtM. My current job knows this and they’re cool with it. A lot of my colleagues are in the LGBT+ community in one way or another, including my bossman. I think it’s the fear of the unknown and having to explain to a new workplace that I know my gender doesn’t match my birth certificate but this is what I am, it doesn’t affect how I do my job at all, but I like to be open. 

Second, I’m severely depressed. I’ve been to counselling, CBT therapy, been on several types of medication to no effect. I manage to get through each day, mostly, but everything is a struggle.  Part of it is probably down to my gender issues, but I’ve been depressed a lot longer than I knew I was transgender. My family doesn’t help this. I live at home because of financial reasons, and I get told a lot, quite firmly, that because I was born female, I am female and I’m never going to be a man. Also that my depression is all in my head (which, Yeah, it is. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist). I used to have a cutting problem and when I did, I was told that if I wanted to do that, I should do it properly, go into a dark alley and bleed out. And honestly, I don’t remember the last time a day went by where I didn’t cry about how much I wish I was dead and yet I’m too much of a coward to do anything about it. If I try mentioning I feel suicidal, I’m told to think about how it would affect them and to not be so selfish. Maybe I am. I’ve taken up self-harming again, but in the form of deliberately causing bruises instead of cuts. My arm has a huge black patch of bruises at the moment, but I need to hurt. It’s something I have control over.

I used to have a list of things I wanted to achieve but now I’ve lost the will to do anything. I’ve become a grade-A under achiever. I’m still learning to drive over a year after starting. I’ve failed my test twice, but if I don’t pass, I can’t get more hours in my current job. 

My life is a rut and I’m stagnating and it just feels like there’s no point to going on because the rest of my life is going to be like this. I know only I can change it, but it feels like there’s no way to.

TL;DR, I’m an under-achieving piece of crap and don’t know how to change.

387,"So this happened 6ish months ago and I've completely left it alone, I just started thinking about it again and I'm still confused. 

========
So I was ran into a girl that I knew in junior high (we're now early 20's) and we did the ""date each other"" thing that did really go anywhere and kind of just fizzled out because she moved and things are just awkward at that age anyways. We stayed friends on facebook but again awkward age didn't really result in long term connections.  

========
ANYWAYS, we had a small conversation about where we were in life and what we were planning on doing. She was the one that came up to me and even introduced her friend to me (Whom I've never seen) like so ""Hey (friends name) this is (my name)""! So her friend knew about me enough to associate my name to one person. A little bit later our conversation continues on facebook for a little bit. Things didn't get ""flirty"" per say but there was more of a connection than if I were to talk to one of my regular classmates. Next day I message her a ""How's your sunday going?"" And it was read within the hour and that's where it ends.

====
I understand that she isn't obligated to anything, I'm just confused. If she didn't introduce her friend to me in a manner that would suggest that she talks about me frequently enough for her friend to know who I am then I wouldn't think anything about it. But the fact that her friend knew about me, who hasn't been in her life for 6-7 years, made me confused as to why should would talk about me but then not even want to talk. Or READ the message and never reply, which just seems kind of weird.

I am now struggling with figuring out what it is I want to do and how to pay my bills. I keep blowing through my budget mostly with food \(restaurants, binge eating\) and impulsive/compulsive shopping. I am venting here mostly to put these thoughts down somewhere instead of watching/hearing the endless loop inside my head. I recognize that having multiple streams of income would be a wise idea but I can’t think of what those could be for me. I think back to when I was a child/teen and how much i loved to write poetry/fiction, create, make art.  I know it’s my limited thinking but at times I feel like I don’t have much to offer that people would want to pay for. I want to help others become healthier in mind, body, and spirit, but I think the belief that “there’s no way I can survive/sustain myself by doing that” is holding me back.

401,"I always hated living with my parents. They were ultra-controling and it felt like dying to live there. After finishing university I decided to go for a risky move and move out. Where I live it's hard to move out of your parents apartment and people rarely do it before getting married (and even after getting married not everyone does). There is this common practice here to live in (for a lack of a better word) dormitories for grownups and families. It's almost a shit hole, but I can't afford anything better now. Right now it's spend 10% of my salary on my living arrangements. The cheapest better option is going to cost me about 50% of my salary. So I would say moving out is not an option. 

So, I obviously have a roommate. He pretends to be all friendly when we talk. But he constantly eats my food behind my back (I spend almost a half of my salary on food so it takes some toll on my budget) and doesn't clean after himself in the bathroom. He constantly tells me how ""we should clean the kitchen area sometimes"" but he doesn't give a single flying fuck about me cleaning the bathroom. I tried to call him out about the food several times, but he went all Shaggy and told me it wasn't him, like he was deeply offended and confused, even though I know *for a fact* he stole from me. Today I tried to be more assertive. He took a godawful dump this morning and didn't clean up the insides of the toilet (the shit was everywhere). When I confronted him, he (no doy) told me he doesn't know anything about it and that he always cleans after himself. I told him ""dude, you need to cleanup after yourself, you're a grown-ass man"". He got pissed at me, after a few minutes of talking he finally stand up from his bed and goes to the toilet to look at it (all the while telling me *I'm* the crazy stupid assholefor accusing him, and that it was actually my shit and I'm trying to ""frame"" him for some reason I guess), wiggles this flimsy toilet brush for maybe 5 seconds and tells me there's nothing he can do now cause it's dried, he'll do it later after it soaks up a bit (spoiler alert - he won't).

I'm giving up. My work life is crap, my social and love life is in the gutter, living situation is a shit show, I can't go back to my parents, I can't talk to anyone, I might have to kill myself soon to avoid a worst fate (not exactly related to what's going on here) and I have absolutely no one to talk to about it.

Some back context for you, I'm 23 years old and my dad left when I was 10, he cheated on my mum with 4 women and when he left he moved straight in with one of the women he cheated on my mum with. I've never really been close to my dad but he's always done this thing where he pretends we're  a lot closer than we are. 

He used to hit me a lot when I was younger and I'm his only daughter (i would say child but who knows) there were times it was hard. I'm not going in to too much detail but just to give you an idea of things he strangled me on the floor when I was 7 because I was stood infront of the tv. I've had counselling because of all of this and I have met someone since who's helping me get through a lot of shit I've had in my life. 

He has been with a few women since leaving here and he's now been with the woman he's with now for a few years and last year announced they were getting married. When he told me I was happy for him but as it's gone on I've been getting a lot more stressed, I don't get on with my family at all on my dad's side and I haven't seen most of them since I was 11. 

I originally agreed to go however since then circumstances have changed. Myself and my dad have not spoke properly in a while. I last saw him 3 months ago for the first time in 2 months and his future wife knew I was seeing him but proceeded to go out and get drunk and call my dad asking for a lift which he agreed to do. Whenever he's been messaging me all he's said is ""how are you? My wedding is soon"" 

I had a breakdown a few weeks ago regarding the whole thing stress wise as I've also had a lot more going on in my life and I think its best for me and my health not to go. However he messaged me last night and asked if everything is still okay for the wedding. I've not replied yet he also messaged me and asked am I still going and then tried calling me and when I didn't answer tried calling my boyfriend.

I'm at a bit of a loss of what to do. Emotionally wise I am drained and stressed, my boyfriend has offered to speak to him and say that I'm ill which is why we won't be going.

I did really well in high school and had high expectations since then. Unfortunately, in the few years that I've been in college, I have constantly struggled to do well. I've had to retake at least one class every semester and I've always had to take summer classes since I graduated high school due to me having to retake classes. At the end of every semester, when the final grades are posted, it always ends up with her being incredibly angry at me and disappointed with me because I've never passed all my classes. 

This just happened again about 30 minutes ago when I found out that I got a 69.97% in a class that I needed to get a 70% in. So now I have to retake the class online over the summer. What makes it worse is that this will be my third time taking this class. I'm taking it at community college so I know i'll get an A or a B in the class this time but it doesn't help much seeing how angry she got. She refuses to talk to me unless it's her yelling at me about how she doesn't understand why I can't just pass the class and telling me how she's tired of paying for these classes over and over again.
 
I gave her all the money I had on me (about 1/4 of the full price of the summer class) and told her I will work as many extra shifts as I can and pay for the class myself. She told me she doesn't want my money and, after I said I'll take care of it, she said, ""No you won't. We will just like we always have to do"". At the end of last semester I was put on medication to help with depression and that greatly improved my ability to get good grades this semester, I just did poorly on the final exam which made me get a D in this class. I don't even know what to do anymore. 

The weight of being a constant disappointment has taken more and more of a toll on me as the years go on and I can't even tell her that because she won't care. She'll tell me that if I would just pass the classes then it wouldn't be a problem and she's right. But the constant pressure I always feel from all of this makes it even harder to do well in school because I feel like no matter what I do, I'll never live up to her standards. 

I'm sorry if this is all just rambling. I'm very shaky right now since this just happened not long ago. If anyone can tell me what I need to do to help smooth things over with her or to help me deal with the weight of all this it would be really appreciated. ",21May2018,1

A few days ago, he saw on the schedule I was working st a different store, so he stopped by and no matter how many times I tried to say “hey dude I’m locking up” or “hey, store is closing, what are you doing after” he stayed for three hours and wouldn’t leave when I was closing, only kept getting in my way to help when he wasn’t even clocked in to try and take me out after I repeatedly said no. Then he tried to walk me home even though I kept saying I didn’t want to hang until I physically had to walk away in the opposite direction. It’s hard trying to be “mean” since we do work in the same company and have events to go to together.

Someone sent out an email asking for coverage, and since I need the $$$ I picked up the shift. It wasn’t until the second email after I agreed that I was informed who my supervisor was. It was that dude.

I don’t wanna work with him. Even that day i was closing there were things I couldn’t do because he was just hanging around checking me out. I don’t wanna have to deal with that for 7 hours. I feel like I can’t back out of the shift though. Help?!

So title says it all but for more information, I attended school at a university to earn my degree in Biology but after the first year, I had zero motivation and zero drive. My grades sucked, I didn't know what I wanted, and ultimately I didn't want to be there. I was struggling with depression and had just moved 800 miles from my family. So I dropped out after finishing my spring semester. 

Naturally my parents were pissed so to compromise with them, I began attending school at a local community college. Same thing happened. I had no motivation, my grades still sucked, and eventually I dropped out. 

Basically, at that time I didn't want to be in school and the only thing that was ""pushing"" me was the pressure from my family and peers and obviously, that didn't go too far. 

Since then, its been two years. I have a decent job, I'm on medication for my depression, and I finally feel like college is something I want to do and not something I'm being pressured to do.. I want to earn a BA degree and make a living but I feel a little stuck due to the mistakes I have made.

I am a 12th grader in my school, which is the final year. In just 4 days, the graduation ceremony will be held before exams start next week.

Here's the deal - you will not be allowed to graduate unless you have finished all the necessary assignments and don't have any negative grades. Unfortunately for me, this final semester has been among the most hectic in terms of real life stuff getting in the way, as well as depression too, so I was unable to get every positive grade and every assignment.

With this knowledge, I'm about to fail school as a whole and I'm just at a loss for what to do. What CAN I do?

Yes, I've tried asking the teachers what I can do and tried reasoning and working something out, but they all tell me that I should've done my assignments on time and don't care about listening to my side of the story. While frustrating, I understand why. Trying to work something out with my teachers has been a no go for the last month and a half, actually.

That's why I'm turning to here. I'm just so at a loss as to what I can do that I just don't even know. Is there anything I can do at all? It just feels like I hit a complete roadblock, a dead end if you will.

So I met this girl about a year ago while helping a friend, we didn't talk a lot over the 4 days we worked together but I talked to her the most out of anyone there, and I think we hit it off.

Even though I kind of fucked it up by not talking to her enough at the end of the project I got her number, (first number I'd ever got) and started texting her a bit,

I asked her out pretty quickly and she said: ""she would like to get to know me better in group situations before, but that she was flattered."" This seemed reasonable to me since we really hadn't gotten to know each other very well, and her family from what I gathered was super religious. (we're late high school age)

We texted a bit more, and we almost worked on a movie together but nothing really came of it, honestly, I felt like I kind of fucked it up do to inexperience and dragged out the texting a bit. We really share no social circles, so a group hang out never worked out.

We had not talked until recently when I was invited to a play she was in, I asked her if I should go kind of playfully, and she said (very enthusiastically, at least as far as I could tell over text) Yes.

I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing and the play was actually really fun, but when I talked to her afterward it was super brief and she pretty much showed no interested from what I could tell. But of course she had just been acting for 2 hours so it could mean nothing.

So my question is, is it worth it to try one more time to get the concrete answer? I'm like 90% sure it will be no but I don't really know what I have to lose besides my dignity and pride? I don't mind getting rejected at all, but getting rejected by the same person twice feels pretty bad.

TLDR: Logically I can't think of a reason not to confirm she isn't interested by asking her out again, but it feels like a bad idea because I'm 90% sure the answer will be no.

424,"I’m 21 years old and I am extremely depressed. No therapist will see me as they say my problems aren’t severe enough. I don’t have anyone else to go to and I’m too caught up in the situation to help myself. 

Growing up I had severe Aspergers. Having Aspergers as a child pretty much meant that I would be extremely socially awkward and have no friends as a result. On top of that the only family that I had was my mother who was extremely abusive and neglectful so for the most part my childhood was spent alone and in fear. 

It was around my 17th birthday when I met this girl. We met on the internet and after a month of chatting we met up. From the start we hit it off. I was awkward, she was awkward, there was no pressure to not be awkward, it was great. Little did I know though, unlike me, this girl had friends - lots of friends. She introduced me to them and oddly enough they liked me (so she said). The girl and I started dating and I became really close friends with her friends. From that point on I was no longer alone, I had friends - lots of friends and I never wanted to be alone again. 

Through being friends with all these new people and constantly hanging out with them I was able to strengthen my social skills and put the awkwardness behind me. 

2 years went on as such and eventually the girl and I did end up separating. I felt as though her and I were becoming different people. I was curious about what was out there and felt as though she was holding me back. I truly did love her but I knew breaking up was the best decision for me and that is what I did. 

So at this point in the story I am 19. After the break up I do miss her a bunch but overall I am feeling good and mostly focussed on seeing what the world has to offer. A month goes on and I realize that I am gradually becoming depressed. I feel unsupported and alone despite having lots of friends. I think maybe it’s time to find a new girlfriend and so that is what I do. 

I meet this new girl and it’s bad from the start. We try to make it work for a month or so but it just didn’t work and she ended up breaking up with me. 

After that relationship I begin feeling the same feelings of being alone and unsupported so I go and find another relationship and we end up breaking up. Long story short this cycle continued for 2 years straight with me being in and out of 5 relationships. 

Through those 2 years I became obsessed with finding the “one” and in the process completely neglected all of my friends and promptly lost them all. I tried to make contact with them recently but they don’t want any part of me. 

Now, current day, I am 21 years old. No friends and am getting close to another girl. I do not want another girlfriend but I am too afraid of being alone to stop what I am doing. It’s like I have a deep rooted fear from my childhood of being alone that I can’t get rid of and I do not know how to get over it. Does anyone have experience with getter over a fear of being alone?

427,"The PE teacher my brother has at his middle school seems to be a very mean teacher. My brother hurt his ankle a week ago so he couldn't do PE. But today, when my brother was sitting innocently, the teacher came up to him and said to do 200 situps and 100 pushups for no reason. It was out of nowhere so my brother said his mother told him to not do anything in PE. At that, the teacher became very angry and told him to call his mother. Unfortunately, my mother wasn't available, and my brother had to do the dreadful workout. Because he hurt his leg, the teacher told him to do with one leg which makes the situation even more stupid. My brpther wasn't allowed to rest for one bit. My mother heard the story after school so she went to meet the principal. Originally, the teacher said to do the 300 total pushups and situps for a week. The principal gave my brother permission to do nothing in PE. After that, my mother had to pick me up at high school so she couldn't do much more. This is very ridiculous to me and since my brother still had to do 200 situps and 100 pushups, I want to report to some place and get the teacher fired or something.

I have also admitted I was interested in her multiple

429,"A couple of months ago I went on a few dates with this woman. We didn’t click, and things starting coming up about her that gave me an uneasy feeling. Just certain habits of her past &amp; present, including excessive drug use. When I finally saw her house it was a complete wreck. Trash on every square foot of ground, hoarded trinkets, molding dishes stacked high in the sink. The entire thing smelled densely and exclusively of cigarette smoke &amp; cat urine.

Anyways, I told her I didn’t want to continue dating. I was polite about it. I just said something about she seemed perfectly nice and all, but I didn’t think it would quite work out. 

A few days later she very politely messaged my phone saying she understood &amp; that she would like to be friends if that was possible. My dumbass agreed to this at the time. I hung out with her for a couple hours soon after that, and went home. 

I woke up to my phone ringing, finding that I had a string of text messages berating me for not picking her up from a bar at 1 am. I had no idea she was at a bar. I didn’t see any of her texts. I had been asleep for quite a while. I would’ve been happy to come pick her up had I not needed to sleep. I listened to three voicemails where she very cruelly attacked my character, claiming that since I didn’t answer her calls that I “dont value human life” and also that I “deserve to die in a car wreck”. 

I told her to get an Uber, and to please leave me alone. 

The next day, and the next few following days, I received texts by the hundreds. Just one after another. Apologies, small details about her day, requests to please forgive her. On and on. I would reply very occasionally, telling her to please just leave me alone. I mentioned that it was fine what she said to me, but that I would appreciate it if she would just forget about it &amp; forget about me. 

Since then I have blocked her number (she never stopped texting me). 

I made the mistake in our first date of letting her know where I live. Since I’ve blocked her number, she has came to my house multiple times. She knocks on my window late at night when I’m already in bed. She’ll pound on my door and just start shouting requests to forgive her before I’ve even had a chance to get up and see who it is. She leaves excessively long notes, pictures, etc. on the chair of my porch. 

I never answer when she comes, and I have stopped looking at the notes she leaves. I just immediately throw them in the trash when I find them. I have tried telling her to leave me alone, and at this point I have tried to simply ignore her completely. Ignoring does not work. And I know if I give her even the slightest bit of attention it will open the floodgates &amp; make the problem even worse. 

I have no idea what to do. It is causing me anxiety, fear, and annoyance. I’m having difficulty sleeping at night knowing that I might get a sudden knock on the door at 1 in the morning followed by a plea of forgiveness. 

Does anyone have any ideas of how to stop this? ",21May2018,1

431," Throwaway since I can get into serious shit for this. I'm 18\(F\) and dad is in 60s. About two hours ago my school just sent some news we weren't expecting and we got into a huge fight. I can't get into too much detail, but the news really wasn't my fault. He started screaming at me anyway, saying things like ""You're worthless! You can't do anything right!"" I was eating lunch at this time, and was frustrated that he wasn't listening to me. Not thinking, I angrily threw my plate. I honestly wasn't aiming any direction, but it hit his forehead area.

He fell to the ground and started SCREAMING blood murder. My dad is a strong man that deals with chronic pain, but I've never seen him like this. He was bleeding quite a bit. I immediately ran to my mom's phone to call 911. My mom yelled at me not to, saying I'd get into trouble. I replied I didn't care but she refused. She said she's taking my dad to the hospital. But he REFUSES to go. 

He claimed it would bring ""dishonor"" on the family. I can't fucking believe it. I told them to say it was an accident \(it kinda was\) but they won't listen. I kept trying to call 911 but my mom doesn't let me, claiming he's okay. 

I mean he's still screaming at me, so he can't be dropping dead any minute. He also doesn't look like he needs stitches. But I'm VERY worried there might be internal bleeding or a concussion. I don't even care if the police press charges, I'm just worried he can be more injured than they're letting on.

Also, if god forbid he dies, don't I get charged with 2nd degree murder?? Isn't that much worse than an assault charge on a 1st time offender??

432,"Hello,

I had this school project to do, I invested a lot of time in it \(something like 50 hours\). I did a very good project, had 19.5 out of 20. I got really proud of myself for achieving such a good mark. However the final mark for this project is MIN\(project mark, practical test\). 

I made the practical test today it started very well but at the end I blocked and could not finish the last 2 questions. I guess I will have something like 15 out of 20 on this test which means I will end with 15 on the project.

I am so sad, really really sad because I invested so much time at this project, I gave my best, and because of this practical test \(that was only 30 minutes\) I am going to lose around 4.5 points at my final mark.

What makes me even more sad is that I could choose to make the test tomorrow and I could get some feedback from the people that made the test today.

Do you guys have any ideia of how I can get motivated again? I was in something like a motivation loop where I was getting good marks and that was giving me motivation to invest even more time in future projects however this situation made this ""loop"" go away...

I tried my damnedest to find a wildlife rehab placement for her but nobody would take her, so I decided to look after her myself.  I had the week off work and I had previously hand-raised kittens, so I felt I could give her a good chance at life. 

Everything went smoothly until Saturday, when she developed diarrhea.  I was unable to find much information on how to properly treat diarrhea in a baby mouse so I did the best I could, but she became emaciated after fasting on fluids for a few hours.  This concerned me.  I continued to move slowly according to my instincts, but her rate of recovery was not good and in my worry, I was reckless.  Against my better judgement, I gave her too much milk too soon and missed warning signs that ought to have corrected my course.  She died early this morning.

I was brutally tired when I made those decisions, due to having to stay up all night feeding her every half-hour (I was up with her every two hours in the days before that).  I know I wasn't thinking straight.  I was operating on very basic information which made decision-making more difficult.  And I know that even if I had done everything right, she may still have died as even adult mice are touch-and-go with diarrhea.

452,"My family has made me dependent. 
Ever since I was a boy I was conditioned to feel like I am nothing without my family. They would constantly put me down and make me feel like an idiot when I did something wrong, they point out my mistakes every chance they get. My family has always been fond of cutting my wings with both psychological and physical abuse.
My mother constantly repeats to me how she wants me to never leave and makes me feel guilty every time I talk about being financially independent.
When I got a job, they made me quit because they told me “it wasn’t convenient”
Whenever I get mad at them for any reason they all get against me and put me down. I never have anyone by my side ever during family arguments, it’s four people against me. 
I can rarely voice my opinions because I will be put down for it, I can’t trust them with any problems I may have, I can’t talk about my emotions. When I have opened up, they use that and treat me as a victim who isn’t mature enough to take care of himself.
Many of the choices I make have to go through them first! If I do something without asking, even if it’s something harmless or meaningless, they get mad at me and make me feel like utter garbage. 
They constantly make me feel like the disappointment. They never recognize my achievements or my qualities and only pay attention to my flaws. They push me to the edge and make me mad so they have a reason to abuse me. I really try to not let them win but I can’t. 
They have made it so that it doesn’t matter what I do I always need to go to them first.
This is worst by the fact that I have no money and no financial independence, my university is free but many of the extra classes I take that are necessary for my career aren’t and they pay for it. I am afraid they will stop supporting me at any moment. My hands are tied.
What can I do? Being in this house with all these people against me has damaged me immensely. At 19, I still flinch when they raise a hand for any reason because I immediately feel like they will hit me.
How can I get a job or something and escape this cage? ",21May2018,3
