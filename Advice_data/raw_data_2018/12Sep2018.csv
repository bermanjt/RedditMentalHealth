0,"My friend and I live in a college dorm apartment with two new roommates (both pairs have our own rooms, and there's a shared living room and kitchen). However, we've been having some issues with the new roommates and we're both really non-confrontational, so we're not sure how to deal with it. I wouldn't mind confronting them if my roommate did it with me, but she's willing to just let everything they do slide so I'd have to confront both of them alone. Here are some of the things they've done:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Taken the living room lamp that comes with the apartment (which is the only source of lighting for the living room) and put it in their own bedroom. We supplied our own lamp for our bedroom, and the living room lamp is a shared utility that we technically all paid for. They also took it without telling us and don't know that we know about it... I keep wanting to ask them about it but I don't use the living room much anyway and I feel like if I bring it up I'll be obligated to sit there more often. It just bothers me that they literally took something we all paid for. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Blast loud music in the living room/kitchen. The walls are super thing, and I've been woken up at 8am many times because of them. I honestly don't know what's worse, when they do it early in the morning or late at night (one time one of them starting playing music loudly at 3am). When it happens I usually ask them to lower it, they apologize, and it doesn't happen again for a bit, but eventually they'll do it again. They blast music and movies during the day too, which isn't as bad but can still be annoying. They're also just noisy in general- just last morning one of them started washing dishes at 7am and I swear she banged every single plate as loudly as possible. I miss the days when I could get 8 hours of sleep... 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Always occupy the living room. They must have a really lax class schedule because they're always back before my roommate and I, and they're always sitting at the living room table (which is pretty small so it can't fit all of us). I wouldn't normally care but the issue is that their room is much bigger than ours (just bad luck, it's kind of a lottery system when it comes to who gets the big room). So it seems unfair that they get to always take the living room space AND have a big room while we're forced to stay in our dorm style room at night (going to the library isn't really an option since the apartment is a bit far from campus). It wouldn't be that bad if they weren't also noisy as hell. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Leave candles on at night (and sometimes the stove). My roommate and I have to blow out their candles at night (which they leave on in the kitchen) because they always forget. Sometimes they leave the apartment and leave a burner on as well. Candles are already a huge fire hazard, so not blowing them out seems dangerous... Also, their room is a lot closer to the exit of the apartment than ours, so if anything were to happen (knock on wood) they'd most likely be safe and we wouldn't.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the best way to approach these topics without making things awkward between us and the roommates? We have to live with them for a semester so we don't want things to be too weird, but at the same time I feel like there are a few issues we have to address. I can live with them taking up the living room and even having the lamp (as long as they know that we know they took it) but the loud music is really annoying and the candles are potentially dangerous. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

TLDR; Non-confrontational person with roommate issues looking for a way to resolve them without making things awkward.  They play loud music, stole our lamp, and leave candles on at night.",12Sep2018,1

That's all well and good, but I want to get the game as soon as possible as to avoid spoilers. My grades have dropped due to missing assignments, and I am told that if I do the assignments and get partial credit and keep up with the class, in about 1-1.5 months my grades will be better, but that's not quick enought imo.

3," I wanted to share this, idk what advice I‚Äôm particularly asking about, any comments or opinions, advice will suffice!!!

So i moved into this apartment building last semester. The maintenance man would come to my apartment literally all the time because everything was breaking when i first moved in. I had a boyfriend at the time and he helped me move in. I always found the maintenance guy attractive but i never acted on that.

Fast forward to last week! So now I‚Äôm single. I saw the maintenance guy at a local club and we were talking and we ended up making out and he was calling me ‚Äúfine af‚Äù and he said to me ‚Äúi always wanted to do that but you were with that dude‚Äù and i told him that i felt the same way. And the club eventually was closing and i was in a rush to meet up with my friends to get a ride home. And he was like ‚Äúwell I‚Äôll see you around‚Äù and we do see each other around the apartments since he works there. And we talked for a little. But its a bit awkward for me because i did this when i was drunk and then i see him when I‚Äôm sober...but NO REGRETS!!! This was like the best 10 minutes of my life in a long time. 

Where can he and I move forward?? I want him!!",12Sep2018,1

5,"Title.
I just.. I'm a senior in high school now, in a new school. I have a disability in math and I'm freaking the *fuck* out because I'm failing in a damn special education class. I was told I shouldn't stress it, since most students in the class are currently failing.. but.. I just.. feel pathetic. Today I heard everyone turning their tests in when I wasn't even halfway done with it and it just made me snap. The stress of not doing well in class, and the stress of not passing gender-wise has been wearing me down thin. I ended up hurting myself for the first time in a very long time today due to the anxiety and pain I was feeling. I ended up in hot water with my mom, and she nearly forced me to go to the hospital. I ended up staying home, but she made me promise to try and handle my stress better.
I need.. help with controlling my stress in a healthy way. Not anything else right now.. 
So, any help with controlling stress would be appreciated. Thanks.",12Sep2018,1
6,"I‚Äôm using my throw away account in case they see this but someone close to me has always had problems with the truth. Growing up we caught them many times using social media accounts to troll other people and tell tons of lies. Some were simple saying my dogs were their dogs on their fake social media posts. Others were bigger creating huge lies about horrible things happening to them under fake social media names to get sympathy from people they don‚Äôt know. Due to them being family I know their parent caught all of their fake accounts on their phone and that‚Äôs how we know all of these accounts belonged to them. 

We even had to completely remove them from social media because they were bullying internet people and saying horrible things to them on one account and then using their own real account to be the hero fighting them back. Basically causing trouble just to be the one to fix it. When found out they were not allowed to use social media by their parents for a very long time. Years went on and everyone thought the phase was done. We all knew they still exaggerated things but most were grounded with some truth so we learned to read between the lines. 

Recently they told me of an issue on Twitter that they came across and how a person was being toxic to a fandom of people and showed me the tweets. They didn‚Äôt mention tweeting back to the person so I just agreed that yea that person is terrible. Then a few days later I was looking at their recent tweet and saw that the ‚Äútoxic‚Äù person they showed me had retweeted it. I thought it was weird so I clicked on the toxic persons profile only to realize that the account was newly created once the conflict started in this fandom and that every liked tweet and retweet this toxic person had was the compulsive liar‚Äôs tweets. Doing some more digging the toxic person was doing all the same things in real life that the compulsive liar was doing and all tweets by the liar were retweeted by the toxic person. 

I dont know what to do. Do I confront them for going back to their old ways of bringing toxic energy so that they can white knight it on their real profile? They‚Äôre using this toxic person to claim everything from having a kid (they don‚Äôt) to being in an abusive relationship (they‚Äôre not, they‚Äôre single). I‚Äôm torn because now they are technically an adult but are using false identities and horrible lies to gain attention not only on their fake accounts but to gain notoriety on their real accounts. I feel like everything they ever say now is a lie since I‚Äôve known. I can‚Äôt really just walk away from them as they are family and part of me feels a sense of responsibility to get them to stop but it‚Äôs happened before. Is there any hope they will ever stop or should I just realize everything they say is probably a lie? Do I do anything or just leave it alone?

Sorry for the long post hopefully it‚Äôs not too confusing. ",12Sep2018,1
7,"I‚Äôve worked at a restaurant for a while as a host. It‚Äôs a fairly easy job but we don‚Äôt get very many hours and we get paid minimum wage. Sometimes I try to pick up some slack for the servers when they‚Äôre busy and I‚Äôm not towards the end of the night. I bus and set tables and occasionally bring bread and water to customers. Again this wasn‚Äôt expected of me, I just did it when I wasn‚Äôt busy. Pretty soon after I started working a new manager took over. He‚Äôs started asking me to do that stuff and more because I suppose he isn‚Äôt clear on what the hosts responsibilities are. Now, stuff that I occasionally did as favors to the servers has become part of our jobs. The extra work load isn‚Äôt too much for us to handle, but we need to get paid more if we‚Äôre going to be doing it. I want to ask the manager to add us to the tip pool.

8,"After my college boyfriend and I broke up, I moved cross-country to be near my sick aunt. I was originally brought up in a large city, but my aunt lived in a small town so when I first moved it was hard to make friends. I eventually did at my work and have been in a group of friends ever since. (About 9 years) I recently purchased my own home about a year-and-a-half ago about an hour north of my friends. Since then, I have felt we were drifting apart. Even though I'm only an hour away on a major higway not one person ONE time has come to visit me! I mean I get it we're all busy but really? So I started thinking about just how good of friends these people really are. In the whole time I've known them, including 2 girls that are supposed to be my BFFs, no one has ever gotten me a present. Not birthday, Christmas, graduating college, not even a fucking card!!! During this time I have gotten the group 50+ gifts. I don't have kids but most of them do so I end up going to 20+ kids/family/husband/cousin whoever birthday parties and I'm always expected to bring gifts! That's because I have a good job and disposable income where this group no one has good jobs and most are on some kind of welfare. Again it's a small rural community with no jobs, and in fact my one friend who owns her own business has ""getter done"" in the title. So are they all hillbillies? Yes, that is correct. But besides the gifts they just expect me to pay for everything. We went to a music festival and I bought the tickets with the pretense I'd be paid back. Well, $440 in tickets later and I didnt get a cent back. I was so mad I didn't even end up going to the festival. They actually had the balls to ask for my ticket!! so they could bring another friend. But still no mention of reimbursing me. Another time I came in and my BFF was looking at my phone and I thought nothing of it. But them someone started using my Netflix account and signing in with a bunch of different phones/devices. Well it turns out it was her and she had given my password to her whole family. When I cancelled the account she didn't say anything to me but told everyone in the group I told her she could use the account and how stingy I was for cancelling. So to wrap up my last point is that while I have almost nothing in common with these rubes I thought we at least were honest with each other. I have caught both my BFFs saying things about me behind my back. The one I catch in lies literally ALL the time and it just gets so old! But a few weeks ago one BFF stopped talking to me. This made it awkward so I didn't go to the big labor day weekend party we have every year. Come to find out it's because she's mad about something I said to another mutual friend. But instead of telling me she tells everyone else and even when I directly ask her she says she's not mad. Well BFF #2 gets drunk and admits that other BFF is mad because I told people she asked me to give her husband a blow job. This is true actually, because she did ask me to blow her husband. But she was very drunk so I didn't take her seriously. I mentioned it to a friend because it was hilarious and explained she wasn't serious she was wasted. So instead of just asking me about it she tells everyone to try to make me look like a dick? That's why I'm at the point now where I'm like is this even worth it? There are a LOT of other things too and I'm just wondering what would others do in this situation? ",12Sep2018,1

Throughout our friendship I‚Äôve contemplated if I want to be with him and I always said no. I know he has wanted to but I never did. It‚Äôs weird though because i think we both get a tiny bit jealous when the other talks to another guy/girl. Lately, he‚Äôs been talking with another girl, and they hooked up the other day. When he told me that my heart sank and for some reason I just felt heartbroken, I spent the day feeling so down and upset. I have a class with him and hearing him talk about the girl makes me feel awful. I still don‚Äôt know how I feel, would I want to be with him or am I just sad he‚Äôs not ‚Äúmine?‚Äù Like we‚Äôve always been each others number one but now with the other girl I feel like I‚Äôm being replaced, and I‚Äôm terrified to lose him as a friend.

11,"I have a friend who I met early in college, and we‚Äôve remained good friends for the last 5 years. We briefly dated but mutually agreed to separate and remain friends. For the last 2-3 years, they‚Äôve been nothing but toxic, controlling, abusive verbally, and honestly it‚Äôs making it EXTREMELY hard to remain their friend. 

I am trying so hard, and still talk to this person every day to be supportive, but there‚Äôs a catch. Several times when we were friends, I noticed they are very anxious and depressed and really never have done anything about it. I always suggested seeing help, getting a therapist, getting medicated, etc. and they never listened. Several times during college when they were stressed, or we got into an argument, they would threaten suicide. I took it serious and always went to them and 15 minutes they were calmed down and regretted saying it. 

Recently I‚Äôve been wanting to remove all the negativity from my life, and this person is nothing but negative. I‚Äôve tried everything I could with them, their family, her other friends, and they just didn‚Äôt take any of the advice. 

I love this person dearly, but they don‚Äôt even listen to me anymore, if I say something they don‚Äôt like over the phone they hung up on me 

I know if I tell them I no longer want to be friends, it may lead to another episode of this and I‚Äôm afraid to do that. 

I guess I‚Äôm asking if anyone has been in this situation, what have you done. What would you suggest. In the end, I know I will probably always talk to this individual to avoid anything.

Ex stepfather?) he wasn't exactly a great example of a man and he left her to go back to his ex wife just a few months ago. I was that weird kid in high-school who was in marching band and even those kids didn't really want much to do with me. I didn't have much experience hanging out with friends or socializing with people. I haven't dated or been with anyone since my 4 1/2 year relationship ended back in mid 2015. I don't know really where to start other than the fact that i have low self esteem and don't have much going for me. I live at home with my now mom, younger brother, and our youngest sister(ex stepfather's and my mother's child). I didn't go to college because i didn't do very well in high-school and went to an automotive technical school instead. I graduated from there with an almost 4.0 GPA but realized i didn't want to become a technician $25k+of debt later. Currently working a job where i make a decent $13 Hourly and put in 40 hours a week in the state of Texas so not terrible.

I don't have issues with talking to people about just normal things or having normal conversations its more that I see someone who is attractive and i cant talk to them because I'm afraid of rejection. I understand that they are just people too but i still cant do it, I can't get out of this cage I'm locking myself in. I can't stop comparing myself to my 3 years younger than me brother who is already way more successful than i am socially and he already has his career planned out.

18,"I'm a 24yo guy from the Netherlands. About 3,5 months ago my GF broke up with me. We had troubles in the last months of our relationship, but I never thought it would end like this. We had a future planned out. 

She came here in January from Germany after a long distance relationship of 2,5 years. Things went well at first, but we were looking for our place (we were temporarily living at my dad's place). However, we couldn't find anything. This, coupled with all the stress due to work, study and other responsibilities didn't do our relationship any good. So she eventually left me after 5 months of being here. I was shocked, heartbroken and plunged into a severe depression. I had suicidal thoughts and did not want to live on. 

The future I had planned with her is completely shattered. We wanted our own place, she would study here, I would work, and we would build a life together where we'd travel the world as much as possible and eventually work towards having our own house with a small patch of land to keep some animals and grow fruits and vegetables.

Now that that future is no longer possible, I feel empty and clueless, like a ship without a sail drifting at sea. I'm finishing my master degree in Public Administration this year and my original plan was to just get a government or corporate job, whatever I could get. However, now I feel like I don't want that at all. I don't want a 9-5 job where I'm sitting at a desk all day doing meaningless work. I do find my field interesting, but I don't think it will give me the satisfaction I'm looking for.

I have done quite some soul searching the past months and I came to the conclusion that the only thing that makes me happy is directly helping other people, changing their lives for the better. I think this has to do with me having a bad childhood and rough life overall, but it really is the only thing that makes me happy. In my current field I cannot directly affect people. So here are my current options:

1. I join the military as an officer after getting my master's degree. I am really attracted to the physical and mental challenge of the job. I also think I'll learn a lot that will be useful in life. And of course, I would be able to help people and be there for them, either my fellow soldiers or other people. Unfortunately, there is a chance I might be declared unfit. Most likely because of psychological reasons since I'm suffering from depression and I probably have a mental illness. I still have to be diagnosed by psychologists and a psychiatrist, but there is a big chance something is wrong and I might need medication for it. This could ruin my chances of joining the military.

2. So my other option is that I finish my master's and become a teacher at the university. I am good at doing research and I like teaching people stuff. I also have experience as a tutor and I really enjoyed it.

3. This is the drastic option, but the one I'm attracted to the most. Due to what has happened the past months I have gotten increasingly more interested in psychology. I always found it interesting (even did a minor in it), but I had chosen Public Administration instead. I would love to be a clinical psychologist, a researcher and a teacher though. This way I can really help people. Unfortunately, it would cost me at least another 4 years to get a master degree in psychology and even more to get a PhD. Since I'm already 24 I feel like it might be too late.

4. Of course, my last option is to just get a 9-5 job. Possibly at an embassy in a foreign land to make it more exciting. Though I find this the least appealing.

What do you guys think? Should I make such a drastic change? Switch studies/career paths while I'm already 24yo? What are your experiences?",12Sep2018,1

I'm 30. I am an adult. But my career is barely burgeoning and my apartment is tiny. AND I fully intend to move west once I've had a couple more years work experience out east. Basically, I'm far from being settled. All my older siblings are established and can afford vacation time to deal with this process. I'm completely overwhelmed. My siblings don't understand and by and large have never taken my feelings about anything into consideration. I know I sound like bitter, childish brat, but there is more than meets the eye.

There's a lot of stuff. A lot. This isn't like clearing out your bedroom when you go to college so that it can be turned into a home gym. This is everything. A lot of valuable antiques, family heirlooms that he's inherited, and about a hundred thousand books. He's a book collector who doesn't have an interest in selling his books while alive. I don't want to dispose of things simply because I'm at a stage in my life where I have a small apartment and can only devote like five days vacation to pick and choose what's important to me. I have two jobs (one career and one to pay off students loans) and am taking night courses. 

But what can I do? Rent a storage unit until I can move back west in a few years? I mean, I imagine it might cost about the same as my rent? Move all the stuff/furniture I want out east and then RE haul it back west in a few years? I don't drive, I'd have to pay somebody to haul it over. 

This is of course all tied up in my feelings about sentimentality and nostalgia that many people might not understand. I live a VERY materially minimalist lifestyle. I barely have any items in my apartment. But I still have a hoarder's brain, if that makes sense. A hoarder who doesn't hoard. Every time I donate something, it's an emotional struggle, but I manage. Now I have to do it on a grandiose level of things that encompassed my entire childhood, and the **history** of generations past. Frigging GULP.

I'm sorry if I sound whiny and entitled and delusional. It's just a lot. I don't have that mental-button other well-adjusted people have when it comes to getting rid of stuff. I'm ill-adjusted, and this clear-out is a problem for me.

How have other people dealt with this?",12Sep2018,3
24,"So I‚Äôve been living with my girlfriend for about 6 months now.   She had a bout with cancer and has been remission for a few months now. She comes from a wealthy family. I on the other hand do not.  About a week ago her mom just texts her to put the blue about this 2 week long trip to India she thinks she should go on. Of course my gf accepted, and I don‚Äôt blame her. At the same time though, I feel a little shitty about it. First of all, I kind of feel disrespected that a decision was just made that she was going to India without anyone even asking how I would feel about it first, or even considering whether its something I might want to do with her. I mean, I couldn‚Äôt go anyway cause I don‚Äôt have the money, but it still feels like no one considered my feelings in the situation. Secondly, this is the first time that the difference in our wealth has been so obvious I guess. Never in my life will anyone just surprise me with a free international trip to go hang out at the Tai mahal and do some spiritual stuff etc. 

At the same time, I want to feel happy and excited for her. She went through a rough time while she was being treated for cancer. It‚Äôs an amazing opportunity and I wish I could do it myself. I want to be supportive, but I also feel jealous, disrespected, and kind of left out by the whole situation.

(Imagine that) I recently landed a full time gig at a well respected corporation. The job is to basically handle maintenance throughout the building and make sure everything looks perfect for lack of a better way to put it. I never would have imagined I would end up in a job like this but with that being said it's not bad at all. I was started off at $42,000/year with benefits, 401k dollar for dollar match, pension etc. The thing about this company is that the leadership likes to see long term growth of their associates in the different departments instead of jumping around everywhere. 5 years minimum before you think about moving to a different department from what i have heard. Ultimately there is the chance to learn different things at this company but you have to pay your dues first. I absolutely adore the team I work with. We work hard and still manage to have fun all while maintaining great relationships with everyone around the office. I guess my dilemma I have is that I feel like I should have that cushy, stereotypical desk job that many of my other friends have and obtain that bullshit job title like ""business analyst"" or ""assistant corporate treasurer"" or whatever. I just never thought I'd be the maintenance guy out of college is all. I did what I had to do because I needed the money and jumped at the first good opportunity I found.

But trough the months, even after her mother got better, she startet complaining about more and more things of her life. And i don't have a problem with talking about it, as long as it isn't in this kind of self-pity way, but she brought those topics up again and again. And even though she knows that i don't like self-pity, she didn't stopped. There is also a thing with our teacher where she cries, that she can't have him and meanwhile, she is really obsessive over him. So I told her many times, that she has to do something about it and that she should go to a teacher or therapist but she doesn't want to hear that. She says, that she isn't mentally unstable and that there is no reason to get help. On the other hand she claims to have social anxiety and often ran out of class when something didn't went right. There was also a situation, where she said, that her life is just a big depression, and as somebody, who is diagnosed with it, I said, that there are people, who really have a bad life and that she should get help, if she feels that way. She was so angry, that she took her things and went to the other side of the classroom. And so i told her every time to do something or to get help and invited her to go with me to my therapist to take a look. And right now i really can't take it anymore so i googled the ""simptoms"" of a toxic friend and they really described her but it also said, that those kind of people want to change you and i realised, that I really want her to change.

1. When asked how people would describe you, how do you describe yourself in a positive light that looks good for hiring, but doesn‚Äôt make you sound conceited or too ‚Äútypical‚Äù?
2. If they ask about weaknesses how do you be honest, yet still try to portray yourself in a positive light despite weaknesses?  (Ex: I know a lot of people say they are too much of perfectionists in their work and have heard it just comes across as a common, boring answer). 
3. When they ask why you‚Äôd be good for the job, what can you say that sounds professional and not just a boring answer like I‚Äôm a good worker or etc? 
4. If they ask about dislikes about previous jobs, how do you go about answering that without seeming unprofessional? I feel like it‚Äôs  seemingly unrealistic and probably an obvious lie to say you had zero dislikes about jobs you‚Äôre no longer at. 
5. If they ask if you have any questions for them, what are good and professional questions that show you‚Äôre interested in the company/position/etc? (Ex.  I recently asked how their business varies from others in the industry as far as the working environment. The interviewer seemed said it was a great question and happily went into detail about their work culture.) 
6. What are some good interview questions you‚Äôve been asked that may be less common and caught you off guard? How did you answer them or how would you answer them if you ever got asked again? 
7. How do show lots of energy in an interview, yet also remain professional and focused? (Lots of places in the industry I am trying to get a position in look for ‚Äúenergy‚Äù in interviews.)

42,"So a little backstory. In my first year of college, I lived in the dorms, and the female RA on my floor and I became friends. She was always flirty, but probably in the friendly sort of way, and we shared a lot of interests. I eventually caught feelings for her and asked her out, she declined, RAs can't date residents. I understood and accepted that and we stayed friends for the rest of the year, just less close. After the school year ended, we fell out of contact and I talked to her once in the 1 years following that, and saw hi another time, couldn't talk to her,  I was on the phone with my dad.

Here's the problem. I still have feelings for her. I still have dreams about her, good dreams, the happiest dreams I've ever had.

I asked my mom and my step dad about it and they both said it wasn't them but I later found the paper folded up in his bedroom drawer.

I would go on the computer (back in the day of the shared family computer) and look at his downloaded porn in folders with inconspicuous names. It was all just normal kinds of porn videos and still images. But one day I found still images of me, my friends and my step siblings (not his kids, and not pornographic) mixed in the albums with the porn.

I don't want it to be a beautiful thing. But advice doesn't seem to be breaking it. It's too strong. There are too many reasons to polish it to a sparkling shine rather than break it, anyway. 

I have a therapist, been going about a year, and I like her, but I can't seem to access what's keeping me hating myself so deeply. I can acknowledge certain things all I want, but there doesn't seem to be any kind of Aha! moment that changes the course of my thinking. It's just such a hard, ingrained fact of my existence. The advice feels like smalltalk niceties that are only meant to flatter briefly and never set in. They just blow away like dust on a breeze. 

I don't believe I deserve happiness, I do believe that the things I like should indeed bring me all of the shame that they do, and I am extremely dependent on the judgments of others in order to feel validated. If I don't get the kind of validation that would come from a loving parent like I've always felt starved for deep down, then it feels like people don't really care. I don't know how to deal with this as an adult who should be able to stand on their own 2 feet. I don't/won't/can't get that kind of validation at my age. And it would be embarassing anyways. So I don't even know what it is I want. 

I was abused as a child by means of being isolated, barely being socialized (if not for my grandparents stepping in from time to time), with my neglectful and terrorizing parents. They did not teach me most life or social skills, so I had a very difficult time developing and maintaining proper friendships. Still difficult today. Parts of me feel like an imposter, like a feral child like Tarzan or something, trying to fit in with humans whose languages I'm not at home in. 

I depend on other people to call the shots, I'm so dependent. I hate it. I have so much anxiety when I'm left to my own devices. Even though I'm an introvert and recharge when I'm alone, and I hate things like group work/projects, if I have to do something I'm not used to doing alone, I tend to freeze. Especially in public. Which manifests as this passiveness and ducking out and just waiting pathetically until someone I think I can trust comes along to help/do it for/with me. I don't like the risk of doing something wrong without someone's direction and getting scolded for it. I feel like a child who got left waiting for something, and never stopped waiting. 

I wish like hell that I could be one of those kinds of people who says, ""I don't give a FUCK what people think, I do what I WANT"" and mean it. And just go through every day like that, living and learning and growing and experiencing life. Instead of sitting at home for their entire life browsing the internet and hating themself for it. 

How do I get to that point from here??? Has anyone accomplished it? What did you do? ",12Sep2018,1

Me and my sibling has been helping pay the rent expenses for the past year while my parents also ask help from my other family members, it really sucks because i never have any money of my own. Ive worked part time job while doing full time schooling, gave all my money to my parents from my financial aid and work money thats like 5-6 grand through both semesters last year. Note that we are in section eight so its like 1500 rent/bills a month. I didnt want my grades to suffer so i quit my job shortly after, i cant even buy what i need like a laptop or even a new phone cause mine broke, summer was terrible i couldnt even go out to buy things like food or clothes, my family was at an all time low with no savings or me and my siblings to pitch in so they kept asking family for money, i gave my last 280 in savings to them last month and now im in school taking full time courses with honors classes so i cant really work, i am really trying to maintain my 4.0 gpa but its extremely difficult, no transportation so i take the bus plus i dont have a computer so i can only work in libraries now my next financial aid check will be coming in a two weeks but this time i expect to not use any of it because my family is at an all time low. Everytime i explain this to my dad he just doesnt understand that its been two years of him not working and just sitting around the house doing nothing, he can do uber or something but now my mom is working a small job but she can only do so much because she takes care of kids, it just makes me angry because my dad just sits around doing nothing while my mom struggles to pay bills and take care of the house.

63,"So, I'm 21 and in my 4th year of college. I changed majors on my 2nd year and now I'm looking towards a different major. My college experience has been messy so far, by this point I should've been about to graduate but now I'm looking at at least 2 more years in order to finish this major so I can start doing the other one. I'm working part-time at McDonald's for $7.25/hour, plus classes and extracurricular stuff and I feel drained. Looking for a different job is kind of difficult here and not working is not an option due to the fact that I pay for all of my things (I don't live at home with my fam). I was happy when I got the job because I really needed it and still do, but I hate it, I feel horrible everytime I gotta go and work there. I barely have time for myself because I wake up early everyday and then I stay late at college. The time I have to relax is time I should be using to do my assignments and studying but I'm also dreading that.  On top of that I can't even keep conversations with females ever since I broke up with my GF of 3 years; if I don't write or approach them first no one would talk to me (unless they need something) and, when they do approach me first and I respond the interectation ends there. 

I don't believe my life is horrible, but I do feel kinda lost right now, without purpose and I can't seem to get my shit together even if I try. I'm tired all the damn time.

I live with my mother (sometimes she stays with us), my sister, her three kids, and her friend that is staying with us because he basically has no where else to go. I spend about 95% of my time in my room. I don't have a vehicle to get out and go anywhere and even if I did I have no money to go anywhere with. I can't stand being anywhere else in the house besides my room. I can't stand being around the screaming kids. I can't stand being around my pothead of a sister anymore. Hell I can't stand being in my own room.

94,"I'm in the middle of a really tricky decision right now and could really use some advice. The college I currently attend has recently had some changes that have really infuriated me to the point where I think if I were choosing a school today, I would no longer apply there. Specifically, the college has begun the process to phase out several of the school's smaller majors (including my own) over the next few years in what was clearly a financial decision that had very little input from actual students or professors in these fields. While the college has promised that my major will still be available to me (just not to incoming freshmen), its also obvious that the program I originally signed up for and am paying thousands of dollars a year to go through will be affected negatively by professors resigning, classes being dropped, and possibly students transferring.

There are a few reasons I didn't immediately transfer though. First, the announcement for this change came in early August, and while that was before the school year had started for them, I am spending this semester studying abroad in a country where the semester began in early July. Not only did I put a lot of money into studying abroad, but when I return, I will be half way through my junior year and I plan on graduating in 2020, and three semesters is a really short period of time. The other reason I don't want to switch is simply because aside from the high price of the college and the annoying administration that has been making these decisions, I really do like the school. I love all my professors, the general atmosphere of the college, and the students who are in my major. I've managed to make connections through the school that could possibly help me find a job in my field after I graduate, and several of my closest friends as well as a girl I've been dating for two years all go to the school. While the college itself doesn't feel like the same school I fell in love with and applied to as a freshman, I still have had wonderful experiences there that I feel wouldn't have been possible at other schools.

So I have a few options: Should I drop all that and find a cheaper place to wrap up my education for my last few semesters at a school that has an administration that actually listens to its student body, should I stay at the college and try to take any classes that aren't available to me at a nearby large university (even though simply transferring to that school would be a lot cheaper), or can you guys think of another option? Have any of you had a similar experience? Any advice at this point would be useful. I'm leaning towards just staying, but that might just be a fear of change influencing me.",12Sep2018,1
95,"Ok, I'm a first year 3 weeks into living in a large state city college in the midwest.... And i've really enjoyed the restart of it. Just came back from an intro meeting of a club that i think i'm going to love, i'm obsessed with the material in one of my classes, etc etc its all good.

&amp;#x200B;

But, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been hanging out with this girl always in a bigger group just through mutual friends and stuff, not even often, and i haven't thought anything of it. One of the guys in my dorm keeps saying I should get with her, even though I'm not interested in her, and now , somehow i'm \*nervous\* when i talk to her!! somehow by his words i'm starting to question what I say around her and shit!!! WTF DO I DO!!!!!!!!!",12Sep2018,1
96,"Recently I went out shopping with one of my male friends. 

I started pointing out thigh high boots and other assorted women's shoes. 

He started calling the boots I pointed out hooker heels."" When I asked him why he thought that he then went on to say how that's what his uncle would always call them. 

I was quick to reply how he shouldn't say something just because another person called an item that. 

He went muttered a simple okay and we continued through the store. 

I then continued to point out more clothes I thought were cute (i.e a mustard corduroy skirt  and a black lace up skirt)

He then starts to make a comment ""You women are funny."" Then laughs. 

I ask why

He continues ""I don't understand you women."" Then he scoffs and continues by saying "" why you women complain about being cat called and hit on when you choose to dress like that for attention from men. You're just asking for it."" 

I was speechless.  

I then began on my spiel about how it can sometimes feel threatening to be cat called, followed and harassed due to the sheer fact of just being a woman.

A little background.. I was sexually assaulted in a previous relationship. I was wearing a baggy pair of sweatpants + an oversized t shirt at the time of my assault. I feel very strongly against when being told women are ""asking for it""

Fast forward till now. I feel incredibly disgusted by my male friend at this point in time. 

I guess my questions are how would you handle this situation? I've already tried stating why it bothers me and how I feel. Moving forward, would you work to fix this friendship? My trust and respect has tethered quite a bit. How do you combat the seriousness of rape culture to someone who takes it as a joke?",12Sep2018,1

99,"I just started college. I like my classes and I feel like they‚Äôre manageable, but at the same time I am stressed out. I have two big tests next week that are worth around 20% of my final grade. I‚Äôm caught up on all of my homework so right now my main focus is to study for the tests. I feel like I need to change something? At the end of the day I have no motivation to do my homework. I know that studying for these tests is super important, but rn I can‚Äôt motivate myself to put 100% in??? My future depends on how well I do this school year :(

I am thinking about deleting my social media for awhile? Has anyone done this? I don‚Äôt use it a lot but it‚Äôs time that could be used to do work. I feel like my life will be very empty without it, I have like one friend here at school and she‚Äôs kinda distant. If I delete it I‚Äôll get the urge to redownload it but I can probably keep myself from doing so. Ughhhh idk what to do, right now is so important and I feel like I‚Äôm not doing enough.",12Sep2018,2
100,"So, I think I may have fallen in love with my friend. And I don't know what to make of it. It may be that I am in love with our friendship, but in the last year or so I can't seem to get him off my mind. That's the other thing--we're both guys. Not that that's a bad thing, personally I can play both sides of the field, and I've found out (from someone else) that my friend does, too. He's said stuff that made me think so, but never directly confirmed it. But now another friend confirmed it because they assumed I knew. And it really doesn't make a difference, but I think it's caused me to read more into things, you know? He's only been dating girls, though, so maybe he is bi, but prefers one side to the other. I just hate myself for secretly hoping the relationship falls through...

Anyway, the last few months I've found that I really crave his attention (and possibly affirmation?). I respect him a lot, and thing he's very intelligent/funny/kind. Genuinely a good guy. He's a few years younger than me, and I think I see a lot of myself in him--or maybe he is more of who I want to be? Like the better version of myself? Odd...sorry. By the way, he's in his last year of college, and I've been out for a few years.

I've been going through a lot of personal stuff this past year, and even before that he's helped me overcome/come to terms with my anxiety, depression, etc. We've talked it through, compared experiences with it, and he's given me advice on how to approach the subject with doctors or what things I should try to do. So, maybe that emotional support has me more attached than normal? As if that ""bond"" caused a more heightened awareness of our friendship. My fear is that I will begin to do little things that appear desperate or clingy, and I'll drive him away (a common anxiety thing I have with loads of people). I just don't want to start being ""weird"" around him? I already think I am, but he doesn't seem to pick up on it yet.

I know that he wouldn't care if I was attracted to him, and I think we are both comfortable enough to state that to each other--like I said, he's insinuated things before, and I think he's fully okay with saying another guy is attractive. It's society that made that seem ""gay""...even the straightest guy knows deep down when another guy is good looking. I don't even think he is attracted to me, but I do sense, in the past anyway, that he and I have a strong friendship. Before he helped pick me back up from my rough year, I offered advice to him, as well. Maybe not to the same degree of depression, anxiety, etc., but school, life, and the like. It's kind of like a big/little brother thing, but lately my mind has taken it further.

So, what should I do? I'm not making any intentional advances, but it's difficult to not have that cloud hanging over me. We don't live in the same city, and we talk periodically throughout the year, and see each other over holidays or summer, so it's not constantly pressing, but it's moments like this when I miss him that I can't help but wonder if I love him or am in love with him?

TLDR; I can't tell if I love my friend or am in love with my friend, who has me through bad times, and I don't know how to process or act on those thoughts. Help.",12Sep2018,1
101,"Honestly, just not happy with the way a lot of things are going. I dropped out of college because I wasn‚Äôt genuinely interested in the path I was taking and just had too much going on in my life to handle the stress. I started working at a convenience store not long before I first started back in college, having taken a break after earning my AAS. For a while I was happy in this job but the irregular hours and amount of hours are starting to wear on me. I‚Äôve been working anywhere from an hour and a half to 8 hours and anywhere from 6 hours a week to an unusual 26 hours this week. They‚Äôre also starting to work me on midnights. I‚Äôm happy to be a cog in the machine but not for a machine that doesn‚Äôt understand the importance of the individual cogs. 

I have a degree in information technology and have considered going back for a bachelors but I don‚Äôt know how much opportunity there would be for me to use it. I live in a town of about 2000-3000 and there aren‚Äôt a lot of jobs to go around of course. Gas stations, restaurants (mainly fast food), grocery stores, schools, and other assorted small businesses that don‚Äôt really employ anybody because they can‚Äôt afford to. Of course there is a small university town about 20 minutes one way and a decently sized, though not particularly large, town about 45 minutes the other way. My biggest problem is that my family is here and I consider this place home. My parents are here and at the moment I‚Äôm still living with them, my brothers and sisters are here or within a short driving distance, and I also have numerous other family members living here or in the immediate area. This place is my whole life and it‚Äôs hard to imagine myself going anywhere else. I‚Äôve just felt lost so much of the time here lately and I‚Äôm falling further into that pit all the time.

105,"So the subset of people I am looking at has a lot of people that are struggling with a wide variety of issues, some of them range from minor issues to some people undeniably probably having serious mental health issues.

But I believe this community is something that should be made and supported and become stronger over time. Where their PEERS can look at the problems and assist them in getting over their problems.

For a lot of people, especially this subset of people, there is a lot of cynicism and disregard for people who aren't ""living it / in it""... and where they are going to other communities and aren't able to really vent the way they could be able to in this sort of community.

So how can I BEST set up this subreddit for success?

-No I do not have qualifications to detect, assess or treat mental health in any regard. I am a professional computer toucher at my job.

-I do NOT want to be able to treat, assess, or detect mental health issues on this subreddit. That is WAY out of our scope.


So how can I best set this up for success? I do not want to lead people into thinking that I can do anything with respect to mental health issues, but I want to offer a place for peer support and people to communicate and vent their frustrations and share experiences with one another.

109,"Had a really good friend in high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

We actually met because he thought I was a pussy and challenged me to a fight. I easily destroyed him without taking a single punch (not that I'm some champion fighter he just absolutely sucked). We start talking after that, but I felt like there was some resentment because of the fight.

 We act like assholes to each other in a friendly way (probably because of the fight), but are actually really good friends. We hang out a lot. My parents had suddenly divorced at that time and he was the only person I could really talk about it when we hung out. Parents divorce really did a number on my self-confidence and I stopped seeing my other friends, but I hung out with this dude a lot. I felt like a big reason was that I could compare myself to him and feel good about myself. I had shit grades, but he might have been one of the few kids with worse grades.

We are still assholes to each other and it gets personal sometimes. One day he tells me that his parents are second? cousins, and tells me not to tell anyone. Literally the next day I tell a few kids in my math class this and it spreads like wildfire. The same day he texts me asking why I said that, and I say idk and I'm sorry. He accepts my apology. Thinking back on it, I did it because I wanted to seem cool and that he wasn't well liked at school. Also, people were associating me with him and I and I blamed some of my unpopularity on that.

Junior and senior years I really turn my grades around and did pretty well on my SAT. Decide I want to go to college, and get accepted into a fairly decent one. He goes to a different one on the other side of the state. As college begins, I meet new people and start losing contact with him. I find out he starts using drugs from a mutual friend. He still texts me, but basically is bragging about how well he is doing and I find it annoying.

Summer starts and we go back home. He want to chill, but I keep refusing. He finally flips out on me and we stop texting. I tell my old friends about it and they are relieved, says that he was a creep and they were beginning to think we were gay for each other. 

Get through college without thinking about him. I occasionally get more updates about him, but it is progressively worse. He fails and changes majors. He becomes addicted to some opioids, his parents sent him to Iran (where his parents are from and where drugs are extra illegal) to detox, and he takes a year off school. I still have no urge to hang out with him.

I graduate college and life hits me like a ton of bricks. I grab a job I hate, but at least it is something. Continue getting updates about my old friend. He never graduated college, apparently went ""full crack head"", last group of people that were hanging out with him stopped hanging out with him.

I want to reach out before something he does sometime horrible, but I also don't want him in my life. He enables bad habits in people like never taking any responsibility, being annoying/antisocial, and hating women or other specific groups of people. I'm not sure what I should do

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Had a really good friend, but had a falling out. He made some horrible life decisions and might be suicidal now, but I'm not sure. I want to reach out, but I'm not sure

110,"Alright this is going to be a rant. Today I have reached my limit and I need to vent all this shit before I explode. Of course I also need outside opinions... scroll down if you want the shortened version. Sorry for the rambling in advance. 

So I am a tattoo artist and a few months back I had a shitty walkin client. Rude/sexual comments during and after the tattoo. Whatever, it happens, so I brushed it off. Then he starts calling the shop to try to talk. Im not interested. He later tries to schedule something with me and I give him the soft no. I told him I'm booked up but another artist can get him in within a week. He ghosts, or so I think. More emails start coming in asking if I'm breaking up with him, followed by more phone calls and now trying to get my personal number.
The shop owner tells me he will handle it and tell the dude to fuck off cus at this point I'm a ball of anxiety. I'm the only female in the shop and I'm there 7 days a week cus I run the front desk as well. More often than not I'm either alone or having to keep an eye on a few artists who have rockstar attitudes. 
It's been about 2 weeks since grandpa skeevy has tried to make contact(woohoo!)
So today I'm in the shop, one artist left an hour after we opened, the other is in no shape to work and I told him to lay down our back.... (this is so common its infurating) 
Grandpa skeeves walks in and instantly starts a barrage of ""are you mad at me? Are you breaking up with me?"" Bullshit lines. Hes moved instantly between the wall and the desk thus trapping me behind it. I panic and play nice and book him out for 3 weeks. He yells at me for not doing it then and leaves. 
NOW THE OWNER CLEARLY LIED AND NEVER CONFRONTED THE SHITHEAD. IM BULLSHIT. 
The owner has told me numerous times he doesn't want me there alone yet does nothing when it happens. His reason for this is because this is not the first, second or even fifth time that I've been alone and either screamed at or blocked in by very large angry men demanding things. 
While this all went down today I was SOS texting and calling him while ""looking up my schedule on google"" . I was bitch buttoned and my texts ignored. 
After this my less than level headed coworker decided to have a boxing match with the computer. I'm not even exaggerating, he scared his client that had come in and they left.
Other happenings while I've been alone at work: 
-Blocked inside by several large men demanding tattoos.(√ó3)
-Screamed at and had things thrown at me for not giving out the owners phone number (turned out THIS WAS HIS FATHER)
-Been threatened to be punched by coworkers.
-Sexually harassed by owners friends/clients
-Had a coworker say he was going to commit suicide and had to defuse that
-Have been told repeatedly my medical condition is fake and I shouldn't go to my drs appointments and instead need to be at the shop (they also think vaccines cause autism ü§£)
-Shop owner has assaulted a family member for being at the shop(x2)
-Numerous rumors have been started by the owners wife saying my bf is abusive. (Hes not and it's a laughable rumor)
-equipment stolen and broken by others in the shop


I feel like this is utterly insane! And everyone is telling me I'm overreacting and ""you need to get used to it, you're a female"" 
üôÉ I feel so trapped in this position. Idk what to do. Help?! Do I jump ship and just be jobless for awhile till I find something or suck it up? I cant look and work there, it's a small community and once I start looking elsewhere I need to make sure all my stuff is already out of there.

111,"I've never posted on reddit to be frank. My girlfriend suggested I do. So here I am, at the end of the road, with no clue what I'm supposed to do. I've had Robles with depression for about 11 years now, but in recent times I think about ending it everyday. At the very least I visualize slicing open my arm, the depth of it, the blood gushing out. It's always there.

I live in a developing country with no social security or really any kind of support system in place for pretty much anything. I am so heavily in debt that I don't even have the strength to find out just how much. I recently gave interviews and even managed to get a job which I can't take. I was hoping that job would help me with my debts, help me get back on my feet. I'm so broke right now that my checking account is in negative and I had to walk back 10k from my interview and sleep hungry because I have no money. On top of it all, I'm meant to support my brother and I can barely give him enough to feed himself, let alone give him enough to attend college. I'm fucking up his life because I fucked up mine.

My mom who stays in another country has an apartment she'd like to sell which is currently resided by her mother and sister-in-law (SIL) who are absolutely horrible to her and won't leave. As I mentioned, not a lot of support systems where I am and courts are backlogged. My whole family is in a financial rut so my mum can't come down and fight a legal battle to get possession of her own house which she'd like to sell for some financial support.

I'm made POA and am supposed to fight the case. How I'm supposed to pay the lawyers I don't know. I'm scared my mums SIL, who is known to have crooked friends will do something to me to disrupt court proceedings. On top of that I get calls from creditors every single day. With no laws governing what they can do, they are Hella abusive and threatening. Soon they'll be making visits to my house. Even if I do manage to get a job while fighting the case in court. I'm so far behind on payments that my creditors will be making visits to my workplace if I get a job (they really have no boundaries or laws governing them). If that leads to termination, I can kiss getting another job goodbye.

Thought about filing for bankruptcy to get some breathing room but even that'd require me hiring a lawyer which I cannot afford and trips to court. My girlfriend has helped me financially as much as she can. She still helps me out with meals every now and again, even used her car to go for interviews. But now I have to move to another city because the legal case is there. I'm scared of leaving behind the one person who has been my support through it all. Sometimes I feel like she deserves much better than me. My brain convinces me that she's pulling away when it's me who is pushing her away when all she's doing is trying to help.

I really don't know what I can do right now to get myself out of this. I can't take more of my creditors, and listening to how poorly my mum is treated is by her own mother. My grandmum told her she's a bitch and deserves to lie in dirt. This broke her and it broke me. I don't even think I'm in a frame of mind where I'd be able to work even if I got a job.

What do I do? What would you guys do if you ever found yourself in my situation?",12Sep2018,2
112,"I (23male) am struggling with myself and everything. I‚Äôm not quite sure what I should do, what I should be doing, where I should be going, or anything. The idea of love destroys me as if I‚Äôm a hopelesss romantic, my life is constant chaos and confusion with no set direction, and I‚Äôm just always in a constant state of fear/stress and dealing with ‚Äòhealth‚Äô issues. 


the idea of love destroys me, It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt talk to woman or struggle in the department of going out and about. But it doesn‚Äôt interest me as much as it others, I just want a girl that will be there for me, care, and support me through things. Not that she has to bend backwards for me or anything, but I just want to find someone that I can try to build a future with and look forward to seeing/talking to everyday. It‚Äôs so hard, even now I‚Äôm currently ‚Äútalking‚Äù to someone but their sister right off the bat told me she‚Äôs not looking for anything serious (even though talking to her it doesn‚Äôt seem that way) and it‚Äôs hard for me to talk to someone when I‚Äôm questioning what their intent is, if she‚Äôs wants to just be FWB that‚Äôs no problem but I wouldn‚Äôt want to plan little social events and ‚Äúdates‚Äù with a fwb, but st the same time she seems to want me at these things and calls me out (jokingly) for not kissing her when I see her. So I‚Äôm confused with that and what I should even do with her or the route towards love in general. 

My life, I‚Äôve flip flopped between a few jobs in the past few months, an old boss got me a security job at a high end retail store, I missed one day (given my fault but there was a misunderstanding on who was working that day) and my boss accused me of being a drug addict and hung the phone up on me, so I got a warehouse job for the meantime and now the security wants me back, the warehouse isn‚Äôt ideal money or great money, but it‚Äôs money and I just kind of auto-pilot while I‚Äôm there. I‚Äôm not trying to survive anymore, I‚Äôm not trying to work towards goals or anything. It‚Äôs as if I have given up on myself and don‚Äôt care. I kinda feel emotionless, sometimes I just fall into a depression or a ‚Äúmood‚Äù and stop caring about everything. Idk what‚Äôs wrong with me but I‚Äôm trying to just get better with myself and everything else. I know I‚Äôm an average guy (sometimes my confidence makes me feel a bit above average) but my insecurities and self consciousness just makes me feel way worse than I should about myself, I struggle to talk to people, get filled with anxiety, can‚Äôt maintain eye contact or even continue conversations. 

To top it all off, I‚Äôm constantly paying people ‚Äúoff‚Äù, helping my mom with money, friends are always trying to do things and when I don‚Äôt have money they spot me so it‚Äôs more money I owe, I don‚Äôt ever have free time to hangout with friends anymore during the week, my house/room is a complete mess, my life is a mess. I don‚Äôt do basic self care, consistently hurt myself (through working hard not self-harm), and just don‚Äôt have hope even though all I want to do is improve myself, not only for others but mainly myself. 

Does anyone know what I should do, or where I should start. Or even any advice towards any of these things I said, if so I‚Äôd gladly appreciate it! I don‚Äôt normally post on reddit but figured by doing this, this is a step in the right direction and I‚Äôll be able to help myself get better and maybe even be able to pay it forward one day :)

114,I'm 17 and I was with my friends driving home from school on Monday when we got hit by another car. I can't remember what happened before or during the impact but I remember waking up on the road and seeing all the debris from the crash. I saw that another driver was helping my friends out of the car so I ran over to help him and I saw my friend who was driving completely decapitated and my other friends were both unconscious. The ambulance came and I woke up in the hospital on Tuesday. The other driver was a single dad with 4 kids and from what I was told he wanted to kill himself and  drove directly into us the truck went straight through our windshield and I was luckily sitting in the back left seat which was least damaged. My other 2 friends also died I'm not sure how. I keep dreaming of the crash and I remember walking up to our car and letting my other friend drive instead of me. If I was driving maybe I would have stopped it? Maybe I would've went down a different road? I'm not sure and I can't seem to shake the guilt I have. The community has paid for their funerals next week and I'm not sure if I can bring myself to go. I haven't told anyone yet and I have no friends or family to visit me in hospital so I feel very lonely. Sometimes during the day I imagine myself jumping out of the window. I already have social anxiety so it makes it difficult to tell the doctors and nurses how I'm feeling. I'm unsure about what to do. I miss them so much I wish I could have drove instead. ,12Sep2018,18

So my issue is kind of self explanatory in the title. So I go to a small (1,200 people) art college in Detroit. I am a sophomore, and am having trouble meeting new people. I came into this school knowing three other people, one whom I‚Äôm rooming with as of now. The other two I don‚Äôt talk to since I‚Äôm not friends with them (because of decisions they make and I don‚Äôt want to be around that stuff). 

So the obvious approach is to be social in my classes and to go to clubs. My school has clubs, but they NEVER meet up, and if they do, they‚Äôre dead. Half of the clubs that are listed on the school website don‚Äôt even exist. The people that are in my classes, I already know since I‚Äôve had class with many of them last year (since we are all the same major we all take the same classes). Some classes have people I‚Äôve never met before, such as English, but it‚Äôs almost impossible to try and meet someone in that class since you can‚Äôt talk during class, and I have to leave ASAP after that class to go to another class right after it. 

I currently have three other roommates, but they aren‚Äôt always available to hang out, and I don‚Äôt want to always rely on them. This past weekend two of my roommates went home, and the other one was around campus doing work all day. I had no one to be with and it made me feel alone. I made friends with some guys on my floor last weekend but I think they‚Äôre ghosting me now. That kinda killed me since I hung out with them Saturday night and Sunday night, and one of the guys reacted with me really well. (In a good friend way). 

At my school, it‚Äôs also hard sometimes to go out and meet people. The school I go to is known for being hard and gives a lot of homework. So during the week I‚Äôm flooded with work and can‚Äôt hang out with people, so that‚Äôs also why I‚Äôm having trouble meeting people. I want to be social, but it‚Äôs almost like the school is holding me back. 

So my question is: what can I do to put myself out there more? Many people already have developed friend groups so it‚Äôs so hard to try and find new people. I really just don‚Äôt know what to do to. ",12Sep2018,1

Her dad answered and asked me all these questions like who are you why you calling her you should be sleeping like my daughter. I apologized many times, calling him sir. She text me saying she‚Äôs so embarrassed and sorry but I‚Äôm more embarrassed and I‚Äôm anxious for some reason and the feeling won‚Äôt go away.

121,"I went to a salon I‚Äôve never been to last Saturday to get my hair color toned. I haven‚Äôt washed it since until today with ACV and when I looked in the mirror I noticed my left side still has some brassy tones compared to my right and it‚Äôs pretty obvious if you look carefully. 

Would it be bad to go back tomorrow and tell them to fix it and leave without paying or am I expected to pay AGAIN for the service? I think my hair on the left was already not toned fully that day but I didn‚Äôt realize it until now. My boyfriend pointed it out yesterday but I didn‚Äôt really look carefully. 

The salon is more of a go in to get what you wNt done, not like those high end ones where they give you snacks and service you well. I also didn‚Äôt ask any questions about how long it should last but I would assume it should last longer than 4 days. ",12Sep2018,2

123,"I'm 17 years old and I'm currently in 10th grade and I live in a small town in Germany, there's a  big city called Frankfurt am Main about 1 hour from here. And for quite some time now, whenever I go there to see family members or just go there to go shopping, I get insanely fascinated by people (mostly men) who wear suits and start fantasizing about their lifes or fantasize what it's like going on a business trip. 

This city has like a financial district where like all the tall buildings are and mostly people with suits are walking around (by the way this city is very known for its stock  market and financial institutions and big banks). 

I often find myself walking around that district just to see and observe these people while I sometimes look up seeing those huge buildings around me and simply being so amazed by it. Everytime I see someone walking around with a suit, I feel a deep desire to choose a job that requires you to wear one because it's just soo fascinating to me, the business world in general, I guess. Now I don't wanna sound like an immature child but I probably am. Though it really fascinates me that much, even though I also know how ridiculous it sounds. 

Since I'm graduating next year (when you finished school till 10th grade you are free to choose what you want to do : continuing going to school till 13th grade to have the highest education level in order to be granted access to study everything you want in this country, or doing an apprenticeship which sounds very monotonous to me) I'm very sure that I'm going to choose continuing going to school although they say those years are very stressful because they are kind of introducing you to the university lifestyle and are also trying to prepare you for it, so that's what it makes it so stressful. But I have no clue what to study yet. All I know is that I love English so much, which I think you already can tell ;) 

I'm very aware of the fact that, if you wear a suit people automatically treat you better and have a lot more respect for you than as if you would be wearing casual clothes. But that's certainly not the reason why I am soo fascinated by it. I actually don't why but I don't think it's that. 

I have never ever interacted with people from the business world although I was always eager to speak with all of those individuals in real life because their lifes seemed very interesting to me but most of them are like in their late 20s or early, mid 30s. Which I sometimes hope I could just be. I'm already very excited to turn 30 :D

If anyone has some words of wisdom to give, I would be very grateful.

124,"Probably my last post on here after I was on here every day seeking advice for my relationship ultimately leading up to me and my girlfriend breaking up earlier today.

I felt uncomfortable with my now ex talking to this dude she used to be friends with benefits with. They were on their final days of texting eachother everyday till he started going to our school. 

She changed right after and for the worst. She started talking to the dude as much or a lot more than me. She started lying and hiding stuff. It really seemed like since he was closer to her, I was being pushed to the sidelines. I understand wanting to catch up for missed time but they never stopped talking like I said. 

We‚Äôve talked about all this multiple times but it always ended with her saying ‚Äúidk‚Äù. Today she pulled me aside and said ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôm not ready for a relationship‚Äù I said clearly and a lot more stuff I honestly wouldn‚Äôt want to bore you all with. 

After we broke up, at home I tell everyone we know that we aren‚Äôt a thing and one of our friends tell me she was crying when they saw her. 

I decided to send her a snap on Snapchat since we have streaks and don‚Äôt know if she wants to keep them. As I was thinking about it, she sent me one of just a black screen. 

I sent her one saying ‚ÄúWe were solid before the school year. The problems we had were easy enough to fix making one decision. This year was supposed to be easy but he came to our school and something in you saw that as an opportunity to be closer to him instead see him as a threat to our relationship. You changed. You‚Äôd rather keep him over anyone. Your losing me cause you don‚Äôt respect me or my feelings towards ya talking. He‚Äôs just a walking talking problem starter that you can‚Äôt seem to live without. Let me know when you realize all that and change for the better.‚Äù

She sent one back but I can really just keep it unopened and there forever if I wanted. I‚Äôm definitely going to avoid seeing her so why not her messages? I mean after all the disrespect she‚Äôs showed towards me, does she even deserve another response? What should I do reddit?",12Sep2018,1

134,"There's been a few things on my mind that brought this up. the two main points are college and buying a motorcycle.

_____

###College

I've talked to some of my friends who seem to regret getting student loans (maybe jokingly?), but all I can think is, ""was it not worth it?"" I haven't been to college yet, but with my recent layoff it's gained quite a bit of prevalence in my thoughts.

I guess my first question is, how is college even paid for? I'm guessing you pay some kind of lump sum upfront for a semester's worth of credits for a class? Is that right?

If I don't have the cash then I'll definitely be looking for grants and scholarships, but I'll likely have to go the route of getting student loans. The main thing is that I feel like I want to either do school full-time, or not at all. Full-time work and part-time school seems overwhelming for me.

I want to get settled in a field of work, with room to grow and that pays enough to let me enjoy having a stable life, working toward a home and a kid. Is it worth it to pay the price of looming debt to get that?

_____

###Motorcycle

On a different and separate note, I have a passion for riding motorcycles.

I've asked a couple times on /r/PersonalFinance and they say ""no"" to getting a loan for a ""for fun"" motorcycle. I don't doubt that's the smartest option, but how risky is it really to take out a loan so I can start enjoying myself sooner than later? Let me share an analogy:

You're not supposed to speed because it's risky, yet some people do it intentionally for the thrill.

On the other hand, I shouldn't collect debt for a ""toy"" because it's risky financially, but how bad is it really if I will be happier today?

Idk... I've been doing research for years, I have the gear, I have my permit, but I just don't have the motorcycle I want to really enjoy myself and make good memories touring states and carving canyons. Should some debt stop me from doing that?

_____

**TL;DR:** Shit costs money. Money I don't have. Should I be afraid of debt?

135,"Long version: In November 2017 I (F:21) was raped. After that I tried to meet new people and it was really hard. I met someone (M:23) who was really nice and who I really liked but it was really hard for me to get close to him as fast as he wanted me to. Talking to my best friend (F:20), she thought he was pushing me too hard and trying to make me do things too soon. Okay. So now read the short version... 

Short version: Okay. So I was seeing this guy for a few months around February 2018. We ended things because we weren‚Äôt compatible and he never put in any effort. I also got the feeling he was using me in a few different ways by manipulation. Of course during this entire time I talked to my best friend about how I was feeling. Starting in July, she started talking to him and has given him over $1500 and they are not officially dating but are leading up to it. I am not okay with it. I feel like he is manipulating her and not putting any effort into a relationship. But she doesn‚Äôt see it. I also live with her and she always wants to invite him over. I am unsure what to do and am wondering if I am overreacting.

150," I'm tired as hell but I'll do my best to summarize in the most concise way. Struggling with this so I'm here asking for help and thoughts on whether or not I made the right call. 

I (23M) have a friend (24F). We've been on and off FWBs for a couple months but the nature of our relationship is strictly platonic, my actions here are motivated by my love for her as a friend and not by romantic feelings at all. 

She's been dealing with an on and off ex who she describes as a toxic, abusive person. Over the past couple of months she's told me anecdotes of him, before she met me, hitting her while they were both drunk, laughing when she hit her head on her bed frame and refusing to take her to the hospital AND not letting her sleep and in general being a manipulative abuser. I met him today.


She has clear psychological problems, as do I, so she drinks to the point of being a functional alcoholic. When she's sober, she goes to great lengths to avoid him through not responding to texts, etc, but when she's drunk she calls him to have sex and hang out. I've had to come over to her house multiple times because she said she was afraid he'd try to break in and hurt her.


Tonight I got home from a busy day to her, drunk, calling me multiple times and begging me to DRIVE HIM TO HER HOUSE SO THEY COULD FUCK. I refused, told her to go to sleep and hung up. She kept calling me, saying she is going to drive drunk to his house and get him. 

I hung up, already tired as hell and stormed 20 minutes to her house and blocked her car in her driveway so she couldn't do something stupid. When I got into her doorway she told me that he was on the way and to not mention the fact that I know about his abuse. Like she was BEGGING ME not to give any indication that I know.


I didn't leave because I felt as if she was in danger and I wanted to be there to protect her so I sat and waited. He shows up and introduces himself, makes himself a drink etc, while my rage is building. I want to fucking kill him. I lost somebody I loved dearly to suicide because she was raped and physically abused. My blood is boiling and I'm just sitting there wanting to give this dude a knuckle tracheoctomy.


And I explode. Start yelling, saying that I know what he did while he tries to explain himself. She looks at me like I just doomed the entire human race while I'm going off on this guy, granted I'm still sitting down because I want to hear him out. ""Dude, look at me, I don't want to fight you man, look at my arms, I'm skinny as shit"" verbatim what he said. 


He goes into a long diatribe about how he would never hit a woman, how things are miscommunicated and how these stories are just exaggerated versions of drunk pseudo-fights they've gotten into. I don't buy it but my friend is nodding her head. He's scared, a little angry and going on for 10 minutes about his moral convictions against hitting women, etc. 


I sit through it, willing to hear him out because it sounds genuine but I know how manipulative certain people can be. I ask her if he's telling the truth and she sits there and nods her head, dissociating from the situation. I ask her again and she looks at me and says ""Matt, you can leave now""... 

I stand up, tell him I don't know who to believe and that we aren't getting anywhere. Tell him that if I ever see a mark on her at any point I'm going to wear his ass out and leave.


Thank you for getting to the end. I haven't slept in what feels like a decade so some of it isn't as easy to read or follow as it should be, but my plea for advice is - did I do the right thing by leaving? Should I have beaten the shit out of this dude? Did I betray my friend by not knowing who to believe? Did I put her in danger?

Not that I thought it would be a one time thing, but it happened again. I‚Äôm currently waiting to go home again...second time.

The dude in administration knows me and trusts that i‚Äôm not just trying to get off school, but explained that he can‚Äôt keep letting me go, because they don‚Äôt have an adequate explanation as to why I left. 

I know I can‚Äôt stay in school when i‚Äôm in that state. I have a big headache, verge of crying, barely able to breathe, barely able to socialize, learn nothing, ignoring these terrible thoughts in my head, time passes extremely slowly, I just can‚Äôt stay in here like that. If i‚Äôm not able to leave then I don‚Äôt know what will happen to me. 

As a bit of an update of what happened after the first time this happened, my mother finally agreed to take me to a psychiatrist and I had a conversation with one for the first time. We couldn‚Äôt have talked for more than 20 minutes, but he agreed that I did indeed have a panic attack but that there‚Äôs probably nothing wrong with me.
He barely heard my story. I feel like he cut off the conversation and knows nothing about me still. Aren‚Äôt these sessions supposed to last an hour or so?

156,"So recently my relationship with my dad has been really affecting me. Whenever i think about him or see him i always have that sad and nervous feeling in the pit of my stomach (if you've ever experienced that). I dont know how to make things better and its really making me feel guilty, like how did everything go so wrong. 

In middle school when i was very depressed all i would do was lock myself and not come out because i was too guilty. I missed days of school to where i got kicked out of my school district. My dad thought it was because of my friend and because i was lazy which really hurt me. He would say hurtful things about my friend when it had nothing to do with her. The thing is my dad is always saying shit like oh ""its because this person, its because you watch that on your phone, its because youre up all night getting brainwashed by this person"". Always assuming. That was never the case. It was because i was mentally fucked and thinking about suicide. The thought of school and thosee horrible kids made my anxiety skyrocket, and the thought of hurting my parents, making them fight everyday tore at my so hard. To this day i still have mental issues and i havent gotten help.

From what i can remember thats when he became distant. Even when things got better he was distant. But now onto what my dad is like. I feel like i cant talk to him because he is judgemental and quiet. Whenever i would try to talk to him about something i feel like he just would want to end the conversation quickly. Sometimes he would ignore my questions or barely say anything about what i was saying. I think this is what triggers some of my anxiety. Hes also just hypocrite and jerk in general, hes always talking bad about strangers, about my mom and her side on the family like my grandma, uncles, and sisters. He involved me in family drama when i was very young like 8-10. He told me how bad my grandma, mom, sisters and uncles were. Told me spy on my mom and tell him who she was talking to which i actually did. This made me hate my mom and her side but now that im older i dont and now know that some of what he said was over exaggerated.I shouldnt have been involved in that at such a young age. All i wanted was for everyone to be happy. He even told me he would be gone if it wasnt for my brother and i. i know he doesnt love my mom, he just tolerates her. He also has a temper and has said some really hurtful things to me in his deep, scary voice that i will never forget. He was never a good role model in the first place.

Currently i dont really know whats up with us. Im doing really well in school now but our relationship isnt, i guess our relationship never recovered from middle school. We really have no connection at all. And i know nothing about him, where he lives, his family. I know none of my family on his side at all. He doesnt know what games, music, hobbies, or tv i like, hes never asked EVER. Basically all we do now when he comes over is say hi and hug and i just sit around him. And believe me ive tried to talk to him but its kind of a thing where both parties need to put in effort. Hes really not easy to talk to at all. We went to dinner and he literally didnt look at me or say anything, it was so uncomfortable. I tried talking but when he gave short responses i gave up. I think my dad is the reason i get extremely nervous around men (also from being sexually harassed for a long period of time by a peer). I fear being in a relationship with a man because i think it will go terribly like the relationship with my father. I fear talking to older men such as teachers because i always expect them to be as intimidating and judgemental as my dad.

I know he loves me but its hard to form a connection and bond when he wont even try. We never do father daughter things and it hurts me so bad. I want so badly to have a father figure who i can look up to, who can guide me. I still love him and desperately want to connect with him despite him not being a good dad. What do you guys think, should i stop beating a dead horse or keep trying, any suggestions? I just dont know anymore.",12Sep2018,1
157,"TL;DR at the bottom, although I‚Äôm trying to make this as short as possible.

This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. Sorry if this doesn‚Äôt seem well formulated. I am only 16 and I‚Äôm doing this on mobile.



Ever since I was younger, I would always side with my mom in almost every argument. My two older brothers would instead favor my dad. These arguments ranged from financial to social problems. Being a kid, I usually would overthink them and start going over the cliche divorce scenario in my head. Obviously, nothing ever happened. I always thought we fought too much for a normal family. We are the stereotypical well-off family living in Southern California in a very nice house. I think I should mention that my dad works night and day, 12 hours a day for 7 days a week, in his office. My mom works as a flight attendant.

Fast forward to the current day, I am now 16 years old, in high school. My two older brothers have gone off to college and are starting lives of their own. My dad still works behind a computer and my mom still gets free one day vacations twice a month in her ‚Äújob‚Äù (don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my mom more than anything in the world and credit lots of my success to her). Being the most like my dad, he will usually ask for my opinion in arguments. These arguments always happen when she has wine. She will be an angel the next moment then a sip of wine turns her crazy.

The most prominent example of her drinking problem was today. My mom went to a friends house, and took her car. I was playing video games and heard a car pull up to the garage and I looked out the window and saw my mom stumble out of the car. I didn‚Äôt think much about it and went back to playing video games. Later, I heard my mom screaming things like ‚ÄúF*ck you!‚Äù and ‚ÄúI f*cking hate you!‚Äù to my dad. I walk downstairs and hid behind the corner and my dad is holding her keys. He said that he saw her drive into our driveway while drunk. It is easy to tell when my mom is drunk, I have absolutely no doubt in my mind she was. She kept saying he was making things up, and called him a liar to his face. My dad didn‚Äôt raise his voice even once. After a barrage of horrible insults launched by my mom, she demanded to be taken back to her friends house. My dad painfully agreed. I stayed home, and my dad left in his car with my mom to take her back to her friends house. 


When they got back, after more insults, my mom went up to her room. My dad told me she kept saying to take her to her car (to prove that she didn‚Äôt drive herself home), and they (obviously) didn‚Äôt find it. My dad was fed up so he just drove her back home. When they got back, my mom said to my dad, ‚ÄúSee I told you, the car is here.‚Äù If that didn‚Äôt make sense, it‚Äôs not just you. That was my moms defense for being called out.

Fast forward through a couple minutes of arguing and my mom is now in her room and me and my dad are talking in his office. The worst sentence I‚Äôve ever heard all of my life was uttered by her as she went upstairs, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got someone else who actually loves me‚Äù. Oh god I hope she isn‚Äôt cheating. I went to my dads office and we decide to text my moms friend (we will call her Barb) to ask what happened. My dad texted ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on with [mom]?‚Äù It took a long time to get a response. Several times the 3 little dots indicating a person is typing popped up, then disappeared. Finally, we got the response ‚ÄúShe just had a few drinks, same as us.‚Äù My dad requested him and Barb meet tomorrow face to face to discuss this night. 

This isn‚Äôt the first this has happened, and certainly won‚Äôt be the last. Some more examples were on her birthday, we went to Las Vegas and she hit and scratched my dad after an argument about not wanting to be there (even though she suggested Las Vegas herself- and yes, she was drunk at the time).

But never have I ever seen her do what parents try to keep their kids from doing. Being a horrible wife and mom while drunk is one thing, but going behind the wheel is another.

Please, please give me advice. My dad is relatively old and has been complaining about chest pain since this happened. I‚Äôm worried for his health. I don‚Äôt want my mom to give him a heart attack. 

TL;DR- My mom is an alcoholic who crossed the line driving drunk and I need advice on what to do to save her from herself

160,"Trigger warning: physical abuse 

I've been thinking about this a lot recently. How can people be both so terrible and so wonderful at the same time. 
My step dad has been a part of my life since I can remember (bio dad in and out of jail and into serious drugs) and honestly he was an amazing dad. He made me feel so loved so often, and most of the time treated me as his own. He was my DAD - - taught me to ride my bike, tie my shoes, fix my dirt bike etc. All the dad stuff. 

But there was also physical abuse from my dad (very subtle though, thrown against walls, down stairs, head slammed in doors, screamed at etc. Didn't realize it was abuse because it wasn't 'being hit'). It culminated in him attacking me and holding me up by my throat after my mom died.
He was also kind of emotionally abusive - - he had temper where he would SCREAM at me for doing the smallest non-issue. He once during an argument with my mom said 'it is the reason we fight', pointing at me. I was probably 9 or 10... Maybe younger?

How can be be such an amazing father and yet have such a negative impact on my life as well? ",12Sep2018,0

I was hurt but I figured I was overthinking it and kept walking. I was wearing loud flip flops which they probably heard because just then the door opened and the girl turned back and said ""He's was right outside"" and ran back in to start laughing.

197,"So we have been in a relationship since 6 years and live together for 3 years now. We expect a child in January. So far our costs were pretty low in comparison to our income. We payed only about 380‚Ç¨ rental fee and had about 250‚Ç¨ running costs. I work since 2 Years and she does since before our relationship startet. I work for 40h with a net income of 1960‚Ç¨ and she works for 20h for a net income of 1090‚Ç¨. when i didn't work she took most of the costs and when that changed and i had more income i took most of the cost. About 4 Months ago we decided that now we are probably even so we want to divide costs by 50/50 now. Now that we expect a child things started to change. 1) We will need a bigger flat. 2) She will stay at home for the first 20 Months and recieve parental leave benefit of about 624‚Ç¨ at that time.

Now i know that it is a lot of work taking care of a child and that we can not simply split the costs in half when she will do the main work of our household and for the child. So i suggested we might split the costs in comparison to the income we have. For example: Currently my income is around 65% of our total income. So i would pay 65% of the costs that regard both of us (rent, running costs like electricity or heating, food,...). I think this would be the fairest cost division so far, especially since we have almost the same hourly wage.

BUT: Then we talked about buying a flat using a loan. We both thought this makes more sense since the monthly costs would not be that much higher than renting (thinking of a Loan term of 35 years). I said that we would need to talk about the question of whom the property belongs if we split up. My opinion is that if i pay 65% over that period i own 65% of that flat. Hers is that i should pay 65% of all the monthly costs and each one of us owns 50:50 of the flat.

Apart from that i offered to straight up give her 500‚Ç¨ in the first 20 months so her income would be 1124‚Ç¨ at that time and mine 1460‚Ç¨. The other rules would still apply so my percantage would shrink to 56% in that time period.

TLDR; My suggestion:

For the 20 first months where she doesn't work i will add 500‚Ç¨ of my income to the 624‚Ç¨ she gets from the state
All our costs that regard both of us or our child will be devided by the percentage of personal income to common income
property that results from that costs is owned by each one of us in percantage of the money put in
She wants to leave out the last point.

I actually couldn't find any information on how this will be dealt with legally if we wouldn't make an agreement. Does anyone of you know? Do you think my suggestion sounds fair? Or am i selfish?",12Sep2018,1
198,"I was just offered a full time position at my part time job! I‚Äôm excited but also nervous because I‚Äôll be moving my hours to 12-6 am Monday-Friday. I really am quite worried about how to schedule my life. 

I work as a crisis line worker, meaning I staff lines like the suicide prevention lifeline. I mention this because it can be quite stressful. My last call tonight was a man with a gun to his head. So even though I got out two hours ago I am still awake thinking about it. This is a common occurrence so I‚Äôm not sure exactly when I can get to bed on a regular basis. 

I also want to go to the gym at some point. Would it be easier to get up and go before work, or when I get out of work in the morning? If I go in the mornings I would get home around 8 am and then hopefully fall asleep 10-6pm.

199,"As you can read from the title I am in a doubt to invite a certain classmate to a reunion. This mainly goes about two people, my best friend (let's call him John) and the classmate (let's call him Tom). John and I had the idea to hold a reunion with our high school classmates. We already have the contact information from everyone except Tom. 

Tom was always a weird and kinda creepy guy. Not that he was not nice (to me at least) but the girls in our class were really uncomfortable with Tom. I lost contact with Tom because he and John went to another school after graduating. 

Fast forward a few years and Tom tried to steal Johns then girlfriend. Naturally, John hates Tom for that and broke all contact. I heard stories from Johns classmates from his new education that Tom had become a grade A asshole. He was a lying, cheating and manipulating jackass who saw women as mere objects. 

Because of that I am in doubt to invite Tom. Multiple people stated that they do not want Tom to be invited and the others don't care if Tom gets invited or not. I can agree with the reasons to not invite Tom but he has never wronged me personally. 

As much of an asshole Tom has become he was still our classmate. I just don't know what to do with this situation. Should I invite Tom or not? ",12Sep2018,1

204,"So I come from a very traditionally catholic family. Growing up there was no such thing as mental illness or disorders, just crazy people or people who need to pray for God's love. I know now that that's a load of bologna but I still have a hard time differentiating between personal shortcomings and symptoms that warrant professional intervention. If you could help me, I'd be sincerely grateful!

I've always had a hard time managing stress. As a kid I used to have horrible anxiety. I mean, crying so hard I'd physically give myself a rash anxiety. It was never diagnosed or anything but I don't know what else to call it. It's not so bad now but I find myself still having chest pain, headaches and not being able to think or sleep once I start worrying.

A few months ago, physical side affects started to appear. Hair loss, a loss of appetite, acne, brittle nails, tons of fun stuff. I've calmed down since then and they have started to go away. However, I still find myself panicking over small things and doing ridiculous, often unrelated tasks to try to feel like I have some sense of control or else I'll be up all night (i.e. Not being able to sleep until I file my nails because I almost failed an exam). 

Until then, it was sort of just something I dealt with. I'm normally very optimistic and happy-go-lucky so bringing this up to my friends rarely elicits little more than a ""But your so happy! It's a rough patch. Just relax and you'll be fine!"" sort of reaction which doesn't really help. (But maybe they're right? IDK) 

A friend of mine saw me crying and suggested that I might need to consider talking to a professional. 

Ive googled it before and a lot of the solutions are things as simple as reading or yoga or eating fruit. So I wonder, if the treatment is something that simple, is it worth going to a doctor over? I tend to over think things and I'm worried that I'm just being dramatic or paranoid. Like, maybe if I just learn to not be so uptight this wouldn't be an issue? 

I think the main reason I'm hesitant to go to a professional is that it's not completely uncontrollable. I have some tips and tricks that help keep me calm when I feel a panic attack coming on. Humming a specific song and tapping my fingers helps me come down once I start panicking. So, if I have a few methods to keep it in check, maybe it's not as bad as I think? Or I'm in denial. Again, not sure. 

There are a TON of books on Amazon that tackle the subject and if being a little ball of stress is something that can be solved with a 100-page book than it can't be that serious right? 

I'm really not sure what to do. I seriously don't want to go to a doctor if they're just gonna tell me to breathe and do stretches whenever I'm upset.  

I know reddit is NOT the same as going to the doctor. I'm not asking for treatment or a diagnosis, I just want to know if these are things I shouldn't try to handle on my own. 

Any advice is welcome.

205,"My husband and I went out recently to have dinner with our 10yo son and 7yo daughter. We had a great time, eating in a cozy garden of a cozy restaurant, had some dessert and went for a walk through the park. There were some musicians playing, so we stopped and listened, and danced... It was really an almost magical night. 

Nearby, there was also an ice cream stand. My daughter dragged me to that stand and said, ""I want a scoop"", which I refused and explained to her, that we just had a sumptuous dinner and dessert (pancakes with Nutella) and that she will get ice cream the next time. Of course, she was not amused, yet really sad, but not crying and she didn't make a scene of it. I just wanted to went back to the music, a stranger approached me, loudly commenting what a mother I am, that a little scoop of ice cream will not make her fat, and that I should watch my figure more and not hers (I'm not fat, but I'm not sexy either). I told him, that it is none of his business and turned around, but shortly after that stranger overrun me, with a scoop of ice cream for my daughter, which he handed her, and she gladly took. He just ran away and left me confused and really, really mad. 

I took the ice cream from my daughter and said, that she is still not allowed to eat it. Then she started to cry, loud...

208,"For as long as I can remember, my girlfriend (who up until now I was considering engaging to) always had a few ex-SOs and a ""stalker"" that would always text her. She told me about them texting her, and I told her that I trusted her more than enough to handle the situation and respond appropriately. Well, that's where I fucked up. 

     Just a small side note to help me rationalize part of the next bit to myself: She had a bit of an angry episode the other day (which she *did* apologize for), and went through my phone for no discernable reason. This was the first time, to my knowledge, that she had ever done that. Of course, I had nothing to hide, so nothing was found ofc. 

Well anyway, lets go back to where I left off, with me fucking up by trusting her to respond to those guys appropriately (AKA telling them to politely fuck off). Today I am driving her back home from an appointment and she accepts a call through the car from her ""stalker""  named ""DF"". She had always refused to block him becuase an attorney had apparently *told* her to just let him keep texting while sending nothing back to ""stack evidence"" for a restraining order. Well, during this call from DF in the car, he started asking her why one day she sends nudes to him and says how much she loves him and the next day she's either extremely hostile or ignores him completely. She only denied what he said through a whisper to me, while just loudly laughing at him after he said this instead of denying it. She hangs up. She asks me if I trust her, and the fact that she would mever do anything like that to me. Like an idiot, I tell her I trust her. Well, later that night (tonight) I have a very strong gut feeling to check her texts. This would be my first time doing this, but as mentioned earlier I felt that it was possible to rationalize, especially given the circumstance. Well, I found exactly what I was hoping not to: her talking in a sexy manner to this DF guy and another ex named ""Brent"". Not only that, but also sending naked pictures them both that I was told were ""only for me"".

212,"TL:DR I'm in a long term relationship that I'm happy with but feel like I've missed out on the stage of my life where I could go out and enjoy casual dating and sex. 

I (m21) have been with my current girlfriend (f21) for over 2 years, we've been living together and paying our own bills for most of that, have combined finances, and our long term life plans and goals have been made under the assumption that we are in it for the long run. 

I'm totally content with my relationship, I don't feel deprived of sex or emotional comfort, we have been supporting each other in what we're both pursuing. She is and always has been my 10/10	and I've never wanted to be with anybody else.

When she met me, I was rather skinny, unhealthy, unkempt and not very confident. She was way out of my league but we wound up together somehow anyway.

Shortly after meeting her, I developed a strong passion for fitness and health and have seen remarkable changes in my personality, confidence and obviously physically as right now I'm channelling that passion into bodybuilding (namely men's physique) and have embarked on a career in the health and fitness industry. 

So here's where the problem arises...

Although we club together, I still like to go out clubbing with just my buddies because I still enjoy a guys night out. (she is aware and is fine with it and goes out clubbing with her girlfriends when she can). 

Since I've become a lot more confident and attractive, I get approached a lot when my friends and I go out. Even when I try to wingman for them it seems like whatever I do girls are trying to come on to me instead. I don't say this to be arrogant I'm just trying to present how I'm feeling clearly. 

I'm not a doucbebag so I try to make it clear I'm taken, I don't flirt or do anything like that. 

The problem is, now that I've gotten to this point in my life where I feel confident and attractive, I feel like I've missed out on the excitement of dating and casual sex and that I've settled down too soon. 

I don't desire other women, I just miss the excitement of meeting new people. If I could meet my current girlfriend and go through that process all over again every time I go out, that would make me happy, but obviously that isn't possible. 

Although it's just something on my mind now, I'm afraid that as time goes on this may turn into resentment and hurt our relationship. 

I'm sure part of this is hormones and being young, but is there a way I can just feel content and happy and get ride of this innate desire to essentially go out and have casual sex/date ect? ",12Sep2018,1

About 8 months ago, I was at work and my husband texted me saying she was at my house (she knew I wasn‚Äôt home). She wanted to talk to my husband to get him to convince him to forgive me. I was very creeped out that she would show up at my house to talk to my husband. My husband told her to go away.

At this point, I started worrying about her mental stability and started to suspect she had a personality disorder although I have no proof of that.

About a month or two after all this went down, I moved across the country. I have not been in contact with her since.

Then the letters started. I got two letters addressed to my new work that the return address is my old work. They are both unsigned.

218,"I'm a high school graduate, fairly studied in a few trades but not certified. West Virginia doesn't really have a lot of opportunity for jobs or a trade school, and I'd like to move to Indiana. While I dislike the idea of leaving my family here, I think that moving would provide far greater room for improvement in my life. I'm currently employed with a franchised organization that has a branch up there, so it is my hope to obtain a position through transfer. It doesn't pay much more than minimum wage, but having a minimum wage job when I hit the ground is better than having no job at all while I try and land one of those sweet factory gigs they've got going up there.

I contend on saving all of my money towards this goal very tightly until tax season comes around. As I pay what appears to be 22% of my check in taxes, I presume I'll get an okay refund back.

I'd like to figure out how to:
A) Figure out how much money I'll realistically need to save in order to finance such a large move with relatively little to no assistance.

B) Find an affordable, reasonable place to live. My current thinking on this involves Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace.

C) Develop an understanding of what kind of safety nets are available to me. Is AAA available and worthwhile? Are there similar services for other facets?

D) Beef up my resume, so that when I do manage to get up there and moved in to an affordable place I can continue my savings and perhaps eventually progress to the point of attending a trade school.

Posting on a throwaway account 

Bit of a back story- I‚Äôve (F21) been with my boyfriend (M21) for almost 3 years and we have a great relationship, before we met I had been on a dating app and had been talking to a guy. We never made anything of it because he lives a few hours away from me. When I met my now boyfriend, the flirting and pics stopped but It‚Äôs been over 3 years and we talk almost every day just on and off about random things  (my boyfriend knows this and doesn‚Äôt mind) this guy next week is coming to the same town that I live in and wants to meet up (just as friends, we have already discussed) I feel like I should tell my boyfriend about it but I know he won‚Äôt be happy because he knows we were talking on a dating app prior to us getting together. I feel guilty because I‚Äôve never lied to him before but I know he won‚Äôt be happy that we are meeting up and I just want to know is it considered cheating? ",12Sep2018,2

235,"          Hello, I‚Äôm new to reddit and have been lurking since I got the app (a few weeks ago) but now I have a big problem of my own that I really need help with. 

           I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been this stressed in my entire life. I just started college (community) to eventually transfer but I‚Äôve never actually wanted to go to college (mother is very stern on making sure I go) as I struggled immensely with high school (very surprised I even graduated hs) and at first I thought that starting college wouldn‚Äôt be too bad, but it‚Äôs really hitting me hard. I can‚Äôt keep up with anything any of the teachers want as I have horrible motivation and concentration issues making it really hard for me to get anything done. This in itself is stressing the ever loving fuck out of me because I know that if my mother finds out how much I‚Äôm struggling or if I tell her how much college is making me lose my mind and go completely insane she‚Äôll throw it to the side and just say I‚Äôm being dramatic. I‚Äôve had 3 break downs in just a day and a half because of this and I feel like I‚Äôm going to eventually crack. I have health issues that are heavily related to stress which has caused some awful ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù I guess you could call them, which I haven‚Äôt had since middle school. 
          
           Not only this but I‚Äôve started to develop an interest in someone and it‚Äôs so hard to read them to tell whether or not they may feel the same. We spend a lot of time together by both playing games and watching shows and movies as well as hanging out with each others‚Äô friend group(s). Sometimes I get hints that they like me, such as staying up really late just to talk to me or simply spending a lot of the day with me and telling me things they don‚Äôt share with anyone else. But I feel like that might just be what they consider our friendship to be. I think about them a lot, especially when I‚Äôm stressed to try and help calm myself, but that‚Äôs not working anymore as they‚Äôve become apart of my biggest stresses, along with college shit. I‚Äôm afraid to say anything out of fear that I may ruin our friendship as well as freak them out into straight up just never talking to me again, but it‚Äôs starting to eat me alive as I worry over every little thing that we discuss, as if trying to find the deeper meaning or trying to find any hiccups I might‚Äôve said to cause them distress or a reason to dislike me. 
          
           I would greatly fucking appreciate advice on what I should do, for either one or both situations as they are the two biggest things causing me great distress and getting rid of even one of them would lift a lot of weight off my shoulders.

          Sorry if this isn‚Äôt how these posts usually go, I‚Äôm not 100% on how to format everything and such. x",12Sep2018,2
236,"It's been almost a week since I last heard from them. I was in training prior. I worked two or three days every week for about a month. I received automated texts about scheduling and emails from management. Last week we had our first official training days for the location and they seem to go greatly.

Since then I've still been getting texts about scheduling but when I check there will be no shift for me. I haven't received any emails, which is especially strange because management emphasized to us today would be an important training day and tomorrow would be the official  opening.

They are usually speedy with their emails, I've experienced it and they even bragged about it in the training last week. I emailed them yesterday and still no response.

237,"My girlfriend and I were driving back home to Los Angeles from Las Vegas. Before we fell asleep the night before, we watched a quirky romantic movie. During the road trip, we were discussing how sweet the movie was, how the ending caused my girlfriend to cry and get emotional. We both vividly remembered the moment of looking into each other's eyes and acknowledging enjoying the movie.

&amp;#x200B;

The puzzling part is that we both don't remember anything else from the movie.

241,"I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm posting this here. Maybe because I have a difficult time talking about this to people IRL but here goes nothing.

I had an ugly breakup about 2 years ago. It was the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced in my life. I don‚Äôt want to go into details because it‚Äôs a long story but it was pretty bad. She cheated on me and when I found out I lost control of myself and my life. The words that I uttered on that day and the following weeks to her, when looking back at it now, were absolutely unconscionable. Called her a whore and told her that her parents should be slapped for raising a prostitute. Called up the guy and told him he wasn‚Äôt raised right because he didn‚Äôt have a father. I mean I quit my job I was drinking almost 24 hours a day and I was unable to process anything but that doesn‚Äôt excuse the words I said. I was on a scorched earth policy and basically shut down any help that people offered by abusing them with words.

I also started hating the entire gender because of this one incident and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm still not completely over it. I have gone to a therapist. I took medication. Things are relatively normal now but whenever I see a girl or woman who is showing even a relatively less amount of skin, my brain immediately goes to ‚Äúshe is a whore‚Äù mode. But thankfully my brain does not let that thought fester and I immediately figuratively slap myself in the face and tell myself that this is a horrible way to think.

Although that happens very infrequently, the words I uttered to people during that whole thing, I can‚Äôt seem to forget. I wake up at night thinking about those words. When I‚Äôm taking a break from work and not thinking about anything else, those words get replayed. Over and over again, day and night for the past 2 years. I don‚Äôt know what to do and sometimes I think maybe killing myself will finally stop these words from being replayed in my head but obviously that is not an option. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not suicidal but those thoughts do tend to creep up when I think about what I said.

My life is still not ok, even after 2 years, and I‚Äôm slowly trying to piece it back but the things I mentioned above still keeps bringing me back to the negative mindset that I‚Äôm trying so hard to get past. It feels like if I take a step forward, those words and the gender hating pulls me backward two steps. What I‚Äôm trying to ask is, how can I forgive myself for uttering those words? How can I move past this?",12Sep2018,2
242,"Can I have your advice about whether to move to Chicago from NYC?  

After 13 years in New York City, I am itching to get back home to be closer to my family.  His parents have passed on, so we don‚Äôt have any other family except my parents in Chicago.

However, my husband has an incredible, truly irreplaceable job in NYC.  He would make about 1/3 what he makes now.  It would hurt his pride to go from making 110k to about 40k, and I don‚Äôt want to do that.

I‚Äôve just found a place on my favorite street in my home city of Chicago.  To me, I feel like that is where I belong.  While the mortgage would be a bit high, I think I could make it work (but it would be high, and stressful for us).

Am I selfish to ask my husband to quit his job and move back home? 

Important: While my salary is high, my work is unstable (I am in sales and can be fired for not earning enough for my company).  On the other hand, my husband‚Äôs income is high, and his job stability rock solid.  Also, the condo in Chicago would require that both of us work to make ends meet.  Currently, we have a mortgage that just one of us can pay on a single salary.

244,"A guy \[19/m\] and a girl \[21/f\] are in a consensual friends with benefits relationship after they broke off their dating relationship. They haven't set ground rules out, but the girl told him that she was planning on having sex with him when they were dating, but wasn't sure she was ready.

When they start hooking up, they get down into their underwear and the guy starts to thrust into the girl's vagina (over top of her underwear) penetrating her slightly. It starts to hurt for him and he decides to try and initiate sex, so he reaches down and moves her underwear to the side quickly and then slowly starts to penetrate her. He checks to make sure she's enjoying it (which she is) and isn't saying anything objecting it (which she wasn't).

The girl on the other hand doesn't realize at the beginning that he had moved her underwear. It started feeling better for her and she just thought that it was her body reacting to what was going on. She still isn't aware that her underwear had been moved and asks ""hey are you still over top of my underwear"". After asking this question, the guy reaches down and moves his dick out and moves her underwear back over top of her vagina and responds ""yes it is"".

The girl feels that but keeps continuing the encounter. It isn't until a few weeks later when talking about it that the guy does tell her he was under her underwear. He took the ""hey are you over top of my underwear"" as a ""shit I shouldn't be doing this"" and immediately stopped because it was a no to him.

251,"Hi Reddit,

Our friendly neighbours have an outside-only dog who's just started howling at night. We know these neighbours to chat to, but we don't really *know* them. We don't know why the dog's only just started crying after three years of only very occasional noise. It's cold outside at this time of year - early Spring (poor boy) and he sounds cold and sad and lonely :(

What do we do?? 

1. Obviously we don't want to risk the relationship with the neighbours - we're both owners, so we'll have to live next to them for the foreseeable.

2. I would gently/delicately ask them if they know the dog is crying, but... how can they not? This seems pointless. 

3. Given that they know the dog is crying and it's been almost a week they must be making a decision to keep him outside. So asking them to try and keep him quiet also seems pointless - how would they even do that, without bringing him inside?

Any suggestions welcome. :( The dog crying is really upsetting to have to listen to - he's such a sweet boy - and it's also grating our nerves.

Disclaimer: as far as I'm concerned, keeping a dog outside-only, especially when it's cold outside, is awful, and if you only want an outside dog you shouldn't get a dog. Having said that we don't want to risk the relationship with the neighbours by calling authorities or lodging a complaint. The dog is healthy, I think, just sad and cold. :( ",12Sep2018,6

260,"I don't even know how to start this and I'm not sure if I can express my feelings in English, but I will give this a try.

I've always been the guy, that is just there and once people get to know me, they are always impressed about my personality. They think I'm a smart guy who knows exactly what he wants in life, how to proceed and just goes straight up where he wants. At least that's what they tell me and I can see why people may think that.

I've never talked about my feelings as I never felt the need to. I never cried, I was always fine but the past 3 years I sometimes had the feeling that something is wrong. I didn't really feel anything, but more acted about my feelings. When someone died, I didn't really care, but really tried to show that I did.

It looks like that it all started to collapse a few months ago. I indeed consider myself smart and I thought I was able to handle everything that ever occurs to me but I think I ran into the wrong direction career wise.

I'm 22 years old now and going for a bachelor degree, but first of all I may need to shed some light on my surroundings.

My parents broke up when I was like 3 years old and I always had my mother who tried too hard to provide the perfect life without really having any money. On the other hand I had my father who was supportive and tried to push me towards a successful life. Also too hard as I was a very sensitive kid. I lived with my mother and my siblings and we had a good childhood I guess.

My father had a terrible childhood and as far as I understood it, he was kinda homeless at around age 16 and did everything to have a good life. He now is successful and seems to be more than fine with his life.

He always told me I had to get those degrees and I got to do the best to become the best.

Very early on I learned how to do simple school stuff like maths, writing, reading and that kind of stuff.

I went from first grade straight to second as I was too fast for the other children and didn't learn at all until I started to study computer science (I don't know the exact term in English, but it's more technical and practical).

So basically I set up everything to believe that I could now go straight through my degree and live the life other people wanted for me.

But in reality I'm failing one exam after another and I think I won't make it. I am working in a small company while studying and I've been in a few companies to know, that there is none I could do what I really want to without being either the CEO or having a shit ton of degrees and a lot of working experience.

I want to do what I can do best but I just can't stand studying which I believe I need to finish first. I try to learn but my motivation is just non-existant and I'm usually procrastinating. People keep asking me how I'm doing and I keep lying, even to my girlfriend. They think I'm learning, but I just think about ways to get out of here and live my own life.

I started to develop my own programs and tools and while a thousand users may not be the big success and I didn't make any money yet, I know that given enough time and just letting me do, I could do big stuff and live off of that.

It's just that everyone pushes me too hard into my life, that I neither study probably nor do anything towards my dream goal which is a small company of my own, developing things that I want on the market.

I'm just living off my father now, afraid of telling him that he is wasting his money on me and next to my girlfriend who doesn't know at all, that I will fail my degree because I am again too afraid of telling.

I know that if I would tell my girlfriend, she would be supportive and tell me to go get a job. But I can't stand failing my degree that is to be honest actually very easy to earn, if I would be able to focus on it.

I know my father would do the same thing, but I also can't stand being that child that didn't finish the degree that I could do easily.

So now I'm sitting here lying to myself, that everything will be fine and lying to everyone else, that everything works as intended.

I see no way of getting out of here except somehow managing to motivate myself to do a degree that I don't want to do.

Thanks for reading, it even helps a bit to just write down how I'm feeling.",12Sep2018,1
261,"Some background. I had a 15 year best friendship with someone that culminated in us going into business together, him lying to me, stealing thousands of dollars from me, and resulting in an end to our business as well as our friendship. He was my best friend from age 10 to age 24. Since our falling out, I completely cut ties with him. That was 5 years ago. I hate the guy. He demolished a 15 year friendship, so he could routinely use our business account to buy $300 rounds at a local bar, pay for his home internet, buy his own groceries, and all the while I'm working 80+ hours per week at 2 jobs, and not getting paid for my stake in the business. So that was 80+ hours per week at about $4.00/hr. This is all during a time in my life where I am struggling to pay student loans and medical bills.

Now to current day. A mutual friend of ours, someone from our friend group in High School, is getting married. I was asked to MC the wedding, and I know that the friend I cut ties with will be best man.

I‚Äôve recently been faced with a dilemma:

A few years ago, I ran and was elected for a student public office position (I am 17 and was elected when I was 16). I ran because I like public speaking and it was a chance for me to harness those skills. Though, I‚Äôve never really had a flair for politics; engineering is where my passion is at.

Fast forward a year later, I dislike the world of politics even more and I am considering dropping the position. The hard part is that I was elected and there are so many perks to this position.

Well... I'm realizing now it isn't what I want to. I have a weak personality so I will do what I'm told regardless of if I want to do it. I'm working on that and getting better. My parents firmly want me to be a nurse. They have made it clear that they don't want me to do anything else so for the past few years, thats what I've been doing. I don't want it. I don't want to be a nurse with my whole heart. I have no motivation to study or go to class. I can't stand it. I don't want the responsibility of someone else's life in my hands. I don't want to potentially kill people each day for the next 40 years of my life. I feel obligated to step down from the field when I feel like that because I wouldn't want someone taking care of me if they didn't care about what they were doing. Getting to the point, I want to withdraw. I spoke with my teacher about it yesterday and she told me what I had to do. I just don't know how to tell my strict parents.

268,"Hello all! Not sure if this is the right sub, sorry if it's not!

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I switched from Accounting (too hard for me, and it was destroying my GPA) to Finance.

I enjoy Finance more than Accounting, however, I am worried that a Finance major on its own may not be secure enough job wise.

My friend switched out of Accounting a semester later than I did, and told me the courses I *would* have taken for accounting were a lot harder. I know that taking Accounting isn't something I'll enjoy, and it will bury my GPA even deeper. But will the suffering be worth it?

269,"So, I started dating someone within the past few months. At one point I invited him over to my house so he could meet my parents. Everyone was polite and friendly it seemed. We weren't allowed to go upstairs, but we were given some privacy in the living room. When he left, my mother looked at me and said ""You're too young."" We had a brief conversation and she basically said I was too young to date. This confused and irritated me because 1. She's expressed her approval of me starting to date and having boyfriends in the past. and 2. I'm 16, which is young, but also a pretty typical age to start exploring romance.

271,"So the first week's started and this is my second (attempted) degree. It was English, it's now archaeology. I'm going to use bullet points/a list style to make this easier for you to read.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the list sounds like I'm an ass, but keep in mind that I'm only asking whether you think it's a good idea for me as a person, with all my quirks about what I want to do and what not, to study in a university setting.

&amp;#x200B;

Pro's:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I like the practical science (at the moment we're learning to distinguish different kinds of materials with first a lecture then a practical). This is fun.
2. I like learning about the history of how human sciences developed
3. 1+2 combined: 2 classes, which translates to about 3 hours a week, which I like
4. I like reading books (if the subject is interesting)
5. I like doing tests (I'm very competitive)

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I hate the school-style learning. University is just high school with professors who have higher titles.
2. I hate the rest of my classes. I am not interested in the history of archaeology or who did what and what methods there are. In this context only want to dig and look at an artifact and be able to tell which period it is from.
3. addition to 1.1, 1.2, and 2.2: as a conclusion of these, I am paying a shitload of money for three hours of interesting stuff (3 days a week), 6 hours of boring stuff, and the rest of my money goes to tutorials in which we're told to 'read chapter 5+6 and summarize it'.
4. I hate workgroups
5. The other students are mostly teenagers (I'm in my late 20's) and I neither want to nor know how to deal with people in general anyway
6. don't even want to work as an archaeologist. All I want to do is learn some practical science.
7. I hate rote learning and I will not do it. I can learn timelines, yes, but I will not memorize which fucker in the 18th century started doing x and that's why it's called y and what implications it had for research. I will only learn stuff that is a) applicable right away (such as distinguishing between different materials) and b) useful (=practical)

I'm actually leaning towards quitting university. I know it's only been a week, but I wasn't really excited about starting it in the first place. All I wanted was 'something to do' because lately I've also been out of work (mental health issues, yes, they're being worked on professionally), and archaeology was... one of the only classes offered in English. I never was 100% sure, and I don't like studying pointless stuff, but I can already tell there will be more bullshit than practical things we'll actually use EVER (just like high school) and I'm thinking university is maybe not the right place for me to learn.

272,"I'm a lonely guy (19) I'm in the army and I work at a hospital where I'm the youngest by at least 7 years so imagine I can't talk to anybody and joke around everything is strictly professional. I went back home for leave and met this girl (18) we used to go to high school together but she had a bf. Anyways after three dates I just felt like I was on top of the world I never had a relationship before and this was my first ever. I came back to where I was stationed and our phone calls after work averaged 4 hours. Long story short she told me about her sexual past, being ""extensive"" (6 guys 1 girl and roughly 13 times), also how she experienced traumatic events(abusive ex, her first bf raped her, and her father was abusive toward her mother). I felt really insecure about how many guy's she's been with and I ended up blowing the situation up . We settled on being friends even that was too much for me. We had made plans for her birthday and she bailed on me to go partying with her friends, I told her I was leaving that night back. she said ""and so?"". I had driven 4 hours and brought flowers so I looked really stupid I admit I had ulterior motives. Now I'm not the victim when we had made it to where we're friends she had told me¬†while drunk¬†she didn't want to have sex with me because I'm a virgin and how she's misses being young and reckless, and all the guys texting her, and how I need to ""step up my game"". I was hurt I ended up getting on tinder and lost it the next day to some girl. I felt good you know like I'm still me.

back to the when she bailed on me. I was talking to close friends that encouraged me to tell her off. I did.. I blamed her for making me lose my virginity to some girl (that probably hurt her) and I told her how I'm probably another guy to fall back on. At the time I felt relieved now i regret it. I text bombed her asking her to just give me one chance. I admitted I tried making her the bad guy and confessed it was never meant to hurt her I just didn't want show how I really felt. I asked her for one more chance a week ago with no reply....

It's just that I'm really lonely and I just wanted a relationship for once. And I screwed it all up by being selfish, immature and insecure. If I continue trying to contact her I know, whether I like it or not, its basically harassing her. Believe me or not but I really have changed my mindset about her being with other guys before me. It's the past leave it at that and it was wrong to judge her for her past.

I'm getting over her but I'm honestly cringing soo hard on how I acted and if I ever do see her again I'll die from embrassment. How do I stop cringing over it?

280,"**Background information:** I work in a small upscale clothing boutique currently, which is owned by three friends. A woman who was hired around the same time I was recently got promoted (I'll call her X). She is older, more experienced, and doesn't have a looming set exit date like I do. Because the store is small, only a few of us work at a time on most days.

**The situation:** While I used to love going to work, the dynamic has recently changed since X started working and particularly since her promotion. It used to be a friendly environment in which both coworkers and the manager worked as a team. There was no competition and egos were kept in check. X, however, definitely has an overinflated ego and is cutthroat competitive (always trying to get all the customers, even if that means stealing them), though she always acts nice and tries to be funny. Her insecurity is obvious,  but that knowledge doesn't make working with her day to day really any easier. Because of her insecurity she is constantly trying to prove her power over others-- she makes comments like ""I'm going to have you..."" and ""... for me,"" and her choice of words combined with her body language make it apparent that she is trying to exert power purposefully. While none of us at the store talk outright about X, the looks we share are enough to let us know that we're all on the same page about X's obnoxious behavior. So, one bossy coworker-- no big deal, right? Except the owners adore her (because she makes lots of sales because of her customer hoarding tactics) and actually *condone* her behavior, undoubtedly to make us all try to compete to increase their sale volume. They make comments about her competitive spirit and dramatic comments praising her in front of the rest of us (like how she should *finally* take a break or leave early and skip on cleanup because she has worked so hard). And when they give her criticism it is usually done in a group setting, not often just one on one with her like with the rest of us. The owners have been more open about sharing who has sold the most and who has sold more than who in general, which makes for an uncomfortable atmosphere.  I've always been a good worker and highly aware of what goes on in the store, and I know the owners know that. I don't spend my time BSing and work efficiently but take the time necessary to prevent from making stupid mistakes. Obviously at the end of the day the owners only concern is how many sales were had, but their gaslighting strategy is ridiculous. 

**The solution:** I still like my job but am not OK with putting up with a bossy, ego centered coworker all day almost every day. I think it is a shame my bosses are trying to manipulate our team using her, but bosses are bosses and as long as I'm not treated poorly by them I can handle them. I've tried the ""kill with kindness"" method to deal with X, but that hasn't worked long-term. I can tell that I unintentionally (for the most part) intimidate her-- I have resorted to purposefully intimidating her on one bad day (I'm not proud of it, but my frustration got the better of me). While I'm not into playing the competitive who's got more power game with her (or with my bosses for that matter), I also don't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing that her behavior bothers me by talking with her about it since I'm confident she is acting on purpose. The only other option I see is to ignore her as best I can and let her compete with herself by not partaking in the competition. As far as her trying to be bossy, though, I'm not absolutely sure how best to handle her comments. To outright refuse her requests seems childish, but allowing her to talk bossy is weak.

284,"
My girlfriend and I have been together for around a year and a half dating but knowing and being with each other longer. I love her very dearly, and we have an 11 week old together. I try to tell her the way she makes me feel from time to time, and she either 1. Ignores me, 2. Blows it up like I'm calling her a terrible person 3. Gives me excuses as to why the way I feel is incorrect, sometimes lying and manipulatingthe situation. Or some variation of the 3. She is pushing me away and really making it difficult for me to be able to build any kind of life with her and feel like I'm an equal partner. She downplays my contributions, and acts like I don't put in effort. Sometimes even claiming i do the exact thing she's doing at that very moment. She makes me feel pushed aside as if I have no input and my feelings thoughts and opinions completely unimportant. Unloved. I have examples... 

For background we work together(usually not same shift) and I have 3 step children from her, plus our newborn. 

So we went thru this period where any and every fight she would break up with me/kick me out of the house. I've told her calmly and rationally after the fight that doing this ruins any sort of security I've established, and to me that is one step short from making an excuse to be single. I feel very strongly about this and if I'm just going to be told to leave then there's no point in being upset so often so why try to stay? She knows exactly how I feel. Yet not even 3 days ago, she did it again. And the worst part is she says ""I've been telling you to leave but you never listen.""

A couple of weeks ago she talked about dying her hair a color I really did not like. I asked her to let me come with her to choose a color together. When I got home the other night she had dyed it that exact color. When I asked her why, if it was to spite me, she claimed we weren't talking at that time (from being broken up the other night) but that's not true. I have texts that prove that's not true, and when I point them out the story changes. 

She says that she has no friends, all she does is watch children and doesn't go out, as if blaming me. But it's been even longer since I've done anything at all. And she had her youngest son 5 years before I met her. Those responsibilities were established before I was ever in the picture. And from the moment I met her children I've acted like a father, and given 100% effort to be a family, and help her as if they are my blood and responsibility. And I'm just expected to do these things.

She says really hurtful things to me, knowing they are things I'm weak or insecure about, and rarely says sorry. The best I get is ""I overreacted."" But it's a rare occasion that she will comfort me, or do things a partner does like build me up or care about my wants and desires. Or even care that I'm crying myself to sleep right next to her. 

I have made a point to make sure we do things she wants to. I bought 140 VIP tickets to her favorite band, gift cards to the spa, get my family to watch her kids so we can go out(as an aside I've never seen them as her kids. 100% ""our children."" But I am so alienated anymore and tired of being kicked down that as this point I have probably start to ""keep score."") I ask for and cherish her input. I try to tell her, speaking calmly, how I feel just to be ignored. 

She rarely acknowledges any wrongdoing on her part. I feel so alienated and more like her child than a partner. I've tried everything I can think of. I hurt so much anymore and just want to be loved and to matter to someone. The thought has crossed my mind to find someone else even if for a night but that's not who I want to be and it will solve nothing. I just want her to listen and care and respect me. I want to be able to have a healthy relationship and family. Create a safe and loving home for our children. Have her acknowledge me and have input. 

How can I get through to her, or is it futile? I don't want to break up but no matter how I speak to her I feel so unimportant. What can I do? We both have baggage from previous relationships, but we are both almost 30 years old. These all feel like things that happened in High School. She Compares me on the regular to her ex-husband. I am so worn down, I am at a loss for what to do. Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you Reddit!

285,"I will try to keep this as short as possible.  On August 8, 2017, I was pulled over and issued two tickets - one for speeding, and one because my registration was overdue by a week.  After going to court to take care of it all, the outcome was a single ticket for 5 mph over the limit - basically, no points issued, and just paid a fine.  The registration ticket was withdrawn as I had renewed my registration prior to my court appearance.  I have all paperwork in hand.  

Year goes by, and I get a renewal quote from my insurer indicating an increase of nearly $500.  After calling and talking to my insurer, she informs me that something doesn‚Äôt look right on my driving abstract (record?), and that on the date of August 8, 2017, it shows I got 3 tickets - 16 mph over (which was reduced to 5 over with no points), 5 mph over, and driving an unregistered car.

We got into the crypto-mining business game about 14 months prior. We invested around $55,000 on equipment. We was able to make around $320,000. He decided without my knowing to purchase a additional $30,000 worth of equipment because of how well we were doing in the bear market(thanks to me finding very unknown coins at the time). The last 2 month has been pretty bad, but we're still in the green.

I feel like just giving him all the rigs and say fuck off do it yourself since you're so great and im so bad at it. Knowing full well he doesn't know jack shit about mining, let alone how to even start a fucking a computer.

So i moved into this apartment building last semester. The maintenance man would come to my apartment literally all the time because everything was breaking when i first moved in.

Fast forward to last week! So now I‚Äôm single.

And the club eventually was closing and i was in a rush to meet up with my friends to get a ride home. And he was like ‚Äúwell I‚Äôll see you around‚Äù and we do see each other around the apartments since he works there. And we talked for a little. But its a bit awkward for me because i did this when i was drunk and then i see him when I‚Äôm sober...but NO REGRETS!!! This was like the best 10 minutes of my life in a long time.

306,"Bit of background - I've been dual certified in insurance since January, which is around the same time I got my current job (medical biller at a chiropractic office). 

I'm pretty good at my job, and for the most part I enjoy it. Just I spend a lot of time at doctors appts because of worsening neurological issues, which is getting bad enough to affect my everyday life. 

A lot of people have brought to my attention that maybe I shouldn't be working right now (multiple family members, my boyfriend, even doctors have all told me this). Which I've started to agree with, main problem is: I only have one coworker. Even if I'm feeling extremely unwell, if she's busy that day no one else can cover my shift. 

I have tried leaving this job in the past, usually they guilt me into staying saying things like ""if you can't handle this job, you'll never be able to handle a different one"". They know about my health issues obviously, and they treat it like I can just turn it off before going to work. Even my boss has said ""so you'll be 100% better soon"", as if it's a common cold. Feels like speaking to a brick wall. I only work 3 days a week, which is the embarrassing part, and honestly I do feel quite pathetic over feeling so weak after a shift that I can't do anything but lay down. 

Thing is, I wouldn't want to stop working forever. I just want to get a hold of my health, hopefully get it all managed and figured out without pushing myself. 

I'm young (only 20) so I would like to continue with my insurance career when I feel ready to work again, which is a reason leaving on a good note is important. I have gotten a lot of experience that I can put on a resume when it's time to look for another job. 

If it was a bigger office, it might be easier. I'd be able to hand in a two weeks notice without difficulty. Whereas with my boss I wouldn't even know what to say or how to say it (with him I wouldn't be able to just write a 2 weeks notice, I'd have to speak to him about it which like I said usually turns into guilting me into staying).

307,"Fair warning, this is long &amp; there's a TL;DR at the bottom. (Throw away account)

Recently I've (20F) been at a lost on what to do. So what better place to turn other then the internet. 

I met a guy(27,M) about a year and a half ago over the internet playing a video game, and was instantaneously attracted to him. I was dating my ex at the time, and was with him for about 4 years. We were at the tail end of our relationship, I fell out of love with him and vice versa. A month after meeting the video game guy, me and my ex were broken up. I was chasing hard after this mysterious guy I met online, the issue was that he just got accepted into active duty in the army. Which means, instead of only living a state apart he was going to move across the country. We began talking a lot more, everyday, and finally he asked if I ""would consider trying to date a screwed up officer that lives halfway across the country."" I agreed. He thought he was going to deploy a month after being there which i meant I couldn't meet him face to face for a year. I told him I would wait for  him. 

Within the next 2 to 3 months after we agreed to give dating a try, he was being distant. Extremely distant. I would only hear from him about 2 times a day, if that. I was eager to make this work, and he would continually blow me off, and barely acknowledge my existence.  November came around. I was still trying my hardest to make this work and show my full interest to keep this relationship afloat. He told me he wouldn't be deploying, and he'd be coming back up north for the holidays. We met at Christmas, and since then we've been inseparable. 

Since we met and was with each other at Christmas, I've been down to visit him around 4 times, and he came up for a few days last week. He wants me to move down there with him this Christmas, talking about how magical it's going to be. After the hardships we had from August-November, of him barely paying attention to me, he's like a completely different man. He admitted to me that this girl, that he was on and off with throughout college really broke his heart and kept screwing him over. The last time he tried to rekindle things with her was just a few weeks before we met on the internet, he went down to see her with hopes of rekindling, and her leading him to the idea that they were going to rekindle things. It ends up when he went down there, she had another boyfriend. He left abruptly and told himself that 'this was the last straw'. He stated the reason why he was so distance for those first few months, was because he continually got screwed over by her, and the last long distance(with another girl for a few months) ended horribly and was afraid of being hurt again. 

**So what's the problem?** 

I love this guy endlessly. More than he will ever know, but I have a gut feeling something is going on behind my back. I don't know what is causing this gut feeling.  The only things I have ever seen that were sketchy was messages from his FB coming onto my phone when I was down visiting, and it was of him and his friend from college talking about how much they wish they screwed this one girl, and should've done it when they had the chance. Which i confronted him about, and he apologized up and down and said it was just guys being guys.. So i let it go. Another thing I found was when I was dusting his shelves when I was visiting another time, I knocked a box off his dresser. I saw old stuff from when we first met and old pictures, then I stumbled on an old love note from the girl that screwed him over.  I got upset, of course, but he explained that it's part of a memory box and he got the idea of the memory box from his late father. 

Since February, he said how he is going to marry me next year (Propose in October 2019) when he makes captain,  how I am the love of his love.  I've learned a lot about his darkest secrets, and him with mine.   

It's small things, I know. But I just have a gut feeling about something not being right, I'm not sure if it's my own paranoia, or if I should listen to my gut feeling. ***I'm not sure if the thought of him still having feelings for his ex is driving me crazy, because he did say to me during Christmas when we met, he always wondered what would have been between him and his ex***.  I'm not sure if it was because of the rough start of him being indecisive about me in the beginning when I was all in. He does say dumb things to me, and makes stupid comments that hurt my feelings sometimes. All in all, I'm afraid of moving, to pick up my whole life, quit my job, just to find out something is going on. Also, it's completely against my mother's wishes to move, so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with anything.  I do want to start a life with him, I want to try to build something special, but I guess I just need reassurance from someone other than my own head.

Even when we get assigned to different seats because of assigned seating, he is always making uninsightful interruptions while the teacher or another student is speaking. It's like, he does not understand when it is okay to speak and what not, it's very disrespectful. He disrupts the entire class instead of just disrupting me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really think he just has a need for attention or something that is not being fulfilled for whatever reason. You know, I'm not a therapist or a doctor or something so I cannot fix that for him, and maybe some people just need more attention than others -- but you should still be able to sacrifice being the center of attention for the period of a class, and if you can't, then I think you have a problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

His arrogance is just really offensive to me.  He doesn't do any of the assigned reading because he says it's such a stupid thing and that he already understands it -- then of course, after he fails the examination, as if on cue, he always makes the same complaints about the ambiguity of the questions to the teachers, upset that his grade was bad. And if it's math where such a point will be moot, he complains that he was never taught this, that the teachers weren't doing their job.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I do not even think myself above reading the textbook, because I know that there is still something that I can learn-- and even then, you could bring yourself to read it just because it's the assignment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, yes, language is interpretive and what not, I get it-- but this insight is not very imaginative or groundbreaking. And I think that maybe he is possessed by the idea that language is just *purely* interpretive, and nothing else. As if that was what language meant... Well, no, I don't think the idea possess him, I just think he's using it an excuse to not own up to being lazy/stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess every class has someone like this, maybe you have a memory of someone like it. Was there anything that put a stop to it? I always thought that he needed discipline or something, but nobody in an authority position does anything to him, they just try to ignore him out of annoyance so that they can teach the class. But when he gets ignored, he only becomes more talkative. He also tends to start in the middle of your sentences, including the teachers.

I met a wonderful guy who takes me out all the time, and tries his best for me and recently he's been bringing up a lot of points about my parents I hadn't noticed before.

First, a little bit of backstory. I'm a 15-year-old female, and I turn 16 in a few months. I live at home with my mother, 19-year-old sister, and my stepfather. Ever since I've actually been leaving the house, my mother demands that she knows exactly where I am and that I always have contact with her. In the summer break, I was hanging out at my boyfriend's house. His parents were cool with it, and my mum was cool with it. Or at least I thought she was. My phone had been left in my coat pocket in his room with the ringer on. She called me 10 times. My boyfriend and I begin to panic, knowing how controlling my mother is. She calls me again, and I pick up. She shouts at me saying that she was going to call the police and that I didn't tell her I was up this morning. Rewind to this morning; I was getting ready when she went off to work, calling up the stairs that she was about to go which I responded to. She knew I was up because she walked around the house whilst I was awake, and we even encountered each other in the small 2 bedroom house we're in. Fast forward to the current moment. I'm sat in my boyfriend's living room, bawling my eyes out after ending the phone call with my mother when my boyfriend says to me, 'did your mum ever do this to your sister?'. I mull it over, thinking about it and respond with a 'No.' 
He then brings up the fact that she seems awfully abusive as she asks to know where I am all the time, and often threatens to call the police when I'm not home dead on my curfew. 

Very recently, I asked her to stay out until 10:15, 15 more minutes past my curfew as I was throwing up in town, and had missed my bus back. She responded to me in a flurry of messages, saying that she didn't care and that she wanted me back home. I barely ever go past my curfew, other than that singular time. She threatens to call the police again, and when I do return home, she's sleeping in bed. I return to the question my boyfriend asked me, and respond with another no.

Is my mother abusive? If so, how can I deal with this until I turn 16 and can legally move out. ",12Sep2018,3

I would've taken him but I would have no time for him and he's a very social dog.

I wanted some say in where we lived since I'd be paying half of everything, but I didn't get one. We went on saw the house and it was RIGHT beside her bestfriend! The bathroom door didn't have a handle and one of the closet doors didn't have one either. I gave in but I told her I wanted the front room and she agreed.

June 2018 - backing into a receiving dock in downtown Las Vegas, full sized tractor-trailer took up 3/4th of the road while being unloaded, dock was not wide enough for me to back into with back doors open, only had a scant inches between trailer and dock doors ([Google Map view of the dock](https://goo.gl/maps/ecSotdKUts62) worth mentioning that the gate was not open at the time.

August 2018 - backing into a dock after 9 hours of driving and scraped a pick up truck next to me. Second driver claimed I hit him as well (on the center of his front bumper). Officer said I have no defense since he was responding to an accident in which I was at fault.

Police interactions:

February 2018 - got pulled over with a seat belt citation. Officer claimed the shoulder pad I was wearing obscured the seat belt from view and I was technically not wearing it if he couldn‚Äôt see it. Ticket and violation received 

March 2018 - ‚Äúfailure to maintain lane‚Äù after officer was too close to me, his vehicle being over the center line before I took to the shoulder. Ticket received. 

April 2018 - cited for ‚ÄúImproper lane change‚Äù after I crossed a four lane road from a [truck stop parking lot (TA) to the southbound ramp of I-75](https://goo.gl/maps/fYcNG2yrvL12) at 2 am. Cop was hidden, claimed I needed to cross one lane at a time. Ticket received 

June 2018 - pulled over because I didn‚Äôt have two hands on the wheel. Warning. 

September 2, 2018 - 58 mph in a 55 mph. Warning. 

September 6, 2018 - using Google Maps on my phone which was mounted on an AC vent (my onboard computer was down since the 3rd); failure to show proof of electronic logs. Ticket received, $250 fine, DOT violation, out of service for 24 hours, and forced to quit from company.

September 7, 2018 - officer claimed I was using my phone when I was scratching behind my right ear. Verbal warning. 

September 8, 2018 - had an officer stalk me for over 10 miles both next to and behind me. Was not pulled over.

So obviously there‚Äôs a lot. Some I‚Äôll claim responsibility for (that dock in Vegas...I knew I wasn‚Äôt leaving there without a battlescar or two). 4 out of 6 backing accidents happened in Georgia. 4 out of 8 police interactions happened in Georgia as well. I know my driving record is not clean, but aside from all of those, I only had one speeding ticket in a personal vehicle. No DUI‚Äôs, no major accidents, nothing too bad in my opinion. 

Thoughts? Should I still try for something like a mail carrier?

322,"My best friend and I have been inseparable since we were 4 (she is 24 and I am 25). Around a year or so ago, I finally convinced her to join a dating app (she had always been apprehensive because she is overweight and felt insecure because of this) and she met a guy and lost her virginity. Fast forward to now, and she is meeting up with strangers multiple times a week to have sex (sometimes with up to 3 different men in 1 day). This alone would not be terribly concerning, I fully support people enjoying their sexuality, but other factors added to it are worrying me. She is not having safe sex. She has also started smoking pot heavily everyday and drinks heavily multiple nights of the week. She has been becoming unreliable (showing up to everything 30+ minutes late, showing up late to work, missing therapy/psychiatry appointments, etc). She was preparing to apply to nursing school and missed the deadline for last semester because she didn‚Äôt order her transcripts and was just rejected from the same school for this upcoming semester. I convinced her a few months ago to see my psychologist because she had been expressing that her depression and anxiety were getting bad and she was then referred to a psychiatrist. She is on medication as of May I believe and the psychiatrist recommended she stop drinking and smoking. This upset her and she is now choosing to find a different psychiatrist because of this advice. I‚Äôm concerned that she seems to be losing control slightly and I haven‚Äôt seen much change/improvement. I also struggle with anxiety and have greatly improved through therapy, but I have noticed that being around her lately has been slightly draining and affecting me negatively.

Am I just being judgmental? I truly have been struggling to identify if it is that or if I have valid concern, so please let me know. Any advice for how I can help her while still protecting my own mental health?

She gets in these really shitty moods where she doesn't talk, anytime we fight she gives me the silent treatment. Anytime our son is acting high maintenance, she just gets on her phone and ignores it. It's gotten to the point where when I see you're doing it I don't even bother to help because she needs to learn not to act like that.
 I'm constantly and consistently being weighed down with complaints, it doesn't matter how good I do how much more around the house I do, what I buy her, how much better our financial situation is getting as a family. Nothing's good enough.

The whole culture around colleges and admissions is more toxic than chernobyl, I'm getting fed up with all of it and I don't see the point of doing menial busy work or stuff I don't care about.

I get it, the whole do good in high school, do good in college, and get a good job, but with incomes dropping and college getting more expensive, I'm not going to whore myself out to such a stupid system for a non guaranteed better income.

I'm still going in and out of guilt for my grades dropping from a solid 4.0 to a 3.0 (likely to go down to 2.5ish) because I don't want to disappoint my family but I don't want to stress myself over this with a job and a business I'm trying to start up.

On top of all of this, serving as a true testament to how much of a mess I really am, I feel as if my health is declining and I'm becoming slowly more suicidal and shutting down in the middle of class.

328,"This morning I woke up to a call from my boyfriend telling me that his ex girlfriend tried to kill herself last night. He got the call from the ex girlfriend's father. She got in a fight with her current boyfriend and got so upset that she tried to commit suicide. Theres a high possibility that she's bipolar by the way. She's in the hospital right now unconscious.

Everything is honestly fine with my relationship with my boyfriend and I and it still is. I would consider myself as a very level headed person who wants the best for everyone. Last week my boyfriend got a random call from her crying on the phone saying that she's sorry and saying things that he couldn't make out before hanging up. My boyfriend told me about it and also told me that he's tried to text her making sure she's ok but she has him blocked. So because of that I gave him the idea to tell her dad so he can at least keep an eye on her and he did that.

Fast forward to yesterday, I get a Facebook message from a stranger saying

&gt;Hey I know you don't know me but your bf and my gf use to date. Hes non stop texting her. I'm not trying to stir shit. I just figured you should know.

Now I went to my boyfriend and debunked it quickly. She blocked him when he was trying to get a hold of her and probably got all the texts at once so it seemed like he was nonstop texting her. He was trying to make sure that she was alive and the current guy wasn't beating her and he's not afraid to show texts or facebook messages. I believe him because he's never showed any signs of being shady. My boyfriend got worked up over the fact that the guy reached out to me (I honestly appreciated it because then I can confront and debunk/confirm) and also reached out to the him. My boyfriend told him everything he knew, everything he did, and everything she did. I'm guessing this is what his ex and her current partner's fight was over (her hiding that she contacted my boyfriend).

Now some backstory on her. My boyfriend and her were in a relationship for 2 years. It was a very toxic relationship. She would do violent things like randomly grab onto he steering wheel when he was driving, threatened to stab him with scissors, etc. The last straw for him was when she disappeared for 2 weeks and was with her ex the whole time. It's not out of the ordinary for her to hit up her exes when she feels like she's not getting enough attention from her current partner. She clearly shows signs of bipolar disorder and I'm not sure she's getting help for it. She's a very dark subject for him and when things ended, he almost became an alcoholic.

He truly believes that he's 100% better in relationship he's currently in with me. And I feel the same way. I hate seeing him so distressed over something he couldn't control. I don't know how to help him and even though I should nave negative feeling toward his ex, I'm worried about her too.

tl;dr My boyfriend's bipolar ex hid that she contacted my boyfriend from her current boyfriend, got in a fight with current boyfriend, and tried to kill herself.",12Sep2018,1

331,"Hey all,

I wrote an essay last week about a propaganda piece. I found a bar graph depicting deaths per 100,000 per country that were caused by guns. It did the usual skewing, and I tore it apart for it. I MLA formatted everything correctly and what not.

She comes back a week later and fails me for it.

She also said I didn‚Äôt have an article name, but I found it on the main page of a blog, there‚Äôs no article name. The reliability of a blog is obviously very low, but that was made to be the point of the essay. The three points above are why she failed me. This would be all okay, but I fear that she docked me because of my stance on the issue. She is obviously a VERY liberal teacher and has made it known since day one.

335,"Hi guys!

Right now, I'm in Ireland for my Erasmus semester abroad. I've been here for little over a week and have found myself crying because I miss/want to go home literally everyday. I've been abroad for longer times before, but it has never been this bad. It is that bad that I've considered going home and just quitting.

I've met a couple of people here but I don't feel like being part of a group or that any of them would consider me somebody they enjoy hanging out with. I believe that one possible reason for that feeling on my part might be that all the people I've met at my university are girls and I'm the only boy in that group.

A big reason why I'm so homesick is my girlfriend I believe. At home, we do something every day since we live together even though we're only together for 9 months (actually our 9 month-anniversary today if you can say that), and when I go home here, I know that I'll spend the rest of the day alone.

Now I know that there'll be stuff to do for university and I actually don't want to go home, I just don't want to go through this for the next 3 1/2 months. Problem with that is that I'd need to be back by like the end of the first week of October so that I can be back for University in my hometown. So it feels like I don't know if I can really make that decision until that point.

337,"Well folks, I was briefed about some seriously grave stuff last night.

I went over to visit a friend to drop something off I had borrowed from him. As we were conversing, a mutual friend of ours was brought up in the conversation. ""Dude, I found out we need to steer clear of her. You were busy so I know you're out of the loop in our groups of friends, but this weekend I had to talk to multiple people who are accusing her of being a rapist.""

Now I have a policy of believing people when they say they've been sexually assaulted or raped, but when I asked if he could divulge the identities of these individuals he mentioned 3 names:

-Her ex-boyfriend, who I'm not fond of and has been known to lie in order to stir shit up if it serves his needs. Our friend (the accused) claims that this ex abused her, with stories that have been corroborated by neutral parties. His claims are the one I question the most.
-A woman I know but not very well, and who is a close friend of aforementioned ex. Again I question this case due to the woman's associations with him, but not knowing her very well I wouldn't know of any reason for her to lie.
-A woman I don't know at all with the exception of one brief meeting one night.

That's where things are at the moment. If it was just him, I gotta say I'd call bullshit, but the fact that there are 2 other people coming forward makes me suspicious of my friend.

So short and short of it, should I: a) believe the accusers and cut ties with my friend, b) avoid both accused and accusers until more comes to light, or c) stand with my friend against the accusations, or at the very least not avoid contact with her?

344,"Whatsup reddit,

TLDR at bottom.

I'm a 22 year old guy. Almost 23. Upon fighting with my parents a bunch/being miserable/being coddled as a kid/etc. I took it upon myself to take a trip to a state near michigan/indiana (I am from New jersey). With what was going to be a few weeks away from home, I applied to a reputable/historical restaurant by a big school in the area. I did well on the interview.

They are offering free associates degrees (books, everything) to employees. They also have medical/dental/vision coverage. With the restaurant being so popular and fancy, the waiters make a living that wouldn't be bad for a 22 year old kid like me.

It sounds incredibly stupid (With my parents paying for my college at home) to do this, but I'm actually considering staying here. I have been lost for a few years, with losing sports scholarships at 18, to trying out university and leaving to do a community college program. If I live at home in nj, I would live in a place where nothing goes on (although NYC is there), everything is expensive, and I would live in a house most likely with the rent being high and stressful after a while. I also can't bring girls over the house, and have a curfew. I might get depressed again.

But I would miss my family. Is it practible to stay here?

345,"Hi,

Im a 26 year old male from estonia and im coming to you reddit for help. This is a throwaway for privacy, in Estonia everybody knows everybody.

Im in a really bad place in life as i have been for most of my life as an adult and a young adult. And this is my story, well a ""quick"" overview of it. Ive left some parts out too not make ot entirely obvious if by any chance anyone who knows me reads this, but im more than willing to give out more information privately.

I was born to parents who were functional alcoholics and i was an only child. My parents split (they tried to make it work a couple of times though) shortly after i was born and i lived mostly with my mother but i saw my father regularly. Im gonna say right now that both of my parents loved me despite the things im gonna explain below.

There has been a lot of bad things that i have witnessed/experienced as a child and a teenager which have left me with a lot of mental scars i cant seem to get over and i have been depressed since i was 15.

When i was young i had a lot of situations where i needed to learn to become independent. When i was with my father he was sometimes so drunk he was passed out for days so i needed to learn how to cook when i was 8-9 because you know you gotta eat. My mom regularly partied and came home in the middle of the night with men when i was about the same age home alone scared. I used to call her to ask when was she coming home at night because i was scared. But after a couple of calls and getting the answer ""soon"" my mom would switch off her cellphone. So i had to learn how to stop being scared of being alone. A lot of men came through our home who were there to drink and well bang my mom when i was in the other room. I remember i couldnt sleep because of the noise. It wasnt any better with my father who used to pick me up at school and taking me with him to work after and let me sit there doing nothing till the evening then go home and watch my father drink himself to sleep. When my father and mother were together (on and off) when i was 1-6 all i can remember is them fighting and throwing things. At some point my father beat my mom so bad she had to call an ambulance, i only remember being scared to death screaming and crying that they would stop. 

Somehow when i was 10 my mom and dad got back together. It was the time when the financial boom was starting and my father had started a pretty successful business and my mom was a trainer at a local table tennis club. Everything was better than ever, they still drank but it was a positive atmosphere all around, well at first. About 6 months in it all happened again. Fighting everyday, drinking to the point of delirium and well leaving me to handle myself. This lasted for a year and half or so and they split again. Thank god. I think they wouldve killed each other if they stayed together in the same house any longer. I had grown numb to all this by that time. I think i was 11 and something at the time. Its kind of a blur tbh.

Anyway at the same time i was doing good outside of the house. I had all 5's in school (the same as A's in america) and was relatively popular. Also i trained 4-5 times a week. I had a lot of friends and everything was really good and it seemed future was bright. Obviously i had my emo periods of listening to good charlotte and slipknot and hating the world you know the typical edgy teenager stuff. 

Fast forward to when i was 14. My dad and my mom have new partners now and i have been mostly staying with my mom but saw my father from time to time and we called each other and whatnot but he wasnt really involved closely in my life. He was ready to get a new child with his new girlfriend and i remember being happy to get a little brother. I got along with his new SO too. 
Im happy, little do i know all hell is about brake loose.

As i mentioned my mom had a new SO aswell. We had moved into his place and were living there for a year. Their relationship started to worsen at one point and my mom started drinking a lot again. One night they had a huge fight while me and my stepsister where quietly in our room trying to comfort each other. At one point my mom comes upstairs and tells me to pack my bags and that we are leaving now, it was about midnight. We pack our bags and move back to my moms apartment. 

I was really upset because it was my first time living in a happy family where everything was good and healthy. And it was over just like that. My mom was broken. Started drinking like never before and quit her job. I learned a little later that she had miscarried. She started having 
Sleeping problems and got prescribed a sleeping pill. This is the start of the decline  of my mom and me. 

My mom is drinking everyday and swallowing pills at the same time. We start to get into fights everyday over her drinking or about totally irrelevant matters. She started blaming me and picking fights with me out of nowhere. Sometimes wouldnt let me in or out of the apartment. It was obvious looking back that she was, i dont want to say in a psychosis, but not in her right mind because she felt like she lost everything. She was devastated. This affected me in a great deal. I start doing worse in school. I dont train as hard anymore. I stay at home only to sleep or when i have nowhere to go. I start to rebel in a sense. I dont care about anything anymore. I started smoking and going to ""parties"" to get drunk. Obviously this starts to cause trouble in home. Not just with my mom who is basically a shell of herself but my dad gets word of it. He has quite a temper and reminds you of an army dad and thought it was better for me to move in with him. I move in with him and since i was a ""troublemaker"" at the time he puts me on a very short leash. He takes me to school, tells me to come home right after training and then i stayed home. Since my dad lives in a totally different neighbourhood im basically cut-off from my friends. I can use the computer at home for an hour max and in my free time do chores around the house. Basically he thought the best action was to punish me for a while to get me back on track. But if u punish a 15 year old who u basically havent raised for 3-4 years and start telling him what to do it usually doesnt end well. I pulled the basic 15 year old edgy moves and said i know better and this is no way to live and u were a drunk when i was a child how can u tell me anything yadayadayada and moved out back in with my mother after a month. Now i know who in the right mind goes back to an enviroment where there is an alcoholic crazy person who just berates you for no reason. But there were days when she said she was sorry and we got along. We were always really close even when we hated each other most of the time, we loved each other more. It was really toxic relationship. I think in a sense im the only one that my mom has and she's the only one that i have.

Anyway the situation there only gets worse and i somehow manage to get trhough middle school barely and get in a decent high school despite my bad grades because i did well on the tests. Ive always done good in school with very little effort. I think this is one of the things that has shaped my life in a really bad way. It made me think i didnt need to make an effort to do good in life and that everything would be easy to me. Anyway the situation in home worsens. My mom is unable to hold a job and drinks more than ever with taking strong sleeping pills and starts to get violent. She starts threatening me with a knife and other stuff to provoke me or to straight up make me feel like shit. She succeeds. I drop out of high school and basically start living with a friend who has a similar situation at home, not exactly but we understand each other. His dad is an alcoholic and his mother lives abroad. Her mother got him an apartment when he was 16 and he lives alone. Im 17 at the time. We both drop out of school and do nothing. Literally nothing that has any benefit to our lives. But i couldnt actually move in there well for one i didnt want to, because i felt like i was intruding, second i wanted my time alone and third i think he didnt want me there 24/7 anyway.

My relationship with my father after i dropped out of school was basically over. We spoke maybe once in 6 months and that would end with us screaming at each other. Anyway i get 18 and i still live with my mother who is an alcoholic invalid at this point. Im beyond depressed and barely leave my room for anything but running away when my mom gets violent. I'll give you a scenario: my mom tells me to buy her alcohol and when i say no then you know the knife is out immediately and i have to lock myself to the bathroom or run away. If i do bring her alcohol then the knife is out at night when she's drunk out of her mind with the sleeping pills. But there is a chance she will pass out. Although i hated it to the core i would bring her the alcohol she would buy it herself anyway and would be extra violent if she had to get it herself. She didnt let me in when i left home and made everything in her power so i would leave. Ive spent countless of nights just wandering the streets of tallinn being scared that i will get jumped or something.  I tried going back to school many times but it just didnt happen, i couldnt pull myself together with the life we were having. Me and my mom just wasted away our life in that apartment her drinking with me starting to join. At some point in my life i was so embarrased with myself and i couldnt bring myself to look anyone in the eye and i deleted my facebook, i didnt have a phone. I just slept watched tv and went to bed while fighting with my mom. I started to get drunk myself. And when i was 22 the situation was so bad and we had big debts (well my mom did).

This is where it came out to our family (my grandmother and aunt) how bad the situation was. I mean they knew we had problems but didnt know the severity of the situation. They saw me the boy who had all A's, a lot of friends was involved with different things become a young man who hadnt had a haircut in more than a year, couldnt speak properly in social situations, weighed 48kg etc. And the same with my mom. They tried to help but you cant help people who dont help themselves. I didnt even know how to live anymore. And my mom blamed her family for not helping sooner and that they never cared for her. So when my moms bank cards were shut down and we had no money for food. She decided to sell the apartment and gave me 5000‚Ç¨ to start my life. I was even happy for a second. I immediately moved in with the same friend i stayed at before i was young. I bought some new clothes, ate and started socializing again. About a month after felt like a proper person again. This is where the summer started. And being young and never really partied so i partied. I loved it, getting girls attention, having fun and generally feeling good. I had forgot what it felt to feel good. And man did that summer feel good. But all things come to an end. I still had a lot of insecurities. And hadnt really ever worked.  I never felt useful and my physical form was pretty bad. I wasnt a straight up anorexic anymore but i had no strenght to do a ""mans"" job and turns out i had a lot of concentration problems, sleeping problems, anxiety problems which i hadnt noticed when i lived in my bed for a few years. The money ran out and i did some random jobs but couldnt hold them, eventually i was broke. I was facing being homeless and i had nowhere to go. At that point i did some sort of a pathetic suicide attempt. And got put in a mental hospital. It was my biggest fear, me in a mental hospital, what have i become? Will they pump me up with chemicals and im gonna be zombie for the rest of my life? Am i insane? This cant be. But to my surprise i didnt even have to take 1 pill because i didnt want to and they saw me getting better every day. I saw myself getting better every day. I had hope again. That i could become a fully functional human being who could take care of himself. I reconciled with my father who agreed to take me an apartment for rent and pay for it until i finished high school. But as soon as i got out the same day i got in a row with my father, i dont even remember what was the problem, probably something insignificant, and i jumped out of his car while we were near a red light whilst leaving the hospital. 

Now i was homeless again with no money and a bad state of my mind. I went to my grandmothers for a few days. And my mother called and said she missed me and she was sorry and doing better. She asked me to move back in, i knew it was a mistake but i didnt want to bother my grandmother with my endless problems.

Now a side note, there are many years here in this story with me doing nothing. So where did the money come from to survive? Well i have played poker ever since i was 16 and im good at it. I won a couple of tournaments worth 4k$-6k$. And sometimes won 100$ daily. But i had no discipline and would gamble it all away in one day when i was feeling down. 

I moved in with my mother again. And in 2 weeks in i understood everything would be the same. It wasnt yet but i felt it going there. I was 24 at the time. But i probably had  the ""best mindset"" ive ever had as an adult. So i loaned money from a high interest loaning business bought a laptop and 200$ of capital and grinded poker for 3 weeks and i had enogh money to move out and start over. I found a girl and all was good. I was starting to regain my focus and thought about finishing school and dreamt of starting my own business when i had enough capital and time. Unfortunately she broke up with me before the summer and it completely broke me. 

I loaned 3500‚Ç¨ with the purpose of going hard all summer and killing myself when the funds run out. Yeah this is insane i know but that was the plan. But i met another girl that summer. Someone who made me feel like never before. But i had basically ran out of money and since the truth was too hard to tell her i slowly sabotaged the relationship and she left me. I had no money for rent now but i didnt want to die. I felt like i was worth something and i felt happy for a second and wanted to feel it again. But my life was crumbling apart. I did something i thought i'd never do. I called my father explained the situation and asked for some work. This was last september and we reconciled once more and i got a job in a warehouse. As i was working there i had kept an eye on crypto for a good 6 years now and my father got interested too. He gave me money to join a few signal groups (basically tips what to buy when to buy) and soon enough in like a week i 4x our first investment. As that happened my father became more involved in it and deposited a lot of money and trusted me with it and then the boom happened and we had A LOT of more money. More money then ive ever seen. I told him i would like to cash out half of my stake (this was around new years last year) and travel for the first time in my life and go to school the next year. He was okay with it but for some reason he stalled with it and stalled and stalled until the crash happened, everything was going down at the speed of light. My father didnt exactly blame me, but acted like it. Although i told him to cash out in the end of december, at least half of it. Which was the same as my plan. But he wanted to make a ""million"". We were close to it too. But he was too in. He had the mindset of going ""going to the moon"" you couldnt talk him out of it, no way in hell. Our relationship worsened in a matter of days to a point where my father gave me an obsolete amount of money since ""if it wasnt for him i would be homeless anyway and that i should be grateful."" The money was 20x less than the money i asked when we were up and 8x times less than my stake with the current market situation. It wasnt even about the money. He was still up, and it was all my work. It was his money but it was my work. And i got crumbs. All of my plans of starting over with a new proper life washed away, ive never felt so betrayed before.

I was back in the state of not leaving my bed, only for food every 2 days. And when i mean food i mean i ate 3 packs of ramen every other day. Sometimes i didnt eat for days. I did absolutely nothing but browsed reddit and surfed the web while feeling as depressed as ever and contemplating suicide. Which i knew i couldnt do. And felt like a pussy for not being able to do it. In the meantime my mom is in and out of mental hospitals all the time. Which affected me also. Until june i did absolutely nothing. But then one day i thought why not play poker probably because i was running out of money. And 3 days later i won a tournament and one of my friend groups that i had managed to keep went to see the world cup. I joined looking like shit but i didnt care. My first time abroad as an adult. It was great, ever since i was a little boy i wanted to see the world cup. And i fulfilled my dream albeit a not a life goal but first time in my life i did something i wanted to do. When i got back to estonia, i loaned money again, moved in a cheap apartment with a roommate and used all the money to party all summer, i just couldnt help myself. Its the only time when i feel like a human being. Probably because its the only time when i socialize with other people and actually talk to someone. I had a good summer and was talking to people daily and felt good still depressed and stressed out but good. Until i saw the girl i sabotaged my relationship with. And the fact that i was out of money again. I spiraled back into a deep depression and self destruct mode. 

And here we are now, a week ago i rationalized i weigh 48kg again, cant focus on anything, cant sleep basically cant do anything and im in debt and need to pay rent or im going to be homeless again. I thought about my mother who is in a mental hospital and has somekind of bipolar/schizoaffective disorder and feared this is going to happen to me if i dont get my life together. I know i need to do something but i am not able to do anything without some help because ive dug myself in such a big hole in every way and the next step is literally becoming a bum. And im scared. Since i didnt pay my loan back and because its not the first time my bank account got frozen until i pay 5000‚Ç¨ back. I need to pay rent in 3 days 500‚Ç¨, i have no money for food and havent eaten anything but ramen from the money i have gotten picking up bottles. I have sold all my electronics and everything of value except my phone and clothes. I have literally nothing but a phone, which i havent payed the bills for 2 months so i can only receive calls and have no internet. Luckily i have wifi at home until i get kicked out. I have no idea how long i have before i get kicked out. Ive been too scared to tell the owner of my financial situation and was hoping i could get the money somehow but im out of options.

I am unable to work because of my mental and physical state, i cant sleep or concentrate on anything.  Im scared of dying. Im scared that i wasted my life and never really got to live. Im scared ill die and no one will remember me and ill leave behind a legacy of doing nothing and getting nothing done. I cant even take care of myself. And i fear what will happen to my mom when something happens to me. 

But i have been in a better place, i know what im capable of. I really think if i could live a normal life for at least some months ill be able to get my shit together and be of some value to this world. Im looking for someone to help me. I need a psychologist maybe even a psychiatrist, but they cost money. I need food to live, i need to live somewhere and that takes money. I hate asking money and i never ask friends for money and i havent asked like this before because i have been too proud and id rather not eat, i cant face the people in my life and show them myself in this situation. And it wouldnt matter because they dont have money anyway and needless to say my father is not an option.

I know i and only i have put myself in this situation. And im an adult and should take full responsibility of my life. And ive had more options than so many people growing up in poor places where they dont even see the sums of money ive had. I know many people have endured so much more abuse then i could ever imagine. But im so weak mentally and i dont know why and i hate myself. I know my story doesnt really build confidence that i would not fall into the same holes ive been before and i know my main problems are not money but my mental health and my physical health. But i have no way to help myself, im a shell of a human being. I cry like a baby everyday, and i cant face anyone. I cant even chitchat with anyone without feeling like im going to have a heart attack. Because i know they see what i look like and how i act. Im so embarrased that i get the worst panic attacks. 

I dont want to die. I want to live, be useful have somekind of purpose. I want to do something. But i have to fix myself first and i need help but im out of ideas.

Thank you for reading!

346,"Summary: Partner had a panic attack and then put the responsibility for helping them on me, which is really grating on me. I did my best to be A) specific about what items I needed and B) show empathy for how they were feeling but it was all thrown back in my face.  Am I right to be taking this personally?   


More details:   
I've \[32/M\] been dating my Partner \[32\] for Two-ish years and living together for over 1 year.  They suffer from PTSD and have been living in a bout of depression for the last couple weeks. I live with some generalized anxiety of my own that I have mostly kept managed. I'm currently seeing a therapist. They are not, due to financial trouble.   
Last night Partner clearly had a rough day when I got home but didn't seem to want to tell me about it.  Partner said they were going to the grocery store and 'did I need anything' I asked for a couple of items and handed them five dollars.  I went out to the coffee shop to do some reading.  
I received text messages from my partner asking for details about a specific item, but I could see within the texts that they were really agitated. I tried to answer best I could but, without knowing what's on the shelf I picked two items that were likely there and said either kind, and that it didn't really matter which.   
They seemed not to understand and started having a panic attack. They suffer from decision paralysis.   
Saying things like ' I don't have spoons for this.'  'I only wanted to pick up snacks' 'I just need to know specifically what you want'   (I had already answered the question)  
From the start I was more concerned about my partners mental well being than I was about the groceries.  So I said, 'Don't worry about getting me X item. Just take care of yourself and I'll get what I need later. '  
They pressed me, texting 'you wanted it, I'm here,  just tell me what you want'   
I repeated one single option. and luckily they had it on the shelf. but Partner continued to have a textual panic attack. 'There are so many people here and they just keep coming.'  
I was feeling attacked already but I tried to show empathy , ' I feel it, I know grocery stores suck, especially when spoons are low. ' 'please do whatever you need to and take care of your heart'  
They replied with a long text message about PTSD effects them and I can't possibly know what that is like. and I shouldn't dare tell them I understand... that I was minimizing their feelings...  it included some other accusations of me being unhelpful and some references to them being all alone with their illness. It included some  of their financial worries, although I had handed them a five for the items I requested.   
I felt like it was unfair and I was about to shoot back but I didn't want to make it worse. so instead I tried to remain calm and replied ' I know I don't know what PTSD is like. But I've had panic attacks in public before, and I know how  grocery's stores can effect you. I want to help but I can't do that if you attack me' I also offered to walk over to the store and get them out of there.   
They denied attacking me and told me they're just pointing out how unhelpful I'm being and that I was out of line for asking for items from the store (when they had asked me if I needed anything, and I only asked for two items. )    
I know this post has a lot of vague language. I don't know if there's any possibility they might see it and I feel guilty for typing it up. But the Idea that they had a panic attack and then put the responsibility for helping them on me is really grating on me. I did my best to be A) specific about what items I needed and B) show empathy for how they were feeling but it was all thrown back in my face.  I ended up telling them I love them and I'm sorry I can't help but I need to take a pause and take care of myself. Which I did for the rest of the night.   
Any advice at all would be helpful.  How do I talk about this with my partner? We're talking about someone with PTSD, should I have been the bigger man and tried to help more.  Am I being too defensive about it?  In the past I've done everything to avoid triggering my partner and mitigating the PTSD but I fear I might have just been enabling them to continue lasting out at me without getting help.

349,"""K"" and I dated from October to April. During this relationship, we experimented sexually with each other. ""K"" was rather inexperienced, so a lot of what we did was ""trial and error"" - for lack of a better term. It first started with me trying to finger her and she expressed comfort with only over her underwear at that time. Over time, after doing only that for a while, I slowly motioned my hand under her underwear and moved my way towards her vagina and she allowed it. The same process happened with eating her out. My head would go down her legs and I'd kiss up them and she'd either move my head away (at first) or allow me to do it. Additionally, I did feel like I was moving too fast with things and told her I felt like we hooked up too much, to which she responded ""I am always down to do sexual things with you and will tell you if something isn't okay"". She truly lived this out by moving head or hands away or expressing no if she didn't want to hook up that night. She also expressed to me that she was ""afraid of sperm and that we would have sex before she ever gave me a handjob"". She also ruled blowjobs completely out for forever. Towards the end of our relationship, I started losing feelings for her and broke things off with her.

I broke up with her the week before my fraternity formal because part of me wanted to sleep with someone at it. When I got back to school from the formal, I met up with ""K"" because she wanted to talk. During this, she told me that ""she was going to have sex with me at formal"". So being the young, horny 19 year old that I was - I immediately started hooking up with her again because I thought she would have sex with me. I started trying to take things further with the intent of ALWAYS stopping if she expressed no or there was any level of discomfort/hesitation.

During these ensuing hookups, I would undress ""K"" down to her underwear and she would do the same to me. We would make out, I would finger her, occasionally eat her out, and then we would have ""outercourse"" where I would grind on top of her. I would then take my dick and angle it into her vagina over top of her underwear and start thrusting into her. It did hurt the tip of my dick a lot, but there was one time when the natural friction moved her underwear to the side and I immediately felt how wet it was. In combination with the friction and me grabbing my dick, I moved her underwear to the side so it stopped hurting my tip. I slowly started pumping into her some and felt a clear breakthrough, from where my dick was dry to when it was wet, into her (I think). I was scared that I was moving too fast or that she might end up saying no, so I only ended up going an inch or two inside of her. I ended up stopping because I was close to coming and didn't want to come in her. I did check to make sure she was enjoying herself and that she seemed okay with it.

In subsequent encounters, I would move her underwear and start to slowly pump into her like I did in the paragraph above, and gauged her reactions. While I knew it was unchartered waters, I told myself ""she's not saying anything objecting to it"" and she seemed into it in the moment. There was ONE time when she did ask me if I was over top of her underwear or not, and I got caught up in the moment and immediately used my hand to move her underwear back over top and pulled my tip out. I did say ""yes"" when it was back over, but more to confirm that it was - and I didn't go back to this during the encounter.

In encounters after this, I slowly built things up again and moved her underwear back to the side after gauging reactions and not doing it for some hookups. I moved it as to try and initiate things with her, but I always had the intention to stop if I was told or if I could tell she was uncomfortable and not enjoying herself. Eventually, we got to a point where she asked to have sex, but we stopped after she sat fully down on my dick because ""it hurt her too much"". We never ended up having sex though.

If I remember correctly, I only moved her underwear and handful of times, with the time she asked the question being the middle one. I always had the intention to stop and always checked to see if she was enjoying herself - which she was. I know I would've stopped if she had said anything or acted like she did during the one time I did stop, and I was just trying to warm things up to sex. I hate that I didn't ask and was just going off the fact that she wasn't saying anything - as I somewhat now feel like she wouldn't have said yes. (I'm not sure on that either though.) I now know that I will ALWAYS ask and not try to push things along, and will forever ask before initiating sex with any partner from here on out.",12Sep2018,0
350,"I am 16 and I am gay. Since I am closeted and no one knows about it, I recently started getting very frustrated since I have no one to vent or to talk about things. 

This has led me to sign on grindr last night. I wasn't hoping for a hookup or anyhig, just other gay friends. However, there people were only interested in hookups, which made me be a bit more interested too. This afternoon a guy asked if I was up to it. He was 40-something and he was totally ok with it. He picked me up in a very fancy car and did small talk with me. I noticed he was not as handsome as he was in the picture, but not ugly. 

When we got in his home, I was feeling super nervous. What if he kidnaps me, if he kills me or something like that. It was a very fancy home with super expensive items and cars in the garage. We got into his room and he started kissing me. Wasn't bad at all but I wasn't confortable. I didn't say no so I can't blame him. 

I will be a bit specific now so if you want to skip this part, however is important to the story. I gave him a blowjob and then he wanted to do anal. He was going to do it whitout a condom but I insisted he wore it. It was awful, it hurted and I didn't feel anything. He came in 3 minutes, which didn't help. 

He apologised and left me in the underground station. I couldn't help but feel dirty. I felt disgusted that I had done it and I'm writing this while in the underground, and I feel like I am going to vomit. Was it my fault? That I went looking for it and I'm disgusting? What if I got an STD? He wore a condom but blowjobs and kisses transmit them too! I am a total mess and I feel that even if I took 1000 showers, I would still be dirty.

So I‚Äôm a childcare worker and I made the mistake of leaving a group alone out of a specific request of another teacher (I still take full responsibility) and that is a violation of licensing. I have been really shaken up today, I‚Äôve been with the company for 10 months. I know that the mistake I‚Äôve made is grounds for a write up surely, maybe even termination all together. My boss is investigating what happened even further which leads me to think he is documenting. He is even asking other coworkers what happened and how they feel about it.

I love my job and am broken on this because my boss had told me everything was okay this morning. But then he is going around, investigating the situation further which I thought was diffused.

If I feel I will be terminated should I quit instead? 
I love my job and am so very very upset by this happening. I have never had any write ups and have received nothing except for praise since I first started here. This job is a stepping stone to my career, I‚Äôve made some great connections and am afraid I‚Äôm going to lose it all.

So I (35M) have been divorced for 10 years, my ex and I have a daughter who is 11. My ex has had a long term bf and two more children since. We have had some serious ups and downs over the years, but generally get along for the kids sake. And honestly I really like the other two kids and spend some time with them as well. 

Here is the problem. 

Her BF got fired a while back from work. Then started hiding money, then apparently changed the contact information with their landlord, and stopped paying rent. They are about to get evicted. My ex doesnt have a job either, there is no family she can stay with currently her best bet would be 2 hours away with grandparents. I would obviously not be ok with that since I love spending time with my daughter and we have a custody arrangement which could not continue if she were that far away. Which would mean, court, and honestly that makes me feel like im kicking her when shes down. And I know my daughter would be very upset, we have a great relationship, but its still her sisters. 

I have room at my place. I can let them stay. It's inconvienient yes, itll be messy. Shes depressed the kids are scared and confused. I dont want to get back together with her. But honestly, she has never been alone really, so I know she will try for that or latch on. We live in a very expensive part of the country. Her supporting herself and moving out is not going to be able to happen quickly. Itll put stress and have a ripple effect into every part of my life and everyone involved both directly or indirectly. 

On one hand, I want to help. But I also have a character flaw where I am nice and will always help another character flaw is keeping the people around me happy. Seeing the kids upset, and her that broken and defeated honestly breaks my heart. 

What do I do?",12Sep2018,5

I have problems though. The first one is that I get distracted by looking forward to finishing it and opening next one.

Another one is that I get frustrated when I realize I don't read very quickly, forcing me to stop. Although I can help this by practicing reading faster, if you have some tips, gimme.

The last and the worst one is procrastination. I have problem to stick to the books because I'm so used to computer and cell phone, so I tend to get distracted by one thought I get when I pause and I need to Google something about it. I surf more and more and eventually I have read much less than I intended during the day.

My dad has had a history of drug and alcohol abuse over his life which has since caused significant health issues. 
He was homeless 4 weeks ago. When his health appeared to become more dire my SO and I took him in. Little did we know the night before we took him he went on a speed binge overnight, we had to deal with his detox. Due to his drug past we said we would never took him in. 

He currently is on hospice care. Although he is not imminent he needs round the clock care. Which I cannot provide financially and I am soon going to be out of days that I can spend with him administering his meds. 

We are trying to get him a bed in a skilled nursing facility however no one is accepting him. 

If we cannot get placement would it be wrong to take him to a hospital have him admitted. Since he does not have a place to live some hospitals will not discharge a homeless person unless it is a safe discharge. Ultimately what this will do is have the hospital social worker find placement for him. 

Is this wrong? I am at my ropes end. I mentally and financially cannot care for him any longer.

367,"My Mom passed away 7 years ago. She had breast cancer. When I was informed that the her doctor had said she had approx 2-3 weeks left, I took family medical leave from work. I was living an hour and 30 minutes and had been driving regularly to visit and help. During the leave I stayed at my husbands grandfather's house, which was much closer, so that I was readily available. I did what I could to be with her through it all. I drove my mother to the Hospice center where she would finally pass away. There are things that happened during what turned out to be 8 weeks before her passing, that no one know she and I dealt with and went through because they were not present, nor did they ask. The point of all this is, I was there. I have a 2 living siblings and my father who I still resent because I feel like they were not there. I also feel like they have no appreciation for what I felt like was me dropping everything in my life to be there for my Mom. My sister had two young children at the time and when I brought up that she wasn't very present, her go to was that she had young children to tend to and could not. I won't waste time on my brother and Father as they literally have no excuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

This week my mother-in-law has been in the hospital. She has a lot of medical issues and is always at high risk for complications due to her life-long health battles. My husband canceled a very important business trip to be here for his mother. We do not have children. His brother and sister-in-law have two children. They are showing the same sort of behavior that I felt like my siblings did when my mother was in need. Lots of excuses and not finding ways to be present when we witness them find ways to do all the fun things they like to do in life whenever those opportunities present themselves. A lot of those fun things they get to do while my mother-in-law watches their children!

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like there are people that see that their sibling is handling it and won't say anything to confront their absence or lack of empathy, and they take advantage of this. The advice I'm looking for is on how to handle growing resentment and is there something that can be said or done that will inspire these people to put in more effort and realize that if they were the person in the hospital/nursing home/hospice... it sure does mean the world when people show up to support you, even if they are sleeping the whole time.

373,"I feel like no matter the retail job that I have, the customers just get worse. 

A little backstory:

I'm in college and I work at my school in a paper printing shop. Pretty self-explanatory - people place orders and submit their files and we print it out for them. The customers are almost always department heads or professors, which shocked me when they treated me like ass. Usually I get some nice ones that are super patient and really kind. And sometimes I get customers that treat me like I'm the scum of the Earth. As if I'm a robot that is only here on this planet to serve them, and that I have no feelings. And it's usually because I don't know how to answer their question within 5 seconds. 

This sounds like a dumb thing to get so upset about, but about an hour ago a woman called to ask about pricing for an order she wanted to place. She wanted a bunch of color copies and wanted them cut in half. We charge an extra $.50 per cut. For some reason my brain thought that we charged per cut PER PIECE OF PAPER. When in reality we have a machine that cuts the stack at once, so we would only add on the $.50. 

Running on almost no sleep and after an 8am class, I price quoted her for a shit ton of money. I didn't make the connection in my brain. She ripped me a new one. I apologized about a hundred times and she decided to bitch me out on the phone and make me feel like I literally deserve to die for giving her the wrong price. I can't help but take that to heart and feel like shit for the rest of the day. Crying in the bathroom has become a usual thing for me at work after a bad interaction with a mean customer. Maybe I'm just over-dramatic.

&amp;#x200B;

The two paths are completely different than one another. One being Industrial Engineering and the other one is Filmmaking/Advertisement.  The thing is that I have skillsets for both of these areas. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been making videos and short films and editing them since I have started high school and I have been using cameras since I was a little kid and made my first sorta short film when I was 12. I have always loved art in forms of both visual and music. I worked in 3 conferences this year in media department and in one of them I was also in the Public Relations department and my work has been liked by many people and lately 3 other conferences requested me to work in their media depatment.I have created social ads for a party and one conference. This seems like a great job but the pay in this job is not good and there is a slight advantage I have which made me get to the top positions which is I know some important people from this sector. However I met these people because they liked my works and people liked my works too.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to Indstrial Engineering, the reasons that I want to follow this path is that 1-It pays good, 2-I can get an MBA and get to manager positions more easily, 3-My family supports whatever I choose but they would be happier If I chose engineering. I am successful in managing people and I am a creative person. 

I know that I can do this job too because I am a succesful student, I have coded for a year, I am good in science (physics,chemistry,biology) and I have an entrepeneur mindset which would be useful If I became an engineer.And this career path is more secure both career and financial wise.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I love filmmaking/advertisement and successful at it right now, I know that I would be successful if I choose the engineering path. But should I risk it and choose what I love and good at, or should I choose what I know that I'll be good at and which pays well but I do not love.

OR maybe I am just trying to turnmy hobby into a real job. Maybe I should be an engineer who has a filmmaking hobby.Or should I commit myself to filmmaking/advertisement.

Hello!

I've started working as a cashier since March this year. After every shift, my cash register is being checked for any deficit. My average deficit per working day may vary from 3 Cents to 1,00‚Ç¨. 

Before I go into the detail with the incident metioned in the title, I'll tell you about this one I had before that to show you what kind of person I am: I once gave out 10‚Ç¨ too much. It's not long ago and my entire world for that day. You know, I'm that type of person that keeps thinking of the little things and of what ever people may think of me. On that day, 2 of my colleague, who'd always hype me and got the impression that I'm pretty disciplined at the job, were coincidentally in the same room when I had to sign a paper for having the 10‚Ç¨ deficit. That really fucked me up. I was a so ashamed, you cannot believe it. I was concentrated all the time, gave my best to have the ""zero deficit register"", which was rare. I've literally sworn to myself on that day to have the perfect register, and boom, 10 Bucks were missing. Like I've said, a world broke down for me.

But that cannot top the story from today: Today, I had a customer that wanted to change 40x 10‚Ç¨ bills for 8x 50‚Ç¨ bills. As the bloody scrub I am, I agreed and we counted the bills he offered me together. And I think that this incident caused me to have 220‚Ç¨ missing in my register. Either, they were missing. My supervisor and I counted the cash 3 times, by hand and by machine. Man was I stressed throughout the process. I thought to myself, ""How can I fuck up so badly? How is that possible?"". The thing is that yesterday, I had a 1 Cent deficit and it was the same supervisor who checked my register. That makes it even worse. What's worse is that before we concluded that there was a deficit, she asked me what I did with those 10‚Ç¨ bills while she was counting, because the bills which that one customer gave me were pretty rancid (not sure if that's the correct word). I've told her that this guy wanted to change 400‚Ç¨ in 10‚Ç¨ bills and she told me that we normally don't do that because there is the risk that the cashier miscounts or gets scammed. I said ""yeah, I hope I didn't do that"". Yeah, 5 minutes later, we both knew that this is probably the case. However, my supervisors are investigating that and I'm home now.

Maaaaan, I don't know what to do or what happens to me now. I have so many mixed feelings about this whole thing, but primarily, I'm so damned ashamed of me. Like hell, how could I be so naive and allowed this guy to change freaking 40x 10‚Ç¨ bills. And of course, I'm really worried. What if I got scammed? It would be still my fault. 220‚Ç¨ deficit are still 220‚Ç¨ missing and I don't know if the administration would want somebody sloppy like me.

The only good ending for me would be if it turns out that there were 220‚Ç¨ missing in the register from the beginning, but I highly doubt that.

If I assume that I got scammed or miscounted, I'll either get fired or I will resign, because I could not continue working there like that. That's a huge shame and everyone will know about the fact that I gave out 220‚Ç¨ for free. In addition to that, buying groceries there would be impossible for me then, holy.

Ugh, and I got a shift right tomorrow. I don't know how I'd feel to walk in there again. I'm so afraid of hearing the consequences, even though I am already sure that there won't be any good news for me.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I supposed to do? Should I really resign? Should I really worry too much about it? 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I (28F) and AT (29F) have been friends for almost five years. We met because I had signed the lease for an apartment and was looking for roommates. We were all in all four people when me moved in, and AT and I got really close really fast. She broke up with her longtime BF soon after moving in and I was there for her. We had some really wild and fun times, threw parties, went out but also watched movies and had six hour long conversations about everything. While living together, we never had any fights or problems and truly became friends. I don't have many many close friends and I felt like we had this great connection and respect for each other. 

About a year and a half after we had moved in, she told me ""I gotta tell you something"" and I thought it was about a guy or something. She told me she was thinking about moving out and living on her own, with her sister helping out with rent because she would sleep on the couch during the week. I was shocked and devastated and this was the first time I felt blindsided by her. But eventually I accepted her decision and felt like our friendship was even better after her moving out. We were there for each other through break ups, heartbreak, job issues, my depression and anxiety etc. 

But there were times I didn't speak my mind because I felt intimidated by her. Although I would consider myself probably as intelligent as her, I haven't reached much academically, while she has two bachelors degrees. But I felt like I looked up to her, the kind of person she was and how confident and self aware she was.

In 2015 I got into a new relationship. It was emotionally abusive and I had already been struggling with depression, anxiety and anxiety attacks for years. She was there for me, but not in the way she used to be. One time I told her I was having a panic attack and needed to talk, if she could speak on the phone and she said she was so sorry but her boyfriend had cooked dinner and she needed to go home. SHE! The feminist (like I am) and person who made me think friends came first. A few things like that happened but I didn't stay mad long. 

Fast forward to this February. She texts me that her bf of two years dumped her out of the blue and she thinks she shouldn't be alone. I said, no questions asked, of course and was at her house 30min later. I had just started a new internship and was still getting used to it but I was there, drank wine with her and talked as long as she needed. I offered to spend the night and told her about a dinner I had planned the next day anyways, inviting her already so she would have plans for the next night. She thanked me and I kept checking in with her the next day and offered to talk on the phone the minute I got off of work. I truly was there, offered my time and told her we could do anything she wanted to. She told me her and her now ex had planned a week of vacation in April so I said ""Hey, I need to tell my boss when I'll take a vacation so let's do something together"". Eventually we had agreed to road trip to a place where she has a few friends and I've never been. The day of our vacation comes around and I feel anxious, depressed and exhausted from the past few months of my internship and with a heavy hart and so much shame I tell her I have to stay home and chose my mental health first. I would of course never cancel if we had booked flights, hotel etc. but since we were basically visiting her friends I felt it was okay, not great of course, but okay for me to cancel. She went into ""Ok, well I'll have to figure it out, but it's your decision"" mode. Of course I knew she was upset and I totally expected her to be and felt she had every right to be. But she was ice cold to me when I asked a few days in how she was doing. So she came back earlier and we met up and I apologized and told her how sorry I was but that I also would have felt like an asshole and a burden (because, depression, hello) if I had gone and made everyone miserable and ruin her time because of how I was doing. I thought we were good but I guess we weren't. 

Ever since her breakup I basically have the theory that she (unconsciously or consciously) thinks that because she was hurt so bad she can be an asshole. 

For example, she moved apartments this summer and had this cute piece of furniture that I had always loved. She had gotten it as a gift by an ex. So when she told me she was selling it online I said ""Oh, I love that thing, I would have taken it.."" And she told me instead of 150.- she would sell it to me for a friendship price of 130.- Mind you I was barely hanging on financially (still am lol) so that is a lot of money for me. I told her I had to think about it. The day of her move came around and a friend from out of town came to help. She ended up giving it to him for free (!) because he had always paid for drinks when they went out (he makes a lot of money) and she thought his girlfriend would love it. I was so appalled I didn't even know what to say.

I've been through a lot of shit and I could always count on her to listen and talk to me. And vice versa! When her mom got sick I told her I would come to the hospital with her if she needed me to. When she had a toxic boss I told her to stand up for herself. With any guy drama I was always there to cheer her up. 

Maybe things just change or maybe she's changed or I have. But going from talking to someone almost everyday and seeing each other all the time to now not talking one on one but only in a group chat with another friend of ours and only about partying.. it's devastating. I miss my friendship and our good times. But I feel like too much has happened. I've tried to talk to her about it twice, asking her to be blunt and tell me if there was something bothering her, if there was something I could do to make things better. She assured me that nothing had changed and that she didn't mind being there for me. She used to be the person I would call first for anything, good or bad. And now that's gone. 

I feel like it could also be that she's keeping me at a distance because I've called her out on her shit so to speak. And maybe that's something she just can't deal with. But if she's not doing well she has to let me know so I know why she acts a certain way or isn't able to be there for me. 

Is this friendship salvageable? Do I want this person in my life? She has brought so much joy to my life but lately I feel like she doesn't give two fucks about me. 

Thank you guys for taking the time and any advice would be appreciated. ",12Sep2018,1
390,"I tend to over do indulge in things like eating, video games, porn, speaking my mind no matter how controversial the subject which comes at a high social cost (no point saying find different friends as I find it becomes tiring for everyone other than those who even I find tiring or unenthused to be around).


I find I have no self control. I have tried to be less controversial which helps but I have found that it makes me more likely to 'explode' when I do eventually open my mouth on what's bothering me, or I'll end up spending countless amounts of time arguing about shit on here (I do like arguing and whether it' me being devil's advocate or really believing in what I'm saying I am naturally contentious and I get more bored than happy when people say that I'm right). I'm on the verge of deleting this account and quitting reddit hence I have few comments in my history.


With video games it's too easy for me to binge on them so I've had to quit but the problem is that I work social hours with an erratic work schedule, and thus erratic sleep schedule so it's hard for me to be available to do social things. I also can have a hard time enjoying social things anyway, because I often get bored if I'm not doing anything in particular and we're just hanging out. I'm the sort of person who'll prefer to go to a bar or club that they'll enjoy by themselves than hang with friends in a situation they wont enjoy, especially because I know that I can be a drag if I'm bored.


I also tend to overeat if I'm not dieting/being mindful, but I will end up bingeing again or if I'm not dieting/being mindful I'll be constantly eating, it's ridiculous. I've recently tried to have calorie allowances that are more for maintaining current weight rather than lose and that's been a lot easier and less stessful to maintain but I haven't been doing it for long so the jury is still out. I'm not obese and never have been close to it but if I eat without restriction it's very easy for me to be noticeably fat. I find that I tend to eat I'm bored, stressed or anxious, and I'm in one of those states of moods quite often. I'm pretty snacky in general too.


As for porn I never had an addiction to it so bad that it was ruining my life, but I was at a point where I was watching it everyday which I still felt was a bit much. My sex life is also quite irregular. It's hard to quantify how damaging porn is, especially as I've found myself less sex obsessed when I don't watch porn, how sex obsessed I am is relative to when I last got laid. When I first tried to quit porn I had gotten laid recently which made it easier but in the months following it got harder. But then again it's very easy for me to not leave the house due to my lifestyle, so it's easy for me to not have anything to use from my err, memory banks...



**tl;dr**

Anyway I've gone on a bit too much but yeah, wanted to ask for advice on self regulation. I mostly want the self control so I can focus on my work, but I'm pretty work averse in general. I'm even more work averse when I'm not enjoying myself but I tend to overdo the things I enjoy, so even when I am enjoying myself I'm doing zero work",12Sep2018,1

394,"Two months ago I rekindled an online friendship with a girl I used to talk to, it was great and I was happy because I really like her and the fact that we kind of grew apart sucked. We met like a month ago for the first time and it was so much fun and I had a great time. We talk fairly regularly but a while ago (two weeks or so) she never replied to me. I guess she was probably not in a good mood and I probably said something that pissed her off, I guess? So I just left her alone and a week later I hit her up again but she didn't reply either. Now, do I text again, or just let it go and we'll probably never talk again? I really want to talk to her again, but I don't want to have to always be ignored you know? I've stopped trying with people long ago because I hate being vulnerable like that due to past (very) bad experiences, but I really like this girl and I've had a great time with her. Yet I won't really be ""heartbroken"" or something if we never talk again, since I've lost many friendships and dear people in my life already, but it still makes me sad when I remember that we don't really talk.

So the hard drive on his work laptop went out (i had been playing sims on it so it may have even been my fault but idk) So we go to best buy and he buys himself a macbook air. The exact laptop I've been talking about for months. He also says its for work and i can't even use it. Am i wrong to be super upset that he not only won't get me one but got one for himself? I don't work right now and take care of our daughter 24/7. I do literally everything that pertains to her, he might watch her one hour a day if i have somewhere to go.

yesterday evening she was out partying at some friends house and when i went to bed we talked and she said she will call me in the morning, but i insisted she should call me as soon as she is leaving the party, because im always worried for her and i just like to know if she is okay and talk to her.. . so i went to bed an and around 2 am she calls me crying saying that she will not be goong home because of a fight and she will tell me tomorrow morning and than the phone died... she calls again saying she is out of battery and she will call me  in the morning so i  couldn't sleep the entire night and was worried sick. in the morning she texts me she is now at home and i call her.. and than she tells me she was outside all night and a guy in a car picked her up saying he has a charger at home and raped her.. also she went back home in the morning and her 'best friend' called the cops because she was saying she does not want to live anymore.  now she is in the hospital for being suicidal.. i cant cope with everything she tells me. i dont know how to help her. i dont know what to tell her. i just feel sick and angry and sad and guilty, because i insisted that she should call me... maybe she wouldn't have gotten in the car if it wasn't for me.. i don't want to worry her even more with how i am feeling thus im keeping most to myself.. also i know how she is feeling .. i was also abused in the past, but im not sure if i should tell her.. if this would help her or if it would  just hurt her even more. everything triggers me right now bringing back memories of my past... i want to be strong for her but i dont know how and what the right thing to do is. also knowing that this guy did this to her and he is still out there and nothing will happen to him makes me sick to the stomach..i cant stop crying.

420,"Welp, okay, here goes nothing... 

A little more than 10 months ago now, one of my best friends &amp; I (she was one of my then-two best friends) were coming back from a Halloween party &amp; she was driving me home. On the way, she was telling me how her AP Calculus BC teacher was now requiring his students to turn in homework on a weekly basis to make sure everybody's doing it &amp; that, because of this, she'd now be forced to do that instead of copying it off of CalcChat on test day when HW had previously been due, as she had normally been doing up until that point. Now for some necessary backstory: so for like 4 months prior to this conversation, when Calc was a topic of discussion, she sometimes made self-deprecating jokes about how she got a 1 on her AP Calculus AB exam due to her pretty much not having really cared at all about Calc. Ok, back to the story: so after she tells me how her Calc BC teacher was now gonna require homework to be done &amp; collected weekly, I ask her if she thinks this is gonna help her be better able to pass her eventual Calc BC exam, &amp; she says something to the effect of ""oh yeah, definitely because now I'll actually be doing the work daily which will allow me to better learn &amp; retain the material,"" &amp; so then I (in what I thought would be perceived as being in the spirit of her previous self-deprecation) say to her ""well, no wonder you got a 1 on the AB exam,"" to which she... went... off. I mean off. She first immediately threatened to kick me out of her car (we were only a block away from my house at this point) before then saying ""Fuck you, that was a really shitty thing to say,"" &amp; I quickly apologized &amp; said I thought she'd take it as a joke &amp; she simply repeated ""that was a really shitty thing to say"" &amp; I apologized again, at which point she dropped me off at my house.

A day after the confrontation (I guess that's what it was, I don't really know the word to describe that), I heard from the 3rd best friend of our group that what she wanted was a real apology that I meant (i.e. not just me profusely saying sorry right after the conversation, as I had). But I was so sure I was right in that I thought she was way over-reacting (in that I thought her reaction wasn't justified given the context of the above backstory re: constant self-deprecation) &amp; it was something really petty to be so mad over that I figured, if she was willing to throw away our friendship over something I thought was such a minuscule issue, then so be it. So, except for discussing items relevant to our officer positions on our school's debate team (I was President, she was one of my VP's) &amp; this one time where she asked me if I wanted to take part in a card game during a random AP Lit class a few months after the confrontation in which we had a substitute that day, that was the last time we spoke. 10 months ago (during which time I was blocked by her on Instagram &amp; Snapchat, &amp; was also kicked out of the group chat that the 3 of us friends shared by her).

Except, fast forward &amp; here's where I'm at in my life right now: an unfortunate event has recently taken place, my uncle's passing, &amp; it's forced me to do a lot of self-reflecting. See, I went to visit him (as our entire family had, vis-a-vis a pilgrimage of sorts) shortly before his passing &amp; in our last conversation together, his parting words of advice to me were to not fuck up in life, &amp; to try &amp; have as few regrets possible. Hence, the self-reflection &amp; my coming to the realization that the manner in which I acted (&amp; over such a petty issue too) was a young, stupid &amp; immature one, &amp; that maybe if I hadn't been so blinded by what I feel like I now understand basically amounted to a fragile ego that felt the need to always be right at all costs, well then maybe I could've seen that I was losing a pretty good friendship in the process.

I also know that, regardless of what I do, my actions are gonna be a regret &amp; permanent drag on my conscience, but that doesn't mean I can't try to make amends &amp;/or rectify the issue while I'm at, right?

So /r/Advice, what should I do?

P.S. Thank you in advance to anybody &amp; everybody who actually takes the time to read the above, consider my situation, &amp; hopefully help a fellow redditor out; you have no idea how much it means, &amp; I look forward to hopefully receiving your help.",12Sep2018,1

I just had my wedding and an old friend of mine and I are in a major fight. This may be long but I‚Äôll do what I can to keep it short. 

1.5 years ago I got engaged and I was planning my wedding. Now about 4 years ago before I met my now wife, I promised my roommate(at the time ONE OF my best friends)that she could be my best man if I ever got married. Now fast forward to a little over a year ago and we were getting a list together for the people who had to be involved. The first person on my list was my roommate. At that moment it dawned on me that she could officiate the wedding legally and I thought it would be amazing for one of my best friends to marry us. To me it would have meant the world. 
     That‚Äôs where things went south quick. I choose my best friend from high school to be my best man and asked my roommate to officiate and explained what it would mean to me. I also wanted her husband in the bridal party, and her daughter (who I am extremely close too) as the flower girl. She told me to ‚Äúgo F*** myself‚Äù and that I betrayed her. (This was repeated multiple times this past year)
      So for the last year I have been acknowledging that I hurt her but it would still mean the world if she would officiate. I started getting nothing back and for a month she wouldn‚Äôt speak to me. 3 weeks before the wedding she asked me what I did to her that she deserved this treatment. I told her she did me no harm and I only wanted to make sure she was in a spot that meant the most to Me. She has been in couples therapy due to her getting pissed at her husband for being in my bridal party amongst other reasons. 
      The week before the wedding her husband told me he couldn‚Äôt be in the wedding due to her flipping out about it and it would be easier for him at home. Again I hold no anger at him for that choice. 
    Then I received the  following text on my wedding day: 

‚ÄúYou'll never guess who else got married on this day.  My other fake f***ing ""best friend"" from childhood, (friend).  S***, if (stepdaughter had another falling out with) would just choose to get married on this date, it'd be perfect.  So f** fake friends, f*** you, I hope something went terribly wrong, and leave me and my family alone.  Including (daughter).  I'll be sure to tell her that you decided you didn't need her anymore because you have (my wife).‚Äù

Now since I moved out 3 years ago, I have been over the house almost ever weekend for 1 day to hang out with them, help with computer issues (I‚Äôm in tech support). Got them all new computers and laptops. And just try to be apart of their lives. 

       Yesterday I talked to her on the phone and told her that I am actually worried and that she needs help. I told her that she is framing all of her arguments like I didn‚Äôt want here there. How do I move forward. Was I wrong? Any advice would be appreciated. ",12Sep2018,1
425,"My spouse and I have been looking for a house for WAY too long. We have lost on a few we liked along the way and are now living with family. 

Of all the houses on the market in our price range (and we have seen them ALL), the house we like most has one caveat. I checked the sex offender map and around the corner, about a block away, there is a registered sex offender convicted in 2001 of aggravated sexual assault of a child (a member of his family).

We do not have kids yet, but plan to start soon. My guess is we would live in this house for 5-10 years.

430,"Hello Adviceneers!  I'm in a little bit of a (non-Rick) pickle.  Hopefully ya'll can help with getting me to see the forest instead of the trees...grab some popcorn, it's going to be a long'un.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I work in information security and have an upper-management position for a company in Palo Alto (I live near Denver).  For my entire career, about 15 years, I have been traveling about 70-80% and it's been a lot of fun.  Status with airlines and hotels is a cool thing and it has paid for a few vacations with my wife and I.  Great, right?  She doesn't have to deal with me for much for much of the time and when I'm hope, it's great!

&amp;#x200B;

Then came my miracle daughter.  (just a side note...due to medical issues, my wife technically shouldn't have been able to have kids, as a few miscarriages and a VERY late term stillbirth attest to).  But, our little miracle ball of sunshine was born 6 years ago and it was pretty amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, back to the issue...when my daughter could finally begin to comprehend when I was going to leave (about the time she started walking and saying dada), I realized this jet-setting lifestyle wasn't going to work.  Eventually I was able to find a job that PROMISED less than 50% travel a few years ago.  Note:  they were in St. Louis (mistake #1)  After being home about 4 weekdays a month for over a year, I realized they had lied.  So, I found another job, this time for a company HQ'ed in Palo Alto (mistake #2).  I'm sure some of you have guessed it....I started in May and my travel is already over 50%. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the crux...this is a really cool job.  The pay is good, the people are brilliant and fun to work with, and it's really moving the needle on my career.  Here's the bad part...my poor daughter and wife are really feeling the pressure that I'm traveling.

&amp;#x200B;

A small amount of background:  My wife has some pretty severe health issues.  The aforementioned issues I stated above, plus thyroid issues, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, fibromyalgia, and a few other issues.  So, her ability to do a lot of things around the house are diminished.  My daughter (6 years old, 1st grade) is extremely empathetic and seems to have attention issues.  While those attention issues don't go away when I'm home, they are definitely lower.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since my new job started in May, my daughter has been acting out.  A Lot...like a LOT.  Both against my wife and her teacher.  Not listening,  being defiant, screaming, throwing, and just general anger issues.  She has no desire to learn, read, do her homework, or anything really.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, we brought her to a therapist just to get a baseline on what is going on.  It became very apparent to the therapist that my absence was a large component to her behavioral issues (and we see that as she gradually relaxes when I'm home).

&amp;#x200B;

So, since I place loyalty and care of my family above anything a company could provide, it's time I make a choice...and this is where your advice is greatly appreciated.  How do I approach this with the company?  I've started my job search in the Denver/Colorado Springs area already and have gotten some good traction with a few very good companies.  With that in mind, do I tell HR/my VP about these issues and what I'm going through with my family?  Do I just continue my job search and give the normal 2-3 weeks notice and call it good?  It's a lean infosec team, and losing 1 person (whether it's me or not) would be pretty devastating until a replacement could be found.  I would hate to just cut them loose when I find a new job, but I'm worried about divulging this and them just saying ""get out.""

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:  Great job for a company, too much travel affecting my family, how do I (or do I even) notify the company and tell them about this issue?

435,"Not to divulge too much information on him, but he told me when he came back after summer that he was actually developing some aspects of schizophrenia and that he had been getting help for it but wanted to just let me know. Everything was fine for a little while but I‚Äôve increasingly noticed some little strange behaviors out of him that makes me believe he is beginning to have paranoid delusions with me being the persecutory person in them, and I honestly don‚Äôt know how to approach it. He smokes weed which puts him in a worse state of mind in terms of that but, as I understand it, eases his anxiety. I don‚Äôt know if *I* am just being the paranoid one here either, so if anyone would like to weigh in on that let me know.

Basically, about a week to two weeks ago he came downstairs and told me he thought he saw me at the top of the stairs looking down over at him, to the extent that he ran back upstairs once he came down and realized I was on the couch. He said I locked eyes with him and maintained eye contact, he didn‚Äôt seem freaked out but rather was laughing so we kind of just laughed it off, with me then going upstairs to diffuse any unease about whether there was someone else in my room or the bathroom. The next time he got high, he started asking me if I had ever read any of his notes and I asked him what he meant and he just was suspicious as to whether or not I had read any of the notebooks he uses for class. This comes up again later, today I grabbed a single sitting scrap of paper to write down my number for the third, just moved in roommate from the kitchen table and after the fact I noticed the paper wasn‚Äôt actually blank but said ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre here watching‚Äù instead. Then today, he came home and noticed the other guy was smoking weed and asked that he not on my behalf because he knows I have respiratory issues when it comes to smoke, just sets me off. I told him thanks then explained this to the other guy, who seemed to understand and just said he‚Äôd take more care since I only really had a problem if I inhaled the smoke directly. The roommate this posting is about overreacted a little bit and later texted me then immediately knocked on my door because he thought I was basically telling the other guy something different, and when I explained what I had said he just had a very strange look in his eyes that I wasn‚Äôt really familiar with, like someone scared. He‚Äôs also started asking me random little things about his appearance and demeanor, I always respond positively because I don‚Äôt want him to feel insecure even in his psychological distress, but the other night it went a little far when I came in and found he had cut all of his nails to points and asked me if I thought it looked stupid- I told him yes a bit, and he said he had done it by accident even though it was every finger nail on one of his hands but didn‚Äôt seem hurt by the way I said it since I said it didn‚Äôt really fit his aesthetic or style. I was really uneasy about this. Then a while later I was downstairs in the kitchen and he started running in that direction, just from the living room out of nowhere he ran into the kitchen and looked at me- I asked him what was up and if he was alright, and he just said sorry and seemed a little confused/flustered. We‚Äôre on good terms in general, I am not the most sociable but I‚Äôll chat to him whenever we‚Äôre both in communal spaces about whatever comes up and we do try to look out for each other in terms of making sure we have food and the things we need around the apartment communally, but I‚Äôm increasingly becoming paranoid that he is paranoid of me and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Partially it makes me feel anxious, because if he is progressing into schizophrenia as he had indicated then I don‚Äôt know how to respond if he becomes violent or if that‚Äôs even something I should expect. 

Sorry for the wall of text but I just wanted to make sure I mentioned everything, and even writing this I‚Äôm realizing that I didn‚Äôt say everything that was bothering me about his interactions with me the past one to two weeks. ",12Sep2018,0

Recently, a photo of my language arts teacher from his Facebook page of him smoking weed has been going around.

This guy‚Äôs kind of an asshole, and many of his students will agree with me on that. Overall, he‚Äôs not the nicest person. The tests he gives us are poorly written and are very hard to do well on. Recently, we took a test on a book we were assigned to read, and out of his four honors classes, one had half of the class fail, one (my class) had a third fail, and the other two had several fail as well (I believe 30/110 or so failed total). He blamed it all on us for ‚Äúnot putting in enough effort.‚Äù (Seriously, at what point do you realize that if this many students are failing, you‚Äôre at least partially at fault?) The test average for all of his classes was about 65%, with nobody getting higher than a 90%. We don‚Äôt actually learn anything in his class, and much of the work he assigns us seems pointless.

In the aforementioned photo, you can clearly see him smoking a blunt. (Note that any possession and/or consumption of marijuana for any purposes other than medical is illegal in my state.) I‚Äôve been debating on whether or not I should tell an administrator, considering he might get fired for it. He posted the photo over 4 years ago, but he was still teaching at my school at the time. 

So far, everyone I‚Äôve talked to has said I should go through with it and report him, I don‚Äôt know if this is something my district would fire him over, or if he deserves to be fired it. I can‚Äôt decide whether or not I should do it considering he might get fired.

I graduated college with a Bachelors in Advertising, Account Management and soon after found myself in the world of corporate sales. I hated it. After some while, I decided to take a step back and do something I had always wanted to do and that was to Enlist in the Air Force. I currently have 2 years left in my initial contract and want to start my masters (Air Force will help pay) but have concerns about getting it in Business and stepping back into corporate America. 

I am applying for Officer Training School within the Air Force but I want somewhat of a plan if I do not get accepted. 

My thoughts have been this: 
1: Apply to Officer Training School to fly jets (I‚Äôve always wanted to fly and while I‚Äôm surrounded by jets now I need more)
2: Obtain Masters in Aviation Management (Work for companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, FedEx, etc.)
3: Obtain Masters in Education Counseling, possibly becoming a Guidance Counselor in schools (I‚Äôve always wanted to help people and if I went back to get a bachelors I would probably get it in psychology. With that being said, I believe I have had an interesting path and believe I can guide youth in so many directions. Applying to college, financial aid, dealing with a military recruiter, etc.)

I know what you‚Äôre thinking.. these are totally random paths. I know.

446,"(Dunno what to flair this)

Possible trigger warning idk

Also, I‚Äôm on mobile so sorry for any formatting errors 

So, basically I‚Äôm terrified of being gay.

I dunno why I‚Äôm like this. I‚Äôm gonna try and explain my thought process about it and I wanna hear what people my age think.

I‚Äôd like to start by saying I have no issue with anyone but myself being gay, I‚Äôm completely accepting of the gay community and such. But personally i dunno what‚Äôs going on with me.

I am a traditional thinker and someone who thinks a lot in the past in regards to my own thoughts and actions.

I‚Äôm of the belief that I must grow up, make money, marry and continue my family line and name. I want to do this and that‚Äôs, I think, why I‚Äôm scared of being gay. Like, i feel like I cannot allow myself to be that way and I intend to suppress any gay feelings I may have.

I bring this issue up because of a lot of thoughts i get and a current situation.

I‚Äôve met this super amazing guy and he‚Äôs bi, I‚Äôm really not sure if he‚Äôs interested in me because he‚Äôs very ‚Äòexpressive‚Äô and i may just be reading it wrong. If he did confess anything to me idk wtf I‚Äôd do. Since i met him I‚Äôm talking and saying things that, to me, are sappy af but i mean them, I always wanna keep him smiling. I just cannot let myself get any feelings for him and I‚Äôm scared I might but I gotta refuse and idk why I‚Äôm like this. It‚Äôs not 1800 anymore I should be able to be open to the idea in relation to myself, but I‚Äôm not.

They way I talk to him and him to me is that of something you‚Äôd expect from a couple. And as much as he‚Äôs an amazing dude I gotta stop myself from giving in to any shred of feelings i may have. I feel like this has to be suppressed and I fully intend to. But why! Is what I don‚Äôt understand.

If you read this far thank you, it was difficult for me to write. I apologise for any grammatical errors. And I‚Äôm sorry if this offends anyone.

I think I like working with my hands. In my free time, I love video games, writing, and cooking. I know I'm only 22, but I feel like my time is absolutely running out on my life and if I don't decide NOW I'm going to either be a burden to my family, or I'm going to be trapped in a job that I can't emotionally handle and have meltdowns in public that will cost me my livelihood.

But the main reason was she decided to invite her boo-thang.  She told me that just a few days ago before her bday he physically assaulted her. As in while they were arguing in a car, he stopped at an isolated location, took her phone, got out the car, threw it on the ground, opened her door, and pulled her by her hair out the car. When she said she still wanted to leave to he pulled to his side and started choking to the point where she couldn‚Äôt breathe. All because she decided to leave. Even with what just happened she decided to give another chance and invited him to come celebrate. After hearing about what she told me and to hear that she invited him to celebrate, I decided not to go. I couldn‚Äôt be around nor meet the man who my friend. It hurt me. Even though she said it would mean a lot to her if I did, in the end I still didn‚Äôt go. I told her I respect her decision but I could support it. And I said sorry that I can‚Äôt do it. I felt if I had went then I would have thought that it was ok. That it was ok for my friend to go through something like that. And that it was ok for her to be physically assaulted like that. That it was ok for him to get away with that. And that it was ok for her to be mistreated. I could not handle that. But my other friends decided to go so I assumed she would be ok without me. The next day while I was texting in our group chat here I felt like this tension. I felt like the other girls were annoyed with me for not showing. I could have been wrong but I still felt that way. So I stopped texting for the rest of the night just so they could get there space. And the day after that I went the whole day not texting chat just because I just did not feel like talking at all. And then today i still didn‚Äôt say anything because I forgot about the group chat all together. And then my friend texted me asking if I was cutting her off because of a boy.

457,"I‚Äôm a 19 year old female from South Dakota. I had always considered myself to be straight for my whole life until a few months ago when I noticed that I‚Äôm no longer attracted to my boyfriend or to any boys that I used to be attracted to and now I only like girls. I am still confused by how this can happen but I guess that‚Äôs not really my main concern anymore. 

My boyfriend and I had a fight that I used as an excuse to break up with him. I was already planning to break up with him before this happened anyway but I was scared of how he‚Äôd react and I didn‚Äôt want to tell him that I‚Äôm gay now anyway, so this worked out well for me I guess.  His parents kicked him out when he turned 18 so he had lived with me for a while at my parents‚Äô house (he stayed in the guest room). I don‚Äôt know where he lives now. He and my parents and pretty much everybody I know are really staunchly conservative and generally hate gay people so I haven‚Äôt told anybody yet except for one of my friends from work and she promised she‚Äôd keep it a secret. 

My mom is kind of insane and really controlling and overbearing and she blames me for splitting up with my ex because she liked him a lot. She tries to control everything I do and takes every opportunity to make me feel miserable any time I don‚Äôt listen to her because she wants me to be just like her. Recently she took all the blankets and sheets off of my bed as well as my space heater in my room because I had been sleeping naked lately which she describes as ‚Äúwhorish‚Äù, so now she‚Äôs forcing me to sleep with clothes on or freeze. So I‚Äôve mostly not been sleeping at all. She‚Äôs done plenty of other crazy stuff like this, pretty much my entire life. I once reported her to my school but they wouldn‚Äôt do an investigation because she wasn‚Äôt physically or sexually abusing me. I believe she‚Äôs intentionally trying to ride the line of abuse so she can keep treating me like dirt with no consequences.  My dad treats me fine but he is basically a slave to my mom and refuses to help me if it means going against what she wants. 

My friend from work (Kacie) told me that I can move into her finished attic soon so I can get away from my mom, I just need to save up for half of the month‚Äôs rent which is about $300. I only make $150 a week so I‚Äôm doing my best to save up for now. I‚Äôm really worried about moving in with her, though. I think she‚Äôs really pretty and I‚Äôm really attracted to her but I‚Äôm still not comfortable with having gay thoughts yet so I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm supposed to think. She‚Äôs from New York and she isn‚Äôt like anybody else from around here. She told me she likes girls too but she doesn‚Äôt keep it a secret. I don‚Äôt have any reason to believe that she likes me and I also don‚Äôt think she knows that I like her in that way. She told me that she was an Instagram model for a while before she came to South Dakota and she sometimes sends me pictures of herself only in her underwear but the pictures aren‚Äôt very sexual as far as I can tell and I think that‚Äôs just how she dresses at home. But i guess I don‚Äôt know to interpret it. 

People have described me as being naive, I guess because of how my mom raised me, so I don‚Äôt know what I should think. I also don‚Äôt have the slightest idea how I should interpret my own feelings. I‚Äôm worried that if she does like me in that way that I won‚Äôt notice it until it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôm also worried that if she does like me and she wants to kiss me or do sexual things with me or whatever that I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do. I never had any kind of sex education because of my mom‚Äôs religious beliefs so I only know a little bit from what my ex told me. 

I‚Äôm worried about how my relationship with her will turn out but I think I have to move in with her either way because I need to get away from my mom as soon as I can. 

Thank you for reading my post and for the advice. I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm coming off as offensive in any way, I don‚Äôt mean to if I am. ",12Sep2018,1

461,"This might be long and seem like a rant, but for reasons that will become clear, I don‚Äôt have anyone I can really discuss this with. 

I‚Äôm a 22 year old male who recently graduated from college with a degree in biology. Currently I‚Äôm taking a gap year. I might go to medical school, I might get a permanent job, and I‚Äôm also trying to write a novel and maybe get published. Currently, I have a job as a substitute teacher to help pay my student loan payments as well as help around the house since it would be wrong to live at home for free when I‚Äôm making money. 

The issue is how I‚Äôm treated by my parents. There is a distinct lack of respect towards me. Very often, when my dad wants me to do something, he won‚Äôt ask and instead will force me to in one way or another. For example, my grandparents can‚Äôt drive themselves places. My younger brother had an important event that my parents thought my grandparents should attend. I was not informed of this event, but 2 months in advance, my dad told them I had agreed to pick them up early in the morning and take them back late at night. He never once asked me if I wanted to, he just lied and said he asked me. The night before the event, I for the first time am informed of it and that I have responsibilities. I‚Äôm forced to cancel my previous plans last minute.  This is a fairly common occurrence. 

My mother is a constant complainer and nagger. Nothing I do is good enough. I don‚Äôt ask for praise, just for a lack of anger towards me for helping, but not doing enough to help apparently. She‚Äôs also the type of person who is always right and will go out of her way to start fights and throw fits if her perfection is questioned. This means that I cannot voice complaints or make requests, since they are always shot down, often by claiming I‚Äôm a sensitive snowflake or some other buzzword. 

The result is that I‚Äôm stretched to my limits with work and having to essentially run the household, but what I do is always not only not good enough, but somehow bar and deserving of punishment and anger. I‚Äôve considered couch surfing just to get away, since I don‚Äôt make enough money to both pay my student loans and pay rent somewhere, but I know that can‚Äôt last and I‚Äôd have to come crawling back. How can I resolve this?  Talking it out doesn‚Äôt seem to work since my opinions are written off, so I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

462,"Hey /r/advice.

To save you from a huge backstory, last year I had a really terrible mental breakdown (was overusing the shit out of LSD), and effectively ruined all of my relationships in my hometown. Everyone I used to know basically sees me as a psycho (for totally justified reasons).

So for the last year and a half, I've been effectively alone other than one friend who stuck by me. At this point I want to just get out of my home state and start fresh somewhere. I don't have much in the way of higher ed (Associate's degree). I have a friend who would probably let me stay with him a few states away.

I feel like shit about everything that has happened, but everyone I've talked to has pretty much told me it was too much to come back from. I've been isolated/depressed so long I feel like I've lost all my social skills. I don't really do much other than Reddit, work, and watch twitch streams, and I feel like I have nothing interesting to say/talk about. I don't feel interested in anything, which I assume is a symptom of the depression.

I'm basically worried that even if I relocate, I'm just too depressed and messed up to actually make any real connections.

Also, I've stopped all drugs at this point. I want to start up therapy again, but I don't really want to do it before relocating, as I feel like that's kind of pointless. Has anyone been in a position like this before/have any advice or tips for me? I honestly just want to get somewhere else, make new friends, and get my head back on straight.

473,"So there is this girl in my gym class and we will call her kelly. Kelly is pretty attractive and likes to flirt a lot. I flirt back occassionally, but most of the time just stay kinda calm/ reserved. I will begin by talking about me; I am kinda a mix of a few different types of people [i dont really fit a specific mold] I dress preppy, am social, interested in finance, computer programming, and video games. I can talk about almost anything as i try to stay informed, and have even been trying to learn some jokes here recently. I have never had much luck with girls however.  This year things are starting to change and i am a lot more comfortable with myself and approaching girls i find attractive. I am also at a new school this year so it makes the approach easier.

To begin, in the past few days kelly has really been getting touchy. Every day she comes into class and sits really close beside me or just will sit in my lap. Kelly has also started Hugging/ trying to cuddle during class. Today she put her arm around me and slowly moved her hand up my leg and grabbed my butt for way longer than comfortable, but not long enough where people really noticed. She does these things and i just kinda try to act calm like it happens all the time. In my mind though i am definetely not calm. Kelly has also talked to me about how she is interested in another guy who plays guitar. I have seen them together a few times so it makes me hesitate a little. Today she seemed to really be concentrated on me. The other day however she kissed a guy who is in the class with me. After he kissed her kelly started really emphasizing that they where only friends. He claims that they are best friends and she just kinda ignores him [Poor buddy got friend-zoned]. This seems like great news in my mind, one less guy to worry about. I had gotten kellys phone number during the second week of school. In all honesty i planned to ask her out sooner, but have been checking out other options around school.

So basically, I (25F) have struggled with some pretty severe depression for many years. Started as early as middle school, but I didn‚Äôt realize it was depression until years into college. Before that I just figured it was a phase that would pass. I‚Äôve always been really introverted, and I have a tendency of not getting super close to people. I know how to have fun and be silly, but there‚Äôs a certain closeness that I can‚Äôt achieve with many people. I don‚Äôt know why, it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt want to be close, I just get...drained of energy so quickly. I didn‚Äôt start seeking help until years into my university career, when I started learning -in my classes, mostly- the obvious and less obvious signs of depression and isolation that I also recognized within myself. I‚Äôll also add that depression runs pretty deeply on my mother‚Äôs (62F) side of the family (my grandma and uncle sleep for 15+ hours a day, they both have hermit-like tendencies, socially isolated, etc., etc.). I‚Äôm scared of ending up like them. I don‚Äôt want to look back and see how much time I wasted staying home and sleeping on my free time. I don‚Äôt want to waste my youth. 

Despite my depression, I‚Äôve tried really, really hard to overcome how I feel and how I am. I‚Äôve gone through stages of denial. Done the whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just keep busy and not dwell on things!‚Äù bit. I‚Äôve tried keeping busy with part-time jobs and extracurriculars throughout college, on top of normal classes (joined a social sorority to get more social and make more girlfriends, was a research assistant for multiple summer/fall semesters for many psychology research labs at my university, did some volunteer work at an animal shelter for some time, joined my school‚Äôs honors college...just about anything to keep busy.). I even did extra school courses to try and go above and beyond to graduate with dual degrees (Psychology &amp; English) that would help me with my career. I‚Äôm currently still studying and taking post-graduate classes to get an education certification (my goal is to become an elementary school teacher, with focus in reading comprehension and verbal language skills, and eventually get into a masters program in education). Eventually, I completed the extracurriculars and graduated, and was relieved when I was done because I was pretty burnt out from always being on the go. From what? Perhaps just my own mind. 

I mean, I‚Äôm doing everything I can to prove to myself that I‚Äôm not lazy. I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm hard working. But I just don‚Äôt believe it. I can‚Äôt shake off this feeling. Because the truth is, I really have to push myself to get out of bed every single day. I have to push myself to get my work done. I have to push myself to do just about everything, even small talk. I have to take everything a little bit at a time, and see the joy in the ‚Äúlittle things,‚Äù because I‚Äôve seen the big picture and it overwhelms me. I get depressed thinking about my future, to the point where I don‚Äôt even see a point in going on dates. I don‚Äôt know why, because I know I am fortunate to even have gone to university. I know I am sounding ungrateful, and I truly am appreciative of the people in my life. I do try to see the little things and make the most out of it. I really am. But it‚Äôs so hard. 

These days, I don‚Äôt see myself doing much outside of work and classes. Right now, I‚Äôm working at a local bookstore, and soon I‚Äôll be starting off as a substitute or student intern/teacher‚Äôs aide at a school (fingers crossed!).  And even though I know these things are all fine and dandy, and it‚Äôs to be a new chapter in my life, sometimes I wonder about my personal life. I used to be so active, I used to physically workout a lot and be much more social and happy, and even though I still put on a cheerful outlook, many days it‚Äôs just difficult for me to even text a conversation. I avoid social media because I am weary of the people I used to be friends with, and who have now gone on with their lives. I want to be strong for my future students, but I can‚Äôt help but doubt myself. I want to be a fun and good teacher in the future, and I often wonder if this will hinder me for life. 

These days, when I‚Äôm not at school or work, I‚Äôm just...sleeping. Like my mom, and grandmother, and uncle. It really scares me. And there‚Äôs so much I want to do! I used to read all the time. I want to be able to do that again. I want to start taking art classes (like stained glass) or dance classes to keep moving, or just walking around the block more and get my blood moving. I used to be so active in yoga and spinning at my local gym. And even though I have a gym membership, I just...can‚Äôt bring myself to go. Just thinking about it makes me drained. I want to do these things so badly, and I realize the only thing that‚Äôs stopping me is my own motivation. And I feel so guilty not being able to do these things that I used to love. It‚Äôs just that deep down, it all feels so futile and empty. 

I‚Äôve gotten tested in the past and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with my thyroid, but I am on antidepressants (Wellbutrin). About three years now. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre really working, but I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre doing something if I manage to get out of bed for class and work (I went through a period where I could barely do that). I take multivitamins too, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm vitamin deficient (anymore, at least. I‚Äôm vegetarian so I need them.). I‚Äôve recently started taking this pottery class with my mom, a friend, and her mom. And it‚Äôs been fun (today will be the second week of class!). But the thing is, I want to be motivated again to do things without other people. I want to be independent and be happy. I want to have enough drive and energy to be able to get myself to the gym, to get into these art classes alone if I can‚Äôt find a buddy, to take up reading as often as I used to, to volunteer at the animal shelter, to start swimming again, etc., etc. I miss being social, but most of my friends have turned into distant acquaintances and are busy with their own lives. I haven‚Äôt even been on a date in over a year, and it‚Äôs not because people haven‚Äôt asked me, but because I always turn them down when they initiate. I just don‚Äôt have the will to really meet anyone right now, because I don‚Äôt feel up for making a new relationship with anyone, much less a future partner. I‚Äôm just so exhausted. My moods are usually lethargic, emptiness, or overwhelming sadness. I know how to laugh with people, but...the sadness always comes back. It‚Äôs not everyday, but it‚Äôs most days of the week that I feel like this. I know I need to push myself. I can‚Äôt help but feel like this is my fault, that I am just dwelling and need to just toughen up. I‚Äôm a psychology major so realistically, I know it‚Äôs not the case, but it‚Äôs how I feel. I am always blaming myself. I want to work on myself and get into these hobbies and meet people, I want to be the type of person who can wake up at 6am for a morning run before work, but I don‚Äôt know how to really get myself out of this rut. I don‚Äôt know how to find the joy in life again. I feel like there‚Äôs this glass wall that separates me from the rest of the world. And it scares me to think, what if I‚Äôm not going to be a good teacher because of this? What if I never outgrow this? If I‚Äôm not strong enough to face myself, how will I face the world? My future students and their parents, or the faculty? I want to remain positive for my students, because right now, my future as a teacher is my strongest passion. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôm living for. I just want to live for myself, too. I don‚Äôt want to look back in a few years with regret that I didn‚Äôt do enough to live my life to its fullest.

478,"So it's my Junior year of college I have my associates degree in Liberal Arts and I have a 3.8 GPA. I'm taking 4 classes this semester, out of the 4 there are 2 professors that don't teach and just make you do the work based on your previous knowledge of the subject. My College Physics class requires me to know precalc but I've never taken precalc until this semester. I've wanted to take breaks from school in the past but my parent's won't let me do that. It's either school or get kicked out and find a way to live on my own. At least that's what I think would happen since my brother's been kicked out in the past for other shit. I just need advice I feel that I just hate school and have no idea what the hell I want to do. I love my major which is Environmental Science but all these pointless classes I have to take to get out the way just piss me off and I just don't know what to do.",12Sep2018,1
479,"I was thrown under the bus this week. I am part of a Secret FB group related to politics. Most of the posts are just memes or info about political figures, stuff we wouldn't necessarily want our conservative family members to freak out about.

I recently posted something vaguely personal about a teacher at my kid's school. Basically I just confirmed that she does, in fact, like Trump. In person and online she's been kinda vague about whether she's just toeing the party line or actually likes the guy. But no, she actually likes him. 

In the comments section someone asked who she is. I replied that she's a teacher, but she has no background in her subject and no rapport with kids and isn't very good at her job.

THEN SOMEONE SCREENSHOTTED IT AND SENT IT TO HER.

What.theactual.fuck?

The WHY of this boggles my mind. But whatever. This person betrayed everyone in that group by screenshotting something private and secret, and mostly me, obviously.

So, how did this come to light? Let me tell you. Person A texted Person B to tell Person B about it. Person B is in charge of the PTA, of which I'm a member. I happened to be sitting with Person B when the text came in, so she told me who Person A was and that I should take down the post. Which I did. Damage done anyway.

Then I compared the member list of the secret group to the teacher's friends list. There were about 10 names in common. Only 2 or 3 were/are really contenders. Person A used to be in secret group but never quite wanted to be, said she hid it from her feed, etc. She is friends with teacher on FB. (Is there any way to tell WHEN someone left a group?)

So was it person A? I mean, why would a teacher call someone who is not a fellow teacher or an administrator in the school when she found out about this? Why would Person A call the PTA and not me? Occam's razor tells me it's her, even though there are a couple of other vaguely slimy characters on both lists.

481,"My problem is actually very dumb and I know it but for some reason I don't seem to let it go. Two months ago my best friend (for 5 years and girlfriend for 6 months) (I know it's not a lot) broke up with me, the reason one disagreement , just like that one simple thing. 

The reason behind it, in her words ""she didn't wanted to hate me"" I told her that we could work things out but she said no and tell me the we can still be friends!. 

For a week maybe I tried to be her friend I love her that much but one day she stopped the messages and all communication, then rant me about how I was manipulating her to change when I asked her if ""I"" was doing things right and if she was happy with me and just like that disappeared from my life. 

Now it's been two months and I still miss her she blocked me in everything but Facebook I don't know why and i see everything she post, things from, toxic people in her life to... well her flirting with other guys. 

The thing is no matter how much i want to, I can't block her or eliminate her from Facebook i can't move on, i still love her, i miss her with all my heart and Facebook is the only thing that I have left of her. 

I know it's stupid, but i don't know how to move on or how to muster the courage to rip her from my life and heart. I'm trying to but the thought of not having her in my life hurts a lot. 

So if someone please could tell me how to move on from her I'll appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.

489,"First off, I‚Äôm (F/21) not pregnant and I‚Äôm not planning on having kids for a couple years. In the past year, I‚Äôve had more trips to the hospital than I can count on two hands and two feet. I‚Äôve never had to go for myself, but I‚Äôve had to go because of parents‚Äô issues. Most of them were ER visits, some were surgical. Nothing major went wrong, but I dread going to the hospital every time now. I hate sitting there for multiple hours and I get more and more anxious until my emotions eat at me from the inside and just bottle over and then I burst out in tears.

Because of my fear/anxiousness of hospitals now, I don‚Äôt want to give birth in one. I‚Äôd rather do a home birth with a midwife. However, my fianc√© and I have had the discussion multiple times and he would prefer me at a hospital in case of complications.

I don‚Äôt know what to do to make hospitals more of a positive place. Between deaths of grandparents and my sister losing 2 babies, I just don‚Äôt see any happiness in hospitals. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do to lessen the negative feelings I feel when I have to go in whether for myself or family members?

490,"Whatsup reddit,

I'm 22 and I am from nj. I recently took a trip to Indiana for a few weeks, and I have been working for a close friend of mine. I applied to a restaurant and I got into a pretty popular/fancy/historical restaurant here. It is a college town and it brings thousands of people on football gamedays, especially. This restaurant offers free 2 year school, vacation and benefits (full medical/dental/vision). It's a serving job, and the servers make good enough money, especially since Indiana is an inexpensive area to live.

I'm actually thinking about staying here. I'm scheduled to take a train back on October 20th, but what would you say is the right thing to do? All of my friends and family are in new jersey, but I have been there for 20+ years and I'm growing sick of it. Jersey is also crazy expensive, and i would have to likely live with my parents unless i get a lucky break. They are known to be coddling/helicopterish. If I stay here, I would probably do a few years of school and then head back home. My parents would probably also help me out with paying for school and such.

&amp;#x200B;

The info above may not sound like I'm in dire need of losing weight, and health wise I'm not, but it's something that I would personally like to do. I really don't feel comfortable walking around with these extra pounds, and realistically I would like to be around 150-160 lbs.

 

Unfortunately, I've tried for years and years and years to lose the extra pounds, but literally nothing has worked. From buying the Insanity workout DVDs 5 years ago, doing soccer and wrestling in high school, going vegan last summer, and this summer having an online coach and going to the gym literally every day it was open AND working at a farm, I've never lost a single pound in my life (Somehow ended up gaining 5 pounds this summer). Still the same pudgy body with no tone, big butt and thighs; the exact opposite of what I want.

After all this, I'm really leaning towards an extreme low calorie/starvation diet. I'm so tired of this fucking body I have, not even counting calories and exercise this summer helped, nothing changed. So yea.. I don't know what else to do.

500,"Please excuse my English if I make errors and excuse the length of this story. I`m trying to make sense of what happened a few hours ago.

My husband and I moved into this ground-to-1st floor apartment 6 months ago. It`s in a quiet residential street where cars and people pass by every now and then and there`s barely any traffic at night. Opposite of our building is a kindergarten due to which the little parking right in front gets crowded around 7-8 AM and 3-4 PM with parents dropping their kids off or picking them up. That, and the kids passing to/from school is the most action our doorway sees each day. Past 5 PM there are few people around.

We leave our bikes in front of the building, right below our living room windows. This is a European country where everyone and their grandma has a bike (usually an old one that gets one from A to B) and leave it outside overnight. They do get stolen a lot, but there are so many bikes around that the odds of it being your bike are tiny. The building has a locked basement where a number of tenants keep theirs, but it`s quite inconvenient to move it there every day. My ladies bike has a basket and I used to find an empty beer can inside now and then, but that was the extent of the `troubles` I had.

Then, this morning around 8 AM, my husband looks out the window and sees my bike on the ground. We notice immediately that it didn`t just topple over to the side - it was lying on the wrong side, i.e. it had been moved. My husband goes out, sets it upright, gets on his bike which was right next to mine and apparently untouched and cycles to work. 

I go about my day, my cousin came to visit from abroad so I bring her to ours to eat and relax before we head out. Around 6 PM we walk out the building door and bump into my husband who just locked his bike and was getting in. We stop and chat for 5 minutes after which he goes in and we go for a walk. As far as I recall there was no one else around in our vicinity.

My cousin and I come back around 9:30 PM. It`s dark and we`re alone in the street. We approach our doorway and I see my bike on the ground again. Its little ‚Äùstoop‚Äù (the little ‚Äùleg‚Äù near the left hand-side pedal that enables it to stand upright without leaning on a wall) is completely twisted. I knock on our living room window and my husband comes out. He didn`t hear a thing, but he took a shower sometime around 9. He looks at his bike which is upright and realizes the same part that is twisted on mine has been completely broken off on his! There were two other bikes parked next to ours`, but they weren`t damaged.

At this point we decide we`re locking the bikes in the basement for the night. My cousin helps me with that. The entrance to the basement is around the corner from the front of the building. As we turn around the corner, we see some dude standing right in front of those doors, smoking a cigarette. He turned around as we approached and stood a meter away when I unlocked the door, but kept standing there, smoking and `waiting`. He was still there when we moved my husbands bike. I got a bad feeling about him the moment I saw him. He didn`t look local and there`s no reason why one would be smoking right at that spot. 

I feel distressed, the feeling of safety/belonging here have just been tainted. I don`t know why us. We are foreigners in this country, but so are the majority of the tenants in our building. We don`t know anyone here personally and never were in any trouble. We`re both European, working professionals... Not saying anyone else deserves this, justbthat I cant understand how we could have provoked this.   Why would we be targeted? It feels bad. And I don`t know what`s next.

502,"I'm 16 years old, and this girl is 12. We met on a dating community, and we hit it off. She said she was 15, and knowing how she looks, you'd be fooled too. We ended up doing a bit of dating, where we weren't too serious for about 6 months. Over time, she revealed more and more, and I became uncomfortable with the situation.  Then, today, she told me that she was 12 and that her parents and friends abuse her and she wants to move in with me. I told her my home state and showed her my face, so I'm sure if she ends up killing herself I'll be linked to it. I'm terrified for my future because no matter what I'm stuck.

505,"I was thrown under the bus this week. I am part of a Secret FB group related to politics. Most of the posts are just memes or info about political figures, stuff we wouldn't necessarily want our conservative family members to freak out about.

I recently posted something vaguely personal about a teacher at my kid's school. Basically I just confirmed that she does, in fact, like Trump. In person and online she's been kinda vague about whether she's just toeing the party line or actually likes the guy. But no, she actually likes him.

THEN SOMEONE SCREENSHOTTED IT AND SENT IT TO HER.

What.theactual.fuck?

This person betrayed everyone in that group by screenshotting something private and secret.

So, how did this come to light? Let me tell you. Person A texted Person B to tell Person B about it. Person B is in charge of the PTA, of which I'm a member. I happened to be sitting with Person B when the text came in, so she told me who Person A was and that I should take down the post. Which I did. Damage done anyway.

Then I compared the member list of the secret group to the teacher's friends list. There were about 10 names in common. Only 2 or 3 were/are really contenders. Person A used to be in secret group but never quite wanted to be, said she hid it from her feed, etc. She is friends with teacher on FB. (Is there any way to tell WHEN someone left a group?)

So was it person A? I mean, why would a teacher call someone who is not a fellow teacher or an administrator in the school when she found out about this? Why would Person A call the PTA and not me? Occam's razor tells me it's her, even though there are a couple of other contenders on both lists.

I would like opinions on whether you think it would be Person A or someone else. ",12Sep2018,3

508,"So right now I am a 20F taking online courses to become a vet tech. Right after high school I went to the University of Maine. I had so much anxiety there, I wasnt the person I wanted to be there, and instead of giving Maine another try, I dropped out. I actually didn't end up taking my final exams there. 

I then went to my local community college for a few months and my depression of about 6 years was going furthest downhill its ever been, there for me dropping out again and going into a psych hospital.

I tried to go again Spring 2018 semester but i wasnt ready and only lasted a week.

Now I'm taking online courses to become a vet tech. I do love animals, but what I would really love to do is work in a Wildlife preserve as a wildlife ecologist. That takes four years of school. 
I miss university. I made so many friends, and did so many awesome things and was never bored. Now I can hardly find the motivation to do school work. And thats not because I'm depressed, its because I have no one to help me. I don't like the way my college is set up online. I want to go back to a regular university. Has any one done anything similar or have any advice for some one in my situation?

510,"For anyone that does not understand what I meant or never heard of such thing before:

This type of companies/agencies will normally hire and train you for 7-11 weeks. After you completed the training program, they would market you and ""modify"" your resume, so you would look like an experienced software developer. After this, you would work with the account managers in the company where they would try to get you interviews from other companies. 

**Here's the CATCH:**

 * I would have to sign a 1 yr contract with the agency, which means I need to stay there for a yr until they land me a job. Then I need to finish the rest of the time in the company that hired me.

 * If I fail the training program or I want to part away with the agency, I would need to pay a penalty of 10k+

 * There's no pay, no nothing during the training phase. (some other agencies might pay minimum wage during training phase)

 * part-time salaries (900-1k) while I'm waiting for interviews

 * fixed average salaries once I got hired(many other agencies have way-below-average salaries)

 * I heard some people might be waiting for months and only received 2-3 interviews. (but the agency that offered me the position would allow me to leave if they couldn't find me anything in certain amount of time)

I just recently got an offer from an employment agency to be a Java/UI consultant, and I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with it? If you do, do you think is worth the risk? How did you do? How many people/co-worker around you did well?

Any advice/insight would be helpful, Thank You in advanced.",12Sep2018,1
511,"Basically I'm in college in a pretty good relationship with my girlfriend. Really don't have too many complaints. However, about a year ago I dated someone I came to care about tremendously in a long distance relationship. Seeing as it was long distance it never really blossomed into anything serious. Said individual and I still care about each other and intend to keep in touch/see each other when the opportunity is there. I have no desire to cheat on my girlfriend or be intimate with anyone else, but I certainly still care about this other person and would like to keep a potential future with them on the table. Am I an asshole for enjoying a good relationship with somebody while keeping in touch with someone who has potential in the future? How close is too close with this other person? These circumstances being me graduating from college in a year and a half. My life could go in any direction after that. I'm just very confused about the situation, call me an asshole if that's what I need to hear...",12Sep2018,0
