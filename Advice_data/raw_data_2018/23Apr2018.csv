1,"My younger sister is currently in 6th grade. She has this male friend that she refuses to call a boyfriend, but we think he is. Me and my parents don't think that she is ready to be in that commitment, she is still young. However, she continues to always text him and everything. After looking at some of the texts (which are very confusing. Sometimes its like they're speaking another language.) they seem to be particularly more-than-friendly. We've never met her boy friend, and don't even know what he looks like (that doesn't matter, we just mean we have no clue who he is). I can't find much about him through my friends. She currently wants to go to the movies with him, one of her girlfriends and another male friend, essentially a ""double date."" The only one we know is her girl friend. What should we do? Are we overreacting? Thanks!",23Apr2018,2
2,I want to talk about something but at the same time I can't really explain it without giving context but that context would require me to share something my friend wants to keep quiet about herself. I can't really explain why a situation is how it is without sharing this but I feel like im kind of betraying her if I do.,23Apr2018,2
5,I want to die but I dont want to commit suicide. Can I do things to put myself in a dangerous situation or something idk.

6,"I have a sword, probably 30"" from tip to the top of the handle. It is poorly manufactured. (Not straight, tip pierced through scabbard, loose handle.) I paid maybe $70-80 for it, so it's not like I didn't expect it to be shit. Anyways, after having it for a while I have decided it is just a POS that is taking up space. It has a sharp tip, and a sharp blade. I was planning to throw it into the dumpster at my apartments, but I'm not sure if this is the best way to dispose of it. 


I was wondering what y'all's thoughts would be on the best way to dispose of it. ",23Apr2018,0
7,"Zoos make me really sad because they mistreat the animals by holding them in captivity and I would hate to give them money from my admission. I know I would just think about how stressed out the animals get from being stared at the whole time! And I would much rather be dropped off at the DIA while they go to the zoo.

9,"Or for anyone who does have high anxiety, how is the best way to reassure you when your having a problem?

My friend gets anxious a lot, she always overthinks her actions and thinks people think worse of her than reality.

Like today she texted that she came into work with short sleeves. It's been pretty hot lately, but not really the right season for cooler work dress.

Her school's Vice Principal commented on them (just asked if she was cold. Not actually said it was inappropriate. But we're both foreigners in Japan and they're not very direct about what they actually mean.) and so now she feels like she's dressed wildly inappropriately.

I honestly don't think it's a big deal (I've come in to work with short sleeves plenty of times already this year) but she's texting me that she cried at her desk because of it. She's a lot more sensitive to this kind of stuff.

This happens a lot. I never think it's that big of a deal but I understand that this is just her personality and she can't change how she feels.

Usually I try reassure her that she's just making a mountain out of a molehill but I feel like that invalidates her feelings and it's not actually helping. But it's also hard for me to feel sincere in totally comforting her when I can't rationalize her reaction to a problem I don't think is very serious.

Do I just say ""That sucks""? She's texted me paragraphs about this one incident. I feel like just saying ""That sucks"" isn't good enough for how she feels...I've also offered solutions but she shoots them all down.

But it's not just this one incident. This happens a lot. I want to be able to support her but I'm not sure how to go about it.

How do I balance out assuaging her fears while also being sincere in proportion to the problem?",23Apr2018,1
10,"i'd put it more as ""friend"" or acquaintance, not really the nicest dude, but he was something. I've been speaking to him less and less throughout the school year, which is fine, but i have a class with him in which i know no one else. I get the feeling he's petty, like if i don't sit with him next class he'll know i'm doing the same (like a ""you can't fire me, i quit"" but in reverse). recently he unfriended me on facebook, it isn't much of a big deal, social media and all, but not even for the 1 extra friend, it's a bit petty. I'm sure i haven't done anything wrong, maybe i annoy him but he's not that nice anyhow, i just get the feeling he doesn't wanna be friends.

He doesn't do anything totally bad, he's kind of a dick, not a completely bad influence, but he also just doesn't do anything for me to keep him around (mean to say but true). We have class, meet up to play basketball once a week with the rest of our team, never study together, never hang out. He's paid for the team fees, so he decides who starts a game, and he literally invited people he recently met onto our team, and they start ahead of me. I get you wanna win, but we don't win anything if we get first place, it's more of a fun for friends college thing, we won't make national play offs or something. 

I find our friendship weak, i doubt he'll even invite me or some of my friends next year, so i'm planning on doing my own thing. I need advice on how to discretely go through with it this semester. Like what to do in our shared class, at our ball games, etc...",23Apr2018,1
11,"When I was around 1 year old my parents divorced. Growing up I did a lot of moving around. This helped me with social skills, causing me to be highly extroverted, but made it difficult for me to keep friends. I moved four times between the ages of 5-13. 

I had a lot of friends but none of them were serious. I only had one best friend named Max but we kind of drifted apart recently. 

Flash forward to 8th grade. That summer I moved into a school district that I am still in today. Over that summer I found a friend group in the area that was very nice and welcoming. I connected well with all of the people in there and we were all great friends through 8th grade. During 8th grade I bonded with one girl specifically, I’ll call her Sam. Sam and I were pretty close. I would talk to her about crushes, family problems, and even the fact that I was suicidal once before, but she was never more than a friend to me. 

During the middle of 8th grade I was cast in the lead role in our play. Sam and I were still very good friends but I started getting feelings for the co-star in the play, let’s call her Sara. 

The night of the play Sam gave me a piece of paper that told me how special I was to her. I thought she liked me but she said she gave one to another guy in the group. It was very personal, nonetheless. That night I folded it up and put it next to my bed for safe-keeping. We were still just friends to me. 

After the play ended I started dating the other lead in the show. We only dated for 2 weeks until she broke it off (lesbian). Glad I helped her realize that, I guess. In that 2 weeks something horrible happened. 

Because of all of my moving around I never really had a girlfriend beyond a few little instances where we liked each other. While I dated Sara I guess Sam got jealous and started flirting with me pretty heavily. I asked her to stop because it was making me uncomfortable since I had a “girlfriend.” She did but I guess she was embarrassed. We didn’t talk at all for the rest of the year. I didn’t know why at the time. I thought we were still good friends. 

8th grade graduation came and all of the other girls in the group were overly affectionate to me, saying goodbye and shit. I was confused because I was sure we would see each other over the summer. 

We didn’t. 

That summer I hung out with one person, call him Louis, and he wasn’t even in that group. I told Louis that I thought my group was avoiding me for some reason. He assured me they weren’t, but he probably just said that because he had no reason to believe otherwise. He was just as dumbfounded as me. 

I talked to Sam once during the summer for help and she gave me a bunch of excuses as to why nobody’s available. 

Freshman year came and I was still being avoided. Nobody would start conversation with me or invite me places. It wasn’t until one of our friends had a birthday party that I wasn’t invited to. I cried heavily that night when I realized they really all didn’t want to be friends with me anymore. 

One night I was lying in bed and realized I still had that ducking note she gave me. I also noticed a spider crawling around my bed. I took the note and squashed the spider with it. Then I burned it in the backyard. 

It wasn’t until halfway through freshman year when I finally connected the dots on this whole mystery. Sam and I connected fundamentally. She had fallen for me head over heels somewhere in that process. We grew even closer, talking everyday during and after school. Then the eighth grade dance came and she was bummed that she her “date” had dropped. I told her I would take her AS A FRIEND. I made it clear that that was known. Then Sara came along and because I was a dumb shit and that I thought Sam knew it was just as friends. I asked her if it was okay if I went with Sara instead. 

I am well aware now about how douchey, mean, and immature this was but I was in 8th grade and didn’t have common sense. 

She agreed and the other guy she gave a letter to took her instead. The weekend of the dance I was grounded and couldn’t even go. 

Flash forward back to freshman year when I realized this. I immediately texted her saying how sorry I was. She told me not to worry about it and that she forgave me. I expected her to apologize for literally having my only friends excommunicate me from the group but she never did. 

I found new friends, who I’m still friends with now, but I still can’t shake the feeling that they all hate me for some reason. Or they’re just avoiding me. Or I’m some sort of nuisance to them. I’m probably not, but every little thing leads me to believe they are. I know it’s just in my head but I can’t get rid of this feeling that they all have me.

12,"I’m 30 years old and newly married. My husband and I have sex once a month, twice if I’m lucky. His sex drive has never been that high, but since he put on the 60+ pounds, he’s had a pretty low libido. He likes to talk about how how his sex drive was high when he was young and skinny and just how long he could go for. Now a days, it’s like he doesn’t care anymore. He got the girl, why try anymore? At first it was okay. I thought maybe I just had an abnormally high sex drive, but it’s just gotten worse. It was once a week and I was pretty satisfied, then it just dropped down more and more. There was even a point where we would go a few months without sex.... and we were still in our 20’s!! I thought maybe it was because he lost his job and his confidence was shot. But it still continue even after he found a good job and has lost some weight. I know he’s not cheating on me, so I’m not worried. But the lack of sex drive just has me in the thought that maybe I’m just not attractive? Maybe I’m just not good looking? I mean, I gained about 40 then I lost it all. I look the same as we first met, yet still he still is t interested in sex as much. I’m at the point where  my toys aren’t cutting it and I want a friends with benefits. I had this realization with my therapist just recently. 
It’s also not helping when my therapist has been encouraging me to take my clothes off while I’m there. He’s hot and for him to tease me has been making things worse. Is that professional of him? No, but he’s been the only one I have ever felt comfortable enough to actually be 100% honest with him. Fuck, I wonder what he has in store for me? I’m tempted to call him on his bluff and just take off my blouse. Let’s see what he does. While he do something? He’s offered someone else sex in exchange for sessions. I’m waiting for that offer, I think I’ll take it. 

But realization settles in when I know that nothing will happen between him and I. So he I am again, stuck in a dirty fantasy and no outlet to get these sexual frustrations out. Seriously, I thought the men had high libidos and the women didn’t? I just want someone to fuck the shit out of me. Make me cum. Make me moan. Make me scream. I need this and my husband can’t deliver.

My family has a house down south and I live in New England, I really wanna go down myself and drive down but I don’t think my family is gonna let me drive for 12 hours by myself (I have had my license for like 3 years) so it’s not a matter of driving experience.

15,"Background. My SO didn't meet his bio dad till he was already an adult (because his mother is a smart women and knew bio dad wasn't a fit father, bio dad agreed). At that time SO was having issues and bio dad along with his gf let him stay with them. During this time they formed a sort of bond, and now SO tries to include bio dad in his life. 

While he was living with them he helped in everyway he could, with money, cleaning, taking care of gfs kids. Bio dad and gf are toxic together and have an on and off relationship. They got into pills, spending money on that rather then bills. They left the kids with people who abused them. They are not my favorite people. Since then, bio dad has made significant improvements in his life. Gf has not. To clarify, bio dad is not the father of gfs kids though he tried. 

So gf got evicted, and didn't do anything about it till the day of. After much debate and bickering, they ended up living in my basement. I don't want them here, they are the type of people you know is going to bring drama. I agreed more as a favor to SO then to them. They honestly didn't have anywhere else to go besides a homeless shelter, and I understand not wanting to put them there. They probably didn't have options because they are shady people and every they asked knew better but I digress. 

So they're living in my basement probably the rest of the month. Gf and her two kids, girl and boy. She has a truancy court date next month because both keep skipping. The boy was caught smoking weed in the house a few days ago. While I'd honestly rather them smoke weed then do the pills their mom is ""clean from"", this kid is 12. 12! In my house? No, hell no. I'm not having CPS knock on my door for not my kids. 

Recently I've seen more and more of why the kids act how they do. Their mom treats them as a burden, has called them retards, blames everything on them. Yes they are their own people but they've grown up in a shitty situation and I can't put all the blame on them. SO has tried time and time again to be the positive role model in their life but when he's not around it goes back to how it was. 

Part of me wants to tell their mom every stupid thing she's done to get in this situation, part of me is afraid she'll turn violent. She doesn't deserve the title mom, she was an incubator and has literally fucked these kids lives up time and time again. They were arguing a few nights ago and I heard her yell ""Why do you keep *fucking* cussing?!"" WELL I WONDER WHERE THEY GOT THAT FROM. 

Yes they are shitty kids, they don't listen to a word she says but with how she treats them I don't blame them. They listen to me, they listen to SO. She herself can't follow basic rules! We had friends over and SO warned her a week in advance that just this one day we needed the house to ourselves. My sister is super pregnant and I don't want her to have to stress over it like I've been. A friend of ours is very anxious, especially around kids, and we didn't want her to feel uncomfortable. 

Well of course, they were here. Which is ok to a point because they're down stairs. Except gf kept finding dumb excuses to walk up stairs. Until now every meal she made for the kids was pretty simple stuff, oh but no on this day she just *had* to make something that required her to be in the kitchen for almost a full hour. You have to feed the kids, duh I get that. Bio dad was kind enough to buy this more expensive food for you guys, I get that. But she kept interrupting SO every ten seconds with conversations that could wait. 

SO was getting visibly upset and that takes a lot. And she knew, and kept half ass apologizing yet blaming the kids. ""Oh boy is so picky he just had to have this certain thing. Girl forgot this oops! It's not me it's them!"" Like gf any other time they do stuff like this you call them retards but now, in front of guests, you're super mom to your ""horrible demanding"" kids. It's hard to explain in text but you could tell she was playing the pity card. Our guests noticed and they barely even know them! My overall point is that she seemingly purposely ignored basic requests. Nothing is her fault, ever, it's bio dad's or the kids or the school system but not her. 

A lot of it is small things that wouldn't matter if they weren't all together. Just today I went to do laundry and there was a load in their that had to have been there for days it smelled so bad. She keeps half ass hand washing the dishes when we have a dishwasher, then acting like she's so awesome. Yes I appreciate it but they're mostly their dishes anyway. I had been wondering why she won't use the dishwasher and finally figured out today. I went to put a load in and the bottom filter was clogged with nasty oil, hair, and food. So she tried to, fucked it all up, never said anything, and seemingly requests praise for hand washing them. 

Sorry this turned into a rant. My question for you guys is, is this a lost cause? Screw her, she fucked up her own life, but I worry for the kids. Her court date is coming up and we're pretty sure she's going to jail, meaning the kids will go to the state. I feel like that's either their best chance of turning their life around, or that they'll end up on the same path as their mom. I am NOT taking these kids in. Yes I care, but I'm purposely child free, we can't afford them, and they honestly are crazy freaking kids. Taking them in would give her access to them when she gets out, at least if the state has them she'll have to prove to them she's fit to take them back. 

I worry for SO also. He thinks he owes them because he stayed with them. While he stayed with them, he helped them out. While they have been with us it's been nothing but drama and screaming. She's the type of person to give an inch, knowing she'll demand a mile down the road. He's stuck between them and me, I didn't want to make him choose. Is there anyway to make him see she's using him? 

Has anyone been in similar situations? I want them out before the cops get involved, as they should be. I'm worried something will happen while gf is working (yeah sure leave for work and don't even ask if it's cool that I watch your kids/s) and suddenly *I'll* be the adult responsible. They are old enough they don't really need watching, but the law doesn't care. I'm over 18, they are not, so I am responsible. It's been giving me the worse anxiety.

Any advice or suggestions or just confirmation I'm not over reacting would be amazing I'm just in over my head. For the record, SO has put his foot down and stopped even more crazy stuff from going on. I refuse to make him destroy the relationship he has with his bio dad, and sending him every time I get mad might do that. He's way too nice of a person and will never turn down someone in need. I don't want you guys thinking he's ignoring my wishes, I just don't want all the stress to fall on him. ",23Apr2018,1

20,"So my friend(USA) had depression for just about 5-6 months and he got to the point of being hours away from suicide. He spoke of all the ways he could do it in great detail which freaked me out. I called suicide hotline as soon as I knew he set a date and asked for advice which is when reality kicked in and I couldn't stop crying on the phone.

After I the call. I decided it was time to tell his mum who was unaware his depression was this bad since he hid it from her. Telling her mum is legit the hardest thing I have ever done and I couldn't tell her without crying and shaking uncontrollably.

Currently, he is getting better even found a gf who was on the brink of suicide as well. Which has been wonderful to see him improve from something so horrible. Although they are moving really quickly as they have been dating for a month and already talking about moving in together and getting married. I even spoke to her and she told me something chilling last night saying if they couldn't be together they would both commit suicide which has not sat well with me in any way shape or form....

But after over a month of dating with this person, I am now the third wheel and we don't talk much anymore.

I feel really alone and still feeling the rippling effect of my friend, My dad (who was also suicidal at the time and cheated on my mum) and my brother all suffering from depression (Currently my dad is improving). But I feel really burnt out and alone now.

It doesn't help I'm not a social person and all my friends live overseas (which I don't mind I tend to find amazing friends overseas but I tend to be thrown into third or fourth place (I miss being someone's best friend).

31,"The past year of my life has been one of those, you can't make this stuff up experiences. I was locked in a hospital for 30+ days unable to go outside because I was alleged to be a danger to myself or others. Then when I was released to go home I found all my belongings packed in my car and the locks changed on me and a restraining order was filed in court so I could not step foot in my home without a police escort. I am ashamed to be a part of my family, but I am unable to make the changes to get them out of my life. The outright lying, vicious betrayals, and subsequent abandonment has got me living a daily loop of fear and loathing. I am trying everyday to break my cycle of despair. I fear that being in these abusive relationships have ruined my ability to love and I will never have a healthy family. I know ""we don't get to pick our family"" and I don't want to come across as ungrateful as some do not even have a family to begin with. Sometimes I fantazise about being adopted.
I was living with my little brother and his girlfriend for some time and the tension in our household was getting worse and worse. I have been unable to work for several years now after several stomach surgeries and now a thyroid nodule my Dr has biopsied twice has shown follicular cells in other words cancer. I may not appear physically disabled (despite being very underweight at times) and I think this bothered my brother and his girlfriend because they always were talking to me about how I should get back to work and if I wanted a girlfriend that I would need a job. My brother is the type of guy who thinks he pays too much taxes and lives in a dog eat dog world and in his opinion all the degenerates of the world should be put on an island (by his standards I am one).
His girlfriend Jenny and I got along well until I guess because I made an off color joke about how since she had moved in they had put locks on almost every door in the house (excluding my room of course). I'm talking locks on the door to get to the door type situation, not just locks on bedrooms and bathrooms. This reminded me of when my father and step-mother used to lock up our food (pantry door, and refrigerator). Jenny eventually started complaining about my brother to me about how he spent huge amounts of money on cloths, how he was a different person when they got drunk and he would show boat. I tried to just listen and let her vent but I was very concerned about his drinking and his recent firearms purchases. Eventually she got abusive toward me telling me ""you think I'd let you take care of my dog"" and ""what a joke"" referring to my financial contributions to the house hold even though my brother used me as deduction on his taxes. I was just trying to fit in, get along, and get healthy. My brother had just bought a handgun and an assault rifle (AK-47). I asked him what the guns were for as we lived in a safe neighborhood and they made me uncomfortable, especially a high-powered rifle in the house. Despite what I thought he had a license to carry or as he called it ""my license to ill"". Everywhere he went he was strapped, even to go to the bathroom. His girlfriend even found the gun, loaded, left on a table outside the bathroom and alerted me to take care of it. God forbid he left the gun out for any one of the number of guys who did work on his house to find. My brother used to dry fire the gun all the time and I would hear this from the other room. So I told him why it is bad to dry fire a gun, it might wreck the firing pin. You might not believe me but he also pointed the gun at me while dry firing it so many times I took a video to show my family. I had no choice but to show my dad and mom but it changed nothing (I want to show the police but I am afraid of the consequences for my little brother) Later when I confronted him about the video which I texted him he told me ""that's a video you had me make as a joke"" worst lie I have ever heard, I mean come on. This is the problem with lying ""No good man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar"" Abraham Lincoln Well, things were ripe for a conflict in that house. I was walking on eggshells. I even started waking up crying, something I had never done in my life. Like I would come to out of a deep sleep and be crying when I woke up. I was loosing sleep and had been up a lot. I tried staying at a hotel several nights to let things calm down and give them space but that got very expensive. This is were my father comes in. My father has been how should I say this... a guilt-trip-dad. His only motivation to being a father I believe comes from guilt, but maybe I am wrong. Maybe he came from a horrible family I guess i'll never know why he acts like he does because he won't talk to me anymore.
I was at home one day back in September when my dad calls out of the blue and demands to come over and take me out to lunch. This was odd because I could not remember the last time he came over to my place and I was busy playing guitar. I told him no and we hung up. Guess what? He showed up anyway and just walked into the house. He came in and was trying to bully me into going out to lunch with him. I think maybe he thought I would loose my temper. When I told him to leave he called the police. I am serious he called the police and told them I didn't recognize him, I didn't know who he was or what his name was. I think he said I was yelling, basically he told them I was acting crazy. I was not. I let the police and ambulance crew in they were cool, and I know they were just doing there job. They explained they just wanted to check me out and make sure I was ok, they did and as I was not crazy or acting crazy they went on their way. This is were things got real messed up, a day or two after my father showed up my brother came home in the middle of the day with two police officers and a section 12 order signed by my psychiatrist and a judge. As I understand it my psychiatrist said I was ""being made out as some monster living at my brothers house"" and that my brother or father threatened his license if he didn't have me committed. So the police put me into an ambulance, I had no choice it was like I was being arrested but the prison was the hospital. At the er the doctor talked to me for less than 5 minutes and I was left alone in a room overnight in the er, they took my cell phone and wallet which were locked up. As far as I understood it if I tried to leave I would be shackled. No one told me anything about what was going on, I think the doctor asked me if I was thinking about hurting myself or anyone else but I never thought about hurting myself or others.
I was driven to some other hospital by ambulance the next day and forced to go into a psych ward for the next 30 something days. Being in there was hell, I cried most of the first few days. I was very disoriented, couldn't sleep, the windows had metal grates over them. The bathrooms were locked and you had to ask for permission to use the toilets. While I was using the toilet the nurse came in my room and grabbed the door out of my hands forcefully and I didn't let go (I think its my right to use the bathroom when I need to) she came back with a bunch of men and they held me down to the bed, pulled down my pants and gave me a shot in the butt of god knows what which is called ""chemical restraints"".
The doctor at this hospital never did an evaluation we talked for no more than a minute or two during his daily rounds, the level of care was abysmal. There was no congruence between the care and medication I received outside the hospital and inside the hospital. On the contrary the hospital was not a caring, healing place but a place where gross negligence and willful neglect were common practice. The patients were treated more like cattle than human beings at times. I even heard a patient speak to his doctor about suicidal thoughts only to be released the next day. Sadly he fell from a parking garage and died a few days later. Maybe it was the medication, it sounded like the whole unit was on the same medications, some on more some on less subtle variations but you get the point. I did whatever I could in the hospital to tell my family how bad things were for me, called advocates, and contacted the president of the hospital. However, nobody cared or would do anything. I was unable to keep up with the outside world as I had no access to my cell phone in the first few weeks to keep up with the world in order to pay bills, and stay on top of my responsibilities. There were so many conflicting things going on, my outside physician was saying I was supposed to be there for three days at a maximum but I had been there for weeks. After a few weeks (what to me felt like a lifetime in there) I found out I could sign something called a three day. This was some kind of petition to leave, I asked to leave against medical advice but was told I could not. The staff and the patient advocate told me I would have to go in front of a judge, why I did not know. I was conscious, awake, eating (though the food sucked) and taking care of all my normal things...bathroom, showering ect. When I went in front of the judge I had an anxiety attack, my heart was pounding I was so nervous I just wanted to get out of there and go home. My brother testified that I was seeing little green men, other lies about the past, and he said I threatened him and his girlfriend. Then the doctor testified that I was having racing thoughts, and I wasn't attending groups or something. I was speechless and couldn't believe my dad sat and said nothing. The lawyer I was appointed was completely useless at one point before the trail he said ""maybe you could leave here with a broken leg"" I had no idea what he meant. He didn't seem to have any idea how/what to object to during the trail either. The judge found me ""unable to take care of myself"" and I was legally committed for up to 6 months. From then on my first priority was to get out of there. I started loosing my will to fight, which is exactly what I think they all wanted. They wanted me to submit and go along with the program. In the hospital I lost a lot of weight, I cried more than I ever had in my life, I was not given my medication, at time I felt like I was fainting or loosing consciousness, I developed these headaches along with a pressure in my forehead that feels like a horse is standing on my skull. I got really sick while I was in the hospital they said it was strep throat but the pain in my throat kept coming back months later so bad one day I couldn't eat. The only thing I got to ease my pain and suffering was an antibiotic.
While I was in the hospital I was glad one of my friends could come visit me a couple times he brought me pad thai and helped me spark my will to fight the injustice going on all around me. My other visitor, my dad, was not such a welcome site. Especially when he showed up with my step mother. My step mom and I don't get along, she hasn't ever showed my any signs she cares about me. I remember my last birthday I went over to my dads and all they talked about was how my dad had to pay child support to my mom and how unfair it was and how unfair it was that she had to pay child support to her ex. Seriously that's all we talked about for my birthday. This has gone on since I was 6 years old. They bash my mom in front of me/to me and then i'm supposed to get along with them. Sorry for the inconvenience of being born, sorry about the laws that society made that holds you responsible financially to your kids. Some people don't need a law to make them do whats right. And how do you think it effects your kids when you show them you can't get along as parents? Or that your more concerned about money than your children? Clearly we don't get along, not like I haven't tried, but what is she doing at the hospital? Not only that but my dad walks in and says I said f you to my step mom over the phone and I have to apologize. I told her calmly to leave, she left and waited for my dad outside the unit. My dad went on to threaten to disown me in my hospital room and he kept telling me I could not go back home to live with my brother and his girlfriend. He said he was going to help me with some money to get a new place, then he said ""all the money goes to my step mother""
3 months into my hospital sentence my brother called and kept trying to get me to admit over the phone that I threatened him, I never threatened him or his girlfriend. I told her to leave that is it. I am not a violent person and the people I am friends with and know me know that I am not violent. In fact, the violent ones in my family are my brother and father. If I threatened my brother he would want to fist fight right then and there.
So when I was on the phone with my brother he told me if you don't admit to threatening me ""I will get my girlfriend to get a restraining order on you"" I hung up told some people I was friendly with on the unit what just happened and they advised me to notify the staff which I did. Sure enough the next mourning, after I had been in the hospital for three weeks the police showed up with a restraining order to serve me. Real messed up stuff going on here, that means she lied in court just to make sure I could not return to the house I was paying rent at. That is how they threw me to the curb. I guess the whole thing was a way my family could use the courts/hospital/doctors to make me homeless and suffer.
I don't know what to do. I mustered up the courage to call the police to report a crime and tell them about my brother assaulting me but they told me I had to come to the police station to report a crime. I don't know exactly what I want out of this but I know what I don't want...move of the same. I keep going about my life like I should keep this all in and to myself and it keeps manifesting in so many different ways in my daily life. I keep blaming myself. I don't know what to do...anyone have some solid advice?",23Apr2018,5
32,"I went on a date with a girl I met on Tinder. It went great. We had a fantastic time and although I went in not expecting much at all, before we knew it the place was closing and we had spend 4 hours talking. She wanted to come back to my place but I worked the next morning.

The next day she messages me saying she had ""sooo much fun last night"" and even called me ""bb"". She even suggested a place saying: ""I should take you there sometime"".

We wanted to make plans for the next weekend but she had a bunch of school work to get done (end of the semester/school year). I was busy too so I didn't mind.

I hit her up last Sunday asking how her work was going but got no reply. I didn't want to seem pushy so I didn't send her any more messages since then. 

It's now been a week since my last message. Has this died? Should I text her again? Is it too desperate?",23Apr2018,2

35,"Just thought I'd post on here to get some advice from anyone. So here is my situation:

I recently turned 21. I'm a male student in my 4th year of a Law &amp; Commerce conjoint degree. I live at home with my parents, and two younger brothers. I've generally always been content with my life and am usually happy. I have a good circle of friends who I see regularly outside of college and that genuinely makes me happy. We do usually stuff people our age would do \(gym, play video games, go clubbing, smoke weed etc etc\). I'm not an introvert but not exactly extroverted, so I generally keep to myself but I can hold a conversation well. I've struggled with confidence and self esteem ever since being teased a bit in high school.

However, the past few months I've been feeling sad or just downbuzz in general.  I've thought long and hard about and I think there are 2 main reasons to my change in daily mood:

\*\*Poor Love Life:\*\*

Pictures of me: https://imgur.com/a/kGOkDNZ

I'm single and have never had a proper girlfriend. I'm still a virgin and the furthest I have got with a girl is kissing \(making out\).

I've been on a few dates with a few different girls over the past few years, and was seeing a girl for a few months when I was 16/17. Most of my friends \(except maybe 2\-3\) have girlfriends or have had one. I've tried tinder and I get quite a few matches \(last time I had around 100\), but I a lot of the time the girls don't reply or are just on there for a laugh. Plus I also find it kinda weird to meet someone online, would rather it happen organically \(in real life\). I don't think I am an ugly dude, probably average?

I had girls interested in me in highschool, but now I am at college it seems way harder. I don't really get opportunities to ask girls out. All my close friends are guys, I don't really have any friends that are girls. My daily routine consists of going to uni, coming home, going to the gym, repeat. I don't belong to any clubs at uni. This is because I live about an hour away from uni \(public transport\) and I don't like to hang around at uni doing nothing untill the evenings, which is when all the club meetings take place., and prefer to go out to events no related to uni \(concerts, parties etc\).

In summary, I just want a girlfriend because I've come so close and the feeling of actually finding someone you are attracted to and genuinely like as a person is so great. I'm not exactly a teenager anymore, and my lack of dating experience is getting me down.  I don't want to be alone forever, but it honestly feels like I will be.

\*\*Lack of motivation for college/Loneliness:\*\*

I think this issue stems from the lack of love in my life, as well as being lonely at uni. Basically all my college friends have graduated as they did single degrees, so I don't really have any good uni friends who I see on a daily basis.  I have a few mates still at uni and try to see them as often as I can, but its maybe once a week at best, and they're only in a few of my classes.

I pretty much go to all my classes by myself. I don't really enjoy college anymore and dread going some days. I've got 2 years left so obviously I am not going to drop out and waste all the money I've spent. I am considering taking a semester off next year as it will be the first time I will be able to, as my papers will be all electives \(not compulsory core papers\).

I have to finish this year, and I really lack motivation. I find it hard to concentrate in class as the content is so boring. I don't study nearly as hard as I used to and my grades are starting to slip. I've used ritalin as a study aid which helps my focus dramatically, but I don't want to rely on it all year round.

I know these aren't exactly major issues and people are a lot worse off than I am, but it's really getting me down. Any advice would be great.",23Apr2018,3

37,"Some background: I'm a college aged guy who has never had a girlfriend or real relationship. Never had sex and don't have too many girls as friends. I am pretty socially inhibited and introverted. I don't do well in communicating with others emotionally, and my neurotic dominant personality tends to push people away. I get depressed and anxious a lot and fear being intimate or close with others. 

About two months ago I met a girl online. The circumstances under which we met I won't really go into, but we started casually talking, mostly when I was high, and I made her laugh a lot. It was fun, and I enjoyed making someone smile. I only know her over the internet, though we text now and she had tried to facetime me a few times (though I never picked up due to timing). She has told me that she cares immensely about me, saying ""I love you"" and other things like that, something I'm not used to. 

Eventually, my facade as the fun loving drunk faded and the emotionally wounded animal that I am emerged, and a lot of our time was me going from emotional highs (from my ADHD meds) to lows (from the crash). I constantly would doubt and question why she cares about me as part of an effort to push her away. My emotional immune system wants this because if I get her to leave now, it would hurt a lot less than her leaving after we get really close. 

She encouraged seeing the ""real"" me, and told me she cared too much about me to never leave me. We don't talk a whole lot but we almost always talk daily. She tells me on days when I ignored her for longer periods that she missed me or would wonder why I was ""leaving"" by not talking to her. She's a pretty accomplished person. Smart, accomplished athlete, lots of real life friends. I never got why she wants to be close to a neurotic asshole like me, but she says she is a caring person, overlooking the few times I really hurt her. 

We used to get really intimate (in more ways than just emotions) in our conversations. That changed about three weeks ago. She would constantly dodge or be reluctant to talk about things like we used to, either ignoring me until tomorrow or just directing to a different topic. Well I come to find out she apparently has a boyfriend, who is the only other guy besides me she still talks to from Reddit. 

As someone who has been rejected my life by most girls this was crushing to me, and left a very sour taste in my mouth. I don't blame her for following her heart, but it is very hard for me to accept closeness and intimacy from someone in a non-sexual way. She's the first girl to show me such emotions, and I really thought I could get something out of it. No only was I once again not good enough, but I lost the only other person I competed with. Yes it isn't a competition per se but that's how my mind sees it. Once again I wasn't good enough. 

She tells me that I will find that affection elsewhere, that I will find a girl to love me for who I am (which I've always been told and so far has never come true). I would be less bothered if there wasn't another guy, but the fact that there is hurts much worse. Yet I still talk to her, constantly saying I will leave or something but never do. I'm pretty socially isolated, and having a person who cares about me like she does talk to me everyday is refreshing from the norm. 

I like this friendship, but I cannot resolve me feelings for her. I resent that her heart belongs to someone else and I'm expected to be intimate with her without the true intimacy I want. I concede that intimacy can exist without sex, my mind is simply incapable of seeing it. 

What should I do? I really want to leave, but it would hurt her. She said its better if I'm happy, but she also says she loves me like a brother. I don't know what to do. Can someone untwist this puzzle my warped mind has created? ",23Apr2018,2
39,"I need help choosing between two jobs which I’m conflicted on. 
I was hired a month ago to mow grass at a mill. Although I ended up at the maintenance area for the fleet vehicles. It’s been interesting learning about fixing the vehicles and heavy equipment but the pay isn’t very good. That and the management doesn’t seem very good and everyone else is job hunting. I’m also concerned I could actually end up mowing like I was supposed to.
Enter boring paperwork job which involves waiting around in the sun for drivers to show up and fill out their paperwork and send them on their way. I’m not very good at the waiting bits but maybe I could learn to keep myself busy. The whole job is around not messing up paperwork and being a warm body waiting. The biggest downside is it’s salary and the hours can fluctuate up and down depending on the amount of drivers. Also the waiting is done outside in the heat and if I need anything I gotta run somewhere.  
Both bring benefits and pay is pretty well the same. I’m just conflicted cause the first option is interesting and I don’t hate it but it seems a few say I should leave. I’m just not good at keeping myself busy and there’s nothing to learn at the boring job unless I do it on my own on the side while waiting. I’m hoping someone can help point me in the right direction. I can give more details if I didn’t give enough. Thank you.",23Apr2018,2
41,"Hey everyone. Kind of a strange question.

I'm a 21 y/o female. Growing up, I always had what would be considered ""basic"" interests. I liked cheesy quotes, cutesy photos, trendy clothing, and spending a lot of time with my friends. Throughout high school I continued to indulge in these interests. I was relatively popular \(I guess\) but got bullied pretty harshly by the theatre company where I spent a lot of my time. Girls were really mean to me and called me a slut and stupid behind my back for the last few years of school because of my basic interests compared to the other people in the theatre group. I know many people would say to just shake it off and ignore it, but I'm pretty sensitive and have a hard time with confrontation. This really fucked with my self esteem.

As a result of this, I began feeling really insecure about my personality. Though I'd always had straight A's and high ambitions, I began feeling as though I was stupid and shallow for liking the things I liked. Suddenly everything in my life felt pointless and my underlying depression became much worse. I started trying to show my intelligence outwardly more, through my choice in clothing and social media presentations. I know it sounds silly, but I'm shy so it was the only way I could think to really give off a better first impression.

Since this change, I've found myself feeling like I'm just sort of floating in space without any security. I feel like my personality is just kind of flipping around based on who I'm talking to or what day of the week it is. I don't feel like any of my former interests are ""worthy"" of time, and any time I divulge in my old interests, I feel guilty and embarrassed. I know I only have a short time to live so I struggle with the idea of wasting that time on stupid stuff that doesn't matter, but it feels like I'm fucking up my happiness as a result.

I'm wondering what you guys think of this and what your advice would be in regards to it. I am afraid of going back to those old interests and having people think I'm stupid and shallow again, but I'm also afraid of continuing to feel like I have no personality or like I'm someone I'm not. I want to enjoy my life and who I am without having to feel ashamed. I know this is mostly an internal battle, but I'm just not sure what the right move is.

**tl;dr** Got bullied in school for having ""basic"" interests and people assuming that meant I was shallow and stupid. Started avoiding my old basic interests. Now I feel lonely and depressed, like I have no real personality.",23Apr2018,2
42,"Okay this is likely going to be a wall of text and I apologize in advance. Also, mobile so formatting and auto correct may kick my ass.

I'm currently 29 weeks 5 days pregnant. This is my first baby. 

SO and I have talked in the past about getting a renter, because who doesn't like help with their mortgage. The topic hasn't been brought up in quite some time, mainly because I had shut it down as I didn't want to have a stranger moving into our house with a baby on the way. (DUH) Recently, one of SOs friends has been having relationship issues and mentioned possibly needing to find a new place to live. We talked about having him live here, but not in depth as we weren't really sure IF it would actually happen. 

Today SO told me his friend and friends SO were indeed splitting up. So we had a more serious talk about it. I mentioned that I'm not honestly entirely comfortable with it for multiple reasons:

1. I still don't know this friend very well. So basically still having a stranger move into our home where I'm concerned. Although, I haven't had issues with him as of yet, and without the other points I would be more than willing to give him a chance. 

2. We are currently in the process of having a roof replacement (still in the scheduling/planning stage) and repairing the internal damage cause from our faulty/leaky roof. This means we will have to give up our bedroom at some point as that is where the main damages are. If friend is living in the spare room, where the hell are we supposed to sleep? SOs response is ""at my parents."" I'm sorry but the thought of having to leave my home during construction to make sure a friend is happy, when our current situation allows us to just move down the hall is absurd to me. SO says ""its just a sacrifice we will have to make."" (We don't HAVE to because we don't have to let him move in!!!!) 

3. I have family coming to town from 10 hours away in approximately 2.5 weeks for my sister's college grad. They are meant to be staying at our house. We were already worried about where everyone would sleep (3 people coming...one spare bed) plus I am already stressing over what we will do if this period falls during us losing use of our bedroom and now you want to add another person the mix?! PLUS these same 3 people are meant to be coming again in July when baby is born. 

4. I am literally going to have a baby sometime in the next 10 to 12 weeks. This is going to be a big enough and hard enough transition without having to adjust to having someone else living in our house. I have heard non stop (from people who I'm sure mean well but really are just scaring the crap out of me) that being a first time mom and adjusting to that new life is going to be HARD. I don't doubt it for a second. I'll be sore and emotional and exhausted and probably a lot of other things I'm not even prepared for! Not to mention I intend to breast feed, but would be incredibly uncomfortable doing so in front of someone I don't know that well, and really don't want to be forced to hide away in my own home anytime LO needs to eat. 

Every single concern I have has been brushed off with the explanation that ""we have to make sacrifices in life and we're supposed to help our friends out when they need it."" Which I mean, yeah. I don't disagree entirely, but why do we (mainly I) have to suffer to do that?? He just doesn't see it from where I'm standing apparently. And every time I try to explain myself, I get frustrated cause he just doesn't get it, and then I become a hot mess because hormones and I can't make head or tail of what I'm trying to get across. 

SO I guess what I'm asking is, how can I get my points across in a clear manner that he will (hopefully) understand? ",23Apr2018,2

She was not a close friend, but she was from the social circle I’m usually in. She was the protagonist of a school musical and she bought a headband that gave her bangs so that she could act as the character. I needed also fake bangs for a school thing 1 year ago, and she handed me hers. I never really returned it because I forgot and she didn’t ask me, as she said that it wasn’t really important. She was really young (she had just turned 20 years old), and that musical was really important to her. I wanted to give the headband to her family on the funeral, so that they could have something of that precious moment and that was hers, but I don’t know the family personally and maybe it could be seen as out of place or disrespectful. I don’t know what to do, because maybe they want it or maybe they don’t really care. It’s just that the bangs were symbolic for the character of that musical.

45,"This is the weirdest thing ever. 

So I am so embarrassed to admit this... but I have this insane infatuation with a celebrity - when I first saw him I knew in my head that I had a special ""love at first sight"" connection or like a ""we were meant to be"" moment that I've never had with anyone before. 

I have NEVER felt this way about any celeb. While I think there are definitely a few hot ones who I would definitely sleep with given the chance, this one is different and feels like a crazy cosmic/weird/""meant to be"" thing that is freaking me out. 

The worst part is... he's not someone who is physically out of my league at all... and I am also his ""type"" lol. I am pretty confident in my own attractiveness. So there presents the very real ""what if"" scenario in my head but I also know it's crazy.

49,"I don't know if this is the right place to put this, sorry. I'm 13 years old. I have a 3 year old brother and a dog. I know this is petty, but it's fucking annoying. My mom also leaves to go to the bathroom for 3 hours at least four times a day. If I sit in the living room for any amount of time, she'll run to tha bathroom, so I have to sit with them (they can't be alone of course.) This happens at least 3 times a day, and it makes me really sad. When she's gone for like 20 minutes is when I start to feel fucking stupid, and it makes me mad at myself that I fall for it every time. The past few weeks I've spent all my time at home in my room for fear of that fucking dog and my mothers deception. Sorry if I sound stupid.

50,"When I was six years old I had two cousins that used to come to visit over the summer. They were 12 and 13. One summer, the elder of the two began telling me to kiss him, it was never “do you want a kiss?” Or “Hey can I kiss you?” It was always “give me a kiss girl” something along those lines. He was my older cousin, family so I thought I should listen to him, I still remember how chapped his lips were and how gross it felt, I hated it. He did it a lot, one time he pulled me under this dark little blanket fort that we had made and asked again, I said no but he kept insisting and insisting until I gave in, his hands wandered. Never to my private areas or anything but it still just felt so wrong. I didn't even remember that this had happened until I turned 17, and I was horrified. I don't know why but now at 19 it still continues to affect me. Is it really that bad? I have only told my current boyfriend, and he thinks its awful, but is it? It was just kissing and a little touching, right? So many people have been through so much worst, why is this affecting me so much?",23Apr2018,2

-He promises to take me places (his family’s beach house and Hawaii)
-He rarely use emoji,sometimes he gave me one word response.
-We have 9 years age gap,when i ask him if i was too young for him,he said he don’t mind.
-He barely disclose anything about him,i know he is legit and real person but he never really answer when i ask him question about himself.
-He asked me to stop talking to other guys (i told him i’m casually seeing someone and he said he will not approve that)
-He asked for nudes,but when i asked back he said he only send dick pic to serious girlfriend.But he assures me that my nudes are safe with him
-I told him i was sick and asked him if he still wants to hangout?He said he doesn’t care if i’m sick (most people dont wanna be near sick people)
-He told me that “sex” is not all he cares about.And he is really trying to meet someone.

She was a member of some of the nerdier activities on campus like DnD and MTG. This means that she was friends with quite a few neckbeards. As we began to see each other more consistently she let it slip that I am Polyamorous. While I generally don't hide this I'm don't broadcast it to the world.

One of the neckbeards Bryan began confronting me every chance got. He would get in my face telling me that stacy should be with him and that it's not fair that I have multiple women and he has none. 

At first I tried to ignore this and would just walk away when he would try and talk to me or tell him to go f himself. However, I began to find notes on my car and that Bryan had started rumors that I had brainwashed stacy into being with me. He then went to tell everyone that I am party of some religious cult even though most people know i am an agnostic.

This behavior seems to keep escalating. I am unsure of what to do. I don't want to involve the university as I worry this could be blasted across the campus. I am also worried about Stacy as she has felt some of the negative affects of this.

I sit here now as a junior in high school and everything is going down the shitter.

Honestly the grade thing is whatever but I just need advice on what I can do to try and keep some motivation to finish this year off.

58,"I don't know whether to post here or in /r/privinv .  

I'm going to be working for an academic institution soon, coming from a dubious company (that came out of a project from that institution) that I've been trying to exit (I have ""trust issues"" due to my experiences there).  I have met my soon to be coworkers and PI's.  Most of them seem like honest, good people but there's 1 guy I'm having second thoughts about because he reminds me a bit too much about people at my soon-to-be-ex company.  Keep in mind at this time the company I work for has no idea I'm about to quit so I am still affiliated with them.  

This coworker has told me that the company I currently work for has a bad reputation in the department (I asked for specifics and he would not tell me, even after I said I'm not going to the company because I want out), and that the fact I haven't quit immediately could raise a red flag and stop the entire hiring process (which is true since I made the mistake(?) of disclosing the results of my internet searches on people associated with the company showing documented proof of past irresponsibility).  He's normally very open with me and still seems to trust me at least to help out with projects on my days off.  I will be working on some of those same projects as soon as my paperwork finishes processing.  On the other hand, I've heard this potential coworker making apparently overblown statements and exaggerations (which are not illegal in themselves but certainly questionable) related to his personal life, and he's affiliated with a lab whose PI does not seem to like the PI which made the company I work for so it might be all political.  

Would it be a good idea to ask around the department about peoples' experiences working with him?  If so how should I approach that?  I'm a very straight-talking person (if I say something you can take it literally because it will be true) but it seems like people in that department are not used to literal straight talk.

Hello:

I am a male Sophomore in High School. I had my first somewhat serious relationship with a Freshman girl late last year prior to Christmas. We had been friends since the beginning of the year and were noticeably flirty. I confessed my feelings to her before Thanksgiving break, and I got a response a few days later that she felt the same way. Nothing extreme happened, we just went to homecoming and on a few dates. We generally had a good time, as neither of us had really dated before.

Before Christmas, we went on a great date, spent time together, and seemed generally like a happy couple. I gave her a gift, and she told me mine would come after Christmas due to the holiday shipping congestion. We said our good-byes and both seemed sad to part, as she was going home to another country since we go to a boarding school. The only issue that I saw in our relationship at the time was a lack of completely clear communication. She is quiet by nature, and I am very passionate by nature, meaning that I was always the one driving conversations, initiating dates, and being the first to buy gifts. She was never particularly expressive, generally using a sheepish smile or a sweet text message to show appreciation. Silence could sometimes be awkward, because she was generally too shy to randomly bring up a topic without some kind of prompt.

We went away, initially communicating pretty well. Once she arrived home, I wanted to give her enough space to spend time with her family. I would text her about once a day to see how she was doing and tell her about my break. She was pretty short with her messages, which could be a tad frustrating, but I understood. I made one kind of asinine passive aggressive comment after I tried to ask her about her hometown and got a kind of abrasive response, and I felt bad afterwards.

Skip to the end of break and we had just returned. I was delighted to get to see her, and I immediately wanted to have lunch with her. I sent her a text about it, but she was not especially responsive. I expressed my feelings to her, and she told me maybe we could have lunch another day. I understood that she probably wanted to see her friends, so I moved on. I later asked by text if she wanted to walk around that afternoon to talk and catch up. She made another excuse, and I, (being the annoying moron that cannot read signs), was pretty rude to her. I asked her why she was even dating me if she did not want to see me after being gone for a few weeks. She was obviously annoyed that I would ask that and told me she wanted some time to think. I obliged, and at that moment I knew I would have to end the relationship soon since I was clearly overwhelming her. I went home that night to begin my pile of work and got the pleasure of a snapchat message at 10 or 11 PM on a Monday night saying ""Hi, I am sorry, but I don't want to do this anymore."" Surprisingly, I responded like an adult and told her that I wished her well and hoped we could still have a strong friendship like we did prior to our relationship. She said she hoped so too, and I immediately deleted that Snapchat, (I had made it for her), and cut my ties with her.

Seeing her at school after that became reasonably awkward. We would wave to each other and exchange greetings, and I expected that we would become friends again in a small amount of time. We even exchanged friendly messages through a friend of hers one time when they were together, so I was optimistic. However, it suddenly began to go downhill. She started to look away whenever we would pass, her friends that became my friends while we dated stopped talking to me and acted extremely weird, and I got a bad feeling. It's been like that since February or so, and I see her every single day because our school community is quite small. I hate this and wish I could just go back to being her friend. I don't know what to do to fix it, and I feel like the rift gets bigger with each day. I have lost multiple friends that I met through her, but one of our mutual friends that I met first stayed friendly. I talked with her and learned that the reason that I was dumped was that my girlfriend just realized she did not have the same feelings. I understand this, and I just would like to be friends at this point. I do not know what to do that does not make me look like a lonely loser or something. Any suggestions?",23Apr2018,3

65,"Ok, so I’m a 15 year old male. My two biggest loves are drama and rock. I’ve been totally “obssesed” with both for 2-3 years. I’m in drama class at school and I participate in all the shows. I love Queen, Metallica, Nirvana, and more bands and I can name all sorts of trivia. 

Well, my parents are very strict, Christian, and conservative. I’m a Christian too, but not nearly as strict, and politically I’m independent. Well, they believe that drama is going to “corrupt” me. Also, my step mom (who’s waaayyyy more strict) has a personal vendetta against my music, thinking it promotes drugs and sin. 

Well, to fix the music part, I sent her a long list of interpretations of all my favorites songs lyrics a few months ago. She’s yet to read it. I sent her it again. Still hasn’t read it. She refuses to, and says I cant listen to rock until she does (I still do). She also threw away all the band shirts that my mom and grandparents got me.

My dad loves rock too, just not as openly or avidly. However, tonight my stepmom said that he agrees with her, and seemed apprehensive when I asked to speak to him personally, saying he’s “busy” when I know good and well he’s sitting in the living room, maybe working, but he’s almost never pushed me away before.

To clarify, I’m a very smart student, just a bit lazy sometimes. I am still making all A’s and am going to dual enroll next year a technical school. Well, I had my first zero of the year, and it was on a homework assignment that didn’t even hurt my grade. My stepmom and Dad blamed drama (my stepmom also blamed my music) and threatened to take away drama next time I get a bad grade. I have to go 4 YEARS without making a single bad grade!

I am crying myself to sleep tonight (which I’ve NEVER done). I don’t know what to do. Can you please give some advice?

Edit: She came upstairs and gave me a compromise- I divide my music time to half Christian and half secular. She apologized and we talked it out a bit more. She promised to read the list tomorrow, and I promised to take baby steps to improve my life spiritually.",23Apr2018,2
66,"My parents had a messy divorce 15 years ago. Long story short, my dad kept fighting losing battles with my mom in court, and the resulting legal bills, along with his own poor financial decisions, have put him in debt.

Now, I live in a different country and I'm getting married in August. My dad messaged me last month to say he couldn't afford to come because of his legal debts. I replied offering to pay his way. The total cost of flights and hotels for him and his new wife would probably only be around 1000USD, which I could easily afford.

However, he has not replied. I'm guessing there's a combination of three factors why he doesn't want to come:

1. He has too much pride to accept money from his son.
2. He doesn't want to run into my mom at the wedding.
3. He has a persecution complex, and not attending will allow him to say ""my ex-wife screwed me over so much, I wasn't even able to attend my own son's wedding!""

I do want my dad to come. On the other hand, it would be easier if he didn't come, as I wouldn't have to deal with the stress of bringing my mom and dad together after 15 years of fighting by proxy. (As far as I know they haven't even been in the same room for 15 years.) They are usually very calm people, but I fear the reunion would lead to some pretty complicated emotions...even if there isn't a direct confrontation, the atmosphere will be pretty damn awkward.

I’m a 20 year old female and there’s this guy I know through a friend who just turned 32. I’ve known him for about a year now and always had a feeling that he had a little crush on me, but I thought he just thought I was pretty and was just a nice person (I still think he’s a great guy), nothing serious. HOWEVER, I was at my friend’s party last night and he was there. We were all dressed up and we eventually started talking just by ourselves for about an hour. He started casually telling me about how he’s single after breaking up with a long term girlfriend a while ago (about a year and a half) and he wanted to start dating again.. I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT because he was talking about his life in general...THENNN he starts flirting REALLY hard  by telling me I look nice and he thinks I’m a great person blah blah blah but then I’m like no way he’s flirting right now you’re just imagining things lol UNTIL someone comes over telling him he looks great and jokingly asked him if he was trying to find a gf....AND HE JOKINGLY POINTS AT ME!!!!! There are a couple other instances too so if you want info you can let me know lol so at this point I’m a tiny bit uncomfortable because I’m just an awkward person overall lol and even though guys have flirted with me in the past, I’ve never had a bf because I never wanted one, although now I’m more open to the idea (before I met him). 

Ok so this is the problem!!! HES 32!!! And I’m 20!!!! He has an entire career and house while I’m a COLLEGE SOPHOMORE LIVING WITH MY PARENTS!!! he’s a greeeeeaaaat guy seriously if he was like 25 I’d be HAPPYYYY to give him a chance because he’s so sweet and really nice to hang around with because he’s so funny and stuff. My question is, am I being dramatic in thinking 30 is too old, or is he being weird for crushing on a 20 year old? 

Sorry this is long and thanks in advance!
Also just to give a little background, I REALLYYYYYYY don’t think he’s the type to just be looking for a hook up type thing, he’s genuinely a great person. I think he has a real crush on me because he gets nervous when I come around and he’s not simply telling me he thinks I’m pretty (like most guys do), he’s complimenting me as a person, which I really appreciate. Also when we met I was 19 and he knew that, so I kinda feel like he might’ve been waiting for me to get out the teenage stage lol because he started slowly becoming a little more flirtatious a little while ago.",23Apr2018,1

Week 1- work undesired scduele and go on the online schedule to request to change availability on weekends to only mourning. (Which like I said manager didn’t need me then). This request gets approved by hr
Week 2 - made scduele outside my availability. That’s why I asked to work less

Anyway I feel like I sort of really pissed her because she told me she doesn’t need me mournings and I continued to change my weekends availability to mournings. And on top of that, when I worked the 8 hour, I kinda of worked slowly because I didn’t want to get tired fast. Anyway she noticed but didn’t tell me to pick it up. She sort of bitched about to herself and told the other guy who works with me(cool dude, been there a while and he nice to me). I feel like he should be the manager honestly. He has better work ethic and most importantly people skills! He kindly told me “hey, if u r working at about speed of 3, I need u at a 6”.  ",23Apr2018,1
81,I've known this girl and we're pretty close. At one point we were casually dating then stopped  because she just lost feeling. While it doesn't bother me to the point of heartbreak or sadness. There are just moments in the day when I get to recollect my thoughts my mind wander to her and ask those what if questions. The break up was a year back and our relationship barely lasted a couple of months. How do I stop thinking about her because every time I do it leads to me putting myself down and I want to stop that attitude before it can cause some real harm. ,23Apr2018,1

87,Religion is a personal thing I know but I don’t know what to do. So I used to go to church up until the second grade when my grandma got sick so I was about 7/8 and we stopped going because my mother took care of her full time until she passed. My father was apart of the Nation of Islam (he has also passed) so I grew up around religion and every one in my family is religious. Ive labeled myself as Christian then I called myself a non believer (atheist is too harsh) then I was sort of in the middle of believing and not believing in god / jesus. I am now looking into Buddhism because that’s the religion that I mostly gravitate to and I don’t want to just live my life as a non believer or someone who doesn’t have a religion because I feel sort of a void there even though Buddhist do not believe in a god but they follow practices. But since I grew up around religious people and went to church and was taught that jesus and god are almighty I sort of feel confused now because although that was what I was taught I don’t necessarily believe that and want to disconnect myself from that religion and go on my own path but at the same time I feel like I’m betraying everything I have ever known up until now and I don’t know how to let this go. And I know just because I’m looking into Buddhism doesn’t mean I have to become one I understand that it may not work out maybe I can just incorporate some of the teachings into my life I’m not really sure but I just want to disconnect from Christianity without feeling guilt or betrayal. As a child you don’t really understand what religion is and having being raised Christian and then not going to church for so long has caused me a great deal of confusion,23Apr2018,4

89,"I'm 21 and am a full time student \(though I also have a part time job\). I'm in my third year of university but first/second for my current course, which is a co\-major of neuroscience and biomedical science. I did business and psychology first but lost interest in it and changed to this, but yet again my interest has waned, in parallel with my deteriorating grades. I enjoyed the classes and was engaged for the first month or so, but i'm 8 weeks in now and am on the verge of having an emotional breakdown. I'm so overwhelmed by not so much the amount of work but the difficulty of it. Even when I study for hours and try as best I can to understand concepts I either do very poorly or barely passably. My worst class is chemistry by far \(which I've never studied before\).

Every week I feel dread whenever I have certain classes \(mostly chemistry and biology\) and wish desperately I didn't have to do them. I force myself to attend them, but I usually do poorly in them. It's gotten to a point where I'm starting to skip some classes \(not labs though\), and those I do attend I can't focus in because I feel physically uneasy and agitated. I feel absolutely no pleasure or happiness in anything in my life now, since my poor performance in my classes depressed me, and because my fear of failing the course is so great. I also have to work on the weekend and any days I have off, so I'm usually completely physically exhausted as well \- for example I worked 26 hours on the weekend and still had to get up at 6am this morning. I was so tired I slept through the alarm and missed my first class.

I don't think I can do this anymore. I'm barely halfway through the first semester of one of my majors \(the other I've dome since the beginning of last year and I like it more\) and I'm already doing so badly. It's affecting my overall personal life as well, in terms of my mental and emotional wellbeing. The only things stopping me from dropping out right now are my concerns of not being able to find a good job without any complete university degree, and my parents' disappointment in me; they've supported every course I've done and whenever I changed, and always encouraged me and wanted me to do my best, and they were so proud of me doing university since nobody else in our family has ever done it. It's my reluctance to disappoint them that stops me from dropping out. I've been at university for over two years now, and if I just suddenly dropped out permanently they'd be horrified at what a waste of time and future debt it would be.

Would it be a bad decision in the long run to drop out, either now or at the end of this semester? I make pretty good money with the job I do, so financially I wouldn't have a problem, it's more an issue of long\-term prospects.

Sorry for how long this post is. I needed to vent it all out.",23Apr2018,1
92,"Context. Me and N have been friends for over 2 years. We meet on an MMO (GW2) me and my longtime GF play together. Since he is an charismatic guy our friendship has grown closer over time, which is a feat since I'm a pretty closed off person. We mostly talk on discord every few days or so. We used to play GW2 together but he stopped because he got addicted. I can play with moderation so I kept on going and we switched to just straight up chatting with no game as a mediator.

Things were going really great for a while. Over the winter my gf's dad died and I reached out to him on the first day. He said all the nice stuff like I will be here if you need me and bla bla bla. Then me and my GF had to go down to the states (we are Canadian) to help sort dead dad's stuff. N happens to live a hour or so away so we ask him to come down and meet us. I think he agreed at first or at least didn't shoot me down. Eventually when I pushed him about making concrete plans later he said no because of money reasons. I was miffed but let it slide since it happened right after xmas so its understandable (gf's died days before xmas. it sucked) Im bringing this up because looking back I think it was a red flag. Which is odd since we did meet in person once before, the three of us for half a day last year. It was fun we ran around Seattle doing touristy stuff. 

Anyways fast forward a few months. N is an arty guy, makes music and we talk about movies/books/psychology stuff a lot now that he isnt playing GW2. He talks about how productive he is, coming home after work to study music on his own time etc. I am also an arty person but I write fiction. Finally I finish a chapter I'm proud enough to show to people outside of my gf. At first N is really supportive. When I mention to him that I wrote a thing he jumps right in and asks to read it. He does, printing it out double space so he can write comments and everything. I am blown away, I was just assuming I'd get a ""I like it but its not my genera"" but he is going above and beyond duty. He talks about how his brothers picked on him for not giving back good feedback so now I'm excited and my expectations are raised.

It takes him a while to get through it but eventually he does and we talk about it somewhat. Honestly I don't really remember much of what he said about it. Which is why ahead of time I asked him to write his emotional reactions when he had them. (ex: this paragraph made me sad, etc) I have a different friend do this too and it turns out great. She even goes further and writes down memories things I write trigger and other fun insightful stuff. It is wonderful, exactly what I wanted. N on the other hand.....

Time passes and I'm done chapter 2. I still haven't got my written feedback for chapter 1. I push him little but I'm not mad. He said he did it by hand so it will take a while to transcribe on the comp. Since he is doing this out of the goodness of his heart, I wait. I finish chapter 3 and send it off. Still no feedback from 1, it has been like two months. 

Then I start talking about taking a birthday trip in May down to the states. We have family right across the line and consider stopping by N's first since I get laid off May 5th (long story...) and he doesnt work weekends. I start sending him messages on discord about travel plans. Is this time good for you, etc. No response. A week goes by, I start planning the trip with a different friend but we will have to go to Seattle to pick her up. I send N another message saying how I cancelled the part where we visit where he lives but if he is interesting in meeting up in Seattle. No response. 

I send him a silly prying text message to test the waters. He says his phone broke which even if true makes no sense. I know he has discord on his home computer but I let it drop and send him something silly back. No response. 

At this point its like almost two weeks of no contact other than the one probably lying text message. I get upset. I considered him to be a really good friend and was showing him my art (which is a scary thing to do) and all of a sudden he is ghosting out on me. I have no idea what to think and it's really upsetting. I cry about it and send him a somewhat confrontational text about it the next day when I have calmed down (Ghosting isn't cool, or something like that) He finally responses saying he is sorry about ghosting but also says he just needs ""lots of space"" 

I am now very confused. I accept the apology but still don't feel comforted. I have no idea if whatever he is upset about has something to do with me or not. The ambiguity makes my mind spin frantically searching for clues and coming up with theories whenever I feel physically shitty and thus emotionally compromised. But at the end of the day these theories don't really matter because I have no idea what is going on. I can't read his mind.

I try reaching out one more time. I finish chapter 4 in record time, less then a week (my store is closing so I have nothing to do but write all day) I decide to email it to him to test his boundaries. Also to be honest, I feel hurt by him suddenly disappearing on me so soon after sharing my art with him after I was nothing but support of his art for years. If his need for space has anything to do with me or my art I want him seeing it to hurt him because he has hurt me. For the email I stick with being humours and lighthearted because I have no idea how he is going to respond to this. Also since I am hurt I am in defence mode and deflecting with humour is one of my coping strategies. 

I get one line back. Something about how I just need to wait. That is it.

My first response is disgust that he would send me a cliche. But mostly I feel disrespected. If he had started clear boundaries before hand that would be one thing but he didn't. I have been fighting for every word I have gotten from him. Most of it has been vague. I'm pushing him because I want more clarification. I'm pushing him because I care about him. Im pushing him because it worked one time maybe it will again. But this email pops my bubble. It's not even that douche of a thing to say but I would have preferred him being mad at me. Being told to wait makes me feel like I'm a dog too stupid to know any better. I guess I could have made my hurt feelings with him more clear, but he is the one who pulled the disappearing act not me. Why do I have to write everything perfect to get anything out of him?

Its been like....two weeks since then. I'm not counting days. I mostly don't think about him but when I do it's hard to stop. You try thinking about something you don't want to think about, it is really hard. 

Mostly I just feel tired. He has disappointed me so thoroughly that I have very little faith that even if he does try to come back to me that he will continue to be inconsiderate to my feelings. I could lower my expectations so he could meet them but that would be so low that it feels disrespectful to both of us. I showed him my art and like a month later he vanishes. If he can't connect the dots to figure out that that would upset me, I don't know what to do with him.

There is always the flip side that he is being vague to be nice to me but that feels like a cop out. Kind of like people trying to justify ghosting as better than rejection. For me ambiguity is way worse. If I get an answer even if I don't like it at least I can process the feeling and move on. But with this issue I am stuck.

Is he going to come back? Why is he upset? Why is he treating me so shitty in the process? Do I really want a friend that makes me feel disrespected?  Why didn't I notice his pattern of over promising and under delivering earlier? (There are more examples)

Sadly, this is all still up in the air. He could come back any day now with some big flowery apology but my instincts are telling me not to accept it and that it is time to let go. I have better things to be doing with my time then giving someone my energy that only gives me a fraction in return.

So I'm here asking for....I don't really know what. Clarification? Validation? Tips on how to get through a friend break up? I feel like I have already ran this whole mess backwards and forwards so many times I barely even know where I stand anymore. I am using this as fuel though, for my art and to push me to use the friend finding website I sighed up for a year ago. That kind of feel good stuff.

Still, moving forward but it is hard. I would never expect a friendship ending would upset me so much, but I never expected it to end in the first place. Sometimes I feel like we maybe didn't know each other that well at all.

94,"This is probably something that gets asked a lot and may seem silly to some, but I’m not sure what I’m doing with my life.

I’m 23, graduating from college in a month with a degree in advertising and I’m not sure why, it’s not something I have a passion for, I just didn’t want to be undecided for longer than I had to.

I come from a wonderful upper class family with supportive parents, and I’ve run out of excuses to justify my lack of direction. There are things I’m good at, but nothing I’m passionate about. 

In all likelihood I’ll be working or interning for a marketing firm inside the next few months, and while I feel lucky the only thing I’m really looking forward to is a paycheck.

I have trouble seeing value outside of money, and I think it’s because I don’t have anything I’m truly passionate about. 

I love my family and friends, and I know to 90% of redditors this ‘problem’ seems silly because I have my whole life ahead of me, but I’d rather wake up happy on a futon in 10 Years than some swanky apartment in Manhattan (though let’s be real I probably couldn’t afford it).

Those of you who found your passion or have some insight into this problem, what steps did you take and where should I go from here? How do I find something that makes me excited to get out of bed in the morning?

Almost Boyfriend=B   
Past Fling=A

B was my first boyfriend, and our relationship lasted 7 months. Then after we ended things, I started dating G, who i also dated for 7 months. I ended thing with G because I still had feelings for B and wasn’t feeling the relationship anymore. After this, I hung out with B and A is his best friend. While we’re hanging out, A and his current girlfriend go to the same park as us and as soon as i look at them, they start bolting. Meanwhile, A is texting B that he sees us. After a while A and his girlfriend walk up to us, and A hands B a bag of quarters he for some reason left at his house. When he leaned in, he cupped his hand around Bs ear and whispered something. I later found out that he had said “sorry bro I forgot the condoms”. A and his girlfriend walk away, as As ride comes and picks them up. After they’ve left, B and I go down to the other part of the park and hang out for about an hour. A texts me on instagram saying in Spanish “do you like butt stuff” . Deciding to ignore it, I didn’t think much of it. We decided we wanted pizza so we went and got some. Everything was fine once we had gotten to the restaurant and while we were eating. Afterwards we decided to go for a walk, and ended up finding ourselves in a dark area near a street. We somehow ended up cuddling, until we saw that G had texted B saying stuff about me. A had also texted B saying to ask me how big Gs penis was, and when B said that I didn’t know, he said that I had given him a blowjob. G and A we’re texting, and keep in mind that A is supposed to be Bs best friend. He told G a secret about B and G texted B saying that he found out something about him that was gross. I decided I had enough and told G to kindly fuck off and leave both of us out of it. We decide to ignore them, and continue cuddling. A half hour later, G is starting to text me about how he isn’t going to stop talking about me and how he can do whatever he wants. I told him to get over that we didn’t work out.

I looked it up and apparently the location pinpointing is incredibly good so I have no explanation why she would be down the street beside our apartment.

103,"Hey everyone this is long so summary at the bottom,

If you take a look at my other posts, I’m a college transfer student preparing to apply for transfer later this fall. 

I’m obviously going to apply in my state of course but I’ve been thinking of applying to other locations across the United States. Such as North Carolina, Texas, Massachusetts and New York. 

Recently, I’ve been thinking of breaking away from my parents. To make a long story short, I just don’t think I can live up to their cultural expectations. A lot of people tell me I have one life and I shouldn’t waste it. Look I’m not aiming to move out for partying or something. I’m only thinking of moving out if I get into a great university with good opportunities.

I’m 20 so technically I am an adult but I just know I have no freedom whatsoever since I’m a woman. My parents say they’ll let me leave after I finish my undergraduate degree. So I’m definitely considering to stay but I don’t know. When I move out by then, they’ll still be supporting me, meaning they’ll still have a hold on me. Eventually reeling me into marriage later on.

Despite it all, I’m still applying to those colleges anyways. The thing I’m worried about is, let’s say somehow someway I get in and it’s a top tier university, they definitely will not let me leave. I live in SoCal so I’m going to apply to Berkeley as well...I discussed this with them and they said even if I do get in, I’m not allowed to leave.

It’s understandable because my cousins moved out at 18 and they did the “unhonorable” thing of getting boyfriends etc. my parents are very conservative to the point where they just judge the hell out of others and even question me for having guy friends. 

They’re scared of me getting onto the wrong path it’s completely understandable. That’s why I am definitely may avoid making this decision. However, I’ve lived in this bubble for my entire life. I’m literally scared of what my mother may do to me for renouncing my religion and just living my life guilt free. I haven’t completely renounced my religion (guilt ya know) but still I’m tired of just doing things because I’m afraid of what they may think.

The only way I’m moving out is if I get into a really great university with good opportunities. I’m not moving out for a guy or just to do irresponsible things etc. I know it’s not going to be easy and I don’t expect it to be either. I feel ungrateful honestly cause I do wholeheartedly admit I’ve had a great life they’ve been amazing to me.

 I just want a shot at life to do the best you know. To be the best! I’m applying to some reach schools so I’m not entirely banking on them but still. I’m not doing this for trivial reasons. I want to live my life. That’s all. I can’t be the model daughter anymore, constantly proving to them that I’m not a piece of shit.

TL;DR: I’m applying to out of state universities. Don’t know how to tell parents if somehow I do get into one of them and if I do, they wouldn’t let me leave no matter how good the school. Tired of living up to their expectations and I want to live for once.

104,"I know that my judgment is probably clouded on this one, to say the least. But a little over 18 months ago, my husband and I reconciled. We had been separated for a while with both of us seeing other people in the interim. 

The woman he had most recently been seeing was and is an absolute terror. I obviously can't give specifics, but has an extremely troubled past, including the fact that she gave up a child for adoption, has substance abuse issues, and is still married to her husband who was convicted of killing her mother. She in turn inherited all of her family's estate. And she tells people that her husband also killed her brother, but the prosecutor refused to go forward with the case. 

In any case, she was not happy that my husband and I reconciled. she texted him repeatedly at late hours drunk and wanted him to find her some weed. She also has pictures of her and my husband still on public view on Facebook, even though their ""relationship"" only lasted less than three months. 

As late as October she was actively stalking me on social media. I have since blocked her and am confident that husband, who is throughly disgusted by her and her behavior has not had further contact with her since our reconciliation. 

In any case, she is a practicing registered pediatric nurse, who regularly uses a plethora of street and prescription drugs. A friend of mine saw on her profile that she was talking about being high on 4/20 and has posted some videos in which she uses obscene language at work.

What I do not know how to handle is when someone wants what I have/want just because I have/want it. I have come across a couple of competitive coworkers who took me as a target, and \*I\* did not cope with it well. I find it hard to wrap my head around the notion of competitiveness. I used to interpret it as a personal attack, until later when I got used to the idea that there are people who are motivated by comparing themselves to other.

111,"So, the last four years of my life I’ve only grown to hate myself more and more. Everything about my personality and my looks. I have no confidence in myself anymore. The only exception to that is the confidence to make music (although I’m still self conscious about that too at times). I’m in band and going to rehearsal is kind of like therapy a way. It’s the only thing in my life that makes me happy enough to distract myself from all the negative thoughts in my head. Problem is that I’m graduating this year. I’m not going to college yet mainly because it seems like a lot of debt to go into when I’m still unsure of what I want to do with my life. I’m highly considering a music major but still not sure. Anyway since I’m graduating I will no longer be in band which always puts me in a very depressed mood when I think about it. I always think “I’ll just go to band and forget about it” or “at least I’ve got a few friends in band” but once summer comes I won’t be able to say that. I don’t know what I’m going to do to cope with whatever this is that I’m dealing with. I don’t know if it’s depression or what but the one thing that helps me will no longer be part of my life within the next couple of months. I would go to therapy but I don’t have the money for it unfortunately. I’m just sad and a bit scared. I used to cut myself quite often but once I joined band I’ve only done it once the past 2 years. I’m worried I might give in and go back to it if I can’t find something else that makes me just as happy. If someone could help me figure out what to do I would really really appreciate it.

126,"So I should start off by saying that I am 17 and that the person who I mention I’m dating is 18. Just to clarify a few things that come up. 

Most of my self worth problems are because of my looks... despite me being in a great relationship with a girl who tells me I’m the best thing she’s ever seen.

Every time I hear her say that; I feel like she’s *just saying that.* I hate it, and I don’t know why but it just is hard for me to believe her because of how I perceive myself. 

To clarify, I don’t tell her I don’t believe her, because that would not right. But there’s a voice in the back of my head whispering that she’s just trying to be nice and that she doesn’t want to upset me. I’ve been in the gym 3 days a week for the past 2 or so years but after seeing yesterday’s prom photos I couldn’t help but think “*She deserves someone that looks 100x better than me, these photos would’ve been better for her without me in then*”. I’ve struggled with acne the past few years and it doesn’t help that most my friends are good looking people.

I’ve found it getting more and more serious as time has gone on, I see pictures of others and just think “*Why couldnt I just have looked as good as them?*” 

As sad as it sounds I think I’ve been visiting the gym to help me with the one thing I can’t workout; my looks. How can I deal with the thoughts that tell me that I’m unsightly and to believe what my girlfriend tells me?

129,"I'm a mixed race 22yo gay male and whenever I am in a gay space I feel so conscious of the fact that I'm a person of colour that I can never 100% let my guard down, because the gay community is so white dominated, especially in Germany where I live. Weirdly enough, it's just gay spaces where I feel that way, otherwise in general society I've lived in all white spaces my entire life without feeling uncomfortable. 

Since our sexuality is what we all have in common attractiveness seems to be one of the most important things in the gay community and it even gets amplified if we're talking about hook up culture.

Whenever I'm out there I feel so painfully aware of my ethnicity because I know it lowers (as shallow as it sounds, but that's how hook up culture is) my ""market value"" and I will be considered a lot less attractive by most guys for being mixed/black. There could basically be a white clone of me and he'd be so much more sought after than me and that fact grates on me.

I can't even imagine what it would be like if I hadn't any proximity to whiteness at all being mixed since the Eurocentric beauty standard hits unambiguously black/Asian people even harder. Guys have flat out told me they'd date me because I have Caucasian features but would never date a fully black or Asian guy. Weird that they feel comfortable to basically tell me I'm desirable despite being part black and have to thank my white side for that without noticing how blatantly racist that sounds. 

Then there's the casual and subtle racism of white gays, especially the upper crust, like when they exclusively hang out with other white gays and there's no POC to be seen anywhere in their circles.

All of this makes me feel like an unwanted 2nd class member of the LGBT community in what is supposed to be a safe space where you feel like you belong.

Don't get me wrong, I don't actually ""hate"" white gays, almost all my flings have been white (because there are basically no POC in Germany, so I don't have much of a choice anway).

My brain tells me I shouldn't paint with a broad brush and generalize because rationally I know better but when faced with racial microaggressions, whether intentional or not, there is this underlying feeling that makes me so angry at white gays and even if it's just for them holding a privilege that I will never get. It's tiring and stressful and I don't want to feel that way.

At my school, they require you to take a government/economics class. It's one class, one credit. However, I opted to take the classes at the college right next to my high school (a mistake), where those two subjects are two separate classes. I finished government with a high B, which was good. And since I did so poorly in economics, I ended up with a high F, right on the cusp of a D-. Still an F though. And now I am just absolutely rife with worry that this one course that would normally count for half a credit at my highschool is going to tank me into being completely unable to graduate.

I don't know, I just need some kind of advice. Is this something I should talk to my school guidance counselor about? She's the one sets up classes and puts in grades in stuff, so the problem is that I'm not sure if she'd legitimately be able to do anything, or if she'd be allowed to mesh the grades into one since it's only one credit normally at my highschool?

133,"My mom and I don’t have the best relationship. I couldn’t tell you why, we just don’t really get along. We rarely have conversations that don’t turn into her yelling at or lecturing me, and even if we do have a “normal” conversation I’m on edge, trying to say as little as possible so she won’t yell at me or shut me down for having opinions different than hers. 

I’m generally a good kid. Not disrespectful, don’t do any typical “bad” teenager things — I never have and my mom even admits this, but the one thing that’s always been a problem with me is my grades. I will fully admit that I have been lazy when it comes to schoolwork, ever since middle school, but when it all comes down to it my year average grades have always been As and Bs, with the occasional C. 

My mom eventually got fed up with my laziness in school during my junior year of high school, and she decided to pull me from my high school and have me transferred to another one. I think this is probably when I started to get depressed. 

The time I spent at that school was awful. My grades improved but I had absolutely no friends — in fact, it seemed like everyone hated me for no reason.  I gained weight, was always tired, felt generally useless and hopeless and while I don’t think I was actively suicidal, I found myself wanting to die. Even after my mom decided to let me return to my old school, these feelings lingered. I felt like no one really cared about me and that my life was essentially an inconvenience. 

This year I started college and while I felt less depressed, I still wasn’t making the best grades. I ended my first semester with a 2.7 GPA which put me in danger of losing my scholarship. My mom was understandably upset about this, but her reaction made me feel much worse than I already felt about it. During winter break I began to fall into previous behaviors like overeating or eating too little, sleeping all day (i actually altered my sleeping schedule so i wouldn’t be awake while she was at home), not showering, etc. 

When I returned to school this semester, I felt completely unmotivated.  While my hrades last semester were likely impacted by wanting to go out and have fun a lot of the time, this definitely wasn’t the case this semester. I could barely bring myself to get out of bed in the mornings, focusing in class became increasingly difficult, no matter how much i slept (hour long naps every day) I was still tired and sluggish, and i lost all motivation to go to club meetings or go and see my friends. And like before, I find myself wishing to die. 

My grades have suffered greatly and I’m almost positive that I will lose my scholarships, but this entire semester I’ve been telling my mom that my grades are fine because i’m terrified of her reaction. Finals are coming up soon, though, and once semester grades are uploaded I won’t be able to lie to her anymore since she’ll demand to see my transcript.  So i’ve decided to tell her about how i’ve been feeling (on and off) for the past few years in the hopes that she won’t be too hard on me when it comes to my grades. 

My question is: how do i tell her this without it seeming like I’m making excuses for being lazy?

138,"I'm about to turn 15, and I am often severely depressed (there is a very good chance that I am bipolar). Suicide is a daily thought in my mind, and has been for a long time. The only thing stopping me is that I don't want to hurt my friends and family.

My main reasons for wanting this are I'm insecure about my body, personality, intelligence, and really myself as a whole. When I look in a mirror I'm often disgusted at the sight.

A few months ago I decided I was ready to end it all and researched the easiest way for me to do it without anyone having to stumble across a gruesome scene. I came to the conclusion that I would take 5 bars of Xanax and chug vodka, which I'd heard would slow my heart to the point of it stopping and me just dying.

I went out, bought the bars, grabbed the liquor, and locked myself in my room. I popped all 5 bars, and then stopped to think. Am i really ready to do this? Yes, if I'm dead I won't have to worry about the future, school, be insecure, or feel this depressed hopelessness anymore.  I texted my best friend my goodbyes, and he replied it almost immediately.

He told me how much he cared about me, how valuable I am, and how he didn't understand why I would want to do this to myself. This caught me off guard. I didn't think anyone really cared about me much nor would it matter if I was gone. After hearing that, I couldn't do it. I just cried, went to sleep and came to school the next day with the remnants of 5 bars of Xanax in my system.

Now, months later, life is becoming unbearable again and suicide seems so tempting. If not for my friend I would probably be gone already. But he is, so I have a reason to stay. So I'm asking, is there any way for me to seek help? I'm not really close to my parents but I think it would destroy them to know what I've been going through, so I've never brought up the topic.

143,"Hi there,

I am hoping to get your thoughts on my situation.

I live in a 20 unit apartment building in Los Angeles.

A year ago my downstairs neighbour started smoking cigars.  He crawls out of his window and sits on a chair in a small grassy area.  His chair is right below my bedroom window.  6-7 days a week he will smoke for between 4-6 hours (I often work from home) and the smoke enters our bedroom, bathroom and living room.  He has now started watching youtube videos.  I've sealed the bedroom window but it is not getting hot and I would like to open  my windows and enjoy the breeze.

I am trying to figure out a way to work out some kind of agreement with him.  I want to respect his right to smoke but also let him know that I don't smoke and see if we can find a resolution.  Our building has no smoking area and I've checked with the city and legally I am protected.  Truth is I don't want to get the city involved and threaten this guy.  

Our manager is an out of work actor desperate to become famous.  He has ignored all my complaints about the smoke and has told me to talk to the city.

I would like to talk to him but wanted to come here first because I want to really make sure that he knows I'm not blowing smoke (no pun intended) that I respect his rights but that it's getting overwhelming.  Some cigars that he smokes smell terrible while others smell quite good!  He seems like a gentleman and I would appreciate any tips in verbiage and approach.

We're moving out in 6 months but I'd like to live without the smell of cigar smoke while I'm taking a shower.  

A little about him...on 3 separate occasions I've observed him lecturing people to not wear shoes in the apartment above him.  He has knocked on their doors and told them this.  I find it strange that he would be so concerned about etiquette yet have no clue that his cigar smoke is entering other apartments.

I deal with it ok some days and other days I just get filled with passive agressive rage.  I want to dump a bucket of fish oil on his chair and seek petty revenge.  I can't count on my usless tool of a building manager and I can't count on the building owners.

Should I get the city involved?  Or should I just tough it out for another 6 months?

147,"i have bad anxiety about my stuff being stolen from my apartment while i'm at work. this is my first apartment and i live alone. we have a entry-way which requires a keycard to get into the building after 11pm but i go to work at 9am and get back at 5pm so for the entire time i'm away literally anyone could get into my building.

i wanted to add a deadbolt to my door originally but the property manager said i wasn't allowed to modify anything in my apartment. then i asked if i could use a door-brace that *didnt* require any apartment modifications

like this one: https://www.safetybasement.com/v/vspfiles/photos/guard-dog-standing.jpg

and he said that i couldn't because housing staff needs access to apartments at all times and that it would be in violation of my lease and i could get evicted (credit ruined blahblahblah)

i looked in my lease and it only says that they need ""reasonable"" access which i googled and most people say that if the tenant provides access after requested (with a reasonable time-frame) then it's acceptable. i tried to email him with this and he never replied

the apartment place im at is actually ""owned"" by a housing company which owns like 50 different apartments all over the country (united states). is there any chance that getting in contact with them would get any sort of resolution? right now i plan on just using a brace and not telling anyone, because i really doubt he'd evict me over that even if he did find out.",23Apr2018,1

155,"This is someone I dated for 2 years, and ended about 7-8 years ago. She broke up with me, got married, and went on with her life. About a year ago she texted me, and we caught up a bit. I was going through a breakup, and it was nice to have someone to talk to. Obviously a mistake.

One of the last messages she sent said something about getting me high and making me happy every day when we are older. I told her it made me uncomfortable since she had a husband and she flipped out, saying she’s married and would never cheat on her husband. I blocked her number and all social media.

About six months later, blank Instagram accounts started tagging me in pics of my ex and her new boyfriend. Since then, at least 6 accounts have been created and used to harass me. I block them as soon as they comment. I recently discovered one following me that isn’t harassing, but the name matched the other fake accounts. This account is posting pictures that clearly identify it belongs to that ex.

I’m worried because these fake accounts have followed a ton of my friends, several work accounts, and sent a harassing message to a business page I manage. This person also asked my best friend, who she met once, to lunch recently. It all seems very random, but like there could be something calculated to it.

I'll do my best to not be too long.

So anyway guys, I think I've fucked up.

I met this girl through friends. We all chilled and smoked. She's cool af. She told me right away she's autistic. She does not talk much at all, but is blunt and often hilarious when she does. When she asked for a ride the next day, I'm like no problem. 


Then the friends bring her around more. Eventually, I start to feel a connection.


The things I worked through as a kid into adulthood. OCD, anxiety, being on the spectrum. She's a lot like I was going into highschool. I changed a lot. Introspection, observation and imitation. MJ and LSD may have helped some, I dunno.

She says she just wants to be my friend, chill and smoke sometimes. My world is fun, new and interesting to her. A nice feature for me, her observation skills and killer memory. I get auto reminders all day without even asking.

Problems. She's understanding when I'm with my girlfriend, but usually tries to be around otherwise. My girlfriend will come hang sometimes. Although my girlfriend is totally cool with it all, she doesn't enjoy her company. 


In a way, I feel drawn to her. We understand each other like most others can't. I've made the platonic thing clear too many times, until she kinda snapped off and recited most everything I'd ever said about it. 


But now she's on her period, in pain, and all of a sudden wanting cuddles, spooning (I refused the spooning) and back massages. And honestly I fucking love comforting her. When we are alone and she comes out more, it's really cute.

There's no way I'm just hug machine 2.0 right?

Fuck.


Could it be that she's just as blunt and demanding about cuddles as she often is  about other things she really wants?


I'm an asshole. I didn't know what I was playing with. I may be wrong, but I feel she must be fragile. I'm so scared of hurting her. 

I just want to know if you guys think it's possible that with her rigidity and honesty, she could keep it in perspective? She doesn't seem to give a fuck about much. Could she just crave connection and contact from someone she trusts, or is she fragile and falling in love with me? I know it's the last one, that I'm dumb, and I'm fucked.

159,"Hi everyone, thanks in advance and sorry for the length.  I know there are a lot of variations of apology texts and I tried to find something similar to mine before posting, but I am hoping for some advice specific to my situation.  This has been weighing on me and I've been wanting to writing this apology for a while, but after thinking about it and some of the things I've read I can't tell if it would be appropriate/appreciated or if it's one of those things that just needs to move on. So a little bit of back story for the sake of context, I'm in college, and I joined a sorority a couple of years ago and for a while I was really happy in it. I decided after rush last fall I wanted a little so I signed up and eventually was matched with my little. Around the time of this process, I fell into what I guess could be called a pretty bad depression? I kind of just withdrew from life, and honestly just really couldn't force myself to even go to most of my classes, let alone social events and extra stuff. I didn't tell anyone what was going on, and I didn't acknowledge it as a problem at the time and kept making excuses to myself like, ""it's okay that you missed this one, you'll go to the next one and it'll be fine"". But of course it didn't work out that way. Right when I was getting into this funk we had big/little reveal, and I was really excited about who was matched as my little. I had a really good night that night, and our schedules didn't match up for the next couple of days so we said we'd see each other at the event we were having the upcoming weekend. But when that came up I stressed myself out so badly about going I ended up not showing up, and I'm really embarrassed to say it happened like that for the next couple of weeks. And then one night I got a text from her saying it wasn't anything against me, but she felt like I didn't have time for a little and that another girl was adopting her as theirs. I was pretty upset (not at her but at myself) and never answered it. I also haven't been involved with the sorority since then. I've spent the time from then to now trying to work on getting myself into a good place, and I feel a lot better than I did then. I've seen a couple of things from her and her close friends on social media referencing her being 'adopted' (nothing mean about me, just more in a support system type of way). So now I want to apologize to her for putting her through that and how unfair it was to her. She's really involved in the sorority and getting a big is an exciting time and I kind of ruined that for her. I don't want it to be a big thing if I apologize, and I have no intent of trying to get her back as my little or anything. I want to text her and just briefly let her know that I wasn't in the best place last year, and I should have taken that more seriously and that I know it was unfair to her and I'm sorry. I've just read things from people on here that have said they feel like the person apologizing is doing it to make themselves feel better, and I don't want this to be like that. So I guess my final question is would an apology help or should I just leave it alone? I'm happy to clarify anything if needed.",23Apr2018,1
160,"Long story short I live with 4 other people. One I dislike intensely and we have had our share of arguments. Mostly over him not cleaning up after himself and not paying his bills on time, causing our internet (house of college students, we need it) to go down 3 times in a 5-month span. 

Every thing he does from clearing his throat to leaving his dishes in the sink for days makes me angry. Two of my other roommates dislike him as well.

2 years ago I met a girl in a forum, in there I made other friends besides her, after a year and a few months I lost contact to them. A few months ago I decided to go to that forum again and I saw her online. We chatted for a while and we discovered that we were both playing Fate Grand Order, after that our talks were usually Fate involved.

Usually we only talk during weekends, normally on stuff about the game, how I like character X and how she likes character Y and so on. Yesterday, I got a character I wanted, I immediately went to tell her about it, she jokingly said the character was a thot, and from there the topic went from this to her fetishes, and to sum up about that, she is into thots and is a dominatrix. She asked if I was fine with it and I told her I was.

Today she messaged asking if I would want to hear a secret of her, I said I wouldn't mind about it. She then straight up says that she finger herself while chatting to people on the phone and she was doing this right now. I know her for over 2 years, I never saw her doing or saying something remotely close to what she was stating at the moment and what she stated yesterday, so I was caught by surprise but I still tried to act normal.

I believed at was some kind of joke/prank, maybe she wants to screenshots some of my responses for laughs and giggles. I joined her game, and before I knew it, I was in a type of roleplay where she sent me 14 lewd images of a character I like while texting me in a dirt way. I was playing this weird roleplay while waiting for her to stop and present it as just as a joke, it never came.

In this ""roleplay"", she said some weird and disgusting things that are too uncomfortable for me to say it, and to end it, I believe she wants to do more of it. What should I do? Should I talk to her about it and tell her I don't want to see that again or should I just delete my account from that forum and never come back?

173,"A little background, I work in an administrative position in higher education. I've only been working where I am now for about 6 months.

So I had a kind of crappy review at work recently. Up until now, I had liked my job. It kept me stimulated and busy. Although I admit I've been seeing some little cracks in things the last couple months with people being two-faced, saying one thing but not meaning it - which I absolutely hate. Acting like something is no problem, then bringing up the instance in a meeting in front of everyone as if the person did something wrong. 

There were a few positive things said in my review, but the negatives outweighed them, in my opinion. First of all, I'm apparently too introverted. This makes me seem closed off (?) and quiet, and my predecessor was very extroverted and would spend a lot of time chatting with faculty. To the point where she would stop by faculty offices and sit down to talk about their lives every morning and have breakfast with them. Wtf I'm friendly with everyone and chat briefly, but I've got an actual job to do. I don't work to make friends. I work because I have to pay my bills. I'm not going out of my way to waste time gossiping with people rather than doing my actual job, and spending all morning chatting. 

Then, apparently, my emails aren't long enough (??). Apparently titling the subject with the request and then saying in the body ""Please sign/approve via email and see attachment. This is a travel request for xxx, thank you."" isn't sufficient? 

Also I was mainly being judged via standards for a job that isn't even mine. The chair of the department's assistant left a month and a half ago and so I've been filling in for some of those duties (voluntarily, might I add) and was reviewed almost solely on her job and not my own. 

To put the icing on the cake, we had a medical emergency a few weeks ago with a student having a seizure; when I bent down to hand a faculty member attending to her a bag of ice, apparently my shirt caught on my cardigan and rode up a little bit. A sliver of skin at my midriff briefly was exposed. An employee reported that to the chair of the department as being ""uncomfortable"" and ""disturbing."" It's not like I even have a body that I'd ever put on display because of my fat rolls, and besides I would think this incident wasn't obviously me trying to show anything - it was an accident. I don't at all wear revealing clothing ever. I am a larger woman who usually wears over-sized polo shirts with a cardigan. 

I guess what I'm asking if I should start looking for another job. I (mostly) like my current job and make ok money. Barely enough to pay my bills, living pay check to check. Unfortunately my area is a low income place and it's hard to find a job here. I am afraid to leave my current job because it's the best I can do. But the negative reception has irritated me. I'm so negatively affected by work lately.

188,"Alright, let me give you some background.

In my country, doctors receive a lot of money. Resulting in a huge amount of people wanting to go study medicine. 

Education is free in my country, but to get in you have to take an yearly national exam. There is an amount of points you have to get accepted. Different courses require a different amount of points.

As medicine is the most desired course, the amount of points is quite high.

Anyway, I'm 18, and I took that test last year. I was alright, but not enough to get into medicine.

Now, for a while I thought I would like to study medicine simply because I was always interested in biology during middle and highschool.

Now, as I didn't get enough points to start studying medicine in the college and I wasn't too keen in wait another year to take the test again. I suggested as a option to my mother to send me to a neighboring country where education is also free so I could start my education immediately. (Besides being free there is no entrance exam, all are accepted, including foreign people.). She accepted, and here I am.

The thing is that I'm starting to have doubts if this is actually something I would like to do. But I also don't know what else I could do. I have a lot of interest in computer science. I fiddle around a lot with computers. But do I want to do that also ? Idk.

I'm thinking of trying at least for a whole year, to see If I start to gain some love for the course.

But the problem is the amount of money to keep me here. My family is not rich by any means. But the fact that they are able to keep another person in another country while also keeping themselves means that they are better than a lot of people. Everytime they call I hear about the effort they are doing to keep me here. How there is late bills and everything. They aren't starving or anything, don't worry. But this 'move' did made quite a hit in their finances. 

So for one side I don't want to give up because of the amount of money they've already spent. But if I actually made a mistake in coming here I should tell them as soon as possible so they can stop wasting money with me here.

But, you know, maybe as time goes on I'm going to start liking the course more, seeing as I already enjoyed biology in highschool. I've been here for only 4 months, there is the possibility that I'm just freaking out without reason.

But what if I don't start liking it ? Should I just bite the bullet and keep going anyway ? Because if I do finish this and become a doctor I'll be able to provide confortably to them.

Urgh, I don't know. 

Any advice ?

I (19M) started seeing somebody (19 at the time F) nearly 7 months ago. We only got to go on a few dates before they went away but the interest was there on both sides. We at least messaged every day and spoke roughly every other day, sometimes more frequently and sometimes less, but it was never obvious we were acting like more than friends, until around 3 and a half months later when I went to see her. On the third night in her company, and after a few drinks, I manned up and discovered we did want to be more than friends and enjoyed the rest of the night and the next day with this knowledge and the intimacy that comes with it.

Another 3 and a half months later and she's back but this time it's different. We've had even more interaction since I was there, we've talked everyday without fail apart from the day she travelled back here for obvious reasons but we still messaged. The 3 month period started with some continued flirting and jokes but calmed down a bit as I wanted to give her space to sort out her decisions and life. But after around only a month it seemed like she was already getting distant. I didn't want this to happen and wanted to make sure I could always understand where we were so If I got uncertain I'd have a talk with her. 

After only a month and a half apart, our next conversation sounded like this might be the end, mainly due to the separation. Despite my wants to see her again, she felt this might ruin it as it would be forced and that we'd need to be together properly. Over the next couple months I still spoke to her everyday with quite long hour chat sessions with the same if not a higher amount of a connection than the first three months of separation. 

But now that she's been back for a week and we've been out a couple times and I've tried to understand if she wants things to continue, it turns out ""We should just be friends"". 

Apparently things got too casual and so it just became the norm and she can't really see anything anymore. I have a hard time coming to terms with this as we've been having MORE of a connection than we did the first time. I should point out that I'm quite thick skinned. I don't get hints unless I'm told it IS a hint. I don't make moves without asking as to make a uncomfortable situation. And apparently this is partly led to my downfall. 
I'm not ready to give up on this person and we haven't spoken yet after our last conversation on it as it was only last night. But after all our conversations so far they always seem to both bring us apart and together at the same time and we always seem to be better for it in a way.

I'm just looking for some advice funnily enough although in all honesty I may not listen to you. I don't know what to do if I should do anything. I'm not ready to give up, I don't want anything more. This is a real shock to my system and I don't know how to handle it. I wish I could go back three months and go again.

NOTE: If you choose to leave advice, thank you. But please don't make any assumptions in your advice, if you need to ask for more info then do. Thanks again.

*edit: Just tweaked and added some things.

**edit: Right now after thinking more, my mind is in a place where I believe I need to stick with it. I need to show her what we both saw and wanted to begin with. It might sound cliche and naive but I think I want/need to keep going and get her back. Advice is still much wanted and appreciated. I could be wrong.",23Apr2018,2
194,"Since i know him i know alcohol is a part of his life. I get drunk first time in my life, when i was at him. Nad we had a time when we drunk almost every week and a lot of memories about him is that he is drinking (not getting drunk all the time, just drinking alcohol).

For a while i felt he was around me to get an excuse to drink. Sometimes harder ones, mostly few beers. Back then he sometimes bought me free alcohol just to get wasted with him, but now i refuse it. Yeah i went with it and he dragged me. He always drinks beer when we meet. He drinks beer 2 or maybe 3 days a week. So, i know about him through my own experience he is maybe an alcoholic, but likes alcohol.

He was not an antisocial but barely had friends but now i see a radical change. He is going out, posting on social media but every time when he is going out, alcohol is involved or those pictures i can find alcohol. I think he cant be alone because he wants to go out and drink. Sometimes pushing me to go out and meet but i dont really want to be more than a casual meetup friend because i dont like alcohol anymore and dont want to get involved in.

I didnt drunk since new years eve and my birthday is coming up, so i want to drink at that time ( will rolling around on the floor) im not a hypocrite. There will be a little house party next week and i want to see can i be sobre and have fun too. i was never a big drinker i dont like alcohol at all. I want to reduce this more. My social group is pretty much like him. I know a chick from this group who was tipsy every time when i met her.

What should i do? am i a bad person because i want only a little alcohol in my life?

196,"Last year I had an achievement that nothing in the near future will match. The reaction to it was a bit of a let down and made me feel like achieving things aren’t even that great because I already know what it feels like, and the feeling isn’t that amazing

Today I got the internship I wanted. I took the call, accepted it but didn’t even feel excited or tell anyone about it. I forgot about it. I haven’t even smiled about it, smiling feels weird

Whenever I got something, even something small like a random, small award at school, I used to feel so damn excited and think about it for the rest of the day and feel pride. When I got home if I was alone, I’d literally jump around while smiling to get the energy and excitement out. This wasn’t even that long ago

I feel like the only way to feel proud or excited again is if I achieve something massive and unrealistic like becoming a billionaire or famous, which could be because I’m always thinking about these unrealistic “goals”

I feel like I’m losing an enthusiastic, excited part of myself, and the motivation to achieve things and it makes me sad

200,"Me and this friend would always flirt and whenever we would go clubbing we would always nearly kiss but one of us would pull away because she a fling with my mate and didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Typical night, we're both flirting at another persons flat and drinking alcohol. I take her into the corridor and put her hands above her head so i try to kiss her and she says no and then starts dry humping me, so i think she wants it and then i try again and she says no, she's trying to leave and im holding her hands and saying woah why can't we, which obviously upset her because i'm being forceful here. I realised it upset her so i left and went back to mine, in which she came after me and came and lay down in the bed with me. Now there is a lot of sexual tension between me and this girl. We start snuggling (very very close). I'm telling her that touching down my chest turns me on and she starts doing it. We're dry humping again and then we start kissing each other on the neck and she tells me she can't kiss me on the lips as she'll develop feelings. I'm kissing her on the cheek near her mouth and she says "" oh my god, you'd be so good "". There's a joke between me and her about my fetish and the fact she doesn't know. I'm into feet by the way. So i take her socks off and she's joking about saying she knew and could always tell i was into feet, then i start sucking on her feet and she says "" why does this feel so good "" and she's smiling and giggling. Then, she pulls away and i'm rubbing her feet and i pull out my penis and start rubbing that on her foot and she doesn't move away or say stop, in fact at one point she starts rubbing her foot against my penis. Then, i tell her im about to cum and she tells me i can't and i need to stop. So i stop, we both fall asleep and wake up 5-10 mins later. I'm touching down her stomach until I get to her vagina and i start touching it outside the pants and she's clearly enjoying it and smiling and moaning, so I escalate and put my finger in and she's moaning and not pulling away or saying stop, so i start fingering her and she's clearly into it, at no point does she say stop or try and pull away or push me off. I then start giving her head and i'm inexperienced so she says "" do it like this in a circular motion, it's way better "" so i start doing it and she's moaning and enjoying her self and then i ask her if she wants to have sex but she mumbled her answer as her arm/hand is over her mouth, i assumed she said yes but i didn't take it as a definitive answer and i asked again and still no definitive answer so i didn't escalate anymore. She then tells me to stop, i immediately stop and say "" are you sure you want me to stop? "" and she says "" yes "" so i stop. 

Now, she's basically saying she was "" too drunk "" to tell me to stop and she felt panicked and felt she had to go along with it. I'm saying that she was not "" too drunk "" at all, and she was clearly into it considering she was doing stuff to tease me and saying how good one thing was and telling me how to do another thing. However, my friends are telling me that I never asked for permission/consent, so technically i sexually assaulted her, but she is not going to the police or pressing charges. I'm feeling very guilty and any advice would be appreciated.
I've seen this girl very drunk before, and looked after her, and I know for certain 100% that she was not as drunk as she's claiming. But, if she's saying she was super drunk and doesn't remember most things then I can't tell her she wasn't.",23Apr2018,1

203,"Right now, I'm in a company and working with colleagues that are of same age group as me. But in 3 weeks, I would be moving to work in another industry that is very unlikely would be working with people of the same age as me.

So with that, I'd like to make lifelong friends with my current colleagues. All of us joined at the same time period, if I may add. Since I feel it's good to have friends with the same age group as me. It's not like me and my colleagues are in bad blood as we get along swimmingly, but I feel like I'm just their ""work colleague"". Like if they go out on movies, or dinners, or excursion, they won't invite me. I'd have to ask to be included. I'm not even a part of their chat group.

So here's the thing : I want to be lifelong friends with them, or at least, friends that even after we stopped working together, we are still in contact with each other. However, they told me the reason why they don't want to ""include"" me in their main group is that sometimes I'm quite volatile. Like they say, I'm easy to anger and whine a lot, so sometimes when they're enjoying something together they don't want someone to be a debbie downer.

Obviously I'm trying to improve on it, since I really like them and want to be lifelong friends with them but I think it most likely won't happen since they view me a bit negatively.

I guess my question is: should I continue to keep trying and get them to view me more favourably within the next 3 weeks before I switch jobs in the hopes of they'll become lifelong friends with me (or at least, keep tabs with me once in a while), or should I just jump ship and hope that I'd get lifelong friends in my new work place?

212,"I'm 23 years old and last year I finally transfed to a 4 year university from community college. I got admitted into the premajor for Economics. I've realized that I only chose that major because it seemed like an easy STEM major that didn't require a bunch of prerequisites. I was just in a rush to finally transfer beacause I had been so behind and saw all my friends already graduating. The problem is I have no passion for it. I have an exam today for a class that will determine whether I get into the major and I literally have never even opened my textbook for it because I hate the class so much. I am 100% going to get a 0 on it and I don't know what to do. I have a few options and if you guys could help me that would be great.


* Option 1 is I switch to a non-STEM major such as poli sci or geography. The pros are that I would graduate on time and still be at my 4 year university. The cons are I'm again choosing a career I don't have a passion for plus I don't want to have gone through 7 years of college only to end up with a degree that I'm sure I'll regret in the future and maybe end up going back to school to get a STEM degree anyway. My parents would also be dissapointed if I chose a major I'm not interested in and that will be hard finding a decent paying career with.


* Option 2 is drop out and go back to community college and basically restart and do computer science or something math related. The pros are it's something I'm interested in plus it would be a career I'd be happy with. Cons are it would be most likely another 2 years in community college plus another 2 after transferring to another 4 year university. I'd be 28 by then. Also my parents would be very disappointed but understanding, and I can't even picture their face if I tell them. They're not in the best financial situation and so I know how much they care about me finally being done with school and getting a good career. I would also most likey have to move back home and lose all my friends I've met here at school. I care a lot about what people think of me and I can't help it. Plus, all my family and friends from back home will find out I dropped out after I come back home. Another con is that I might not know how tough computer science or math really is and I might end up in the same situation down the road where I flunk out of college.

Fast forward 1 hour the girl has arrived and we are in Jake's room full on gang banging the chick. We started out with some sort of fucked up dares and then it just went to the girl randomly sucking someones dick or giving handjobs while getting banged.

   And today I just got told by someone else that the chick that we did the stuff with had told multiple people about it and is proceeding to do so. And that someone else is constantly asking me if it is true or not. I insist that she's making it up but I don't think she's believing it because of how accurately the chick was able to describe the experience. She has no pictures or any other evidence of us doing stuff with her but you know rumors get around quite fast in high school.

216,"Hey all. All my life I've been nervouS around women. Growing up with a hateful mother and sister, my views of girls in general was distrust. I hated to get made fun of as a kid if I liked girls, as my friends at that age and time they said girls were eww, you know. But I progressed sooner into liking girls.

This combined with all the shit thrown at me at life makes me distrustful and closing my emotions to women, as I do realise women can hurt you emotionally better, as I've realised with my ex's. 

So something happened. I was talking to an older dude at the bar and he turned out to be gay. For some reason I felt comfortable telling me a bit more, but I was also shitfaced drunk, about the problems in my life and that I grew up without a father.

He told me I was pretty much set for life. That I should own my looks as he stated I had it all. Perfect height, pretty face, nice body. I felt flattered but it got kind of creepy too. I felt uncomfortable too when he said that.

He started to talk about sex, I got curious, asked some questions about how he turned to be gay, what he did, but felt disgusted and uncomfortable so I left.

Then another guy started to invite me to his house, jerk off with him, etc and nope. Told him to fuck off in a friendly-ish way.

Apparently why there were suddenly so much gay men was because the gay bar had to close early and they all came to the regular bars.

For some reason. I believed them. I believed I was a good looking dude. I didn't see any bullshit. If I girl would tell me I looked good, I would just assume she was just being nice or wanted money.

Why the fuck do I feel so confused? I'm in a bad unconfident time of my life. I hate myself for feeling flattered. I'm not physically attracted to guys in any way, even feeling disgusted, yet I feel more comfortable opening up to them while it's the other way around with girls, I like a girl's body, but I just get reminded of my mother and sister.

They started removing me from the chat for little stupid things, like say if I said something they didn't like for example one day I said I was busy because I was hanging out with other friends who I hadn't seen for a while, or because I didn't say happy birthday to one of them despite the fact I attended his birthday party the day before, also among many other things. 

I made it clear to them that in the past I had depression and anxiety and to go easy on me, I tried to join in on the banter and they started to remove me from the group even more...

221,"I need help figuring out my situation from an external point of view.

My dad lost his wife, who left three children, and barely two years later married my mom.
They lived in the house of my dad's parents, who didn't like my mother and told my dad that THEY had to kick her out of the house.
My dad relied on his parents, didn't face the situation and let them rule his marriage.
A couple of months later, his parents made a testament leaving the house to the three children. I was not included and the explanation I get is ""you weren't already born"".

Now, as things got ugly, my mom tried the divorce, but after the temporary decision of the judge my parents managed to get the relationships together and didn't divorce. My dad says it's because I told him so (at that time I was 5yo).

Objective things:
1) My siblings hate my mom. Only my stepbrother tries from time to time to do the right thing and he likely would like if my parents do well together.
2) My dad want to kick out of the house my mom. Probably because of the influence my grandpa had on him (now he is dead). He keeps saying that to me.
3) Our properties are legally of my siblings. That is because my dad didn't trust my mom and everything he bought he made it through my grandpa (that, after his death, left the testament where he leaves everything to my siblings).
4) My dad constantly defends my siblings, and didn't care much about me, because ""I have a mom and they don't"". I grew up with a father that told me ""I can't behave like a father with you, but like a friend"" cause my mother always got between me and him.
5) My mom, as her relatives told me, has always been a hard to get along with. My uncle told me she used to lock herself in the bathroom to avoid confrontations. At this point I suspect she suffers from some sort of mental disorder or at least she is dissociated with reality. This bring two problems, whether she may be addressed of her faulty or she needs help (that won't get here in this family).
6) My dad on the other hand twist things around for his personal gain. He don't talk and don't compromise his position, talking to me when we are alone and to my siblings when I'm not around. That's because my siblings and their relatives didn't like the fact he married again too soon, in fact thinking only about himself and not his sons; and because of how he treated my mom, so he's stuck in the middle and probably don't know who can trust.
7) I own nothing. My dad had a lot of money and my siblings knew it. He made a house for one of them and payed for the college education of another, other than that he constantly has their backs, financing them if needed.
He's paying my college, but I'm stuck and really can't study in such environment.

Now, I don't know if we are financially sinking (as my father keeps saying, but I fear he says that because in case I sue him I won't know how much money he have); I don't know where my mom will end up; I don't know if I can trust my siblings or I'm alone. I know nothing and I can't trust anyone.
Seeing my siblings get the life they want made me lose my self esteem, cause I don't know if it's up to them or is my father feeding their wallets and keeping them stress free.

Never had something like that before. It all changed when one friend moved away and went to another college and I studied abroad for a semester. So when I came back it was just us three. One friend L has always been my friend consistently but the other one, N, is off and on. During our senior year N and I had the same class and some days she'd talk to me but sometimes she'd ignore me even if I said hi or was right next to her. L and N also got into clubbing and drinking and while I'm fine with it, I'm not interested in it so I would be left out often.

L is the only one who texts me since we graduated. She is the only one to ever invite me places. We don't talk much because we don't usually have much to say and it's small talk but she's nice and she's been the same good friend. 

N - we never text. Like I said sometimes she's my friend sometimes not. She had a birthday party months after we graduated and invited L who lives a few states away from us. I live 45 mins from N and she never told me about it. But L wanted me to come and kept asking me to. I said since N didn't invite me I didn't want to impose myself. Suddenly I get a text from N with a last minute invitation because she forgot. She said she really wanted me to come. So I went and it was fun. We had a good time. I just don't understand where we stand. 

C is the one who moved away during college. We never talk. We never text. I've seen her once since she moved and it was okay. But I don't know her anymore. She's like a stranger to me. 

Also all three of them don't use Facebook; I think only Snapchat. So they all keep in touch that way and I never know what's going on with them because I don't use it. I only know what L tells me. 
For the record all three friends went on a trip together last year without me. I was not bothered by it at all because like I said I'm a bit different from them. It looks like they all had a good time and L said it was fun. And I'm actually glad I wasn't invited. 

Here's my overall dilemma. Should I fade out of this friend group? I know only I can decide but what would you do? I'm a person who can easily keep saying no but I know sometimes I should say yes or be more open so I want a different perspective. I also don't want to be rude to my college friends or give them bad feelings. But I also don't want to force myself into something. I'm focusing more on developing new friendships in my area and people who actually seem interested in my friendship on a consistent basis so I kind of want to move on. It's not like I hate them or anything. They are just acquaintances to me. 

To be honest I have moved on from a friend group before but I had no real reason to and was going through some stuff so I kind of regret that especially since that 1st friend group was pretty inclusive and still chatted with me and invited me places even when I left. I'm also used to moving on from people as I moved around a lot as a kid.

L has invited me on a trip with the other two and I don't know what to say. I tried to use money as a reason but I don't think it sounds believable and it's not exactly true (although I am super cheap). L really wants me to go but I don't want to. I don't want to be stuck with people I don't really know anymore for a week. Am I being a jerk if I say no? And is it rude if I just kind of fade out of this friend group? Has anyone else gone through this and how did it turn out? 

(TL;DR I want to leave my friend group because we have changed. One is still friendly, one is hot and hold, and one I barely know. Should I move on and focus on new friends?)",23Apr2018,2

its so confusing i think that she was the one to pursue me since she added me and messaged me first ( i think no girls who i saw once did that to me ) and now the tables are turned .

I'm 25M kissless virgin who never had any gf, living in a shit hole country.

Been in love since 3 years ago with a girl from work, who still working sitting next to each other until now. She says she loved me but decided to be with someone else. I can't accept it because that guy is a jerk and a fucking stud. Sex before marriage is taboo in my country, and I know that they both often do that whenever they got time and by thinking about it drives me crazy. I knew it because one time I hacked to her phone and read all the text her bf sent to her. And it kinda makes me hard and I want to bang her. I feel like a loser. Years gone by and I started to accept it, but still no luck finding new gf.

A week ago her ex dumped her, and knowing that I still had feelings for her, she hugged me and said sorry and that kinda give me the green light. I did my best to not losing my cool, until I get notification that she still in touch with her ex, trying to fix things and she wants to get back to him. Even though her ex shows no interest anymore, this girl does. 

Today I talked to her about our feelings and she says no. She still in love with her ex. And knowing that sex their weakness, Im sure they'd do it soon and be together again. Just thinking about this makes me feel so ...wrong.

I really need advice on how to forget her completely. I tried finding new hobbies, even I tried to find a new gf but everytime the thoughts of her having sex is coming, I relapse again and again.

First I thought about going to uni to get a computer science degree but here it'd be pretty much like school. School back then gave me a severe depression I just recovered from. I'm really scared that I'll feel like I did back then, I wouldn't wanna go through that hell again.

Also with this kind of computer science degree I wouldn't learn much of what I wanna learn. It covers many topics I'm not interested in at all. I don't know if it's a waste of time then.

The thing is that my family is expecting me to go to an uni but I'd prefer learning that stuff on my own full time. I have no clue which path I should choose, it's giving me a headache. I'm drawn between what I SHOULD do and what others are expecting from me and what I WANT to do.

I responded by saying (as a joke)  
""Im sorry who is this?""

Then he said

(his name, lets say paul), so like ""paul?""

""Are you asking me if this is (paul)?""

Then I had to do something, so he sent me like 4 lines of really quick things like ""wait Im super confused"" and ""/u/ayeyuhayegang?""

~30 minutes later he called me, the first time I declined it as I was busy, he called one more time right after and left a message saying he was confused and wanted me to call him back when I got the chance

I asked him on snapchat why he was confused as I was only joking, and he apologized and said he thought I was serious and was confused and was worried about me because I didnt recognize him. While he was writing that (it took him like 10 min) I said ""(paul)?"" and after he sent his apology thing he said ""but who is (paul)?"" and I said haha.

Later he sent me a picture of us together that his parents took and said ""Do you recognize these people?"" and I said nope

He's acting violently, he kicked in the door to her room when she locked it, and pinned her down while trying to rip the phone from her hands, then threw it at her cabinet when he couldn't get her password.

He's messaged me and another friend, has been sending her HUNDREDS of texts the last few days, threatening to send nude pictures of her to all her guy friends, tell everyone she's been cheating on him (she hasn't; I've only seen her once in the past year, and he's convinced she's cheating with me, among others), and is also threatening to kill himself.

Well today, he apparently created an email using her name, and has emailed her job. She's only been at this job a few months, and he's also threatening to contact the CIO of three company somehow.

We're going to try and get a Protective Order today, but we don't know how to stop him from, frankly, TERRORIZING her.

236,"To start, I’m not asking my parents to buy one for me. That would be absurd.

Ever since I was a small child, I was very into cars. Although I intend to become an Aerospace Engineer, I still have a hobby for reading all about cars and am well immersed into the JDM/Import culture that is intertwined with a lot of the media regarding the subject.

Since I was into it from a very young age, my parents encouraged me to save whatever money I got my hands on when I was younger, such as birthday money and money from jobs as I got older and put it in a savings account, which I have currently.

I have 10,000 dollars ready, and another five that I’ve invested in a few other assets (which are doing well thankfully, I’m not touching it). I was looking at some used Nissans and BMWs that were in the 5-6k range, as the other 4-5k would go towards insurance for a couple years and maintenance costs. 

I have my license, and am a safe driver. My parents acknowledge that. The problem is my parents, I guess, assumed I would lease a NEW car, instead of buy a used one. The reason I don’t want this option is because I would be stuck paying more over the 18 months-2 Years I would have the car, and I wouldn’t even be able to afford anything I would enjoy driving. The other issue with this is  I was intending to buy a manual transmission car which I could perfect my stick-shift driving on, and I’d rather not blow the transmission on a new car.

Recently I came out as transgender to my parents and they did not take it well. I had been talking to my therapist about it, and I had said I'd rather tell them now and have them on board or at least knowing about the journey rather than them finding out and then having them thinking I didn't trust them. They just think I am using this (being trans) as an experiment to cure my depression which I have been suffering from for years, (The original reason I am seeing a therapist) which simply isn't true. I have tried to explain this to them but they completely reject this notion and are effectively waiting for me to ""grow out of this phase"".

My Dad barely talks to me and my mum keeps making passive aggressive comments about me being masculine (To be honest this could be unintentional, but if I bring it up she will just be mad that I brought it up again). I've tried to talk to them about it, but I am just met with hostility. I have a full time job, I am taking night classes, working on my music and fitness and have got a couple of places for university so it's not like I am actively being lazy and that is the reason they are angry? I don't get an allowance from them, but I live rent free and can use the food in the house which could be causing tension? I am honestly just so confused about how to live in them in the months before I go to university because between the complete lack of emotional support and the fear of losing my parents completely over something I didn't choose or can change is just making me really distressed.

tl;dr - Came out to parents as trans, they don't accept me and I am looking for tips about how to handle this until I move out.

239,"*Background*: Friend(26yo) is married to his 2nd wife of 2 years whom is slowly convincing him to cut contact with friends and even his family. She isn't confrontational at all but she's constantly calling him every second when he's not with her and won't even go to sleep without him going to sleep at the same time. She has no trust obviously, constantly has to search his phone, talks down to everyone (she's never worked, but she has family with money type of scenario), doesn't have any manners, and has unrealistic pouts almost daily. I've been friends with him for 15 years, practically through everything but he is on a leash with this demon. I never really gave it much attention until they visited us and after 3-4 days, my fiancee had hit the end of her rope with this girl. (20min drive, 30 min wait, just to sit down at my friends favorite restaurant in town, to be told that she doesn't want to eat here and they're leaving to go back to my place - they were visiting from out of state since I moved recently). Well after my fiancee politely told her she was being a bitchy, she became unhinged. Saying the general stuff you would assume. We would never see him again, they weren't going to move here (he's wanted to for a while, had a job offer, and sold off his business already), etc. Basically they were going to be moving in 1.5 months.  I guess it might be worth mentioning that I've been with my fiancee for 7 years and I've known him for around 15. So she has seen a lot of him. His wife has reminded him publically to not flirt with my fiancee (which he isn't) and obviously has some major issues. She had a kid at 15, and after a couple months being with him, she was pregnant again but I'm starting to think she tried purposely since he's overall a great guy and she wants to have a fortress around him.

I’m not really social, and I don’t venture outside of my small friend group to make new friends very often. Also, Im not ‘best friends’ with any of my friends. Sure, we hang out sometimes during summer, but I’m always the friend who is the last to be invited to things, or not invited at all. I’m not one for sleepovers, unless I’m the one invited. I rarely have friends over to my house because I feel awkward and don’t know what to do, and I get the feeling they are bored when we dont do anything but watch movies and talk. 

My mom wants to have a big party, like, hire a DJ and make burgers and hotdogs and things like that. Now, I’m sure you have inferred that I don’t attend many parties, and you would be correct. I’ve been to one actual party (big party I mean) which was for Halloween. I barely socialized during the whole duration I was there, and I only talked to one person.

So, I know this guy. We'll call him Greg (not his real name). He and I used to run in the same fandom circles, over a decade ago, but lost touch as interests, etc. changed. A few years ago, he found me again on social media. I won't name the site, but we were both using the same usernames as back in the day, so it's not like I was hard to find. We talked briefly, and during this conversation he mentioned that he'd found out a third party in the old fandom was actually a creator/writer from the IP we were both fans of, in disguise.

""...Really?"" I thought. Then I recalled that I knew this third party's real name, and where they'd lived back in the day. (It was a small fandom; the most active people shared details like that.) A quick Google turned up that yeah, they were a real person. Not who Greg claimed they were. Odd, but whatever.

Then Greg started posting all kinds of things to his social media. Conspiracy type things. I don't want to get into too much detail, because it would probably identify him. But...seriously, he thinks the Illuminati are real and dead authors are talking to him. But his biggest theory involves a secret ""vault"" of alternate versions of various media that have been created and locked away because...reasons??? A lot of these alternate versions, which he often discusses in detail, contain graphic violence and rape scenes, particularly against women. 

At this point I got really concerned that he has an untreated mental illness. He never said/posted anything like this back in the day; this was all new, worrying behavior from him.

He also sent me a message a year or two ago, claiming to out me as a former employee of the company who'd created the thing we'd been fans of. I told him no, I wasn't who he thought I was, but I doubt he believed me. At that point I backed away and stopped engaging with him, but still had him friended. Mostly to keep an eye on him, if I'm being honest.

This morning, I woke up to a notification that he'd mentioned me in a post. Said post was a list, including my username and ~10 others, of people he believed had access to this ""vault"" of his and were denying other people (namely him) access. He said that he hated all of us and that we could go fuck ourselves. Most of the people named on the list are women (me included), which is concerning given the graphic violence/rape stuff he continues to post about. 

I'm worried now that his behavior is escalating and his mental illness is getting worse, and that if this continues, he could hurt himself or people around him. Obviously the above post isn't a specific or serious threat, just a generic ""fuck you guys,"" and I don't think reporting it would go anywhere, but...again, I'm really worried about this escalating further. 

I've taken screenshots of the post (and subsequent ones where he added to the list and got combative with someone who went ""WTF?"" about it) in case this escalates into something ""report to the authorities"" worthy, but beyond that I don't know what else to do. I've blocked him and locked my social media down, but I'm also worried that might just make him angry and escalate things. To put it bluntly, I'm scared. At the very least Greg has my real name and where I went to university, and that bothers me.

About two and a half years ago, Scarlet went off the radar for a day and was caught with some other guy, and though she swears she was just hanging out, the fact that she lied about her location is highly suspicious. Nathan broke up with her after that, and being that I was his friend, he turned to me for comfort. I admit that I was a bit flirtatious but nothing ever came of it— it was harmless and had the sole intention of cheating Nathan up. They got together again after a short time. 

Fast forward to the end of the school year last year, our junior year of high school. Scarlet always has these huge end-of-the-year bonfires, and I suddenly find out that I wasn’t invited that year. Confused, I asked a friend if she knew anything. Then I got a text from Scarlet. Our conversation was essentially her explaining that she was hurt that I didn’t tell her about what happened a year and a half prior, and I did nothing but apologize even though I could really see no wrong in the fact that I comforted the boy when he needed a friend. Ever since then Scarlet has avoided me, even causing a scene at a mutual friend’s birthday party because she didn’t want to sit next to me in a game of Paranoia. Note that she never said anything to my face. 

Finally, last night was the bday of my best friend and I spent the night. Scarlet did too, but refused to sleep in the same room as me. Nathan was there but did not spend the night. Today I woke up to a message that said: 

“Obviously you don’t understand how it works when you fuck someone over and break their trust by flirting with their boyfriend and just sweeping it off like it was fucking nothing, you stop talking to Nathan and that’s final!”

I wear what I want now without thinking if Nate will approve and he drinks and smokes now. Last year, I started talking to this guy who Nate and I both know from high school, we’ll call him Jake. At first, it was just the friendly sharing of music and political memes and shit like that. But I’ve gotten to the point where I think about Jake constantly. We talk almost everyday, and it’s not really flirtatious, but I just feel like there’s something there. I saw him a few nights ago and even though I was with my boyfriend, I just wanted to talk to and be around Jake. I told my boyfriend about my feelings for Jake, and he understands that I can’t control it. But I don’t know what to do. I wouldn’t cheat, but I’m just constantly thinking about what it could be like with Jake. Even though Nate has changed since high school, I always think about how he has fucked my self\-esteem up and wonder if this is why I want out, but I really have nothing to be upset about in our current relationship. Does anyone have any advice? ",23Apr2018,1
252,"Hi all! Well, my title pretty much speaks for itself: whenever I meet someone I have so much in common with, we get along great and that in itself is pretty difficult for me - I basically meet very few people I share a connection with. But over time I start over analysing things and wonder if it's just a matter of time before they get tired of me. I understand that feelings can change and both parties may not be equally invested in a relationship, but I guess I keep applying that belief to every encounter I have and it makes things so much worse.

I met a guy who is honestly just the perfect person (I really like him, flaws and all; I could honestly gush about him till the cows come home). We're in sync with a lot of things and he gives me a new perspective in areas where we have our differences. At this stage we're just friends and the stronger feelings are definitely one sided on my end (I sincerely believe he's way outta my league). But because I'm worried that he'll realise that I've caught feelings, I started acting more aloof. I'll think of texting him but refrain from doing so because I don't want him to think I'm needy, or I don't want to show him that I'm dull or can't hold more intellectual conversations. Which could end up in me losing him even as a friend. I've done this before even with other female friends, where I end up losing them as friends for acting too distant outta nowhere (which is just me trying to show them I'm not clingy).

Whether with friends or **potential** (ish) romantic partners, I always worry that their interest in me is limited only to our initial interactions and will fade once the ""novelty wears off"". It sucks because I've had this self doubt and self hatred for so long, I'm not sure how to break out of this funk. Logically I know that I don't really know what other people think of me, so there's no use assuming, bit I assume anyways. I realise how much of a pity party this post is, but I really do want to change the way I think, I just don't know where to start. Also, sorry if my writing isn't properly structured, I've never really voiced this out before so it's a bit hard for me to put this into words.

Any words of advice, or perspectives you would like to share? Cheers!",23Apr2018,1
254,"Before we get into this, I want to just give a heads up that this post will be rather long and profound. And when I say long I mean **LONG**. I advise reading this if you have the time or are really interested \(or you're just bored out of your mind\). You guys are free to ask for details if you think it'd help, but I may or may not reveal some things about myself.

A little bit of background about me. I'm currently a freshman in college. I'm an Asian\-American still living with his parents \(and with most Asian families, I'm pretty sure that's quite common, since the parents will continue to care for their children until they are completely read to make it in the world and then give back to their parents by the time they are elderly\).

The college I attend has a well\-known business school and that's probably one of the few reasons anyone would even go, that and it's relatively cheap. I never once had an interest in business\-related fields, but I figured I had to invest as much as possible early if I was going to get the essentials down: building a network, getting industry experience, etc.

I'm still not sure what exactly it is I want to major in and where I want to start my career, but I'm currently leaning towards Marketing. Accounting and Finance are some of the more popular majors because the jobs people can pick up from these fields have higher starting salaries, but I don't really think either of those things suit me. I don't even really think Marketing suits me. I don't really think of myself as that creative, so I've been looking into the Data Analytics side.

To get into the business school you have to take a bunch of business prerequisite classes, which is what I've been doing. They say the earlier you get into the business school the better, because you can then start taking classes related to your major as soon as possible, and see if that kind of work would really suit you. I think at the rate I'm going, I'll be admitted into the business school by the end of my first semester as a Sophomore \(which is kind of early\).

But recently I've been catching up with some friends from high school. I've learned a lot about how much they've changed, grown, and what they've accomplished so far. I know it's not good to constantly compare yourself with others if you're not using to motivate yourself, and frankly, it really does just get me feeling sorry for myself. But anyway, I hear a lot of inspiring stories from my old classmates. One is pursuing his dream to be a screenwriter, another is making strides with his own business track, already getting more done than I have. Not all of their stories are great, but they all still sound like they're doing much better than I am. I have one friend who really hates the major he's taken: Engineering. Even so, sometimes I think I'd like to be an Engineer, seems like it'd be fun, practical, and it also pays fairly well \(but then again, I still haven't done that much research into careers yet\).

Another friend of mine was attending the same college as me, we both agreed this college and the current path we were taking was neither the best nor the worst of circumstances, and we were just glad to have each other. But recently, his transfer application to a more prestigious school had been accepted. I don't know what he'll be doing or where he'll be going, but he'll be gone next semester getting to explore new options.

One of my aspirations I formed in high school was becoming an actor \(which is admittedly is a little harder for an Asian\-American\). But it wasn't my only ambition, since I was young I sometimes dreamt of being a physicist, a biologist, psychologist, linguist, historian, you name it. The point is I truly love learning about this world and all the things I can do, and I'd like to do everything if only I could. There's just not enough time, or not a simple enough way to make enough money to learn about what I want to learn.

So then why don't I just switch my major? Well, I don't hate Marketing. I think it's pretty interesting \(otherwise I wouldn't have chosen it\). It's just that I've invested so much into getting into this business school already I feel like I kinda have to pursue a business major, not to mention all the friends and connections I've made would be lost. I'd also want to graduate on time since I don't want to waste any time and I don't know how much more of my tuition will be covered. And I figure getting a job in Marketing will practical for the time being. But I always think in the back of my mind, ""Will I be able to do everything that I want to do? If not do, at least try?"" I'm just worried I won't feel accomplished in the future and I won't be where I want to be. I know a lot of this also depends on my own efforts, but I want to be sure I go down a clear path, not confused.

I guess my problems would be the following:

How do you decide on what you want to do with your life after college? How do you focus on one thing in your life? What if your major and short\-term goals don't match up with your long\-term goals?

And this is a side problem I'd really like help with:

How do you do good research on potential careers: finding out qualifications, potential salaries, job descriptions, is there one comprehensive website or source that could really help me out with this?

Currently I have a job that I dislike. I graduated in 2016, things didn't work out and I had to work in an extremely shitty factory for 9 months.

262,"My family has always been fairly rational. I've always looked to my parents for advice and thought of them as very intelligent and reasonable.
But recently they have delved into conspiracy theories. It started with my sister about a year ago, but since she lives several states away with a family of her own, it didn't really affect my life. She tags me in conspiracy posts on social media several times every day, which bothers me, but I just ignore it.
However, it's hard to ignore my parents listening to conspiracy videos and talking about it almost every hour of every day for close to a week now. They're obsessed with it now, and so suddenly. They, along with my sister, are anti-vaccine, flat-earth believers who think Satan uses the Illuminati and reptilians to commence his New World Order. Like I said, I always believed my parents to be intelligent and rational, so this is shocking.

 My mom has been against vaccines since the 90s, because my dad would get a severe case of the flu when he got a flu shot (which I think is due to his type-1 diabetes giving him a weak immune system and not a fault of the vaccine itself). Because of this, she decided to stop vaccinating, and see it as I was born in 1999, I was never vaccinated (which will change soon. I'm getting my driver's license next week and one of the first things I'm going to do is drive to get vaccine shots on my own). The vaccine talk particularly bothers me because I have autism and it personally makes me upset that people think vaccines cause autism, especially my own family. Besides that they've been listening to some kind of conspiracy podcast or youtube channel that's talking about flat earth and linking Satan and the Illuminati to it all, while providing Biblical ""evidence"" to justify these claims.
This is also frustrating because when I was 13 I was equally obsessed with a lot of these same theories, reading about them every single day, having intense anxiety and fear over them, and having them control my life. It took me about a year to realize these conspiracy theories are baseless and hollow at their core. Like a cult, they create a believable narrative, feeding you truths, then bending truths and half-truths, before telling pure lies so you will buy their books/dvds, give them ad revenue, or simply feed into their delusions.

In retrospect it's so obvious that these theories are senseless, but at the time I really believed them and it scared me.
During that time my family would reassure me that these conspiracy theories are clearly not true and that I don't need to worry, and it was the only voice of reason in my life at that time. Now they're convinced of these same theories years later, and it really hurts me. My emotions are chaotic; on one hand I'm angry at them, on the other I'm worried for them, and there's still that tiny part of my brain that thinks ""Well, what if it is true?"" that I struggled with when I was 13. Apart of me wants to put it aside and accept them, showing love and care for them while ignoring it. So far I've been able to fake it, but I don't feel it. I know these feelings of resentment and anger are real, and I can't fight them, I just have to work through them.

Beyond all of that I'm dealing with the shock of my parents falling for this so convincingly. It's the equivalent of them telling me they're converting to the Church of Scientology. It's that level of shock and absurdity, and I just don't know how to deal with it. I feel like I can't trust their judgement anymore. I don't have many people to talk to, and I feel really isolated and upset.

I know the only thing to do is talk to them about it, but I don't want to. I'm sick of dealing with conspiracy theories in my life; I want to ignore it. I feel really weird being around them, like I don't really know them like I thought I did. I feel very vulnerable and alone. I don't know what to do.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

270,"So basically,I have this friend and I don't know how to get rid of her... 

This is a girl I've known for a long time, my friends have known her for a longer time than me but recently the three of us have all gotten to a point of no longer wanting to be her friend. It sounds nasty but trying to explain the full extent of it is harder to explain when I try and tell others why she's irritating.

Only recently me and my friends have been introduced to a new set of friends and we've been getting along with them a lot more then we do with other people. Its been pointed out that she really tries to over shadow the three of us and it really puts us in our shell and we cant be normal around her because all conversations are serious with her whereas we just want to be weirdo's. 

The severity of it is much worse as she's someone who tells a lot of lies, we catch her out but she lies even more to cover it up. Meeting other people is another thing that is done and she never invites us out but then expects an invitation when we're going out. She's self-centred and whenever someone tries to tell a story she then tells one having to be 10 times better then ours and it makes us feel irrelevant. We have been there a lot for this girl seeing as though she has just come out of a relationship with another girl so we have stuck by her side making sure she is ok but we get nothing in return when something major or small happens to us and its irritating to us. 

That being said there is a lot more to it then just that, its gotten to a point where all three of us don't want to meet her and are trying to avoid her at all costs. I honestly have a strong urge just to stay away because she's annoyed me so much that I don't even want to be her friend, she does nothing for me and when out and she's not there other people start to be themselves and we have the time of our lives.

However, i'm a person who gets emotionally attached to others and I know my two other friends are the same. We know that she could just be acting like this because something is going on with her but us finally answering back to her and us wanting to meeting her is something we feel like she now knows that were annoyed with her and nothing changes with her.

272,"I have been working as a substitute teacher and part time copy editor for the past five years. I absolutely hate subbing, because I feel like I'm wasting time; if I'm lucky, I spend about 10% of my time actually teaching/helping students understand things, but the rest of the time, I might as well be a babysitter or correctional officer. Some teachers don't even leave lesson plans, and the constantly changing nature of my assignments, the unreliability of employment, and the stress of being called at 5 AM to go teach is getting to be too much.

Copy editing from home was good to begin with... except now the company that I work for has made some major changes to their editing criteria, and has made the process of providing feedback a massive headache. Plus, work is not available all the time, so again, not a reliable source of income.

I am looking for a new job that is meaningful and satisfying, and that will allow me to cover my bills. I'm not looking to get rich; I'm looking for work that will support me and not suck.

A little about me: I have a BFA in a creative field (trying to be vague, as this is a throwaway). I am good at proofreading, content/copy editing, basic video editing, organization, and cleaning. I do not enjoy working with people (subbing for 5 years has burnt me out on that), and would love to work in solitude. I am not strong in math or science; English and the arts are my strong suit. I'm open to the idea of freelancing or owning my own business, but I also want semi-consistent work. Relocation and travel isn't an option, as I have a family. 

My ideal job would allow me to work independently from home and allow me to exercise my creativity. Being my own boss would be cool. I'm just not sure where to go with this.

I'd appreciate any suggestions or ideas. I know I sound whiny/pathetic... I just really need some guidance. I feel like I'm wasting my life.

274,"I'm a 15 year old girl and my mum has always been a foster carer, she originally fostered newborns for a few months before they went to an adopted family, but recently she was offered a teenage girl to foster. I'll refer to her as Z, she has been with us just over a month and is the same age as me. I know she has been through some horrific stuff, including horrific abuse from several members of her family. I understand the trauma she has gone through will affect her significantly so I'm trying to be fair about this but things have not been going well.

When Z arrived, she went straight up to her room and didn't come out until dinner. My parents told me to carry on as things were before Z arrived, but to engage with her if she tried to communicate with me in any way. In short, I had to give her lots of space but sense if she wanted to be included in something. I feel like that is my parents job but my mum thought I'd be able to understand her better as we are similar ages. 

When she came down for dinner the first evening, she was actually quite chatty with my parents, talking about her friends and what colour she wants to dye her hair and stuff like that. I said some things but it was hard to get a word in edgeways and I didn't want to be seen as trying too hard. Maybe she sensed that but I wasn't being snobby or judging her, I was just trying to work out how things would work. She mentioned her hair and my mum said ""Oh, MokaLeean wants to do hair and beauty for her job! Perhaps you can style your hair together!"". I was put on the spot and incredibly nervous, it's not becauae she's a foster child, it's just that 'm always awkward with people my own age anyway until I'm comfortable with them,  and here I was with the added pressure of trying to make sure she knew I wasn't judging her, while also not wanting to be overbearing. I smiled and said that would be nice. Z instantly went quiet, finished her dinner and left the table, while giving me a dirty look. 

I went to bed a few hours later and noticed the £50 I kept in my makeup bag on my chest of drawers was gone. I was annoyed as I was meant to be buying my friends birthday present with that. I didn't snitch though, I didn't want to live with an enemy in my own home. 

The next day I was getting ready for school (she wasn't going, she was deemed unfit to cope with it) and I coupd hear her downstairs, as usual being really chatty and upbeat with my parents. The minute I come down, I get a dirty look before she runs upstairs. My parents didn't notice her odd behaviour. 

Things continued like that for a few weeks. One evening my parents went out to dinner leaving us both home alone and it all kicked off. She was sat in the living room watching TV and I walked past to go the the kitchenm i didn't communicate with her, she clearly didn't like me and I figured I would respect that and keep my distance because of what she has been through. I was searching through the fridge for a yoghurt and she grabbed my hair and pulled me into the living room. She pinned me up against the wall and just kept calling me a cunt over and over again, I couldn't defend myself as she wasn't confronting me about a specififc incident, she just kept saying ""I hate you, dirty cunt just hang yourself."" I asked her why she disliked me so much and she just said ""You have no idea what I have been through you bitch. Respect me or I'll get my dad and brother to rape you."" 

I didn't say anything to my parents and it has continued, her stealing from me and threatening me and spitting at me whenever we are alone. She grabs a knife out of the drawer and keeps it with her when my parents are out and  makes sure I see that she has it if I come downstairs. She is very crafty, whenever me and either of my parents start conversing, she'll do or say something to grab their attention.

A bit less when they show interest in an actual relationship (a.k.a. when they KEEP asking to hang out, show romantic interest etc). But still I cope. But when I want to approach I experience this enormous sense of dread. Example: flatmates are always asking to have a drink. I often said no but still, we're cool. And then I asked one of them if they wanna have a drink after my exam. He said sure. But still like I have this feeling of shame and worry and 'omg what if he thinks this and that'. So my question is: how do you eliminate that crazy nonsensical anxiety and self-doubt when approaching people? If this affects me even in the smallest things like 'let's go grab a coffee' what am I gonna do about the big things in life where I have to step forward?",23Apr2018,1
281,"I have a close friend who is pregnant. She is set on raising the baby but I’m really concerned and don’t know what I should do/say to get through to her. Some background information: she has been living with my roommates and me for about a year, her only other option is with her abusive father and mother. She has zero dollars to her name (I’ve been supporting her with light support from her parents), she suffers from mental illness with symptoms that include intense psychosis, hallucinations, hearing voices etc. and as a result, hasn’t been able to keep a job or do well in college (5 attempts at 4 universities) and the baby’s father is her drug dealer . I’m not judging her for any of these things, I just don’t think it’s fair to bring a baby into such an unfortunate  situation. Maybe I’m overreacting. Is love really all it takes to raise a baby?

282,"To sum it up: she’s known her ex ever since she was born, so about 17 years now. Their families are extremely close, with their mothers being best friends and loads of cross-family activities such as going on holidays with the other family ever since they were kids etc. She still sees him pretty much everyday and they were in a relationship for about 2 and a half years.
I slept with her and she says she really likes me a lot and would want to have more with me, but I’m unsure. She once sent me a snap of him laying in her bed, as they were allegedly studying or eating or whatever. I just feel like this is stupid and i might get hurt if I start developing real feelings for her. I can’t talk to anyone about this irl so I’ll have to ask you guys :)

283,"I recently moved to a beach town and needed some while I set up my own business, so I applied to work at a hotel on the beach front. I have years of experience and got the job offer on the 1st interview. They also told me they were seasonal and close during fall. It sounded perfect for my needs.

The job is great, I can see the beach from my desk and my coworkers are nice to me. The issue is my manager and the operating owners are extremely racist. I should say before we continue that I am white. I do work with people who are African American and some Mexican Maids.

They will make comments like ""The matianence man does a good job, when he does his job. He can't help it though because he is black"" or if they suspect black people of being the majority of our guests they will say stupid things like ""Today's forecast: 69 degrees and the sky is Black""

There is an event where black students go to the beach to get away from college. It is one weekend, but there is a lot of people and the past 3 years have had a shooting occur. I get that frustration, but it is not the person's race to blame as there are a majority of the other people who are peaceful when they come here.

I have tried to tell them I don't think it is their race but the type of people who come when the price drops (We had a white drunk guy tell us he was going to blow up our Hotel, because we told him to stop shouting at people on the beach from his Balcony at 11pm.) They brush me off. 

They are also die hard Fox News watchers and love Trump but can't name a policy they support. Lately they have been coming to me because of the Facebook Hearings because they don't understand and I ""keep up with these things"". That makes me so upset, they are being intentionally obtuse and just internalizing what hate mongers tell them.

I need to make it to October so I can launch my business. How can I handle this in the best way? Because I despise these racial bias towards people I am supposed to serve best I can.",23Apr2018,2

I need your advice.. I'm a 22 year old, 3rd year accounting student aspiring CPA and I completed my 4-month paid co-op last summer in an entry-level accounting role at a non-profit organization. 

A few days ago, I was offered a 12-month paid co-op (mandatory to go back to school after) in a construction firm that builds on my accounting advanced skills. I applied thinking I wouldn't even get it to be quite honest. Though before that I planned on taking additional spring and summer courses to fast track graduation.

Couple of weeks ago, I met 2 of my friends from high school. I literally haven't seen them since 5 years and I also made no friends in that time gap. I literally closed my social life and started working and studying for my degree. 

When I met my friends, they both were self obssesed with that they do, how they are creating multiple source of income, how they are becoming rich and pretty much everything related to me. I got extermly jealoused and angry because I wasn't able to match up to their financial situation and I barely said anything about myself; plus they didn't ask much about me and my career. 

My question is: is it better to stay around with these type of friends or attempt to make more friends? Or is it better to become indepdent and stay focused on achieving your goals?

287,"Ok, here's the deal. My dad has this really complicated sound system setup with the tv in the bonus room, and I had a bit of a party at my house this weekend and everybody was stoned as hell and we all decided to hook my xbox up to it. Instead of just using an hdmi cord directly to the tv like normal fucking people, we unplugged something else's HDMI cable into it and it worked from that I think (Idek I was very high and have zero memory of what that cord went to)

Now the cable box isn't showing video on the tv. The box itself has an hdmi cable running into the stereo reciever, which acts as a hub and theres another cable going from it to the tv and thats how we get the video. 

For whatever reason the video from the cable box isnt showing anymore. Getting audio from it so I know it's not an issue on the cable box or its cord.

I thought I put everything back how it was but still no video, spent like a half hour yesterday putting everything back how it was and cycled through all the inputs. Still no video.

Was hoping my dad would be able to figure it out after they came home and he was just like ""Nah I'm not dealing with this shit, you fix it"".

290,"Hello everyone, i am a 20 years old student and i feel like i've hit rock bottom. i have been in university for 2 years. During 2017 i've been using drugs, drink a lot of alcohol, at some point i was drinking and taking drugs almost daily. Then my mom got cancer and it was a pretty tough time for me and i realized i was doing bad things in my life, and at this point, i just wanted my mom to be proud of me.

  So i went back to university and tried something else( i used to be a physic student for my first year and switched to Informatic). The first semester went kinda well (note that the first semester is the same in Informatic as in Physics/chemistry/math). During this time i've delt with my addictions so to say ( 6+ month without any hard drugs, drinking from time to time but not getting drunk almost everyday as i used to do. Only thing i keep doing is smoking canabis). My mom beat cancer, i was happy, motivated to get back grinding in my life. 

 Then others family problem came in the way. One of my sister lived in a caravan and is not working for a long time, taking hard drugs on a daily basis, the main problem was her boyfriend, which is now in jail because of drug trafic, shotting someone for drugs related stuff(and i hope he stay there for a long time). At this point i had to help my sister move her stuff, basically throw junks that  accumulated over the years, lots of junk, lots of stealed stuff. So she mooved to my mom's house but yet, she's still into drugs and isn't really trying to do anything about it. I tried to talk to her, to help her but i'm not usually good at such things. Lots of people in my family tried to help her but she kept refusing. So right now she's living with my mom and it's kinda awkward, my mom's trying hard to get her out of drugs, she saw doctor quite a few time about it, but she's not willing to do anything about it, she just wan't to keep doing drugs. i wish i could have helped her, but we've been trying for a long time. 

 On the other hand my 2nd sister is bipolar and she was in pretty rough times as well, she firstly saw a  psychologist which was compleetly useless then she saw a psychiatrist which basically burned her brain with xannax and anti depressant. She lives with my father (which llive in another country) and he do not care for shit about her. So i had to be there for her. My dad was treating my sister like dogshit, she made one big suicide attemps and ended up in hospital. At some point she was telling me almost everyday that she wish she was dead, that soon she will be gone. Now she's with a guy in sweden and she's moving there soon i guess (getting out of the bad influence of my father). She's mostly doing fine now, no more addiction with those legal drugs. No more ""i wish i was dead"" ""i won't be there next christmass"". 

 Both of those things happened during the last 6 month and, after getting back on the track as i though, made me hit bottom. My second semester of Univ went really bad since i moved to informatic and it was a really hasty move. So i kinda threw up univ at this point in time, i'm feeling kinda lost. But that's not enough. recently i have been caugh by cops right after bying cannabis. When this happen, they're  most of the time cool about it and even let you go with your stuff. sometimes they just take what you have and give you a simple warning. But they didn't wanna be cool, since it was in a neighborhood with lots of drug trafic. So they took me to the post. Police officers told me that if i was doing  what they say, i wouldn't get anything, so that's what i did. At this point i was pretty sure they would just release me soon. but they decided to place me in custody. At this point i just wanted to get back home, i was pretty freaked out I stayed the night in a cell and they released me yesterday morning. Now i have to see a prosecutor in 3 weeks, and i will know what will happen to me in like a month. , it could only be a fine or it could basically means that i'll have a criminal record saying that i'm a drug addict. I'm just that 1/1000 case where they take hard measure to show example. I feel like a criminal for using canabis even tho i fighted hard last year to get away from hard drugs and alcohol.

 Right now i don't know what to do. I feel lost and i have no one really to talk about all off this. I just wan't to get back on the tracks and going back to grinding the shit out of my life. I am very motivated to do so, yet at the same time i just feel like my life is collapsing even more. What should i do to get out of this situation ? Thanks to people who actually bothered reading all off this.

291,"I've been working since I was 14 (30 now) and I've never worked with such a horrible manager. 

I've been with the company I work for now for nearly 4 years, 1 year has been under this manager and I'm just... deflated. 

She's extremely condescending when she speaks to my coworker and me. Nothing we do is right -  I will give you an example: 

I have a log I fill out daily that is sent to her at the end of the day. One day our systems weren't working properly and I couldn't fill out my log. I asked if she wanted me to send it to her anyway even though nothing was filled out. She said ""No, don't worry about it. We will take care of it tomorrow"". So I packed up my stuff and left for the day, not sending the email. The next day I was reprimanded for not sending my log. When I reminded her what she said she responded with ""oh.... yes. But still, no matter what I say you should be sending me the log every day."" 

This trend happens every day. No matter if you follow her direction to a T, it is still wrong. You can remind her that is what she said and you are still wrong. 

The laziness is driving me crazy as well. She is one of the most lazy individuals I have ever met. She admitted to me once, when I tried to take on more work from other departments that needed help, that she doesn't want to take on more work because she wants to ""spend her days shopping on amazon"". I thought she was joking but no, I was not allowed to help other departments even though it's in my job description to do so. 

It's all driving me crazy. I have no desire to work at all anymore. I know what I do will be wrong and I will be spoken to like the biggest idiot on the planet. I've never felt more down about myself until this. I don't think I'm out of the world smart, but I also never thought I was dumb.. but now I'm constantly second guessing meself and I'm not so sure.

295,"As the title says, I'll be going away on holiday on the week before my holiday. This was done as a kind gesture from my mum as a surprise for me because she knows that I get worried over these things so she thought it'd be nice for us to go away and ""calm"" however when she booked the holiday she didn't know of when exactly I was going away, and it just so happens to have been the week before my mocks, which are the mocks that represent what grades I send to my desired university's.

296,"Alright reddit, I need your advice.

I'm a 25m. I'm getting married next year and have begun planning for it in full force. The love of my life 23f is doing most of it, as I have no sense of design or taste, I simply pay my part and get to enjoy the honeymoon.

However, I have a few dilemmas that I do have to plan. Let me preface by saying I'm not a very social person. I'm not awkward too much, but I just prefer to be with my lady, and my daughter, and my dog. That's it. I go out with friends once a week or so, but I like being at home. I'm also not too close to many of my friends.

So I have to have groomsmen and a best man. I have the groomsmen picked out, but not sure about a best man. My fiancee suggested I have my late best friend (died of overdose a few years back) full the spot. I would have a groomsman pick up the responsibilities of the speech and what-not. Is this a good idea? Is it cringy?

Secondly, the bachelor's party. Like I stated above, I'm a quiet guy. I like to play Dota2 and rocket league, and read a few books. I don't really want to have a bachelor's party. I'm not terribly close with any of my groomsmen and I feel that doing anything (even playing a few games at my house) would be for their benefit, not mine.
I feel that it would be awkward, or since I play competitive games (mostly single player at one's home), I would be settling to do anything else. I'm not a clubber, or a drinker, or much of anything, really. (Boy, I sound boring.)
My fiancee has also suggested possibly a duel- bachelor's / bachelorette party - which would involve probably a club or something. (I'm not terribly opposed to this, but I'm not big on dancing, so it'd mostly be for my fiancee.)

So, what do I do? What are my options?

298,"Believe it or not, I’ve shortened this as much as possible:
I was really jealous of a coworker (call her “Tanya”) last Summer. I'll just say that I work in a really psychologically draining job, and I felt she was weaseling out of doing the really hard work. The kind of work that burns people right out. So I was the one stuck doing it. 
Tanya is very difficult to even make small-talk with, much less approach regarding serious issues (like, swapping tasks once a week), so I just didn't. Instead, I just stopped talking to her at all and was not cordial when we passed in the hallway. I never said or did anything outright, but it was obvious I was seething, and she complained about it to our boss. She said I was ""always rude."" A fair point, and accurate. I regret acting like this. I look back at my behavior now and I'm just horrified. 
I decided I needed to change last Autumn. I didn't want to have beef with anybody, and this job is important to me. I spoke to her, and it was insanely awkward, and she wasn't very receptive. That's fine. She wasn't obliged to forgive me. 
But over the months, things seem to have gotten worse. I smile and talk to her cheerfully every time I see her, and I thank her for her help when she helps me, and I help her when I can, and I just try to be a good coworker...and she just hates my guts. She has a tendency of just staring at me over the top of her glasses, scowling, when I speak to her. She makes me so fucking nervous that I find myself apologizing for everything around her, which I know only makes things worse. She seems to act toward me exactly how I acted toward her last Summer. Like just seeing my face makes her furious. Yeah, irony, I know. 
Things seemed to come to a head last week. We’re having an inspection, and I (like a dumbass) wrote a long note informing other staff of what we needed to do to get ready for it. I knew Tanya wouldn’t *like* it, but I also wasn’t really writing it for her, because I thought she was also on board with getting ready for the inspection. I guess I thought her only problem with the note would be that I wrote it, and not her. 
But then I got a text from her—not about the note, but about some things I’d temporarily rearranged because of the inspection. She absolutely EXPLODED. This text was something she would never say to me in person, and I’m genuinely worried. She can work more hours than me because I’ve gone back to school; if she complains about me to our board, and/or our boss, they’ll keep her before they keep me. It’s just math. I can find another job, sure, but my boss is sort of a mentor. I have lots of work friends at this job, and I’m very dedicated to the cause. 
TL;DR: My coworker wants me exploded in a puff of dust and can probably do it because I deserve it. How do I patch things up with her for the sake of my job?

302,"Hello!

I currently work for a startup that has experienced explosive growth in the last two years and is struggling due to this. 

I was originally hired for a back end position that did not involve speaking with customers. My manager at the time was a huge bully (and still is, has a reputation for it and high turnover in her department as a result). I ended up going to HR and leaving that department. At the time, two departments wanted me: Education and legal. I ended up in the latter because the manager of that department gets what she wants. I am far better suited for the Education department as that is what all of my prior experience is in. 

So things in the legal department go swimmingly for a while, I learn a ton of new stuff, etc. However, over the last year, that role has grown and grown because of the demands of that manager and it's gone way outside of my title and pay. I have gone from doing something similar to what I'm skilled in/would like to do, to being someone who is stuck on the phone reading off a script all day. I was also just informed that I am now responsible for ""escalated"" customer/bad reviews/etc in addition to this. As someone with social anxiety, this is totally not in line with my skills or what I am comfortable doing. And I was told - not asked. 

My title is administrative, but I am more of a project manager nowadays. I facilitate several large, new projects. I am also expected to function as a floating teammember/manager. In addition to managing the resources and driving these projects, I am expected to fill in for other departments when they are short staffed. We have terrible turnover, so this is often. I am thrown into these new roles with little to no training. I am also handling KPIs/meetings/other performance related tasks because these departments have lost their managers or been restructured suddenly. I am also expected to facilitate a project that is destined to fail. I have recognized many inconsistencies and places to make it more efficient, and possibly make it successful, but the company refuses to listen. It doesn't matter if I make 10 calls or 200 calls a day related to driving the growth of this project, unless I get support and changes on the back end of it, it will never be successful. I hate being forced to remain at the helm of a sinking ship. Nobody will hear me out on this project and it is a constant source of frustration for me. My boss is incredibly sweet and does care for us, but will not hesitate to do what she needs to do to ensure she gets results - this includes putting my counterpart and I in such a difficult spot. She can be personally sweet all she wants, but at the end of the day she is completely overworking and underpaying my counterpart and I and taking advantage of us. Is this correct? 

I do all of this for $15 an hour. I was given a bonus of $150 this year and a raise of $0.45. Comparing what I make to other professionals who manage projects or manage entire departments, both of which I am expected to do, this is extremely low pay for the role/expectations. I also found out my counterpart, who does exactly what I do, makes more than I do.

I should also mention I tried to quit but they talked me into working from home but I was provided with no equipment and currently run everything off of my personal computer which I can no longer use for its intended purpose (it's a gaming rig) because of the software etc that I have to use for work.

Now, this is my first ""office"" job - I come from a background of education and training, and I feel strongly they are taking advantage of my lack of knowledge as it relates to the corporate world. 

I am constantly stressed out and spread way too thin. Better pay would sweeten the deal, surely, but I am honestly at my wits end and would be perfectly OK with just walking out. I teach ESL remotely outside of my regular work hours and could easily keep up with my bills doing just that until I found something ""regular"". 

My counterpart feels the same way. She tried to put in her 2 weeks verbally with HR today and was told she must write a letter, then they sent her on her way without hearing her out. It's just tough for us since our titles don't really ecompass what we do which contributes to our lack of a good frame of reference. 

I spoke with her on this and my advice was that we should coordinate. The company absolutely cannot lose both of us right now. We are vital to their operations. We can either leave at the same time, or we can demand better pay and better work conditions. As far as what comes after this, I am fine going back to my original field or going back to school. This job was an ""emergency"" job I took up when I suddenly had to relocate. 

I have left jobs gracefully in the past and have no problem doing that again, but I have 0 experience making demands in regard to pay and role. What do you suggest we do? What do we ask for? How?

By ""communicating"" I mean how I communicate to others and understanding what they mean.

Here's some additional info:

* I am in my 20's.
* I have struggled with communication my whole life.
   * Growing up I didn't do well in English, history and social studies compared to math, science and computers.
* My boss has told me multiple times I'm a literal person.
* Many times conversations go like this:
   * Me: I think A.
   * Other person: I think B.
   * Me: What do you mean by B?
   * ...
   * We eventually realize A and B are the same.
   * I want to say it correctly the first time.
* I believe I've gotten better at communicating in recent years. \(For example, a former coworker told me I was eaiser to understand.\)
   * One change I made was adjusting my vocabularly to each person I talk to.
      * I've noticed that people have slightly different meanings for words.
      * So I adapt my wording to theirs.

308,"Hey /r/advice, I'd like to talk to you guys because my academic advisors are not helpful. I have a colorful academic past, I was immature and withdrew from uni after my first year of school. I took two years did nursing and got my associates and then went back to uni for biology to go try and go to med school. I'm a B student with a 3.2 gpa but honestly I don't think I'll get in med school. It's not a confidence thing, it's a matter of my gpa being low and my organic chemistry grades being C+. My question is do you guys think I should just finish my bio degree with a ba or spend the extra year get my bs degree and try anyways for med school? The perk of me just finishing it and going to engineering I can shave a lot of time off about a year and a half to get my ba in bio, bs in mech engineering and my MBA. I'm really into space and I enjoy biology but there isn't many opportunities in having just a bio degree. I feel my best bet is do the ba and follow up with the engineering/MBA program that my uni offers. 

I'm just curious for a second opinion and see what you guys think.

Tldr; get an ba in biology so I can go into engineering/MBA or finish my bs and take the gamble of med school. ",23Apr2018,1
309,"Hello all. I'll try to make this as short as possible.

I am 23 years old, and don't have many friends currently. Maybe 5 that I actually hangout with, and of those 3 I actually enjoy hanging out with. Then when we do hangout we're always drinking so its pretty easy. However, I don't really have any friends that I share interests with, so if we're not drinking, the conversations are boring and shallow. The one person I hangout with a lot and have a ton in common with is my brother, which is cool. I didn't goto college, and work a 9-5 cubicle job with people I don't like all that much, so theres no help there.

I consider myself a pretty cool, interesting guy. I've got a few interests and have considered joining a meetup group or something like that. However, I've found most of them consist of only much older folks. 

I've also lacked in the romance department in the last few years, which pretty much goes hand-in-hand with my low social life. I have had a few random hookups with girls that I didn't really like/find attractive, but was just too drunk to care. I sometimes worry that I won't ever get married, and I know that's ridiculous at my age. I find it very hard to talk to random girls at bars or the like, so unless I can get better at that, I don't see anything changing.

This has led to weekend after weekend of me just getting trashed with my dad or the same friend that I don't really like or have anything in common with.

So, how can I get my social life together in my twenties, with barely anywhere to start?",23Apr2018,1

311,"Hello all! 

I'm studying Civil Engineering and am looking to transfer out of my current university to one that is more rigorous/well-known.

The current story is as follows: I didn't work very hard in high school and ended up at a school that while not terrible, was not the best I could have gotten into had I put the work in.

Fast forward, I'm in college now and I currently have a 3.923, on track for a 4.0 this semester, and I'm heavily involved in clubs, activities, and research. I've filed transfer applications at several universities which have stronger programs.

My current grievances:
Food. The food here is AWFUL.
Location: I'm 7 hours from home, and driving is the only way to navigate that.
Program Strength: The academics here are strong(top 70 in the nation for Civil Engineering), but the schools I'm applying to are better. 

My main question becomes should I transfer or not? I hear naysaying about how it's a huge disruption, etc. But the fact of the matter is that I broke in and became something better once, I feel like I can do it again. Yes, it'll suck, but so will being a sophomore here with terrible housing, garbage food, and feeling like I'm not living up to my potential in terms of academic rigor.

313,"Hey ive got a much older brother with alot credit card debt, ive never asked for exact amount of its around 25k. They have frozen his interest so its not getting worse but i dont know for how long that lasts.

He bounced around alot but for the last few years have been living with my parents, and my dad is a complete jerk. He doesnt pay rent or anything to my parents and my mum does alot for him around the house. He occasionally borrows money from me and my mum. Ive recently had enough of this and he owes me around 5k, i dont care much about this but if he asks for anymore ill be cutting him out completely, being 6 months pregnant i just dont want this drama.

He earns about 1000 to 1100 now, but hasnt been working at this job for long. I just dont know what to do? Should i try and help him save or give him a budget? I dont get how someone who earns that and no rent/ utils is borrowing money? 

My partner has offered to give some advice and even help plan out a budget for him. I think he has a problem with impluse buys and gets any cool new thing for his truck, my dad is alot the same. He and my dad dont get along.

I don't think what he is doing to my mum is fair as she already has to live with one selfish lazy bastard /my dad. But just kicking him out would make paying things off for him impossible. Whats bothered me recently was him complaining about my mum and how she use to be so happy why not go back to that... I didnt know what to say. By the way my mum now seems depressed and with good reason, and i think that bothers him. I dont know if its just being selfish or some level of entitlement he has, but he seems to think because my partner and i are doing well, and also ny sister is doing well and has her own family, that we should be helping him. There are big age gaps between the 3 of us and my sister and i have already basically cut out my dad ( very verbally and sometimes physically abusive man and a gambling addict) out of my life.. Should i consider doing the same to my brother? My situation is basically first time mum to be 28, saving for house with partner and about to move out of our small unit.

Guy #1: 
From the very first day of the semester this guy has been staring at me. On the first day of class I was sitting down in my seat minding my business. As he walked in I could feel him staring at me so I looked at him and looked away. He stared until he got to his seat. Now he does it every class. Stares into my face as he walks in and repeatedly turns (I sit in the row behind him) to stare throughout the class. I can feel him doing it so I just avoid eye contact because it’s gotten weird now. I can understand being attracted to someone, but to stare at them for weeks? Just speak and behave normally. I would feel weird doing it to someone so how does he not?

Guy #2:
In another class last semester this guy sat between me and another girl and made small talk with us both and he seemed normal. We didn’t talk that much outside of the small talk. A couple of weeks into the semester he asked us both for our number so that we could start a group chat for the class. I thought “Okay, seems logical this is a pretty difficult class we can help each other out.” Days after that he started texting me everyday asking me what I was doing over the weekend (I realized that he only asked to start the group chat to get my number because I wouldn’t have given it to him otherwise). I tell him I’m busy. The class after that he squeezes my knee repeatedly and tries to flirt like a kindergartner (lowering my seat and snatching my pencil from my hand). I ignore it and keep a straight face. He slides me a note asking me out on a date, I decline. He told his friends in the class that we were dating which was odd because they could probably see that I was not into him at all, barely spoke to him. A week after that he sees me and says “You’re not going to give me a hug?” Dude, I ignored your advances, declined your date, and ignore your multiple texts. I declined and walked away. I saw him on campus this semester and looked down at my phone immediately to avoid interaction and he walked up anyways. As he walked up he quickly grabbed me toward him in a hug (because he knew if he asked I would’ve declined) and kissed my cheek immediately after saying hi? I backed away because it was weird and he takes a step forward so at this point I turn to leave and he asks “Why are you acting like that?” BECAUSE YOU’RE WEIRD AND I’VE HAD THREE IN CLASS CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU. Also, I looked him up on Facebook and found out that he’s 32 with a daughter. I’m 20 (and people tell me that I look way younger). It was a sophomore class btw. Idk something about him was just off. 

Guy#3
At the last job that I had (it was a warehouse/stocking job) this guy would just follow me from isle to isle and stand silently staring at me. I don’t know what he thought it would accomplish, but I feel like it’s not that hard to tell when someone is emitting fuck off vibes, and I definitely was. He acted normal around his work buddies and other people, but would follow me and stare silently. Why not just act normal, introduce yourself and vocalize your interest so that I can politely decline like you know I’m going to? I’m pretty sure he was just an asshole because when his work friends were around he would yell “How you doing?” and “You’re so beautiful” and laugh and stuff like that when I would pass by to impress them and I would ignore it, but when he was by himself he would just stand and stare silently as I avoided eye contact. 


Those are only a few examples. I don’t have time to list every story, but how the fuck do I repel these types? I don’t want to go around with a mean look on my face ignoring every guy who starts a conversation with me because that would suck, but I want to repel the kind that follow you and stare and do weird shit when you’ve shown no interest.

One night, after a very long sequence of awkward events, and her complaining about how no one makes the first move with the her, I ask Selina if she wants to get back together. She says not right now, because she doesn't want to rush into anything, and the next day I get my phone, the only way I can really talk to her taken away for a month because I was behind on a lot of school work.

I take this as a sign that I should probably talk to Misty more, but I find out a little over a week later that she doesn't like me back. I'm upset, but I noticed she was looking my way a lot the next day. Anyways, I ended up getting my phone back a week early and decided to check Selina's Snapchat story and see that she essentially declared undying love for her new boyfriend. To make matters worse, I still didn't have a date to prom, which was in a couple months.

Later, that weekend, I was in a mall with my mom and sister, and I see a sign advertising prom dresses. I get my sister's attention to point it out and joke about my lack of a date, and the first thing she says is that I should ask Holly, this girl I had a crush on my freshman year.

Here's the question - this ""friend"" of hers has been influencing her constantly. I know shes trying to get her with other guys to help get over me. Knowing she's cheating on her boyfriend I have the potential to blow up her relationship, end her relationship with my girlfriend and potentially get things back on track.

330,"TLDR at bottom.

I started my job on the same day as my coworker, Hannah, so we instantly bonded out of first day nervousness.

We ended up going for lunch together a few times that week as we didn’t know anyone else. Later that week, Hannah invited me for a drink in a local bar, I thought that would be a good idea and so went along.  We shared some wine, had a laugh and then called it a night. 

After that Hannah began asking me to go for lunch all the time, like we were lunch buddies or something, but I like to eat late and was sick of taking early lunches to eat with her. I also am an introvert and sometimes I like to use my lunch to have a break from my coworkers and go eat alone somewhere. 

Hannah starts getting annoyed with me because I’m no longer going to lunch with her, and she makes comments that I’m ‘too good’ or ‘too busy’ for her. She has that kind of sarcastic jokey voice. But truth in jest right?

Hannah then starts planning company drinks and inviting me (again, not my cup of tea). I politely declined and said I was busy. She then began questioning me in front of our coworkers. Why can’t I go, ‘don’t worry about my other plans’ but she doesn’t drop it. Out of sheer awkwardness I end up caving and saying I’ll go for a quick one but must leave after. 

We go to the bar, I have one drink, she is sat next to me, blocking my exit. After I finish my drink, i let the group know that it’s time for me to get back and say my goodbyes, she then refuses to move saying it’s too early for me to go. It was extremely awkward, I kind of laughed to try and not make it look awkward in front of my coworkers. But this went on for a good 15 minutes. In the end she gets up and says ‘fine leave’ in a cold voice. I laugh again and say goodbye. 

Since then she’s asked multiple times for me to go to her house (she lives near me with her fiancé). I’ve always declined and she continues to ask me to different events, weekend plans, lunch. I decline all of the time because I’m not interested! But she guilt trips me, especially in front of others. Often saying at a table full of coworkers ‘oh I’ve asked E_r_l_o to my house multiple times and she never comes, she’s too busy for me! Too good for me’ etc

Management have decided to give her a job working closely with me. As they’re making her current role redundant. So now I’m going to be next to her all day everyday and it’s probably likely we’ll end up getting the train home together every night. 

I walked past her desk on my way to the bathroom on a few occasions one morning and she later scolded me for not saying hello to her. I can’t always stop and chat, I’m here to work!

I just don’t know how to handle this situation. She’s extremely clingy and loud and publicly guilt trips me. This is a nightmare for me, I am an introvert and like to spend time on my own. I have friends outside work whom I see when I feel like socialising. I have tried to create a good impression and reputation and she is really embarrassing me. I also have issues with confrontation.

338,"I've known this guy since 9th grade of high school up until now. 9 close to 10 years. Were both male, mid 20's. We see each other weekly. Maybe even twice a week.

The story goes like this:
About 7 years ago I met a pretty chill dude in freshman comp 2, lets call him Fonso. Fonso sat next to me and we would chat throughout the whole semester. Semester ended and we had each other on social media but we never chatted afterwards. 

Fast forward 3-4 years ago and my friend starts dating a girl, whose baby daddy is non other than Fonso. I tell my friend I actually know him and my friend says how Fonso disrespects him and acts like his girlfriend is still his property. Then says something along the line of ""If you fuck with him, you dont fuck with me"".

Being on my friends side and not really talking to Fonso, I removed him from facebook and that was that. However, soonafter (maybe a month or 2), i realized I still had him on instagram but i decided to just leave it be since he's never done anything to me and I wasnt planning on being buddy buddy with him. 

Fast forward to 2 months ago (mid feb), my friend and the girl break up. Everything is pretty normal in the group of friends for the next two months up until about 2 weeks ago. 

My friend calls me up one night and immediately asks ""Why were you talking to Fonso?"", which I did just the day before through instagram messaging. He had posted a video of him going to an event and making out with girls, which he posts on a weekly basis, and I asked him how does he do that. Pick up girls. 

I told my friend ""uuuh... I was talking to him about the event"". Followed by him saying ""No you werent, I know exactly what you said dont lie to me!"". Me:""Bro, I asked him how does he pick up girls at the event, im not lying to you"". Him: ""I told you if you fuck with him, you dont fuck me with. You ruined 9 years of friendship blah blah blah. I hope it was worth it."" Follow by me saying ""You two have beef with each other, not us. I didnt talk to this guy for 4 years out of respect for you. But because I asked a simple question you want to act like this? That's on you."" Then i just hung up because I was upset.

A few days later I apologized saying that it wasn't my intention to make him feel betrayed. I didnt go into that conversation thinking i'd lose my friend. I didnt go into that conversation thinking at all.  

I understand why he's upset and have given him time to cool down, but I truly believe he is blowing this out of proportion. It's been like 3 weeks since we've talked.

P.S
The way my friend found out is because Fonso called my friends ex girl and taunted her saying I messaged him over my friend on the topic of girls. Turns out Fonso really isn't that chill of a dude, twisting the scenario for his own gain. From there friend's ex girl calls my friend. And that's how all of this happens.

340,"Hey everyone!

I am looking to, for a lack of better wording, ""reboot"" my personality. I am a 33 year old male. I have a history of my personality being too empathetic and sympathetic for my friends, people that I feel have enough mutual respect to be more than an acquaintance. I invest in my friends. I don't expect much back. Some, including therapists, have told me I expect too little. If I know something is important to a friend or coworker I note it so I remember it is something they are invested in so I can show more interest. If someone asks me to do something with them I invest in the experience to make the most of it. I am empathetic and sympathetic to a fault.

How do I reset my personality, tearing away my empathy and sympathy until I reach a place where people are happier to spend time with me and interact with me? I am not talking purr apathy or indifference as I doubt the core of who I am will allow it. I am thinking of forced apathy until I adjust to that state. When I find that change happening, stop it at a good neutral ground before figuring out what pieces to add back.

Is this possible at all? Are there better ways to go about making large scale personality changes?

-She lives 45 minutes away, and she has no license, so I have to do all the driving. (I met her at a restaurant I used to work at near her)

-I know she's interested, however even when we're just talking, she's CONSTANTLY on her phone. Like, in mid conversation, her phone will buzz. She'll answer whoever texted, then goes on Instagram or Facebook for whatever reason, then gets off her phone. This happens so often I just don't even bother saying anything anymore. Worst part is, she will say ""sorry if I'm on my phone a lot"". I just don't even respond at that point and try to end the night early and drop her at home 

-occasionally she gets these random mood swings where she'll even get bitter with me, and I know that's normal with everyone but she won't even explain what's wrong, even when I ask multiple times.

-I know this is a little nitpicky but she is not exactly quiet either. For example, we're waiting in line to order food, and we're talking about someone terrible she used to work with. As she's describing her, she's getting so fucking loud while talking, and everyone's just looking at us and I'm just trying to get her to quiet down. She wouldn't be mad, but because how loud she talks, anyone who doesn't know that she's just talking normally would think she's angry at me or something. 

Anyway, I just think I'm putting too much effort into her, for not only the miles and gas I'm spending, but the time. And I feel that I just get nothing out of this.

End of the semester is coming up and I desperately need to pass the class as I'm in danger of failing this easy course. the reason I'm barely passing is because of one quiz that I missed, which I received a zero on and she has a strict policy of no makeups on anything. I have asked her politely if I could take the quiz, but she wont budge. Well, this professor has publicly claimed to not have favorites in her class yet its pretty obvious she does. she let one of my friends in the class retake a TEST for full credit and said because he has had good attendance,( complete bullshit considering he's missed more than 6 classes and me only 3) yet  I have way better attendance and overall grades in that class. keep in mind that the guy who was able to retake the test is a lot more outgoing in the class and talkative and I'm more quiet and reserved. also last class a girl said that she was only able to do 4 hours out of 8 hours on a assignment to which tanya said in front of the whole class, "" that's okay i'll let it slide since you're so cute"" even though I for sure would not have gotten the same response. I was shocked at how she could say such a thing in front of everyone. So my question is how should I go about blackmailing tanya to let me take the quiz for full credit?

352,"So recently I've taken a break from college for a quarter and I am currently staying at home with my parents. My brothers and I have always known that my mom has serious anger issues and that my dad is super submissive and just takes whatever she throws at him. I always thought that us kids where the reason why they where fighting so often, and I thought that when we go away for college everything would be better than they would be a loving couple once again. I was wrong, ever since I've been home  my mom has been going in on my dad for reasons I cannot understand. For example, my mom has been sick with a common cold for the past couple of days. She decided to skip church this Sunday so my dad and I went together. After church we called and asked her if she wanted any food, she said that she was sick and had no appetite. When we got home she started going in on my dad for being selfish and not getting her any food. When I pointed out that she stated that she has no appetite she immediately lashed out at me for""taking his side"". My mom is the type of person who is always right and never wrong, if anyone ever questions her she would immediately flip out. Every time my parents argue its always just my mom laying into my dad about all the problems she feels that he has. I witnessed them arguing yesterday and I tried to encourage my dad to speak up for once. I wanted my dad to try and expresses his feelings and emotions for once and not just my mom yelling at my dad for the whole argument. I tried my best to remain neutral. All I told my mom was that she should let my dad talk and express his feelings rather than cut him off every single time he tries to talk or defend himself. She got very angry and said that I'm always ""taking his side"" and that I don't know what I'm talking about. When my dad tried to defend himself my mom automatically assumes that its means hes not sorry. If I do not do something about this I feel that their marriage would soon come to an end and I do not want to see that happen. 
What can I do as a son to better help them both communicate to each other. I'm not trying to miraculously get them to stop arguing, I'm just trying to figure out a way to get my mom to slow down and listen to what my dad has to say. How do I encourage a ""battered man"" such as my dad, to speak his feelings and not have to suppress everything inside him?

I work a full-time night shift position from 6pm to 2:30am Sunday through Thursday that demands physical labour from me but is rewarding. I have great benefits and I earn a fair wage (59k last year) but due to some complications in the last few months I have run into some debt that I want to pay off quickly if possible.

I've been working this job for ~3 years now, going full-time last year so I'm used to being a night owl. 

I want to work some kind of job during the day 9am-5pm roughly in order to increase in monthly income and payoff my debts sooner. I just don't know where to start. I live in Toronto, Canada, and I've been checking out office assistant jobs on indeed.ca for the time being.

Without giving away too much personal info, I have a Business Diploma, a couple years of a BA, and tons of work experience with restaurants up until 3 years ago. I am a people person and love to help others, and I like to work hard for my money (hence the labour job I've stuck to).

I'd like to consider a flexible job in my area but I don't know exactly what I should pick. I don't want to work two jobs as labour (No warehouse associate jobs) as I'd probably die from exhaustion, but I figure something in an office would be suitable.

I'm hoping someone on here can point out something simple that I might not be seeing as a solution such as ""You should apply for ______ position /r/Veggieman34, you'd be great for it and it suits your needs.""

In addition, I am considering applying to an all-day breakfast place or some kind of daytime server position in a restaurant as the reliance on tips would be nice and I could use different skills than just the physical demand on my body that my labour job does.

358,"throwaway account just in case cuz I'm paranoid 

So, background. Two years ago I (f/17 then) went to Japan for a week, and while the trip was incredibly amazing my boyfriend (m/18 then) absolutely ruined any free time I had. For example, at night (his mornings) I had to constantly text him and give him 100% attention and respond within a minute of him texting or else he'd get mad and start a fight, and even if I did do that we'd still end up fighting over something. This was partly because that's the only time I had access to Wifi and could talk, but becaue of that I wasn't able to enjoy hanging out with my family at night because I had to be so focused on my bf. We've been together about 3 years now and I am happy with our current relationship. 

Now soon I'm getting to take the trip of a lifetime and visit England for an entire month. I'm ecstatic but I'm dreading having to manage my relationship while I'm there. I've already tried to talk to him about the trip a couple different times now, once with the end result being ""well you can't expect me to be happy when you're taking a trip I've always dreamed of going on and you never even thought about going"" and the second conversation being ""I don't care if you're out drinking but while you're having a blast in Europe I'm going to be stuck here all by myself working."" He's also always very concerned about cheating and loyalty so I know that's going to be a big concern of his, especially since my brother (who I'm traveling with) love to go out drinking to bars and everything. 

I completely understand his frustrations, and if I were in his shoes, of course, I'd feel jealous, but I'd also celebrate that he's having an amazing time and respect that. From the conversations I've had with him, he's not even going to grant me that, and from my past experience in Japan I'm afraid it's just going to ruin my trip, especially since then I was only gone for a week, and this will be a whole month.

So I'm looking for advice on if I should bring up this again and have another conversation about it, what I should say to not come across as ""look I don't want you to ruin my trip"" but at the same time express that I don't want a repeat of Japan, and encourage him to be excited for me, like I'd be for him. I'm willing to make compromises as much as I can for him so that he'll be as happy as possible, but there's not a whole lot a can do taking other party members into consideration. Additionally, a problem I think there is, is that he suppresses how he's feeling and refuses to talk to me about it until it's bothering him so much he'll explode up at me (like him bringing up me drinking randomly). Also, I think part of the problem too is that I don't believe he is sincere whenever he comments about my trip because I can't get over what he's previously said and changed his mind on (it's awful I'm going not him, it's ok I'm going, it sucks he's home working, it's ok I'm drinking). So I'm not sure. 

Any advice is much appreciated, whether it be on how to have the conversation or how to handle our relationship (and subsequent arguments) while I'm overseas. If I'm doing something wrong or could do something better please let me know. Thanks a ton! ",23Apr2018,1
359,"This is going to be long...   

The house I live in belongs to my mom's boyfriend. Recently, my mom talked to me asking that I get a job, that way I can get approved for a loan for a house, approved to buy a house in general or whatever I don't know how it works, .. because she and her boyfriend might break up. She says she needs me to be able to obtain a mortgage, that she'll pay for it, but that it has to be my name .. because she won't be approved after defaulting on her finances a few years back. So it has to be me.   

My problem is that I'm almost 30 and never had a job. I don't know how to be a functional human being. When I was young I was easily stressed out. I developed hives in kindergarten because it was stressful and I was anxious. This has lasted my entire life. I went through all my school years with painful hives because just being there stressed me out, and they never went away until I dropped out of school at 16, again, because I was stressed. I did get my GED and I have some college education, but I couldn't finish my Associates and my credits are out there in limbo, unused.    

Since I was 16, I've more or less been constrained to my room. There have been periods where I don't leave the house for over a year. There was a time when I did leave the house every 4 months to go to the dentist but I have relapsed into my hermit ways and haven't seen my dentist in 2 years. As I am currently, I haven't left the house since July of last year.  
I've never been to a therapist or talked to someone about whatever it is that's wrong with me. I know I have a lot of things wrong. I've been a parasite all these years. Just the thought of having to go out and find a job makes me feel like an insect that rolls into a defensive balls. I'm so insecure, ashamed of myself, anxious, sad.... I just want to be in the dark, rolled into my ball, with no one to look at me and no one to talk to me, and let me pretend I don't exist.  

 I'll look up ""jobs for [social anxiety, agoraphobic, etc]"" and my defense mechanisms will flare up and I'll try to find excuses why I can't do this-or-that, even though I know this is counter-productive and innaccurate rationalization. Otherwise, I'm reading these lists while simultaneously panicking and crying. I should've gotten mental health help a long time ago but I'm too anxious to seek it.  

I'm not asking for my life to be fixed but I need to somehow piece together some kind of functionality. I don't know how to do this when everything, EVERYTHING, feels like a disruption to my sense of security. I don't know how to stop thinking the way that I do. I don't know where to start.

Some things to take in mind:

Im fortunate to say that my financial aid covers all my classes for whatever degree I choose. Money is not much of an issue.. yet.

I would like this degree to be a “temporary” or back up job. I still want to pursue a bachelors degree but I want to have job that would help me cover University’s expenses because I know for sure my financial aid wont cover fully. 

Im still not sure what bachelors degree Im going to pursue. But, I know I want something haha.  I got a few majors in mind but nothing is still concrete.

Okay, here are the options that Im interested in: 

-Physical Therapist Assistant ( It sounds interesting but I dont know, if they would even hire someone with just an associate’s degree) 

-Administrative Assistant ( I like this because its general and can be applied to any job, Ive heard its under pressure)

-Vet technician ( I really do love animals, but Ive heard its underpaid )

374,"this is a lot so strap in guys

I'm a fresh 20 year old going through a whole fresh wad of bs.
To lay down the foundation, my dad is a piece of shit. He had kids in the hopes of one of us becoming successful and taking care of him. We have never gotten along since he's shown to me that he's really nothing but a manipulator. 

Two years ago, I was in a car accident where I wasn't at fault, got my car totaled, and was compensated. Now, this is where my dad stepped in. He and I got together and mutually agreed to get a car new from a dealership. We would split the monthly car bill and insurance bill. Roughly $400 for the both of us. 
Now, two years later, when my dad found out how much I made last year (a whopping 11k lmao) He jumps to the conclusion that I'm making too much money and that I need to take care of the car and insurance payments. On top of that, he threatens daily to start charging me rent (even though we came to the conclusion that he wouldn't do that if i was going to school which I am)
I'm already struggling financially enough as it is (ive been paying it off myself this whole time while only working part time because of school) and with rent being added on top I'll have to quit school or go part time to be able to afford it.
I'm not happy at home, my older brother got a dog and decided not to take care of it (every dog he's had has died or ran away, or neglected) and now I'm taking care of it since I didn't want it to share the same fate. I have my mom who I've moved out with for a period of time who emotionally abused me the entire time. And I have my dad here who has physically assaulted me, emotionally abused me, and still threatens to ever since I came out to him as trans. 

Now here's where I am. I don't know what to do, if I didn't have that car I would move out in a heart beat. I have friends who out of the kindness of their heart would let me move in and not charge me rent so I would be able to afford paying off my car. 
If there was a way I would be able to let go of my car, that would be the first thing that I'd do but I'm not sure. I'm just tired and scared. ",23Apr2018,1

I've been worried about graduating for years and have been trying to find ways to deal with it, but I'm still having a hard time with it all. I chose a big SEC school with so much to do, in a crazy awesome college town, and I'm so incredibly sad to think that I have formed a new life here and a new identity. I can't yet think of myself as anything other than a student here.

I can't seem to shake the fact that my friends are moving away, I have to assume the role of someone else and can't just leave the future as it is- the future. My future is now and I'm not ready. I don't love my career options because what I thought I wanted to do with my major turned about to be something I'm not interested in anymore.

My girlfriend understands the issue, but is upset that I don't put a lot of food into my system. It seems that I will feel super hungry, and then after only eating a couple of bites I can no longer eat. I just feel so full.

One person claimed my stomach had shrank, and fills much quicker than it used to... IDK if this is fact or just some bull, but I would like to hear everyone's input. 

The biggest issue is really just filling up very easiliy. I don't really snack often, and during a meal I'll only eat very small portions. I've also been having issues with sharp pains in my stomach, and my girlfriend is concerned. They don't usually last long, but they are definitely prominent.

397,"I matched with this girl on Tinder in February and talked with her for a couple weeks before meeting up. I always thought she was cute as hell and really nice but girls make me nervous and it’d been a while since I’d had sex due to some body issues I developed with an illness. Basically I was scared to meet her. 

I finally did and we slept together that first night. We honestly had an amazing time. I had told her before we even met that I wasn’t looking for anything serious because I’m dealing with a lot of trauma and emotionally not really capable of a healthy relationship. But we had a really great time and saw each other a couple more times, we were texting constantly. I was starting to have feelings for her. 

Then in late March, I got sick. The illness I mentioned is an autoimmune disease that comes and goes in flares and I got a really bad one. I was bedbound completely for 2 weeks and have since been recovering. Week 3 my movements were still minimal but last week I started going to class again. 

So I haven’t been able to see her in a month but we’ve still been texting. And one night I proposed we chill. She proposed instead we go on a date. I said yes because I’ve been thinking about her a lot. We set the day for Wednesday and she even requested a specific Korean BBQ restaurant. We then had an entire conversation about our feelings. 

And then she just... forgot. Not about the conversation, only specifically about the date part. 

And not like momentarily forgot. We were texting and she mentioned something about cooking dinner for me soon since I’ve lost a lot of weight and muscle. I said we’re going to dinner on Wednesday. And she had no recollection, even after me reminding her she was still confused. I had to go back and get screenshots. 

It just felt like a punch in the gut. I had been so excited about the date and talking almost excessively to all my friends about it. And she clearly was not because she didnt remember. 

But I told her it was kind of hurtful and she’s been extremely apologetic, assuring me she really likes me and adamant to reschedule. I told her I need some space because I was actually really upset. 

I just can’t tell if I’m unreasonably mad or if it is an insulting thing? I know I’m in a really fragile and bad state of mind right now. This past month has been horrible. I have PTSD I’m dealing with from hospital and aside from the pain and exhaustion of being ill I’ve dealt with flashbacks, panic attacks, and nightmares left and right. I also don’t enjoy needing as much support from my family and friends and have been feeling like a huge burden / really unwanted. I know objectively everyone who loves me is trying to help but I still feel like everyone hates me for it. I don’t know if I’m thinking straight and I wanna just break things off with this girl but if I’m being crazy I don’t wanna be rash and then hugely regret this in a couple weeks when I’m more stable. 

(Edit add: I also am aware that just because I’m in a bad state of mind doesn’t mean I’m necessarily being crazy, and I guess that’s why I’m asking objective third parties for advice.)

399,"I want to start off by saying that this isn't a pity post or anything like that, I know what I did is reprehensible and will live with that forever.

Background:
I groped a girl I woke up next to at a friend's house after a night of partying. She woke up quickly and said for me to stop, so I played dead and rolled over as if I were asleep. I have assumed for the past 5 years that this girl has been living with whatever emotional damage I did to her in total silence (she is best friends with my then date and now fiancee, so I assumed she was keeping quiet for their friendship's sake or something along those lines). 

Today I woke up feeling guilty enough to go ahead and message this girl an apology letter which I had been meaning to do for some time but never did for one reason or another (scared to).

I get a call about 3 hours later from her (the victim's) friend saying that I need to tell her what happened, so I do. As it turns out, this girl knew nothing of what I'd done and had forgotten it all due to being inebriated at the time. So I have effectively shown this person a terrible life moment that they didn't even know existed.

There is this girl really like and have liked for a little less than a year. The rational part of my brain is telling me to stop liking her but it isn't as simple as this. It has been getting in the way of me doing my work because I can only think of her. To make matters worse she is now dating someone and I am jealous for some reason. I really don't want to be but I don't know how to stop it. All of this has caused me a lot of stress and makes it hard to focus in school. Any advice for getting over the crush? I know that it isn't rational I haven't figured out how to get over it.,23Apr2018,4
402,"So yeah, about 4 months ago me and my STBX broken up, she wanted the divorce, stormed out with 8 months old baby (just turned one two days ago). Divorce is not finalized, proceedings were started recently, just saying beforehand. 

She was the only person I have ever dated (right after high school), first and only person I kissed and slept with obviously. I have never imagined myself with anybody else until two days ago. 

I got this lady friend from work who is pretty hot, social, makes me laugh etc. We started to spend sometime with each other about 3 weeks ago, went out drinking, took long hikes, took a road trip and spent sometime at the beach etc. We didn't share any romantic moments, I didn't stare at her for 10 minutes like in movies. She is way out of my league by the way (I have been diagnosed with alopecia and shaved my head completely, and lost my eyebrows etc.) What I mean is, I am not the best looking person in the room. 

When we spend time with each other, I feel like she is getting bored quickly, me as well having hard time  to start up a conversation for no reason. I am not even nervous, extremely chilled, I just can't find something in common to talk about. She asks questions about our breakup and asks for updates frequently. I took her to some hidden places around our town. Like, today I took her to a hidden beach where you can only go by sea etc. We were alone, smoke couple joints, drank some wine, listened music, played football (soccer) etc. Today was a blast, and she also thanked me like 5 times for everything. 

Disturbing thing is, she is being extremely cautious about being around me. I am not talking about sharing a blanket or hold each other at cold weather. Even sitting at beach with our foldable chairs, she is constantly moving away like I am potential rapist or something (obviously it's not what she thinks, just trying to draw a picture). Even we were about to board the small boat, she refused my help which I only offered my hand so she could keep her balance and fall down. It's not like she denies it in a bad way, she always says ""Oh I'm cool thanks"". 

Now I am thinking, this situation is getting on my nerves. Cause obviously, she is not interested in me, not that I would want it at the moment, considering divorce is not finalized, I am really depressed cause I can't see my son properly due to my wife being extremely hurtful about this whole process. Additionally, my lady friend is being extremely cautious about not sending wrong signals. 

I am extremely bored, I go to work 9-18, I am at home by 18.30 at latest. Obviously, I call my friends, see who is up for something for the night. Which is usually a no go because they are all married now. And only person I can call is this girl. She is single, no boyfriend or anything. But when she talks about boys at work, I get super jealous. I don't know why, I have no idea. Which is also another annoying bit about this situation. 

I admit that I want someone's attention, cause my wife stopped doing that for about 5 years ago. I am not blaming her, we were 18 when we started dating. We got sick of each other. I am not even mad at her for leaving, it was the right thing do, for both of us. But I am guessing I want someone in my life, but not like this. I want this person to be mine, I want to hold hands, do all that romantic stuff I couldn't do properly. 

My question is about the idea I just came up with. I am going to talk to this lady friend at work, and tell her that I want to stop spending time together, due to above all reasons. She has no interest in me, I even doubt she wants to spend time with me actually. Cause I just figured out that, it's me asking her constantly to go out and do stuff together. I don't remember the last time she asked for it. Anyway, I don't know it's a bad idea. While I fantasize about all different things about her/with her, it seems kinda unfair to her. Also, when she talks about other men (in a sexual/romantic way) I get super jealous. Why would I torture myself with this, if I don't go out with her, I wouldn't have to listen this stuff as well. 

I don't know if I were able to explain this whole situation, but any help or tip would be appreciated.

404,"My partner and I are looking to get a dog together, come June. The dog would be a shared responsibility (financial and other). We have been together for roughly a year and a half and have every intention of getting engaged, though we will not be ready for that for another year or two. We are both mid-20's (24 and 25) and have been living together officially since November/just signed another lease together. 

Getting the dog itself has been a well thought-out decision. We have actually held off for a few months to make sure everything was in order. We can easily afford the dog/all necessary care, I am a PhD student and have some time to get us all adjusted to dog ownership over the summer, my boyfriend works from home frequently, we just got a large apartment, and our relationship is quite stable. My concern is about getting the dog before we are engaged or married. Like I said, we have every intention of getting married, but it's not a guarantee at this point. I'm just worried about what would happen if we had to part ways. Are we jumping into something that we should hold off on for a few more years?

Any perspective on this situation or advice from someone who has been in a similar position would be appreciated. Thank you so much!

406,"Just to preface: I’m using a throwaway because I don’t want this tied to my main account.

I’m a current federal employee at the GL-7 pay grade with the Bureau of Prisons. I decided recently that I wanted to move closer to my family and threw in a bunch of applications for transfers and other federal jobs in the area. I was picked up for a transfer at two different places, but the first one to pick me up neglected to tell me that they had picked me up so when the second location went to pick me up the first one told them it was too late. The BOP is hurting for people in a lot of prisons and frankly they need me.

I was just offered a job with the Citizenship and Immigration Services. The pay they’re offering me is a lot lower than what I make now and I’d go down to the GS-5 level. However, I haven’t argued for a higher pay yet because I only got the email, I plan on discussing with them the starting pay. If the pay discrepancy is too high, I’ll turn down the job. If they closer, I’m really thinking about accepting the offer.

I really don’t know what to do. The job with USCIS has a non-competitive promotion to the GS-9 level. While my current job is currently at the max level and I need to be promoted to the GS-8 level. Even get promoted is a pain as I would need to continuously get promoted to move up with the BOP. In USCIS I would only need to get promoted once to reach the GS-12 level non-competitively. For comparison, a GS-12 in the BOP is a Captain and that would be the Department Head of Custody. GS-12 in USCIS isn’t even a supervisor.

While the pay is higher in the USCIS, the retirement is better in the BOP. I can retire as soon as I turn 50 and forced to retire at 57. USCIS’ retirement would see me working far longer and I wouldn’t be able to apply for other federal law enforcement jobs after 37. 

I never wanted the job title I have now. I never wanted to work in a prison. I had a dream of working in law enforcement, but never wanted to work federally, but things happen and you kind of have to roll with the punches. As long as I work federally, I don’t have to worry about my medical condition so it’s just how my life went.

I kind of find myself not wanting to leave my job. I don’t want to burn my bridge with the BOP. I just promised to come out to a new institution. I don’t want to be a flake especially if I don’t pass the five week academy for USCIS and I have to go back. I don’t have a degree so I’m limited in what I do. If I leave it might be better in the long run, but I might be fine where I am. 

I also have to take in consideration of the current administration, but that’ll change a lot by the end of the year and we might see someone different in 2 years.

Both of these jobs are in the same area. BOP could possibly make my life easier when it comes to living for the benefits they have while the USCIS would be harder to live in the area especially if I lose money.

My freshman year of high school, I met him on Instagram, because I found his art account. I was blown away with his art... And his personality, so I messaged him first. I got to know this guy, and he was the most nicest dude ever. Then, I started to catch feelings for him. It was different than any other bland crush I had in the past, but he was different. He felt different. At around this time, I never had a relationship before, and I've never been kissed. I've had tons of crushes, but they all had rejected me in some way. I was bullied for being ugly and weird, and I felt like this guy was my escape from all that. We had most in common, and he was cute and so kind. I started to develop feelings for him as months past, and he just stopped talking to me for the longest period, after we were starting to become friends. (At this point, I was very upset, and I felt like he hated me. And other shit went down.) A few months have passed, and we started talking again. We were just friends and making jokes and talking about things, but my sophomore year and my birthday hit around, and I kinda found out that he was dating someone else right when I was about to tell him how I felt (again). It did break my heart for the longest time, and I felt so stupid. Two more years past into now... He's changed over the years (of course, that's what people do.) And he's in college, and I'm a senior in high school. And I have came to the thought that I've always had those ""feelings"" towards him. Like, I care and love him so much. I've never had a friend like him before. But with the way that he talks to me or approches me isn't really kind. I've been understanding to him, and I give him space and make him feel worthy, but if I'm ever in need... Or if I'm having a hard time, the way that he's here for me isn't enough as much as I give him. He barely talks to me, but when he isn't busy with stuff... Instead of helping or being there for me, he is usually on Twitter, talking to other dudes. Sometimes, I get the impression that he doesn't want me in his life or if I'm annoying. I usually give him some space because of college, too. But I'm in a dilemma where those feelings are still lingering, but not. Like, I don't have a crush on him, but those feelings are still there. I want to get rid of them so bad, because I hate it so much. I mean, of course he doesn't like me like that; he never has. Why do I need to keep feelings for a person who doesn't give me the same respect back. I know I can't control anybody. I know, but it's so difficult to communicate with him. He won't talk to me, and I've given up and chased back far too many times, and I want to end this cyclical repetition of it. The problem is that he's the only person I got right now, and I talk to him about almost everything. I just don't want those feelings screwing it up, but I also don't need to talk to people who treat me unfairly. I don't know what else to do, and it's making me hate talking to him.

So I nicely and publicly responded to his Facebook post saying that he did receive pay and that I was sorry they didn't  enjoy their time here and, if they would've spoken to me about it, I would've done anything I could to change it. They got a little nasty so I posted a screenshot of Venmo and when I sent them money.

I feel like an idiot, like I let it get under my skin, that I was unprofessional. On the other hand, someone was running around lying. I didn't like how they passive aggressively dealt with it, and instead of people whispering, which they were, I tried to nip it in the bud and go to the source. I also FB messaged him to talk about it and was very nice. So how come I feel taken advantage of, immature, and betrayed all at the same time? I am of several minds about this and would love to hear people's thoughts!",23Apr2018,5

418,"Hey guys- 
I’ll be graduating from college in two weeks and have two paths before time that will drastically change my life, my mind changes near daily on which of the two choices I’ll be going for and it’s been very difficult thinking about what will come.
1. I have a girlfriend who is a PA and has to stay in our college town for 2 years before she can be transferred somewhere (she said after two years I can decide where we go). She’s great and has been in love with me since the beginning. I have grown in feelings for her but I am not, nor do I know if I will get to her level of feelings (with her). If I were to stay I would apply and work here as a police officer to begin with. I’ve been interning with my city’s law enforcement division and have met some awesome guys who all want me to stay and work here. The city is a a semi small city 100,000+pop that is only growing and getting better. I wouldn’t mind staying but one of the factors that holds me back is what I could lose out on with option 2.
2. My uncle, aunt and their two kids and I are very close, they are soon moving to the Bay Area (Cali) and told me that if I went I could stay with them paying less than your typical rent while applying for local law enforcement work over there. The idea of California and being somewhere new after 4 years of school is very appealing, I see it as a place of endless opportunities, whereas Texas would be a safe known of what there is to come. 

I don’t think my current girlfriend is the one, but things can change? If I stay she wants us to move in together, which frankly I’m not opposed to. I’m at a key point in my life and I just don’t know what to choose. I wish I could go full Mr. Nobody and see what would happen.

420,"I'm a person who people seem to perceive as timid, innocent, or maybe awkward. People I'm not close with apologize after using vulgarities around me, occasionally tease or make fun of me, and sometimes to expect me to be afraid of breaking rules or doing ""bad"" things. Unfortunately, the way people perceive me is completely different from my true self; I'm not afraid of ""dangerous"" things, as I have an anxiety disorder and my brain thinks asking for money to go to the movies is dangerous, not snorting Comet (Thank the lord for impulse control). I don't respect authority and can't help myself from thinking ""fuck you, pig"" when I see a fat cop. I use the word ""fuck"" as liberally as I please, meaning quite fucking often. To get to the point here, I'd like some advice on reflecting the cool, cold person I am inside. How can I influence the way others perceive me? ",23Apr2018,3
422,"Sorry if this gets a little long. My SO and I decided about six months ago to move to our ideal location on the coast. He makes about double what I do so the plan was for him to find a job first and I would try too but he could support us both while I looked locally once we moved.

Totally unexpectedly I got a job really quickly. It pays pretty well but would have a 30-1 hr commute and require a good amount of overtime. I would need to start in a few weeks which means us giving our notice at work this coming week. 

He doesn’t feel comfortable quitting when he hasn’t even started job hunting or reaching out to recruiters yet. Seeing as he makes so much more money it makes sense for him to be a bit more secure in the job search than he is now. So as it stands we have two choices. I take the job and move ahead of time from him. He would job hunt and move in a month. Or we go back to the original plan and I don’t take the job and wait on him to find one. 

It may seem like a no brainer to just take the job but it’s hard. For one, it’s not my dream job. I worry about the commute and the long hours and how it would impact our way of life. Also I would be so lonely going without him and it would be a lot to do everything alone with everything being so new. On the other hand, if I don’t take this job then who knows how long it would be before I found something that paid well and then I may still have to commute. I also don’t want to be so dependent on my SO and make him feel pressured. 

I guess I’m just trying to get some perspective on what makes the most sense. Has anyone else done this before? How did it turn out? Any words of wisdom would really help. ",23Apr2018,1
423,"Hello friends, thanks for stopping by. 

About four years ago, as I was backpacking Europe, my earbuds died. That's fine. I was expecting that. So I switched to my backup pair, which were much more expensive. Flash forward 3 days, and they stop working. So I buy a random pair of headphones in Paris. Those break 5 days later on my flight home. I buy a pair of headphones in the Toronto airport on my layover. Those break immediately. 

Every month or so now since then, and sometimes at intervals of days, another pair of headphones die. Usually, it's just one or both of the earbuds that just stops working. Like completely dead. Sometimes, the headphones just randomly pause and unease the music, or just skip the music ahead really fast. 

I have tried every DIY method available online to fix these issues. I've constantly untangled my headphones, I've made my volume limit a quarter of what my iPod is capable of doing (yes, I still use an iPod touch). I've done the thing where you put tape over the headphone jack and stick the headphone thing in that way. I clean the actual earbuds weekly for earwax; I clean out the jack for lint. Nothing works. 

I did have a situation immediately after I returned from Europe where my iPod was pausing and unpausing randomly, and there ended up being an actual and physical issue with the headphone jack (side note: the apple store hates me. I keep getting free iPods because I have a good streak going where I keep getting iPods with factory errors). I thought all my problems would be solved with the new iPod, but, alas, the problem remained, and here we are. 

Granted, I do buy cheaper earbuds, but that's mostly because I don't see a point in buying nice earbuds if they're just going to die a slow and painful death. I do have a pair of Beats over the ear headphones that I use at my laptop, but they're too big for me to use when I go outside (which is often), and they push my glasses against my head which is very, very painful. 

It's getting very frustrating for me. I have a high tolerance level for BS (which is why I've put up with it for 4 years), but this is getting ridiculous. If anyone has any information that could help me (besides moving my music to my phone; I have my reasons as to why I've never done that) please, please help me. ",23Apr2018,6
424,"Context is I’m an 18 year old finishing up my senior year in high school, she is as well.

I can’t stop thinking about this girl. She is so perfect: her beauty, million dollar smile, friendly demeanor, everything. And she’s into the same weeb shit I’m into. When she says hi to me my heart sinks, I feel touched by an angel. She gives me hope. It’s a bittersweet feeling, as I can’t concentrate because she has occupied my mind. When I’m not around her I feel awful, and when I do, and I’m not talking to her, I feel weak. I want to talk to her so bad but I can’t do anything if I'm not in class. I don’t know what to do. I’m embarrassed typing this out because I know I sound obsessed, beta, and unmanly. My only opportunity to talk to her more privately is before class which she sometimes comes. Since I noticed this I always show up ten minutes early and stay, whether she’s there or not. I wish I could just stop thinking about her but I can’t.

I need help. Not on how to get her, but on how to release my mind from being a prisoner to lust and desire. I can’t live a normal life if the only thing I associate with happiness is being around a woman. I’m sorry you had to read that beginning part as I’m sure it was very cringe inducing, but those are my thoughts. I’ve been unhappy for a very long time, so those few moments with her that give me hope inspire me, but my behavior and thought process as shown above is self-destructive. I’ve been reading books about charisma, inner peace, and concentration but I am still too weak.

425,"Hey!

I should give you a little background info on myself before I continue,

I'm 15 &amp; I've never had a relationship.

Alright let's go
I'm a pretty old fashioned guy when it comes to anything teenagers are notorious for, I don't like drinking, going out to parties or anything of the sort and I don't expect myself to later, either. I'm not asexual, but I really struggle to like anyone. I have really strict standards that I can't realistically expect anyone to meet, and I'm fine with that. I'll list a few for your amusement,
I can't stand the thought of a girl being with another guy, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to mentally cope with that, and I'm pretty off about drinking &amp; parties, too. It's really soul crushing and I know it's an uncommon thing, I'm not sure if I'm fine how I am or if I'm holding on too tightly to expectations I had as a kid but I'm fearful of never meeting someone who I could be happy with. 

Another issue I'll try cover while I'm here is my fear of sexual abuse, and other related things. I'm scared that if I somehow found the perfect girl, innocent and happy, that someday some messed up scumbag might come along and abuse her, even in the slightest way, and like before, I don't think I'd be able to cope.

Just before I wait for the stupid replies I get, and cherish the fact I'm on a throwaway, I'd like to say that anything mentioned does not define fully who I am and I probably seem like a guy who sees girls as objects (or a ""niceguy"") but the above mentioned things are my problems, I'm cool with most things personality wise, I just need some thought &amp; advice on what direction I should continue in. 

Thank you so much.",23Apr2018,2

427,"Hi there,

I took a quarter long ceramics class at a college near by, and I was told the final day to pick up the work is 4/21. I came by on 4/20 and turns out they already threw all the pottery away in the dumpster. (I went looking and found them shattered in a giant dumpster out back).

My teacher understands it is wrong and wants me to talk with the head of the department. 

We then received a student-wide email from the head of the department apologizing for the error on their end. 

I reached out asking for a class next quarter fully covered so that I can make up my work, and she replied saying she can do 50% off. Should I accept that offer or should I negotiate for less?  If so, how should I communicate this? I lost about 14 pieces of work that I spent a ton of time on. 

Please advise, anything is appreciated!

I call for my dog and not a second before i finish saying its name , i had a green very powerful laser shone at my eyes, hovered over my left eye and my vision starts going grey

I got really scared and quite unnerved.it was like being shined blind by a black and white tv.


Today i went to my gp since the vision on that eye isnt getting better. I have a referral from my GP to an ophtamologist. The only thing my doctor said is that my left eye didnt pass any of her eye tests and that i [should ask whoever is shining a laser into my eyes to stop, no more] as she gave me my referral.

444,"Hi, not sure if this is the right thread or if there is a school advice thread, but I need help. 
I have an overdue assignment to make up in English, i missed when we did it in class two Thursdays ago. The assignment is a standardized testing practice test. My teacher put the link to take the test and a separate link for where we are supposed to type the answers on google classroom. 

Not to get dramatic I’ve had a rough year due to anxiety/ assault / home problems, and thankfully my teacher has been pretty lenient with me if I miss a class and have a late assignment, but 90% of the time I do the work well and turn in assignments on time. I had already approached her last week acknowledging I need to turn it in and apologizing for not having it done, but I also work and it’s been hard for me to be able to sit down and do it. She said she understood and to just get it in to her. 

So now I am home and I can sit down and do this assignment, I click on the link posted but it takes you to a website with few options. The option to take the practice test takes you to a screen where you need to enter a session ID and user name / password, I don’t have any of those.. however on the website there’s another link, it’s a 40 + pg. google doc of the “locked” test *with all of the answers*... So, I could just copy the answers and turn it in to her, but I’m afraid she will wonder how I got in to the test without the session ID. I just want to get this assignment done and in to her because I’m sure it must be annoying by now, but I worry taking the “easy way out” could get me in serious trouble. 

Do I send her a email asking if I’m able to take the test at home? Should I even mention the answer key? I could do this but I don’t want to make it worse because it’s already so late, and if I do have to take it in school it only makes it a day later than it already is. I saw the first few answers but I honestly don’t even remember them... what should I do here? ",23Apr2018,1
