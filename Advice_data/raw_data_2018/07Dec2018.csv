0,"Greetings fellow reddit users. I've fallen into depresion latelly and let me tell you my story. I was a kid, born and raised by a single mother. I have an older sister. My mom was abused my our father when I was 2 years old and she decided to leave, leaving all her belongings there (she took ours). We didn't have any place to stay, nothing. My grandma offered us a place to stay untill we can find something. Mom got a ""town flat"" how we call it out there from some single mother helpers. We were living there (as I thought) peacefuly. I've always had what I wanted (most of the time at least) and I was a happy little child. I didn't have any father to take from, so I suffered as a kid for being girly (living with mom, older sister and grandma was the cause of this probably) and I once rebelled real hard because I wanted to be a man. My mother again stepped in and learned me the ways of being a man. I was 18 years old when due to my older sister's mistake we lost our home. Mom had to sell it in order to save my sister from being in a real bad situation. My sister never thanked my mother and later on got my mom to more trouble than before, leaving both me and my mom behind and going on her way. My mom stepped out again and got us a nice flat. The problem is, as I was 20 years old I was told everything wasn't as nice as it seemed. She was working 3 jobs at once to keep us alive and fulfill our desires. She had to borrow alot of money to make it so we can have a proper life. Sister left when I was 19 with a pure sheet. But I didn't want to. My mom was 2.5 milion czech crown in debt (roughly 120.000,- USD) as I soon realised and was in a bad situation with depressions, having a constant mental issues and such. This is the time I stepped in, left my collage and started my own business. First I got OUR debt to 140.000,- USD and I was crying day and night what a mistake I made. My business started working and I slowly started to repay the debt (leaving only 40.000,- remaining). 3 months ago we were kicked out of our beloved flat. I asked my mom what would her wish be and she said she always wanted a house. I quickly reacted and got a mortgage so I can build her one and everything was going smoothly from then. We are 3 months into building her house and this is where it all starts. My business has started stagnating, I can't get enough money monthly to pay everything we need, my girlfriend is abusing me how I got a mortgage to build a house for my mother, who ruined my life as she said and my mom is getting depressions again due to lack of money. I am getting into depressions latelly too, mostly due to these 3 factors of having a lack of money, my girlfriend abusing me that we won't ever have a house, because I used all my finances to build one for my mum and my mum is in depressions again due to the lack of money. As I am only 22 years old, I do not have much life experience and I seriously don't know what to do. I started feeling really down, can't work properly, can't do anything properly beside crying my heart out. Does anyone know what could help me to get out of this?",07Dec2018,1
1,"I've recently moved.  I moved about 2 hours away from everything I've ever known.  I did it for a job opportunity and it pays well with benefits and that good stuff.  What's getting me is seeing my SO of eight years maybe twice a week,  my father with failing health,  and my cats and dog so seldom.  I want to make this work but I can't help but feel the loneliness.  I drive to work every morning,  get there,  even though I'm still training hate the job,  leave,  go home shower eat food then sleep.  Repeat.  I've resorted to drinking alone about 8 drinks per night before bed.  I am 26 male.  I'm starting a career but losing everything I've ever cherished to be what I called 'life'.

2,"I want to start off by saying I have very severe GAD and it's been bad enough in the past that I've been placed on disability. I also suffer from depression that I medicate for. 
    This year has been a struggle. Ive been trying to repair myself as I struggle ahead, and it's led to alot of difficult choices and changes. 
    My parents have known about my struggle most of the way, stopping to offer wisdom and understanding and I felt very touched by their meaningful advice. I asked them for a loan of 500 dollars to be able to get into a new apartment. We debated for a week over it. They sent me 50. I was grateful.

I thought that was fine. I'm a hardworking guy, I just have had my shortcomings. My parents continued to offer advice on my struggle and I sat hoping they maybe would be able to help me some more further on down the road.
          This december they sent me a christmas present. I opened it expecting it to be candy and a check for groceries, that's what it usually is.

    Inside was an omega seamaster professional.

My dad brought it home with him from deployment and gifted it to me. (This adds to the dilemma of selling/ not selling, because while it breaks my heart to part with such a powerful gift,, I havent taken my wife out somewhere nice in like a year). I wanted to provide for her a little bit.
This watch sells for thousands online, and my heart jumped. I faced the moral dillema of selling a gift, but I wanted to be able to provide for my household for a while so I decided I would. 

The watch was a fucking very very clever fake. 


Now I'm sitting here in another dillema. Do I tell my parents that I tried to hawk the watch and it was fake? They might have spent alot of money on it. Was this some test of willpower with a slap on the face at the end? Did they send me a fake watch on purpose or did someone rip off my dad? Do i keep this a secret forever and keep this watch as a keepsake? Am I a horrible person for hoping and wishing my parents would have sent some assistance to me because I'm struggling so badly and being angry because they sent me some luxury item? I have a violent mix of emotions inside me and I'm having a hard time feeling grateful. I had some great plans as to where her and I would be going and the buyer I had had it examined and brought me the news. I don't even know what to do now.",07Dec2018,1
5,I’m a university student. Basically in the spring I started taking Xanax frequently. I used it as a mechanism to cope with depression and insomnia. I used to be a great student and was in school on a scholarship. I could have enrolled again in the fall but I was still using and was having panic attacks at the thought of returning. Since then I’ve gotten clean all on my own but my parents have no idea what has happened. I just got a call from the university asking about receiving a tuition check from my parents and what they should do with it. I want to go back and graduate but I don’t know where to start. Whenever I think about telling them I freak out and feel thorough shame. Please if anyone has had a similar experience please help. ,07Dec2018,1
6,"Hi! 

Before I describe my problem I need to tell you a bit about myself:

I'm a 19 year old Girl from Germany, so English isn't my native language. So please excuse any mistakes I probably made.
I always had a wide variety of hobbies and interests, some of which are more ""girly"" like doing my make up or writing and some of which aren't as stereotypical like gaming or anything that has to do with horror, gore and creepy things. 
Therefore I have always got along with girls and boys as well. But even though I share many interests with guys I never had a relationship before.

Now, I don't view myself as good-looking or pretty really, on a scale from one to ten I'd say I'm a 5 on most days, a 4 if I stayed up all night or if I'm sick or something.
Because of me being that average looking I lately thought about that I could be to picky.
There were some guys that told me that they were interested in me, but that I turned down because I didn't felt the same and saw most of them as good friends.

Now, the thing is that I didn't think they were ugly or uglier than me or something - I just wasn't attracted to them and I feel like it's wrong to start a relationship with someone you're not physically or mentally attracted to.

I just don't know if this mindset is wrong and I should give them a chance and maybe I get attracted to them after we've been together but since I also viewed them as friends and wasn't attracted to them mentally I am not sure.

Since there were instances where guys seemed not (physically) attractive to me at first sight but after I got to know them and their character I fell for them and then all of them seemed attractive to me, even things I might have seen as unattractive at first.

I am just confused - is it right to not have a relationship with someone I'm not attracted to in any way or am I just too picky?
If so, how can I change that? ",07Dec2018,1
7,"So yea like the title says my friends put me on with this girl and when we were in lunch it was me, the girl and the two friends and I tell her “oh they was jus joking” and she says “oh so you think I’m ugly ?” And then I said “nah it’s not that but they was jus joking about that” and then she told my friends I never hit her up and that I already had her number and then my two friends gassed it to the max and then I said “I don’t think I got your number” and then she said “ yea you do from when we played 8 ball” and I thought about it for a sec and was like “oh yea “ and then my friends said why didnt I txt her and then before she left she said “text me later” but yea how can I fix this, I don’t stumble over my words just get nervous and red, I couldn’t even eat lunch ",07Dec2018,1
8,"I’ve gotten myself into an unfamiliar pickle that I don’t know how to get out of so here I am! 

Please don’t rip me a new one, I didn’t see this coming. To make a long story short, I don’t know how to let this guy down gently and I think he’s moving too fast and likes me more than I like him. 

Backstory: I’m 18, almost 19, and making my way back into the dating scene after almost a year. The last person I dated was a woman, and I’ve been talking to a guy. I haven’t dated a guy since 2015. So we’ve been talking, and hung out for the first time yesterday. I didn’t say I was completely against a relationship, but I didn’t say I was looking for one. I was open minded to relationship eventually, if it felt right. 

It’s been casual, talking about school, work, music, and hobbies. We got some pizza and went to his house to watch a movie. I ended up almost falling asleep and we decided to nap. We cuddled, and ended up making out. I honestly actually wanted to sleep though cause I’m sick so we ended up napping. 

After we kissed, I find out he’s never even kissed anyone (I kind of had a feeling before he told me) and I think he got extremely attached. 

Since hanging out, I don’t think we’re compatible for a relationship because I’m extremely centered around my own habits, and they’re different from his. I can see us being good friends, but I’m not compatible with many people because I’m on a different page than most people my age. I don’t know how to as gently as possible tell him I don’t know how I feel. I know he wants to have sex because he said so... I don’t want to.

He’s just saying a lot of things that make me feel like he’s extremely into me... almost a little too much? Insists on cooking for me which is SO sweet but it’s really soon! We’ve been talking like a week tops. He also insists on driving next time we hang out, even though he’s 40 minutes away and we’d be at his house. I don’t wanna let this guy do too much for because it doesn’t feel right. 

He’s talking about giving up drinking for me literally just because I don’t drink. Like I had no idea he felt this serious about me and I’ve never been in this kind of situation before. 

I’ve been as open as possible about my intentions. I told him I take things day by day as a way of being mindful and present and don’t have expectations for the future, but I feel perhaps I need to be more explicit. ",07Dec2018,1
9,"It sucks so bad we're work together! We seem to have a lot in common. I think he is super cute, he's cute and nerdy but built kind of like a 6'3 teddy bear. We both get all smiley around each other, and we make our a point to talk every day at work even though our job tasks don't overlap, so I'm pretty sure he is into me too. 

He is single (I think for a while now, he's a little socially awkward but really a great guy with an awesome sense of humor and sweet personality). I just broke up with my boyfriend last week too so I don't want to jump into anything. 

But idk how long I can have self control either! I've thought he was cool for a while just had a boyfriend and I wouldn't break up with someone for someone else, even if it wasn't forbidden aka at work. 

What should I do/ how should I cope with these feelings??? I'm a mess.....",07Dec2018,1

12,"Hey all, for some context, I am a senior and only started wrestling this year. I am relatively built for my age and my other sport is rugby. I decided to pick up wrestling because this was my last year and I wanted to give it a go. I just had my first novice wrestling tournament, and I got silver medal (First match was 12-0, second was 6-0, third was 15-10, and last was 0-12). Every match I won, I would get off the mat and the coach would only focus on my mistakes, and to be fair, I made a lot of them. I understand that I must grow to be able to compete against open wrestlers and I always strive to be better than I was yesterday. I know that wrestling is a very tough and physically demanding. But I wished he would at least say something like ""good effort"", or ""not bad"". My final fight for gold was the worst. He ripped me a new one and made me feel like shit for getting silver. He even told everyone I got lucky for having bad opponents. I don't expect him to give a spontaneous compliment, but I wished he would acknowledge that I gave it my all. In between matches, when the whole team was together, he would point out my mistakes and embarrass me in front of my peers. Though everyone else on the team said I did well, they didn't have any value to me because none of the compliments were from the coach. I felt horrible the rest of the day. The next day, we had practice. And when he saw me he would point out my poor performance from the other day in front of my peers. Practice was brutal, but I kept up with the pace (kinda). When I got home, I just broke down and cried. I don't know if I am super sensitive to criticism, or he's being too hard on me. When I was observing how he treated other wrestlers, he seemed to always back up his criticisms with something positive. I can't recall if he did that for me. But if he did, it was seldom. On another note, he doesn't even remember my name. He calls me by this other guy that graduated years ago, but because I look like him physically, he refers to me as him. He remembers everyone else's name but cannot remember mine. Maybe I'm taking his criticisms too personally, but I can't tell. I do my best to see the best in people, but I'm having a hard time with my coach. Am I being too sensitive or is he pushing me too hard? Do you guys have any advice for me with this situation? I don't want to quit the wrestling team because I genuinely enjoy improving and pushing myself. But I feel like I'm always on the edge of crying every time he criticizes me, embarrasses me or call me by someone else's name.",07Dec2018,1
13,"We both knew it was coming, and I was the one who ended it even though we both didn't want to. I had to because all we did was fight near the end, he wasn't financially or mentally stable and stopped putting effort in. I started fights because he lacked in other areas. I asked him a day later to ""casually date"" instead but realized it was just covering up the problems. So we cut it off officially. Now I am a wreck because I miss him and truly did not want to end things. We promised to come back in a couple of months after we were both stable and try things again.

14,"There's a guy who's a regular at the coffee shop I go to regularly, I've only noticed him fairly recently as prior I'd been sitting downstairs to people-watch while he sits upstairs on the bigger table to work on his laptop.

He's noticed me...but it might be only because he's noticed me noticing him, you know?

He looks at me from time to time, but can't tell if it's as he's interested or thinks I'm a creepy weirdo - I'm terrible socially, I'm especially bad at appropriate eye contact and often make too much eye contact, or grimace when I think I'm smiling.

I've seen him a few times outside the coffee shop (typically after, as I leave before him then run errands): in a store, I maybe saw him near my metro stop, walking past him in town (took me by surprise, he didn't look back at me - *do guys look back when interested?*), on the metro (he got off the stop before me, looked for me as I went by on the metro), also today I walked past him and I panicked so scurried into the mall (he looked back).

I'm just trying to determine if he might be interested before I approach him.

I don't want to approach him as generally people don't do that, he often has his headphones in or is on his laptop, he speaks Italian so not sure about his English, I may be picking up a gay vibe, plus normal concerns over approaching...if I get it wrong I 'lose' my regular coffee shop (I'm a creature of habit and love the staff).

I'm kind of worried I've already been too obvious so not sure how I could test the water.  
I'll likely see him at the coffee shop tomorrow, so thinking about how I should play it.

I may be over-thinking or being ridiculous, but I'm really terrible with these sort of things.",07Dec2018,1

22,"English is not my first language, so please excuse me if my english is a little off. Also, I’m on mobile, excuse my formatting as well.

In recent years, my cousin and his dad (my uncle) has made me quite uncomfortable. 
It started after I hit puberty, where i remember my uncle slapping my ass at a time where most of my family was present. Later, they have started commenting on my weight, saying I’m fat or that I’ve gained a lot of weight since last time I saw them. They comment on my twin sisters weight as well, so this doesn’t bother me that much. 
What bothers me is that it seems like my cousin is trying to touch my breasts at every chance he gets. This includes when we hug eachother to say hello, tickling me and playfighting where his hands finds their way to the area (never actually grabbing my breasts, but comming close enough that I have no doubt that he knows what he is doing).

It should be mentioned that he has some mental problems like anger issues, and he sometimes acts like a 12-year-old. I think this is mainly caused by him being involved in a traffic accident a few years ago, where half his skull got crushed and he went into coma for a week or so. My mom told me he has always been a little on the odd side though. He and his dad also drink a lot which certainly doesn’t help either. I am not in a position where I can stop their alcohol abuse, though.

I have told my aunt about what my cousin is doing, hoping she would help me, and she told me to ignore it.

I am not comfortable with telling my dad. He would probably tell me to get over it as well.

What can I do? I really don’t feel like going to any family event where he is coming as well. 
I know this isn’t the biggest problem, but I can’t sleep because I have to see him tomorrow.

I do care. And 2. I do help out with things, I pay for groceries sometimes and help with whatever my mom needs. I don’t currently have a “job” mostly because my depression and anxiety make it really hard to go out and get one and stick with one. I’ve had them in the past. I currently just make money on the side doing deliveries and whatnot, which pays my phone bill, gas, extra. 


Im getting off anti depressants which I was literally forced on by my mom and stepdad when I was going through a lot, (which was actually my stepdads fault) and now just getting off of them because i hate being on  them.  And if you didn’t know you get withdraws from being off it. And my mom assumed Im falling back to where I was before I started taking them.

49,"Hi everyone. A preemptive thank you to whoever reads this post and comments. I need some advice regarding getting over a slightly traumatic experience.

Some background: I am in university right now in the US. My major is a relatively small major, so the classes are small and the students in the classes tend to be pretty friendly with each other. 

On Wednesday, I was at my first class of the day. We started out the class with some lecture, and transitioned into the last quiz (yay!) of the semester. About 2 or 3 minutes into the quiz, I heard one student (let's call him Will) start to make some weird noises. As I looked up at him, he started to gasp really loudly and started convulsing. He was having a seizure. At that point in time, I did not know Will had had a discussion with the professor about a suspicion by doctors that he has been having seizures in his sleep lately. All I knew is that a kid I was friends with all of the sudden started having a seizure in the middle of class.

The professor acted quickly and grabbed him so he didn't fall out of his desk. I called 911 and instructed another student to begin timing the seizure (I just finished a First Aid class last semester so I knew more or less how to handle the situation). A couple of other students helped the professor get him onto the ground while I (mostly) remained calm and talked to the 911 responder. EMS was on the scene quickly and they took him to the hospital. He emailed the professor about 2 hours later telling her that he was fine. 

I was in a general state of shock for pretty much the whole day. In the moment, I had to force aside my emotions and act quickly so that Will would be okay. As the day progressed, my emotions about the situation slowly trickled back in. I called a friend to talk about it last night and he helped me deal with my feelings about the situation.

Ever since that moment when Will began his seizure, anytime someone around me makes a weird noise (it's hard to describe the noise he made, almost like a guttural gasp. But the noises that ""trigger"" me can be anything from a quiet laugh to a cough) I get a quick burst of a deep physically-manifesting anxiety that I am having trouble controlling. What I feel is my muscles tense up, adrenaline is released, and I feel a small sense of dread. Almost the feeling of excitement I feel before going on a roller coaster, but I don't enjoy this feeling at all. 

Logically, I know that the chances of another person having a seizure around me is essentially zero. Logically, I know that all of us handled what happened right. Logically, I know I am prepared for this situation if it ever arises. I know all of that. But I can't shake that momentary feeling of horrible anxiety I get when I hear a noise that sounds similar to the noise that Will made right at the beginning of his seizure. It's almost like I have a short-term PTSD reaction to the situation. It literally triggers me into reverting to the same deep anxiety I felt until I watched Will come out of his seizure and knew he would be okay. 

I have plans to go to my university's provided counselling services tomorrow and I hope that they will give me ways to cope with this. But I have about 16 hours before I will be able to do that, and this ""triggering"" that is happening has really been bothering me. Does anyone have any advice for ways to at least diminish the response I am having to these ""triggers""?

Thanks!",07Dec2018,1

59,"Bear with me guys! First post here but it is looooong.

My girlfriend of 5-7 years has just informed me that she cheated on me during a break. During this break we agreed to be monogamous (her wishes) and she begged and pleaded for a break and not a break up. She knows I am the type of person that would rather have a clean breakup than a break. We have been together since college where she was super sheltered and commuting and I was an on campus bachelor with a different girl for every class.

I was her first experience with a guy sexually or in any type of relationship and we grew together over the years. While I was the smart cool athlete in High School, she was the lame derpy kid so were had very different paths to meeting in college. There have been some bumpy patches between years 1 and 3, hence the 5-7 time table, but it has been great overall. About a year and a half ago I took on a part time job in addition to my full time IT job to make some extra money and I knew that would put a bit of strain on the relationship but we were still powering through! It required a bit more scheduling but she was in graduate school so we made it work.

Fast forward to August of this year. I left the part time employment to spend more time together as I could see the toll it was taking on the relationship. Shortly thereafter, she had a health scare that made her reevaluate the future and if I was the person she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. At that point she was not sure, partly due to the boring nature of the relationship with me working 70-80 hours a week. Rather than talk to me about this growing disconnect she decided to keep the feelings in until it resulted in asking for a break.

She talked to all sorts of friends about it asking ""If I have the perfect guy, why can't I commit to marriage"" with most of her friends coming to the same conclusion that I did, simply that she was not ready and it's not the right time. She openly admits that she only wants to get married because culturally its necessary to have children but she's nowhere ready to have children. 

As someone who has had bad experiences with breaks in the past, I was completely against the break since talking about our problems seemed like a much better alternative. She had never discussed any unhappiness with me but kept it concealed until a break seemed like the only option. I suggested a full break up numerous time but she kept affirming a break was what she wanted as she didn't want to lose me. Her logic was that while she was unsure we should get married, she was unsure that we shouldn't as well (Ive never asked her to marry me btw).  


I agreed to the break with the stipulation that we would try to work through our problems and try my suggestions after it was over. Based on my experience with breaks, I knew that would be hard as the extended time apart would wreck certain things and attaining that closeness again would be difficult. But I agreed. Every other week there would be a check in like are you sure you dont want to end the break and to make sure we were both alive and well. It was all going well until literally a week before it ended -- December 1.

During the past two weeks she has started taking dancing lessons (tango, salsa, bachata etc) lessons daily and going out every night and the weekends to dance and practice. As a boyfriend, on a break or not, I was not a fan of this behavior but I understood that she was always sheltered and never got a chance to go out and experience life in that way. I was not against the going out as long as she was safe and smart about it. I'm the only guy she has ever been with physically or romantically so deep down I knew she would have to go through her ""hoe phase"" at some point. I've been through mine and I'm all the better faithful man for it but it had to happen.

On that faithful (pun intended) day, after a weekend night of dancing, a guy she has seen in dance class walked her to her car and asked to get in since it was cold. After some talking he kissed her but she didn't fight it, she kissed back. she says she wasn't planning on it and its not what she wanted but once it started she didn't refuse. He tried to get her to give him head and she refused. He then, while kissing, pulled her underwear to the side (she was wearing a dress) and tried to penetrate but as soon as she felt anything she stopped him and said no. Regardless of how far it went, cheating occurred.

Fast forward to today. She has now told me this information. We have been in contact since the day after it happened and I have had a feeling that it did but she refused to talk about it unless we were in person. For days this week I threw subtle hints that I knew about the infidelity so we could talk about the elephant in the room rather than dance around it until our schedules aligned. Today I finally got her to agree to the conversation over FaceTime and she told me everything. 

I am someone who can get past cheating. Unfortunately I've cheated on women in the past so I know how it goes. The harder part for me to get past is that it was with someone from dance as that is now to be an integral part of her life. Knowing that she's out every night dancing and a recurrence is possible creates a problem for me although I'm not someone who cares about kissing. And this guy was apparently the ONLY guy at dance she didn't tell she had a boyfriend which is another red flag for me. She has also stopped talking to any of her close friends about where she goes and what she does as none of them would approve. She suspects they would all judge her and disprove of her Current behavior.

She spend hours crying on FaceTime about it and appears sorry and regretful for an uncharacteristic act. The way I see that girl I met 7 years ago is changed forever and she knows that. A special piece if what we had is gone, maybe for good so I'm not sure what the point of continuing on is. I think her thinking is that she doesn't want to lose me forever since we have this special bond but she needs time to figure shit out. If she had just taken the breakup like I said it would have allllll been fine. I knew she would need time for the hoe phase, since I know here so well and know that she was an ugly duckling, but she didn't want to listen.

I need some advice! There are a couple options now:

1. Cut her loose and say see ya later to the cheater 
2. Stay together in a monogamous relationship and try to work it out
3. Try an open relationship where we are honest with each other about our partners but no new relationships allowed
4. Just friends who hang.

All have their pros and cons but the open relationship is interesting. 3 months ago the open relationship idea would have made me sick but today, I see her as more of a super hot friend to bang and go to couple places together than the potential spouse. Most if not all of that love has gone during the break and the last bit left during the FaceTime today. Ive made my feeling on how I now see her very clear to hear. I didn't do it to be mean but I wanted my intentions to be clear. She claims she just wants to be able to go on the occasional date or have a makeout session with a guy just for the experience but she wants to keep the door open for us after the hoe phase.

She then said she doesn't even know if she wants the hooking up part because the scenario with the guy in the car was kind of scary. She is super scared of STDs and getting pregnant so a guy you barely know trying to penetrate and actually pushing up against you vagina raw, while your ovulating, can be scary. So I dont even know what she wants.

I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK TO DO lol.

60,"Hello,

I’m a 19-year-old woman working full-time and sharing a residence with my parents. As the title has implied, my mother is a highly emotionally abusive person and I’m unsure of how to deal with the situation. 

She has extreme anger issues and will often fly off the handle for next to no reason. She has even admitted to me that she tends to assume the worst in people (including her own blood) and has a hard time dealing with stress. 

My mother often fully understands when she is acting like a “monster,” as she puts it, but sees no issue with her yelling or name-calling. Very rarely will she apologize for acting inappropriately. 

I know from what I describe it might seem like I’m exaggerating, but this has been a constant issue since my early childhood. It even escalated to physical abuse at one point when I was little for not doing my homework. Her response was to choke me. She hasn’t done so since, but her anger hasn’t gotten much better.

It’s even more of a issue for me currently as she has gotten foot surgery again. The last time that my mother did, she got so unpleasant that she demanded I clean up everything for her, and when I failed to do so in what she considered a timely manner, she began flinging random objects around the room with her crutches. It sounds silly in writing, but it was much worse seeing it first hand. 

Her words have a huge toll on my mental health. I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, if it helps put things in perspective. 

It’s even worse, because my father is not much of a better person. In fact, I’m pretty sure he is the reason my mother is like this. See, my father used to physically abuse my mother. That abuse went on for at least a decade. The two of them are still together, despite how consistently toxic their relationship has been, no matter how much “better” in their eyes it has gotten. 

Even though my mother has always treated me awfully, I have a bad habit of confiding in her regarding personal matters, due to not having a trust in my other parent and usually not having friends. This has bitten me in the ass a few times, as she has taken my weaknesses and used it against me. 

I know I need to learn to keep a distance, but other than that I have no idea how to deal with my situation. Any advice or just validation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",07Dec2018,1

62,"Hey everyone so I'm 19 years old and I'm trying to choose a career path. I've already decided that I want to go into Computer Programming/Software Development and doing a 2 year Diploma program would be best to achieve this career. 

The problem is I don't think I can handle going straight to College for that without first spending some time studying Math and Computer Science on my own and preparing myself so I can be successful in getting the Diploma. Around where I live it's super competitive and the programs are very challenging. If I work on improving my Programming and Math skills I think I can be ready in about 2 - 3 years to pursue the career I've always wanted. 

I have two options for what to do until then and I would love to hear some input on which choice would be best. I could pursue my 2nd choice career option which would be becoming an Electrical Apprentice, knowing that I'll be changing careers after a few years, or I could just get a minimum wage job full time and do that for a few years. If I go the Electrical route I would need to take a 6 month course to become an Apprentice which would cost around $3700 but I would get to try my 2nd pick of a career and have as something I can fall back on. I just feel like it might be a waste though to spend 2 - 3 years as an Apprentice then change careers if I could spend another few years becoming a Licensed Electrician. The License won't help me at all if I pursue Computer Science though because they are not at all related. Plus it would definitely be much harder work than simply getting a job in retail, grocery, etc... I've considered doing part time courses in Software Development but it would take 6 years which is just too long. What should I do?",07Dec2018,1
63,"So here’s my entire history of learning language in order:
-I leaned sign language as a baby and continued to learn a sign here and there until I was maybe 10. 
-I began learning French in elementary school and did so for two years
-I took spanish for 4 years in high school
-I took an elective course in ASL in college
-I took French for one year in college
-I took spanish for two years in college


And now here I am, familiar enough with French and Spanish that I can’t successfully speak either without interference, and familiar enough with ASL that I know everything I’m doing is elementary and wrong. I’m very, very frustrated. I work in disability services (not necessarily with deaf students though) and have always loved ASL. My career will likely take me to spanish-speaking countries and I have family that speaks Spanish, but I have little personal interest in learning it, and I would love to visit France one day, I love the French language, but have no one to practice speaking with and who knows if I will ever actually make it to France. 

Which language do I pursue first? Thoughts? Opinions? 

Before anyone calls me out- yes. I’ve technically studied spanish for six years and still don’t speak it very well. I got my A’s and got out. ",07Dec2018,1
64,"I’m 19 years old and have had a few sexual experiences so far with different men, mostly without condoms for various reasons, some out of my control. I became very aware of my recklessness with my sexual health after being diagnosed with a certain incurable virus, which made me think twice about my sexual choices. My mum reacted awfully to this news. I thought I could confide in her and she’d understand, but she pretty much blames me for it and cried when she had to accompany me to an sti clinic. This was a while back before I went back to university for my second year. 

I got back to uni a few months ago, and kept seeing this guy at the local club. We both one night got very drunk, and of course went back to his. I thought I’d start of being careful with a condom, but asked him if he was clean (yes I know it was very naive of me to trust this practical stranger). He told me he’s not got anything, and it should be fine without a condom. I obviously assumed he had been tested recently. To be fair he didn’t cum which I think lowers my risk slightly, but there was still intercourse without a condom involved. 

The next morning, me being more conscious of my sexual health. I ask him when he last got tested just to make sure. I shit you not, these were his words- “I ain’t been tested or anything but I know I haven’t got an std of course I’m clean”. I wanted to cry. I now have less trust in males and will be sure to use condoms in future, even if they say they are clean.

The problems arise when I think about my mum. I will need to go to an sti clinic when I get back home, and I’ve thought about lying about it. However. if I was to catch something serious like HIV (god forbid), I would definitely tell her this. It also feels wrong to lie to her about going to a clinic seeing as I tell her everything, and I don’t want to go through this worry alone. 

Shall I tell her with the risk of her practically disowning me, or lie and struggle in silence?",07Dec2018,1

It got me thinking and I'm realizing I've been numb like this for a while now. Didn't get upset when my grandpa died in May. Losing my childhood pet a couple years ago barely phased me. Hell, even my parents divorcing did absolutely nothing to me and I'm starting to think I've got some issues or something. 

The last time I felt genuinely sad was over 5 years ago when I was still in high school. Dealt with my first heartbreak and while that sounds dumb, it absolutely ruined me at the time. There were days I would just skip class and not leave bed because I felt sick to my stomach. Pushed me down a spiral of depression and suicidal thoughts/behaviors.

I don’t think it’s something that he can control, because he pees when he gets too excited or if he gets scared by a loud noise or something. I’ve tried everything to solve this but nothing has worked. I was never told about this problem when I agreed to watch him. He’s also been pooping all over my carpet. I’ll take him outside, he’ll do his business and then immediately come in and poop on the floor, even though he just went outside.

73,"I currently hold a minimum-wage job at a small local coffee and sandwich shop, which the owner built up himself.  My boss, the owner, is a hardcore workaholic, and imposes this on his employees.  This means that he frequently schedules people for 11+ hour work shifts, and refuses everybody their breaks (something blatantly against the law in my state).  This has a number of people on edge.

I am also in college, and have an international trip coming up in January.  I was going to use this as an excuse to quit, but after today, where I came home barely able to walk and felt dizzy after standing in one place for so long, I’m not sure I can hold out that long.

I’m at a bit of a hard decision.  On the one hand, my parents are saying to keep going until the end of the month, so I get paid for the full month, and I end on good terms with my boss, enough to potentially use as a reference for a future job.  On the other hand, my friends are saying I need to report him for breaking my state’s labor laws, something that will almost certainly lead me to end on bad terms with him - I would have to get proof that he’s not giving us our breaks.

I know I need to get out of this job as soon as possible for my own sanity if nothing else, and really feel the moral obligation to swing the karma hammer on him by reporting him.  But I also don’t know how important it is to end on a good note with an employer.

I'm a college student going into a health career and I'm at the point where I'll have to take a drug test soon to go into clinicals.

I have some concerns and thought maybe a wise mind could help me figure out the right way to do this. I've thought about going to my doctor or advisor but I'm not sure if it's their area to help me?

I don't know how to confess that I am in love with her. And I don't know if she feels that same way about me. I haven't told her already because I am scared and shy.

But when I moved out, I couldn't keep up with dishes, and my life was pretty much hell without a dishwasher. I LOATHED spending 1.5 hours per day doing dishes by hand (I cook from scratch). Then, I moved in to a family's place that has a really nice, modern, $800 bosch dishwasher. LOVE IT. Love it. I don't pre-soak, I just sorta rinse it off slightly, and put it in. We live in a SFH right now, but now we're moving out, and we have two small kids..  However, most apartments around the area have old looking dishwashers. Here are my two apartment options: 

Apartment #1: Duplex, no shared walls because garage is separating the two units. This is pretty cool because I have a toddler who LOVES kicking walls and banging his ball against the wall. Single car garage. Large-ish back yard and even a covered back porch/patio. Carpet throughout (which is a plus for me as I have a crawling baby, so carpets are easy on his knees). Gas heat/central ac, which is also a plus because I live in an area that's VERY prone to summer forest fires. Last summer, the whole summer had gray smoke outside due to forest fires. If we put in a portable AC, we'd let in all the smoke, so it was nice that we had central air, so it would be nice to keep having central air in this area. This apartment has old appliances though, old dishwasher. 

Apartment #2: NEW Applicances (but cheap ones). But apartment is small, and it has shared walls, laminate flooring (will need to spend extra money on rug), tiny tiny fenced patio, which is like maybe the size of a small bathroom lol. 

So I'm thinking about going with apartment #1. But, the old dishwasher... will I survive? I have two small kids and cook from scratch, so our dishwasher gets run at LEAST once a day, if not twice! 

So, how do old dishwashers (like, 10-20 years old) compare to new ones like bosch? Will I have to pre-soak dishes and pre-rinse? I don't mind buying expensive detergent, we usually buy expensive one anyway for the current bosch that we're using (finish max, or cascade 12x tabs). Any tips about dealing with old dishwashers? I barely have time to do dishes, I certainly don't have 1.5 hours per day, because I remember I had to spend that much time doing dishes by hand back when I lived at a place with no dishwasher. And that's when I cooked only for two, not four! 

So, what do you think? Will I survive with the old dishwasher? ",07Dec2018,1

so here's my story. My mom is addicted to sleeping pills. I was acting like it's nothing for long time but this weekend she didn't even know what day it was and I assume it was from the pills since she was on friday for 2 boxes. On Monday I called her boyfriend (who is living with us for about 6 years but I never really got along with him) to stop bringing her another pills. He told me ok I won't, then hung up and called my mother that I'm coming home to take all her pills.

90,"A little backstory: we’re coworkers and we dated for 2 months. It was short but sweet and we moved pretty fast. 

We broke up. Towards the end of our relationship it just seemed like he wasn't invested in it like he once was. So I texted him and asked if he had second thoughts on our relationship. And he said yeah, and he was saying how it wasn't me and it was just him needing to be on his own. And I asked him if he lost feelings and he said yeah. So that was it. 

So now we're still friends and such. But the day after thanksgiving we hung out and he wanted to hold my hand. And he dropped me off to go to his friends. But then he invited me to his place to hang out. And I should've known what he intended but I didnt want to think that. So we went to his roommates room for them to play videogames for a little. And he was holding my hand when his roommate was playing. When his roommate went to go get him a beer, we kissed. And then when we went to his room, I slept with him. 

The next day I was really confused, but I asked him if he was just to confirm that he didn't have feelings for me. And he said he wasn't so all the hand holding and kissing was to get me in bed with him. I never confronted him cause I think I'll just be more hurt. 

I asked him if he still wanted to be with me in the future, he replied to me, “not right now”. He said in person and through text that he wanted to be friends “for now” 

But now we're friends, and I asked if he had depression and he said he did. He uses marijuana as an antidepressant but he's quitting so it's just making things harder for him but I'm just trying to be a good friend. 

We text almost everyday. We texted the other day and he replied to me. A couple minutes after he texted me, he sent another text saying “sorry if I’m bothering you” and the conversation ended for the day. An hour later he texts me “Hey, just wondering. And feel free to say no. Would you like to hang out again sometime? “ I said “Yeah! My answer’s been the same, we just haven’t really found the time yet haha” and he replied “Lol okay sounds good. I'm sorry I know it's random. But I just think it'd be nice🙂 maybe sometime this week? “ 

Today, was another normal day at work. I’m at the front office about to clock out for the day. He comes to the front to clock out as well. I had to go to the back to my locker to pick up my stuff and I go back to the front and he’s gone, so figured that he left to his car. I walk out to the back and I see him standing next to his car waiting for me. And we talked for a bit and he invited me to hang out.

first quarter grades were solid, was generally putting in my normal amount of effort, all my grades were 85 and above. now it's second quarter and my anatomy grade is currently sitting at a 71. why? failed the first test and quiz. took the second quiz today that im pretty sure i failed. now i have my second test tomorrow and i'm fucked again. 

but i don't... genuinely care? i am only worried about schools seeing these grades, since my college counselor says that they send out first semester grades to all the colleges i've applied to.

however, i get my top school's decision back in 13 days, and i already got into my second top school.

i'm sitting here on reddit instead of studying for this major exam i have tomorrow, because i just feel like it doesn't matter. i know none of this shit matters in even just a year and especially in the grand scheme of life, and this way of thinking has definitely affected my grades over the years sometimes. now, however, it's worse than before.

i know acceptances being rescinded is so rare, you'd have to get like, a D in a major class at the end of the year, which i obviously won't be getting so thats why im not worried

i can't let all of this go to my head about shit not mattering anymore, because it's only gonna get worse...

any advice? 

am i supposed to be pulling an all-nighter right now to study for this anatomy exam tomorrow so i can ace it?",07Dec2018,1

But nowadays, (and I don’t think it’s my place to judge other people’s standers, my parents just lose their mind if I get a b+) he strives for a b- or a c+ and has dropped two volunteering organizations, he seems to struggle with anxiety but his parents don’t seem to understand how to deal with it and he just seems to be struggling in areas all around. I don’t know if I should talk to him about him, maybe once he is just generally happier in life he might get that vigor back to learn. The main problem is o don’t want to come off as rude, would that be mean to say “hey, you seem to be struggling in a lot of areas in life, can I help?” Would he take that offensively?

94,"It all started two months ago, at a theater performance at my school were I met the girl who I’ve been told was just toying with my emotions as a cruel joke. We will call her L, we after meeting at an after party L and I hit it off and up until last week I believed our relationship might actually go somewhere, that’s when two her closer friends and some of my fellow classmates told me she had been bragging and gloating about stringing my feelings along for a cruel joke.

Naturally, I was hurt and shocked to hear this so I’ll confided in my best friend who we will call M. I told him what happened regarding L how she had supposedly used me. The very next day when I was going to ask L if this was true because I truly believe in innocent until proven guilty. I see M sitting with L and J (a girl M knows has gotten me kicked out of my last friend group and lost my former best friend to). It shocked me because he’s never shown an interest in either of these girls platonic or otherwise, so why now right? Especially the day after I tell him of the possibility of L playing with my feelings. 

So I confronted him about why he was hanging out with these two people in particular, one who had done some terrible things to me and another that might have, I did this about about two days later. Proceeds to he told me that L and J needed to be given a chance and that L had told him rather that she never liked me all along. Which I find odd for her to tell him considering according to him they’ve really only hung out the past few days. I told him in response that I understand giving L a chance because I still haven’t asked her wether the rumors are rumors or actually the truth. But J, he knows what she did to me in my last friend group and he also knows I’ve given her a second chance to fix her initial mistakes and she blew that too.

So I’m left confused, I love my best friend and L is still innocent in my eyes until I hear her tell me that she did cruelly prank me. But it just seems oddly creepy timing that he would to hangout with them instead of me in classes when he knows what they’ve done and supposedly done to me.

So this girl in my class and I have been getting pretty close along with a small group of like 3 other people since we’re all in the same classes. We’ve been trying to set up a “group party” and I said we could all come over to my place and drink, have fun. 

Last Night:
So that night they all came over and she was there of course. We were both starting to get drunk and I noticed that she was pretty touchy with me and my phone. She even put her head on my shoulders while we were on the couch a few times and constantly had our knees and legs touching cause we sat together. She even went in my room and grabbed a vodka bottle I had then hid it in the back of her pants and her friends told me to look! 

I’m not sure if it was just because I was drunk I can’t really tell if she is attracted to me, especially since she has a bf (who lives an hour away). I feel like if he knew he would be pissed. I asked my roommate who was there as well and he said she did seem touchy and that I should go for it.

Question:
My question is should I actually pursue her? Friday night we’re both going to the same party and I feel like if I do it’s now or never. What should I do??

P.S. I know it’s a dick move to try to flirt with another guys girl but I’ve met him and he’s not good to her at all anyway. I definitely have a crush on her and I just want to be the one to make her happy. ",07Dec2018,1

Me and this person have been friends for around 4 years now, and we just recently confessed feelings for eachother but they aren't sure what they want due to us already being friends, as well as knowing we both don't want to stick around the local area much longer - fear of starting a relationship and then having to move away from eachother I guess (understandable)

We just recently hung out and cuddled and all that cute jazz, and I'm starting to realize I really do have some pretty strong feelings, but I'm confused and hesitant to start anything up myself (I generally tend to self-destruct relationships due to some bad history with past relationships) and the talk we did have was over text and minimal at best. 

I guess I'm just not sure how to navigate these waters as I've never dated a close friend before. So, people of Reddit, what do you think I should do? Should I just keep hanging out with her and chatting and see where it naturally goes or should I actually have an in depth person to person chat with her as to what we both want to do, seeing as we're so close already as it is?

We're both mature enough to not let this ruin a friendship if it goes south or we realize we aren't compatible or whatever (I think, we've hooked up a long time ago and are obviously still friends)

I’m going to intentionally keep this vague for reasons, but basically I’m in an interesting position.

I’m in administrative work, and report to two supervisors (A and B). I’ve always had a great relationship with both, and earlier this year was granted a $2 an hour raise without prompting. 

Recently, B left for better pastures, and has offered to take me with them which poses a number of logistics issues such as family relocation and spousal rehoming, etc. Boss B offered me a job thinking I make $5/hour more than I do even after the raise, and openly admitted I’m not paid enough. 

Boss A is well aware that leaving for Boss B is an option (even though it’s not because the financial reward doesn’t *actually* create a better life balance and for many reasons would actually be quite the financial stretch even though it’s more money.

103,"I've noticed recently that every time I get into an argument or disagreement with my mother, it almost always goes the same way. And don't get me wrong, we're very close and joke around a lot, but our disagreements are really driving me insane. I'll try to keep this short with bullet pointing, but it may get long!

Most of the time, it begins with her saying her opinion on something, but she holds it as fact (such as us just today, we were trying to pick a movie together, and her, in the middle of the movie-picking conversation, randomly diagnoses my younger sisters as probably being narcissists after watching a single youtube video about it)

And me countering this with what's actually true or saying to look into it more (telling her what a narcissist actually is, and that a small child isn't immediately a narcissist for wanting attention or being dependent. Also, we've dealt with a real one in the family before.)

This usually ends up with a long spiral of back and forth bantering, and normally consists of her

*coming with more assumptions about others (or me) and holding it as fact

*or blowing up one of my traits to make me seem 'evil' or unreliable as a source in an argument (loner=you hate people, so how can you know if someone is a narcissist or not if you're not around them?)

- however, when I tell her that she makes too many assumptions about people or when I criticize what she does in these arguments in general, I'm ""wrong"", ""being rude (to your own mother)"", or she reacts as if I'm attacking her entire personality and being as a whole.

* picks one sentence in my arguments in return to emphasize on and skew the meaning of what I actually meant, or say what I said was too complicated to follow. When I tell her what I really mean or try to simplify it, she says ""Of course I knew, I'm not dumb"", but continuing to argue on the skewed sentence she created, usually getting me lost or confused in the meaning of my own original statement.


*Stating something obvious (or in this case, say ""all we were trying to do was pick out a movie, you had to make this more than it really was. What are you even arguing for?"")

* Allowing said younger siblings to be present during disagreements. And since we have a large age gap and they're still 6-11, they don't understand how the arguments start or what we're saying. But of course, they're always on their mom's side, and she uses them as devices to end an argument (""6 year old said they don't like us disagreeing, so stop"", ""11 year old doesn't understand your argument, so it must not make sense at all""... Why did you call them to listen as our jury anyway? Our disagreements always just sound like casual banter since we both dislike aggravating shouting and yelling over minor disagreements, so they don't just run into the room because they heard loud voices like some kids might because we aren't using loud voices...)

* Normally, it almost always ends with her derailing the disagreement to the point that I forget how it started or what's even being said anymore. Or she says In her own recent words, ""I wasn't being serious at all this whole time. I was just playing around/joking, you're the one who continued this argument and got too serious about it.""

But I'm close with her, so I know when we're playing around and joking and can read the mood. I'm not just randomly getting upset over everything. I don't know, to me it seems like someone playing a cruel prank and when the victim gets understandably upset, saying ""lol, it was just a joke brah"". (And her saying a young child is a narcissist doesn't sound much like joking around when no joke was behind it and she was legitimately trying to diagnose a child with narcissism)

* Her usual resolution is to tell me that I'm too serious and factual (despite her claiming to know the facts before), and since I'm so darn diddly sensitive &amp; serious, I should tell her when I'm not joking anymore so she won't keep telling jokes to avoid me getting rialed up over nothing again... But the thing is... She wasn't joking at all at the start.

109,"I went to a top ten public University in the US and graduate with a Chemistry degree (Bachelor's) (GPA = 2.2)

It took me six years to graduate with that degree (including one year that I was academically dismissed and later reinstated)

I struggled mightily the entire time.

My first two years, I keep failing and repeating classes just to get by.

My third year, I was academically dismissed from my university.

I returned the fourth year and decided that I am going to live and breath chemistry and nothing else.

I woke up, eat breakfast, and study chemistry. Then I go to classes and study chemistry between classes. (I eat lunch while studying.)  After that, I eat dinner and go to bed. Rinse and repeat.

When I said ""study"", I mean 80% reading (textbook, online papers from the professors, etc.) and 20% doing homework, lab report, etc.

Reading is just so time and energy consuming. I have to spend so much effort making sure that I am reading the right words that I often get ""lost"" in the text and forget what the text was saying.

I wasn't just my chemistry major classes that I was struggling with. I struggled with the general elective classes (literature, ethnic study, etc.)

My advisors sent me to skill classes (note taking classes, time management classes, etc) and they didn't help.

Finally, in my last term, I talked with my professor in a class I was struggling with.

I describe extensively how hard I try and how much time I spend studying. What he said changed my life.

He said that I probably have dyslexia and that his son has that.

I changed the way I study. I stopped retyping my notes after class, and instead, record lectures for later listening. Instead of reading texts, I use text to speech software to listen to text.

I initially thought that I would surely fail that class. I, instead, ended up with a B+.

In another class, I earned my first ever A+ in college.

Furthermore, with the change in the way I study, I feel that I didn't have to work as hard to earn a good grade. I was able to retain the material more easily and naturally.

It's a shame that I didn't figured this out earlier. (When I was using the more traditional methods taught in skill classes, I did poorly).

My undergraduate studies are over and I feel that my grades are not reflective of my abilities.

I have never felt depression like this or have EVER thought about seriously just ending it all. I'm 18 and I go to a crappy community college (which makes me feel so worthless and depressed because I got into a nice university and could not afford it) and I still live at home.

&amp;#x200B;

My family is middle class but we definitely still struggle. I only had that car for three months and I just feel like the biggest piece of shit ever for putting my family in this situation. My sister got arrested earlier this year and that caused a huge financial drain on our family and now i'm just an added drain. I have a crappy job that only schedules me once a week (have to wait for a new car before i can get a new job because right now I don't have reliable transportation) and my parents told me that from now on I have to pay for my own insurance which I completely understand. I don't make enough money to buy my own car or even to pay for my own insurance. I'm looking for a new job, but i'm heavily relying on rides from my sister just to get to my school and work, so I need a car before i can work a job that schedules me regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

I told my parents to use the money they saved up for my college to buy me a new car because I really don't have any other choice. I don't know how im going to pay for insurance and gas and college on top of that. I think about all things i'm going to have to sacrifice just to afford life right now and I seriously just want to die. I don't have any direction in life and no real career aspirations so I feel so hopeless and on top of all of this I feel like I have ruined Christmas for my family this year.

my sister is 23 and still lives at home too and I know that i'm being so shitty by feeling this way, but I also resent her for not making a big enough effort at becoming financially independent and moving out (also for being arrested because it's been a tough year paying for all the crap that comes with that situation even though shes slowly trying to pay my parents back) because maybe I could make dumb teenager mistakes and not feel like my my life is ruined if my parents only had to pay for one child's mistakes. I think about what my future holds and I want to kill myself. I know I wont, but it scares me how much I contemplate it and rationalize it. I just feel so lost and hopeless and every time I go to sleep I see flashes of the wreck. What do I do? How do I fix this? It seems like i'm over reacting, but I can't even convey how unsatisfied and depressed I am.

I don’t really want to pursue dating with B because I honestly think we’d be better off as friends, and it’d make things less awkward between us. I’ve been trying to get over him. But  if I were to hook up with B casually, without involving any feelings, would it be considered a problem if I ever told A? (This would be before dating A).

Ultimately, I do want to be with A, but at the same time, do I tell B how I feel? And what do I do if B likes me back? I keep on thinking telling B how I feel will lift a weight off me, but I don’t want to mess up our friendship.

TL;DR: I have feelings for two of my friends, and while I have made a decision on who I’m choosing (A), would it be bad if I told my other crush (B) how I feel?

122,"In May my girlfriend has to be taken to the hospital via ambulance. We received a bill in the mail a few weeks later for approximately $15k for the ambulance ride and hospital care. Luckily she has insurance and we were able to get most of the bill squared away, after the dust settled we ended up paying about $500 out of pocket. 

Since paying the bill we have been getting weekly statements from the hospital saying we still owe money to the despite being told on the phone that it’s a system error and our account is in good standing and paid in full, we call every time we get a bill just to be safe. 

Today we get a notice from a collections agency stating that we have been sent to collections due to unpaid medical bills. 

How do we go about getting this resolved? Where do we start? How do we ensure we can get this behind us and off our credit report? How do we ensure the hospital is going to do what is needed from their end to help us?

We know that we took care of this. We need to resolve the issue with the hospital, collections agency and ultimately the credit bureau but don’t know where to begin!

123,"I (M18) am in a downward spiral.
So I always had an infatuation for my online and long distance friend of 4 years. I met her (F16) back in 2014, and before I didn’t really made any huge move on her but I always made her feel special and unique in my book. Back then I had a toxic love life, and I put her in the “save for later” category. I would constantly flirt with her and she would do it back but I would always get into another relationship that wasn’t her. As the year gone by and I mature, I got in a serious long distance relationship in 2016 that lasted almost a year. I then found out my ex cheated on me with several dude in her area. And I was devastated at the edge of suicide and my friend was the only one there for me. After the break up, I soon started making kinda big moves on her. I was working up the ranks to ask her out. But then my old toxic love habits started to come out again and she was again side step as I fooled around with easier picks. This all develop into a major fight where I indirectly sent her to the hospital due to attempted suicide after I sent a dick pic meant for someone else. We argued about how bad both of us were and about our ideologies. (Me and her relatively grew up in the same environment, conservative suburban Christians. But I have become atheist since then.)
The fight ended abruptly (cause of the attempted suicide). And I didn’t speak to her for 3 month. I deleted all my contacts with her and created new ones so she couldn’t find me. But like I said in 3 month. She found my new accounts and started following and liking my posts again. I hastily DM her trying to scare her off but bless her, she is a stubborn and forgiving women. Ever since then we been building back up our friendship, sharing very memorable moments. But recently my infatuation for her has grown immensely as she still really the only person who shown me great care and love. I started making big moves on her again, from writing her hand written letters, drawing up couple tattoo ideas, and talking about our future together, and even becoming a bit more Christian recently just for her. I know this time, my actions will be mature and serious moves. And I am 100% sure I will not drop her again and fool around for easier picks.
But I still can’t help it but feel like she still putting me arm length away, putting me into a niche area of her life, even though she is part of my whole life. And I feel like the niche I am in is holding back my entry to becoming a viable partner to her. Distance is not really a problem as we have agree to meet up in the summer of 2019. Ideologies isn’t a problem either, as we become more similar in thinking. Nor is the law as I have no plans to do any sexual acts with her. Me and her talk a lot of big future games. But I feel like it just lip service now.
Should I push forward and break out of the niche and ask her out? (If so how do I do it!?) or should I keep the status quo and realize I fucked up too many times for even the most forgiving people, and maintain a stellar friendship? ",07Dec2018,1
124,"I will leave out some specific titles and names as I want to keep this generic for anonymity. 

I work in a school system that is undergoing a ton of changes. Some are good, some are bad, and some are downright scary because of the unknowns. Many of these changes are happening quickly and simultaneously. 

I have an opportunity to take a position in my field outside of the school system, but this would mean leaving my current job (I love the specific school in which I work....just not the system it’s in). I depend on my principal to come up to bat for me, and they always do, which I feel can be a rarity in school systems these days. 

Here are some pros, or reasons why I believe leaving would be smart:
-principal who is an advocate for me will likely retire in the near future (unknown replacement)
-school pay is low, but related job outside of school pays considerably better 
-I am younger and starting a new job outside the school wouldn’t be damaging to eventual retirement plans
-school system is eliminating positions like mine to save $$ (I dodged the first round of cuts, but who knows later on)
-school system is disrespectful (informed the public of plans to save $$ by eliminating positions via the local paper and employee listserv before telling the affected employees privately first)
-currently no budget for my position/space 

And here are some cons, or reasons why I believe leaving would be difficult:
-said principal has been extremely supportive, and I feel like deciding to suddenly leave would be a slap in the face to them
-I have excellent rapport with the staff &amp; students
-I know my job in the school environment quite well 
-leaving the school environment would make finishing the tail end of my master’s difficult (not impossible, just more difficult to coordinate internships, capstone)

128,"In Texas I have been working steadily at a company for almost exactly a year with promising advancement opportunities. They are coming to fruition after a lot of work man. A job I moved away from my friends for. I am at the beginning stages of this advancement which requires an interview from a 3rd party. I don't want to get into who is specifically the entity of the 3rd party is. But they are vested in seeking and exploring my integrity. Who you think it is, is likely who it is.

So fast forward to the interview after they ask questions about personal 'hiccups' in life, It seems to be going well and normal until the end where a mutual notice of interest is noticed; hinted, hinted again, and reciprocated; I ask out for drinks. Says she is flattered, blushes. But says maybe. Thats okay. On the way out I notice ring, for the first time. I verbalize noticing it. I Say its pretty. She says 'thanks'. Nothing more. We split and I go back to work.

She Calls back next day and says wants to meet up to get drinks. Huh? I am baffled at this point (cause of the ring) and say okay, I also ask while I have her whats the status of the results of the previous meeting. She says she is working on it and will be done 'relatively soon'. I look online. She got married in August (4 months ago).

In summary, this lady has been hired to look what is essentially my integrity. She knows I know she is married. She knows that subsequently I agreed to meet up. But I don't want to make moves on a trap given the potential consequences. 

I only have access to her work phone. She said while talking on the phone we can't text. So Do I call and say I'm not interested anymore while she still has power over me? Do I meet up and explain how I feel? What do I do?

From the beginning of our friendship I had notice a weird behavior towards me and my acts, I while ago I told him I self harm and what does he the day after or a few days after (I don’t really remember)?he told me he wanted to self harm and did. He usually does this kind of things, I told him something I do or did and then he does it too. There are little things too, like I start to be offline on discord and steam and of course he does it too. Today he realice I had my steam profile all private, he told me I was being mysterious, I explained that I don’t like him to control what I do all the time (because he does that too) and thats why I did it  (I mean, I like my privacy) well, just to check if he did it too I entered to his profile and once again, he did it too! 

I know there are things too insignificant, but it kinda makes me feel a little awkward his behavior after all this time and I don’t know how to tell him anymore, I already told him to stop copying me but he always changes subjects or make a dumb excuse.

133,"I’m 21. Nothing in my life has gone right in the past six months. I was cheated on by my ex boyfriend who clearly lost interest in me because he was being weird towards me and then went to the beach with some girl and kissed her. He admitted it to me that he cheated and he knew it would be too hard for us to stay together at the time. This happened while I was away backpacking in another country so at first I was distracted and happy as traveling was my passion. When I came home I discovered he started dating a new girl only a few weeks after we had broken up.  This happened even though he tried to message me a few times the first week we broke up. I was nervous he would move on fast and this girl was one of the girls I was nervous about.  Actually, the most nervous about. Either it was gonna be the girl he cheated with or her. I wonder if he cheated with both these girls but the worst part is I will never know. This isn’t the first time I have felt worthless over a guy.
I have been dropped before by the first guy I ever dated and I just feel terrible about myself because the guy who cheated is the only other guy I have dated besides him. I thought I had found someone who loved me after being dumped but he just got bored too. The worst part is is my ex boyfriends new girl is everything he ever wanted. And he is happy while I am miserable. I live in a small town and this guy has a lot of friends who I know he has told I was crazy or something. I can tell they all are stand-offish towards me. I am afraid to go out in my own town. I am afraid of running into my ex or his new girl. I’m even afraid of running into his friends which has happened so often I literally don’t go out anymore. I already suffer from anxiety, a lot of it being social anxiety so now it has consumed me. 
Here’s the next horrible part. I have done someone else dirty now. I have rebounded with a guy but now it has turned into a four month relationship. He and I are not compatible at all and I am coming close to breaking up with him. I plan to do it in a week when my finals are done and I can sit and have a talk with him. I tried to do it a month ago but he cried so hard and even slightly threatened to harm himself. He has been kind of controlling throughout this relationship. I know that he is a good person but so much has happened in his life he is a very tense and easily upset person. He knows all about how messed up I am about my ex and he is tired of hearing about it. I’m afraid he will spread it around town that I am so distraught over everything. I feel terrible that I am going to break up with him. I know he cares for me and I never want anyone to feel the hurt that I feel now because of my ex. But he doesn’t make enough effort with em when I’m around, he just plays his video games and doesn’t want to go out and do things. I’m so depressed and anxious that I used him as a clutch and I feel so incredibly guilty for it. I also haven’t had a job since I arrived home from my trip. I told myself that I would go home, save money and head out again on another backpacking trip but I have been so depressed that I spend all my time with my new bf. I realized yesterday that I have been home for six months and I would have more than enough money to get out of this town and travel at this point, but because of my lack of motivation and allowing myself to fall into such a depression, I am stuck here until I have enough money to leave. I don’t even have a job yet. It’s going to take so long. I feel so trapped here. I’m gonna break up with my boyfriend and have nobody because my friends are assholes. I’m sorry but they are.

147,"Judging by the title, that may not seem like a problem to most, but it is. But before I explain that, let me share how we got here first.

I am currently a bit short on money, but I need to move out of my current apartment to a better one 'cause this place is a dump. Her best friend...lets call her Viola, owns a house, and she has people staying there who she now dislikes 'cause they are shitty roommates/tenants, but she doesn't want to kick them out because she is tight on money too. My girlfriend...lets call her Bri, was like, why don't I just tell her to kick them out, and you'd be willing to stay over instead, and you'd be willing to give them double what they were paying + clean around the house! (they were staying there for SUPER cheap, so it would still be a fair deal for me). My gf is really excited about this and wants this to happen because she feels its a situation that mutually benefits both her best friends.

The issue is that I find V super attractive. Like she's got the gorgeous blue eyes, a pretty face, and all the standard big boobs, nice butt and great body package blah blah blah, but what's most important (and dangerous) is that I really admire her as a human being. I think she is amazing, and resilient and kind and compassionate and all in all a great person. I look up to her in many ways. That's what makes her so attractive to me.

To make matters worse, I think that she probably feels attracted to me too? For starters, she drunkenly told me I was hot. She also smiles and looks at me...odd? Idk, maybe I'm just imagining it, but I think she does the thing girls do when they're attracted to you, can't really describe it. She's also (jokingly?) mentioned it to my gf that I was hot and that we should have a threesome (they sort of laughed it off, for those that are wondering, so nothing happened). Plus she used to be a ""party girl"" back in the day...kinda still is tbh, but not nearly as wild. She has a legit bf now, so less crazy sex adventures

Anyways, the point is, I absolutely love my girlfriend. We've been together since we were 15. We are 23 now. When I was 18, I knew that this was the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I don't want to move in with her best friend who I am attracted to, and who might possibly be attracted to me, and jeopardize our relationship.

I live in a house with 4 other roommates. We sometimes do stuff together, grab a coffee and a donut. But our friendship is casual, not the getting drunk together and partying kind. I feel that I have a difficulty to bond with people. I feel awkward to speak, when I do wanna speak, I dunno what to say. But also I'm mostly silent around new people, which makes it difficult for me to make new friends.

My dating life is non existent. I have tried Tinder but I would not message the people. If I did, I'd be super bad at making conversation or getting it to flow so naturally nothing came out of it. Also my confidence is too low for my own good. I'm terrified of being shamed for the size of my meat. Stereotypes. Being an international student in a white-majority city doesn't help either.

That said, I did meet someone here but which I managed to screw up by being oblivious to major hints. Obviously now that I realised, the person's probably moved on (it's been months). I still think about her.

I feel sad and alone. I fear that I won't be able to bond with anyone. I feel that no one will ever like me enough to hang around since I have difficulty with communicating and building the relationship. I sometimes feel like I'm the embodiment of the word loser. No good friends. No girlfriend. I'm in college, where supposedly all the fun stuff happens, yet here I am, lying in bed at 2am, 7 hours away from an exam for which I haven't studied. No one cares for me. No one asks if I'm doing well. If I disappear, no one will notice. (Apart from my parents (as I said, loser))

At this point I don't know what to do. This is not who I want to be. I wanna be happy. I wanna be loved. How can I change myself? What do I have to change? Is there anyone willing to give me some advice or to share a story that might inspire me? 

Thank you in advance. :)

151,....I'm not entirely sure how many times I've worn them but I know its more than 14 days and less than 20 days. Any ways on how to fix this or what you did to prevent this?,07Dec2018,1
152,I’m a 15 year old boy (before anyone says anything yes I am young and I have of time on this earth left to live still) so I’ve never really been popular I’ve always been just kinda average fitting into multiple groups but I’ve always had a problem that was talking to girls I’ve always been super shy and awkward around them until I met my best friend she is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen no girls even compare to her in my opinion and her personality is just perfect so the way we met was I saw her in a girl I went to elementary school withs post on Instagram I then followed her and added her on Snapchat and instantly we clicked and became great friends and I liked her and she then liked me and she was the first girl to ever like me and I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes so we planned to meet at the fair and we did and she was perfect but my problem was I was too shy and awkward and she was the complete opposite she always was talking and she could tell I was shy and then my friends pressured me to kiss her which I had never kissed a girl so I had no idea what to do so I didn’t do anything so she just pecked me on the lips and she said “well that was awful” and she had to go then later on about a week later she asked to hangout and I was to nervous to go alone plus she had a friend so I invited my two friends and then we went to a park and then walked to Walmart and instantly my friends stole the show and I barely talked and this was also my last day of summer I had school the next day and then that night she broke up with me because I didn’t talk enough I was completely devastated I cried all night and I was a wreck the next day at school and then I blocked her on everything and was fine after a while but I was still upset and then eventually one girl who was on her volleyball team said can I see your phone and I said why and she said to unblock (the girl I don’t want to say any names) and I said why and she said that the girl liked me again and I didn’t believe it so I unblocked her and we talked and she had been in a long relationship and it was toxic and she missed talking to me and how I treated her Better then all of her other exes (she likes a lot of guys idk if it makes her a hoe or not but whatever) and Then we became friends after her apologizing for being a jerk and then we became friends and eventually became best friends we talked 24/7 it was all we did and then we hung out eventually and I actually talked a lot and got comfortable with her and then about 5 months later I introduced her to friend and he liked her and then she liked him and I didn’t tell her not to even though I knew I was in love with her and they dated and I told her I couldn’t see them together it hurt me too bad and I told her how I felt and she said I’m so sorry I wish you told me earlier and then I made her block me on everything (I promised her I wouldn’t ever block her and I never broke a promise to her) this took a week or harassing her to block me because if I blocked her I’d just unblock her right away I’ve met a lot of girls and she is the only one I’ve ever clicked like this with and she said to me that we were going to get married in ten years and I called her crazy but she convinced me and we planned out our future I did it for fun but she actually thought it would happen and so then eventually she begged me to come back and be her friend and I said no but it was hard and then he cheated on her and I was pissed and then I became her friend again and we were doing really good until tonight she would tell me something like how she liked a guy and I would say something insensitive on accident like You lead people on too much or you like too many people and we’d get in stupid silly arguments like that and we did this even before she blocked me originally and it has always been a major problem i our relationship and I said I’d stop but I always forgot what I was doing and so I did it tonight and she was done on her last nerve and she said she needed a day away from me but I was too scared it meant forever so I kept texting her about how sorry I was and she lost it and blocked my number on Snapchat she hasn’t blocked me yet or on Instagram but I’ve messaged her a lot and I don’t know what to do I need her she’s my only friend and she’s the best friend I’ve ever had and I’m in love with her and she doesn’t want to lose me but she can’t deal with me being toxic like this in her life what do I do?

153,"Hi- not a relationship or personal question this time! (also, if anyone can reccomend a more specific subreddit for this question that would be nice, thanks!)

&amp;#x200B;

I found a really pretty cream colored dress in a thrift shop. Its old, like from the 80's, no tag but im pretty sure its cotton. I would like to wear it to my sister's wedding next month, so i need to dye it a color other than off-white. I'm thinking pale blue. It also has some lace edging

&amp;#x200B;

a. Would it be better to just dye it all blue, including the lace, or try to keep the lace out somehow?

b. is cream-to-blue a good idea, or should i try a different color

I'm not that mad anymore I kinda of really miss her and kinda wanna make friends again but also I'm still a little mad at her i guess i have mixed feelings I feel like I deserve an apology and she should be the one to make up with me all in all I kinda just miss her and I don't know if I should make friends with her or not any advice on this would really help it's been a few months now like 4 or 5 and I generally miss her but I don't know if I should make friends with her or not",07Dec2018,1
155,"My town is filled with merging lanes and of course assholes. For example, to get to my campus I must merge onto a two lane road from the right side. That two lane road then meets at a traffic light, and continues into a turning lane on the left side about 3 or 4 miles later. So that means I have to cross two lanes in order to get to the correct turning lane located in the opposite side. This isn’t a busy intersection so this usually isn’t a problem.

But today the left lane of the two lane highway was blocked off for construction and did not reopen until the traffic light. Which left me about mile or two to merge into the left lane that I needed to be in. With one lane closure, traffic was pretty backed up. So no one was going very fast and it took awhile for me to get over. I had my blinker on for a good 3 minutes and was able to get into the right lane for about 1 minute. My blinker was still on, signaling my desire to get into the turning lane, but as soon as the the turning lane begins, the car behind me speeds up and literally tries to keep me from merging into the turning lane, as if my blinker had not been on and in front of him for a long while. The turning lane light traffic light was red anyway. The guy gets out of his car and starts screaming that I cut him off until another guy comes up and tells him to leave me alone and to shut up before he calls the cops. Thank god for that guy but still. This is a college town and this is finals week so maybe he was stressed from exams but still, how do you deal with rude drivers that don’t let you merge and have road rage?",07Dec2018,1

157,"I'm an 18 year old senior currently enrolled in High School. For my entire life, I've had Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). It's pretty tame most days, but some times it can flare up really bad causing nausea, diarrhea, painful cramps, bloating, gas, and sometimes constipation. I also have a weaker immune system. Last year, I ended up missing around 35 days of school due to sickness. Eventually, I was put on a program called Home Hospital. This was basically temporary home school until I got better. It took a month for me to fully heal from a sickness I had caught called Bell's Palsy. I went back and completed my Junior year. This year, I'm having some similar problems. So far I've missed 22 days of school. Most of them due to me having a minor sickness, or my IBS acting up. It's hard for me to come to school when my IBS is acting up due to the excessive bathroom trips and cramping in my stomach. I can never stay focused when that's happening, therefore, it hinders my ability to learn so I usually stay home so that the next day I can come in and be able to focus and catch up on what I missed the day before. Most of these absences are not excused due to me not being able to go to the doctor every single time I get a flare up, which is usually no more than twice a week. So today, I was attempting to turn in a permission slip to go on a field trip to help out at a local homeless shelter. We had to pay 4$ so that our trip was paid and bring in some stuff to donate to the homeless shelter to help them. I brought in my items and gave my teacher the 4$. She then told me that it was ""iffy"" if I was going to be able to go or not. I asked her why. She responded with something along the lines of ""The principal said you have too many absences"". She then said that she was waiting further instructions on if I was permitted to go or not. About 10 minutes pass and she got an email saying I wasn't allowed to go. I was pretty bummed out to say the least. Eventually I texted my parents and told them what was going on, and they called my school and talked to the principal about it. About two hours later, I was called to his office. He started questioning me about why I had been missing so much school, which my parents had explained earlier that day, and the year before when I got really sick. I had to tell him about my immune system not being the greatest and my IBS. For whatever reason, they still hadn't documented that I had IBS. He then brought up how the field trip was the least of my worries. He essentially said that if I continued to miss school, I would possibly get my permit revoked. I told him that didn't matter to me that much since I only drive when necessary, due to me getting car sick. He then said, in a threatening sounding way, that I would also miss out on prom. I don't much care about prom so I told him that'd be fine. Then lastly, he said if I missed more than 8 more days, I wouldn't walk at my graduation. He had kept trying to find something that would have my attention, and this got it. I know that I need to walk at my graduation. My parents are very expecting of me to do my best in school. He even set a limit. 8 more days. He had full control over the situation. I felt very threatened during this situation. Then he also decided to say that if I miss 3 more days within 3 months, I will lose my permit. At this point, I felt ever more threatened by his actions. He was willing to take these away from me, knowing about my conditions. I was angry to be honest. I didn't know what to do. I just agreed and went back to class. Now if I miss more than 3 days in 3 months, I lose my permit. If I miss 8+ days, I can't walk. This seems impossible knowing that I will most likely get sick with something more severe within the next couple weeks. I don't really wanna have to force myself to go to school if I'm down sick, or dealing with a flare up of my IBS, but it seems I will have to. I really need advice for what I can do to deal with this. I'm so lost about this whole situation currently.

158,"First of all, my parents don’t believe I have anything wrong so I don’t want to hear anything that involves them.  I still want advice though.

162,"Over the past several months, my current position has required me to work very closely (5-6 hours a day) with an employee who I have started to develop romantic feelings for.

We both have the same interests/hobbies, compatible personalities, and I feel genuinely happy when I am around her/working with her. I broke off a very unhealthy long-term relationship about six months ago, and frankly, I have never felt such genuine feelings of attraction for someone as I do when I am around her.

However, while it is obvious that there is a mutual attraction between us, I am not sure whether she desires an actual relationship like I do. While we have in-depth and deep conversations both inside and outside of work, we seldom discuss our past relationships or our dating lives.

Second, one of the biggest problems is our company's strict dating policies, which is especially troublesome given my position. I (male) am her bosses' boss, and a male superior dating a female subordinate openly would spell trouble. I have worked for my company for quite a few years and I have worked my tail off to earn my job title.

So, I guess my questions are: Is it worth it? Is it worth potentially compromising my reputation in my company for starting a relationship with her? Should I even express my feelings to her? Or is the risk of possibly ruining a great professional relationship with her a bad idea?",07Dec2018,1
163,"I just turned 21 and my life is over, or thats what it feels like.  I know I'm young and all, but it is hard to get that thought out of my head.

Some backstory,  I was a very difficult child.  I was immature for a long time and I grew up slowly and no one has ever forgiven me for that.  Not my parents, teachers, advisors, anyone.  I'm constantly talked down to like I am younger than I am and no one takes me seriously.  I'm also majorly depressed and this coupled with the self doubt that being talked down too my entire life has left me with has left me with little to no work ethic.  Therapy and medicine have never been helpful.  I'm also in a very difficult major that I hate with shit grades because I can't make myself study or work anymore because school is so hard and so unrewarding. I'd change majors, but at this point I can't afford the extra years of school that I would need to take to do something more enjoyable.

So here I am at 21 in a major I hate with a GPA so low that I am un-hireable in my field, I am depressed and I hate myself, and not a single person I know will take me or my dreams seriously.  I can't even tell anyone what those dreams are because I know I'll either be laughed at or talked down to like a small child and told why I should set my sights lower.  I seriously hate everything about my life right now and I have no idea what to do.  A big part of me just wants to give up, and while I'm not ready to do that, its harder to ignore that urge every day.

166,"Before I continue with this post I need to clarify a few things, I have nothing against people being bisexual or any of that LGBT stuff. I simply don't appreciate being labelled as what I am not. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

This is all started when I was 15/16 (I'm 18), from what I have taken from the situation. This new girl had just moved to my school, and being an egotistical teenager I wanted to make her mine not really contemplating the emotions involved of that particular relationship. I feel really bad about it now but, it's in the past and I was stupid. One day, I left my Facebook account logged in on messenger on her iPad at school. That night I get messages from her upset because she has read through ALL my messages. When I was this age I hadn't had sex yet and wasn't affirmative of my own sexuality, you could say bi-curious as well as a bit of a mental mess. Anyways, I had my sisters gay friend hit on me and this other guy did too. Being me, too anxious and too scared to say anything of it I just tried to be polite and decline like I would a female. But. When I decided to break up with the new girl she decided to spread a plethora of rumours about me. I don't even know them to be exact but it involves having sex with the pair of them. It's the only thing that makes me insecure and I kinda am adept with dealing how I am perceived, or at least tolerating it.

Being 18 just broke up with one of the first people I have truly loved, let's call her X. I know I'm not exactly the masculine person either but that doesn't dictate my sexuality. Anyways. Recently I was talking to one of my good friends, he was good to me and X. He kept suggesting that I talk to her about me not being bisexual as a conversation topic because we aren't speaking at the moment. Which seemed suspicious. We talked more and I gathered that X seeing me again is contingent with her thinking I'm bisexual. And that I don't know it yet because I don't fully know myself. Which is upsetting because I explained the shit that happened when I was 15/16 to X. It really bothers me now because I know some of X's friends talk to some people I used to associate with. I almost wanna throw up thinking about it.

I wanted to ultimately ask how do I assert myself as a hetero without just blatantly saying it? I wanna make it clear somehow to everyone without appearing that I'm trying to cover something up. I've contemplated a Facebook post explaining everything but that feels a bit much to me.

Any advice would really be appreciated.

171,"Ok so two days ago I had a terrible runny nose so I went to the pharamacy to get some sinus medicine. I took it. My runny nose stopped. However, there was also another effect. I got a razor sharp focus and was able to do work that would normally take me 2 days to do in just 6 hours. It was the most productive I've ever been in the entire semester. 

I knew this had to do something with the cold medicine. I looked at the ingredients and it turns out that it contains 30 mg of pseudoephedrine, which is apparently a stimulant. I took one pill and my regular cup of coffee. A combination of these two stimulants turned me into a studying monster.

I have 3 days of studying left. I have 5 finals next week. 

I didn't take the medication today and my productivity is no where close to what it was yesterday. (look at me wasting time making this post on reddit).

This makes me think... should I take this cold medicine once a day for the next 3 days to help study for the test?

It seems like a no-brainer. It shouldn't have any harmful side effects because it's only one pill a day for three days only. 

But another side of me says that I shouldn't rely on drugs to enhance my performance. I will feel like I didn't truly achieve it even if I got high scores on my finals.... But then again, that's better than receiving low scores? But if I do this, I feel like I will continue taking the medication whenever I need to focus, and this will lead to abuse.

So the situation is, my ^((online, Let's call him Kurtis)) boyfriend of 3 yrs &amp; ongoing, lost his Grandparents who raised him, 2yrs ago.  
He still hasn't gotten over their deaths, nor do I think he's gotten passed the depressive stages of losing two people that meant so much to him. He takes nightly walks &amp; I'll be there with him, texting. I have asked him why he runs off at night in the cold. He tells me ""The cold numbs the pain. No matter how far I go, they won’t come back. No matter where I run they won’t be there...""  
Two months prior to Kurtis losing his own grandparents, I lost my own, that raised me.  
I know what it's like but my grief was shorter than his... &amp; I don't know what this is like for HIM.  
Now Kurtis' brother, who lives in another country, is in &amp; out of the hospital for epilepsy &amp; blackouts.   
It is making Kurtis really consider give up his current job &amp; lifestyle, to move to that country out of fear that is making him think he'll end up losing his brother, too. He refuses to listen to any sort of logic, &amp; tells me he ""won't let it happen"".  
It's heartbreaking, I'm at a loss. He's constantly stressing &amp; working himself up. It pains me to see him this way...

175,"I’m 19 and going to cinema school this January to a big city. Before I made the admission exam and interview, I decided to enter a seminar from the school I was interested to check out their vibe. In the seminar we were 15 members and we were supposed to review and analyze each other’s scripts. I’m used to being the youngest member of a lot of the courses and classes I take, but for the first time in my life I was looked down because of my age. I had just gotten out of high school and all of these people had careers and some even been to important film festivals. It got to the point where, during break time, I got close to them to talk and they just heard me for a little bit and then just ignored me and talked to someone else. I tried not to let this discourage me and kept participating during the debates, which I think I did okay. 

Anyways, I started with the best attitude I could and shared my script about a girl who feels guilty about aborting a baby and how toxic guilt can be. I knew my story was still far from perfect, but I never expected the kind of backlash I got, where the women in the seminar even stopped debating my script and started attacking my own stance on abortion, how they doubted I was pro choice and how I dared made women feel guilty for aborting after all they’ve fought to have it legalized. I originally meant the opposite of it, but I felt so intimidated I just couldn’t defend my story. This woman in particular made me feel really bad since she’s a hardcore liberal and activist. I tried to be really nice to her, but she just walked away with a serious face. Worse part? She’s my future teacher and a true jewel in independent Mexican cinema.

Finally the seminar ended and I went back to my small home town, but then I went back for the final admission interview. I thought I was ready and confident. I thought I was sufficiently prepared for the questions, but then I got really nervous and started answering like a beauty pageant contestant, and the same teacher from before straight up told me “You’re answers don’t convince me, elaborate”, which made me even more nervous. Thinking back, my answers weren’t the worst in the world, but to me, it was in fact, the worst I’ve ever given. I left the interview with watery eyes and then finally cried all the way home and two straight days after that. Given that they only accept 15 of the brightest students every year, I was sure they weren’t going to pick me, but magically they did. I was so confused, but happy, and when I told my family they were really proud. Days later I casually commented the lack of women I saw at the interviews, to which my cousin responded to “Maybe that’s why they picked you.”, and honestly, I’m scared she’s right.

To sum up, I’m afraid my future college professors, and therefore classmates, think I’m just a submissive dumb pretty faced girl, and that they only admitted me to their school to have a gender balanced group. As if moving to a big city wasn’t scary enough, this is just the cherry on top. What do I do to stop being afraid?",07Dec2018,1

177,"Im 19 years old. Ive been wanting my parents to divorce since I was 7. My dad has been a great dad. Hes been able to show me good morals and been a good father to me and my sister. However he hasnt been the best husband. I have a step sister thats ONE WEEK OLDER THAN ME. my mom was devastated when she found he had cheated on her. (She had 2 miscarriages before me, she felt like she couldnt give my dad the kids he wanted, idk if he cheated on her cause of this. She finally was able to get pregnant with me). When I was 7, I saw how my dad would humiliate my mom. (My mom is the sweet humble woman. She's the best. She's so naive and loving.) She would be so excited over something new, and hed quickly humiliate her and make her feel worthless. They have always fought. My dad has anger issues. Hes never physically attacked my mom, but he has always screamed at her and shes very emotional and sweet and cries easily. They have good moments, but they havw horrible moments too. A couple years ago they got into a HUGE fight bc my mom caught my dad flirting w a woman. He quickly got mad and turned it on her saying ""is your fault for checking my stuff, you dont trust me, its your fault for thinking of shit like that, were just friends thats how we talk"" and she quickly apologized. Little things like this has been happening and my mom cries and he just doesnt seem to care. My mom works her ass off to make the house clean and have him food ready for when he comes home, and he'll just go off on her for no reason. Anyways lately I've seen him spending more time on his phone then usual I have even seen him texting other ladies and saw him deleting messages. My mom has noticed some signs and asked him about it and he quickly turned it around on her too. I dont know what to do. My little sister is too young to understand. I hate my dad for this. I have even catch him saying comments such as ""it was 23 years ago that I got trapped, I thought it was just going to be for a fun little while"". This makes me sick to my stomach and makes me wanna fucking cry... I know my mom wont listen to anything bc she loves him too much.

179,"My friend and I recently moved into an apartment together for college, she had already been going for a year before I transferred. I suffer from OCD/social anxiety, so moving was a big deal for me and the transition was really tough. I'd been debating whether or not to get my cat registered as an ESA, my therapist agreed with this, I was just nervous about stressing my cat out as she'd never left my house before. 

Jump ahead to the present, I've finally decided to let my therapist write the letter, and my friend tells me that she's probably going to bring her cat up too. As a registered ESA.

I already took some issue with the idea of having two cats that don't know each other live together, but the fact that she's getting him ""registered"" as an ESA is extremely frustrating. She doesn't suffer from any mental illnesses, she told me she was ""just going to order a fake letter online.""

I guess it just really bothers me that my friend would be that kind of person to do that kind of thing. I get that it's not uncommon to rig the system but it's that doesn't make it better, especially for the people who aren't lying about it. Most of my issue is probably in the fact that getting the ESA letter was this huge struggle for me personally because I wanted to be sure that I actually needed my cat, that it wasn't just me missing her, it wasn't a fun semester for me and it sucked to realize just how bad I was on my own.

I don't even know how to approach her about it. She's always been extremely defensive and I don't want to piss her off or make it seem like I'm saying it because I don't want her cat there (though that is a whole other issue to discuss.)

What do I say to her? Or should I not say anything?",07Dec2018,1
180,"I recently got a job in my career field and this wasn’t an issue that came to my mind in my last two weeks on the job. The job I left, held me down for three years and threw my undergrad. Many of my best friends still work there.
We can call him something simple, like Bill, for the sake of the post.
 Bill had always rubbed me the wrong way. I mean that to be as cliché as it sounds. I just felt like, in any other circumstance, he and I would have never looked at each other. He got along great with all of the office at first and again when he began to hang out in our group of friends. We soon learned that he was fitting in with everyone because he always changed his opinion to fit that of the group of people he was with. With some people he was a full blown atheist and with others he had always believed in a higher power because he was raised Baptist. The full on lies started around then too. Inconsistencies that I would notice with his stories. At first you catch one of those, and you think, “Hey, maybe he’s just changing embellishing. We are all a little guilty of that.” Eventually the truth came out on all of his “important” and troubling opinions and in a Facebook post, of all things. All of which contradicted everything he had ever told anyone in our group.
I don’t want to get down into the details as much because people’s view on religion and politics doesn’t matter to me. People can’t control the circumstances in which they were raised but there are lines you can’t cross. Right and wrong; that kind of thing. But he went as far as to rape shame someone talking about a traumatic experience they had when they were younger. Thankfully I was in the room, so I can quote him as saying, “Well I hope you can learn to forgive all men someday.” I had no idea he had such a charming way with words. Now, I know this instance could just be chalked up as ignorance and arrogance on his part. When she asked him to repeat what he said he started to backpedal and stammer through a statement about how sorry he feels for her.

It was around this time that I started to notice he would copy people’s ways of phrase and would always be the first person to start copying people’s comedic bits to make other people laugh. Bits and inside jokes are made to be shared, that’s just a fact. Again, this doesn’t sound like an issue at all, in fact, I can think of ten people who I knew in high school who would do the same kind of thing. I don’t think any of them would take credit for starting any of the jokes though. Or go as far as threatening someone to, “Shut the Fuck up” for saying that they didn’t come up with the bit. He still uses them over and over. To the point that no one even makes those jokes anymore, other than him. It became clear that getting a laugh and being the last to get a word in was like a drive for him. It sounds horrible to say but he has made it clear that he loves the sound of his own voice. 
I know Bill is a person, made of his own experiences and his own history, but I am seriously afraid for the people I care about. At a party recently his girlfriend was incredibly intoxicated and wanted to go to sleep. He kept verbally shaming her and telling her that they had guests and that she was being stupid before grabbing her by the wrist and pulling her back down to her seat so she could finish the game we were playing. Our group kind of shared a look that something needed to change that night, but it hasn’t really been brought up since. 
I know that the right thing to do, would be to say something to him myself. Heck, now that I don’t work with him, I feel like it’s an obligation. I just don’t want to make it a worse place for my loved ones to work if I lodged a complaint with corporate. 

If anyone can think of someone like Bill in their own life, or has had a similar experience, I could really use some help.

I (18M) am going through another much stronger slump of depression. I went through a 2 1/2 year period of feeling extremely lonely and sad between freshman and sophomore year. The thing that got me out of it really was my girlfriend, we met and things were complicated at first but she was there for me for the most part and I felt genuinely needed for the first time in years. 

A few months back she dumped me, a month later my best friend in the whole world dms me, confessing that he and my ex have been dating for a while behind my back. I felt absolutely crushed, and in a desperate time of need I turned to another very close friend of mine, who ultimately sided with my ex. I was extremely shy and quiet and these three people used to be the only three people I'd talk to, and they were all just gone like that.

I've been dealing with trust issues, like I can't trust like any of my other friends anymore because of what happened. Darker thoughts have started popping in my head, and I've tried to talk get through this on my own but I couldn't. I started seeing therapists, talking to my parents more even, just to see if anything would help. I've only felt worse and worse.

I'm genuinely afraid I may harm myself during a panic attack or something. I don't feel like I can think logically as much anymore. I think I'm going insane.

I'm just really lonely, and even if I do start talking to people, I have a hard time trusting anyone right now. I'm trying my best to help myself, but lately I've been missing a lot of school due to panic attacks I get in the morning. My appetite is completely gone too. In the span of a few weeks, I lost 8 pounds, and I'm already very underweight.

I would like to go to college but I don't know yet. I plan on being a freelance designer but I know that going to college would look good. 

I've messed around with Photoshop, Illustrator, and etc. I've researched the pros and cons of going to college and being self taught. I'm currently leaning towards being self taught because it'll allow me to work at my own paste and that I won't be in debt.

197,"My (21) boyfriend (24) has been ignoring me for the last two weeks.

We don't live together (in fact, he lives in a different city but commuting back and forth is no problem here) and have been in an exclusive relationship for the past three months. Everything seemed to be going well: we would regularly see each other and talk over the phone or text, whether it was to check on each other, say hello, highlight interesting news, share funny pictures or videos or to make plans. We complement each other very well; we have a lot of chemistry, share similar values and interests but we are also different enough that it's not like we are dating ourselves. It's effortless with him. He recently said ""I love you"" and I said it back.

He was recently offered a job in a different country (country X) and he asked me how I felt about it. I told him that I was not pleased by the idea of him moving country because we had just started dating, but was happy for him. He reassured me that he wouldn't take the job as he didn't want to move. Fast forward to last week, I am trying to arrange something for us to do and ask him when he'll be coming back to my city. He doesn't respond (this is unusual because he is usually very responsive), worried I try calling him but the phone just rings. The next day he calls saying he's actually in country X and doesn't know when he'll be back. I am obviously taken aback by this - he never mentioned travelling to this country when I spoke to him throughout the week or when I saw him on the weekend before - and have no idea what to say to him; he doesn't volunteer anymore information but I suspected it was because of the job. I don't instigate any communication between us after this because I needed a moment to let it sink in, I was deeply hurt and confused by his behaviour, and plus, I didn't want to come across as accusatory and demanding but he didn't try to communicate at all and just left it at that.

I couldn't handle the silence anymore and I ended up reaching out to him, via text, 4 days later, just to make sure he was okay and to see if I could get more information out of him. He said it was because he was conflicted and trying to figure out what to do - he wants to take the job, but he also wants to be with me and is not sure if I would want a long (er) distance relationship. Soon after receiving this text, I try to call him but the phone just goes unanswered, I text him urging him to call me and telling him that I want him to do what is best for him and that I love him. Again, I'm met with silence.

He is ignoring me and I am very hurt. I want to talk to him and I'm willing to go see him, but he won't answer my calls or respond to my texts. I don't think I can carry on like this ( I don't want to) but I love him.

200,"So a couple of months ago I met this really attractive girl and we had a lot in common. We studied the same subject, were both trying to overcome anxiety, our conversations always flowed well and we just seemed to connect well in general.

She would always kind of flirt with me and tell me super personal things but never really told me she flat out liked me either so I was constantly having to guess. Anyway everything was going fine but this one time after we met we were texting and she made a kinky suggestion, so despite being a bit nervous I made a kinky reply back... however I felt tremendously embarrassed straight after saying it and jokingly said 'lol bye'. She took it quite literally and ever since then started acting super blunt and even wanted to end our friendship. I'm guessing this may stem from some sort of fear of abandonment or past negative experiences? I made it clear I was joking but she refused to listen.

I tried my best to try and sort things out, but despite us still talking she seemed super distant and would often just not reply. So I got kind of fed up of trying to 'fix' the situation and just told her I was done trying and didn't want to speak anymore. She got kind of mad and blocked me on most social platforms.

We haven't spoken in 2 months but because we have lots of mutual friends I have still seen her several times since. It's super awkward and we barely talk. However the weird thing is when we're in a group chat over the phone with others she talks to me as if things are completely fucking normal. 

I know she's dealt with issues in the past so I'm guessing perhaps why this all happened? I take responsibility too, I feel like I was perhaps a bit too clingy and immature. From what I gather she does care about me and the few times I say I'm not going to a meetup with mutual friends she seems pretty bummed from the texts she sends. 

Anyway - I've been thinking about her a lot the past 2 months. It's taken a lot of self control not to message her but I don't want to live in regret either. I am contemplating texting her and firstly asking her consent/permission to talk (because she has blocked me on other platforms) and then going from there if she's cool with it. 

My issue is that I don't want to seem like a creep. We have mutual friends and part of me thinks she'll tell all our friends that I tried to contact her and it'll just be embarrassing. Plus I might just be another one of the many guys she speaks to and I might end up feeling stupid. Hell, she might just have seen me as purely a friend all along and maybe this was all in my head.

Is it worth the hassle or do I just let it go? I know she's super anxious/non-confrontational type so even if she ever wanted to talk to me she'd never do it. Especially after I coldly said bye the last time we spoke. I want to text her but I also don't want to come across as a creep/harasser etc.

206,"Hi all, 

First thing first, please bear with my english, it is not my mother's tongue. Also, please don't get mad with typos, I'm typing this on my phone and trying my best to not make too many mistakes. 

Now on the subject - I have always struggled to find where I belong. I turned 20 last month, and I really feel like I should have at least an idea where I'm headed to in life.

The feeling of not belonging anywhere is getting to me because I feel like I don't have any purpose and that life is pointless. I won't go into much details but I'll say a few words about me so you can get an idea.

 I'm a female college student with a part time job, living in an Eastern European country. I currently live with my mother, grandfather and dog. I'm studying EU studies, but I feel like I got the wrong field. I don't bother to do any changes as I'm positive I won't like anything I choose - or at least what my university offers. So I'm spending day after day feeling like I've waisted 2 years of my life there. I won't go as far to say I hate my job, my colleagues are actually pretty decent people and we're paid good enough - but I don't see myslef working there for much longer as there's not a lot of opportunity for growth.

Now my biggest problem - I am not good at anything. Don't get me wrong, I'm decent with a lot of things but I'm not GOOD good with anything. Same goes to my interests and hobbies, I like many different stuff, but I'm not passionate about anything. I loose energy in many activities and in the end I'm still unhappy and lost. Even my personal sence of style is not defined - I wear different styles of clothes. My taste in music is really broad too. The types of people I'm friends with are so different you may think they come from another planet. I am so ""decentralized"" as a person, and the experiences, knowledge, friends and interests I have are so diverse and unrealated that I don't feel like a ""whole"" person but rather pieces of different people assembled together. 

So guys, here's my final question: When and how did you find yourself? Tell me your story, give me advice... I hope I'm not alone in this.

210," I work in a field where I don’t have complete control over my return in investment. Lately my figures have been down from last year, but I’m working hard and trying to improve my stats - still, it’s not the result the business wants.

Every meeting I have with my boss lately he mentions the idea of hiring a business on the outside to support my channel that I would lead. This alone isn’t too worrying as lots of people on my team have 3rd party businesses that support the channel they’re in charge of. 

But then after playing with the idea again he goes “we wouldn’t be replacing you though” “we’d never replace you” “you’d be in charge of course, we wouldn’t dream of replacing you”

He says it A LOT. Should I be worried? To me it feels like he wouldn’t mention it if he hadn’t been thinking about it. But maybe he is just trying to make sure I don’t worry about a business coming in for support?

Its made me start looking for other jobs anyway. I’m pretty sure they can’t fire me anyway without warning… what do you guys think?

**TL;DR:** Boss keeps telling me I’m not going to be replaced… sounds to me like I’m going to be replaced.",07Dec2018,1
211,"First of all my apologies for formatting and grammar and length- I’m on my cell and I’m very tired.

A little bit of a backstory: 
When I was growing up I had a awful step-dad who was prone to violent outbursts. If I or something pissed him off he would get in my face screaming at the top of his lungs, chase me around the house to yell at me, slam anything that could move, knocked over lamps and chairs and whatnot. I would go so far as to escape to the attic to just be away from the anger and loudness and he would hunt me down and yell at me for trying to run away from him, even after an argument had passed. It got to the point if I heard movement from his general direction of the house I would retreat to another area. He was a big influence on my mental health and my young suicidal ideations.

A few years passed and mom came to the conclusion I had been telling her the truth for 17 years that her husband was just a terrible person. She had come to terms with this, even going so far to tell one of my siblings (my 18 yo brother and his own child) that he “really f*ked me up.” But that another story for another time. He is no longer a main component of my life, so I’m good with that now.

Fast forward to my mid-20s, I get my own apartment and life is good for a year. Then my landlord cuts a deal and lets two insane people move in downstairs. One of them is a man who recently lost his son and has never been sober any time I’ve seen him. He’s approached me several times coming up to knock on my door drunk with a bleeding head contusion and trying to hug me and apologize for his and my other neighbor’s behavior, sometimes following me the short 30 steps to my car and trying to talk to me when I clearly don’t want to. The other neighbor is a young man who is in AA (according to is off/on ex who comes to slam on his door and scream at ungodly hours) whom I have never seen not under some kind of influence either. My last few months living there was awful. They would play insanely loud music that made my windows rattle and my couch shake, I could hear the helicopter sounds from the younger mans video games. I lived at the top 3rd  floor of the house-turned-apartment and I would take the back locked entrance to get up two flights of stairs to my place. They could get to their 2nd floor apartments from the front and the back. I don’t know why but sometimes they would go all the way up to the top by my door and then back down the other side to one of their doors. I remember holding my breath waiting for them to go down the stairs when they would walk by my door. They never seemed to walk anywhere, always stomping. One night they got drunk, somehow got ahold of a mic, an amp, and a guitar and proceeded to sing the worst version of Sound of Silence I’d ever heard. Every loud sound, or unneeded walk by my door made my heartbeat skyrocket and my body go completely still, even if my boyfriend was with me. I often had to talk him down from confronting them when he got angry. I was always scared and afraid to tell the landlord because they were all friends with each other.

I eventually moved out and went to live with my boyfriend. On the last walk through with my landlord I advised him not to be surprised if the person who moves in after me leaves or calls him with noise complaints. I’d almost called the cops several times myself. He is surprised and tells me that I should have told him, I explained that I feared retaliation from the men and he seemed to understand. 

So the reason I’m asking is tonight I went into a panic attack from the sounds of a cat being stupid and getting stuck in a closet at my mom’s house. I’m sick, and also on pain medication so a little groggy as well. But I start to hear sounds of the cats walking around on the floor boards upstairs and it sounds like people stomping around (we have enormously fat kitties) and I start to hyperventilate. We also have bunnies thumping around a huge tank and it’s not exactly helping, but I’ve become familiar enough to distinguish the sound. But it keeps sounding like someone is knocking/slapping/sweeping at a door somewhere. I call my mom in a panic and even though she is out with her girlfriends she understands and stays with me on the line so I can walk around the house and assure myself that I’m safe. No one is hear and I just chalk it up to my groggy drug-induced mind. She says goodbye and I try to watch television, but I still hear it. It starts up every time I pause Parks &amp; Rec. and stops as soon as I unpause. My heart feels like it’s going to throw itself out of my chest. In the end I gather myself and a broomstick to walk around again. I find the dumb cat in the stupid closet and nearly meltdown with relief. 


So I’ve come to the conclusion that I have a fear of loud sounds, men, and maybe being alone. Is there any advice or helpful things to do when one of these episodes strikes again?

Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me horribly. All this in a bad way? When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way which confuses me because I worry she thinks I’m a gross loser

Edit: she started saying the ‘awww’ from when I’d get up to leave at the end of every appointment since the time I failed an interview a few months ago for not having enough confidence but I usually would say ‘oh ok thank you’ when I’d get up to leave at the end when she said awww so it could be that idk",07Dec2018,1

235,"Throwaway account.

Tl;dr I lent a (now ex) boyfriend $1000. I contacted his family to get my money back because he ghosted, but they're only willing to give me back half of it. I have some slightly damaging screenshots on him and contemplating using them as leverage for the rest, but having serious doubts if I should. He is now engaged. I discovered I was the side chick. I don't think his fiance knows.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so dumb and embarrassed typing this out, but I'm so anxious I feel like I will puke and implode at the same time, and this thing, this shame and humiliation and bitterness and anger is controlling my life and affecting my work. I'm pretty shit at telling a story so bear with me. I was in a relationship with a guy for a few months and at first everything was going great.. he even once told me that he wishes his mom could have met me (his mom passed away two years ago). I saw the red flags but was dumb, depressed, and desperate to not be alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made the mistake of lending him money (yes I know, all my fault). He never gives it back, he starts treating me horribly, so I break up with him via text (I was so absolutely sick and heartbroken and just wanted everything to go away) and asked him to return the money before a set date. A month and a half later I run into an engagement picture – his.. I was the side chick. I confront him via phone, he pretends that his relationship with her happened after our breakup, and says he'll see what he can do to give me back the money. He ghosts me, so I headed over to facebook and texted his dad. Ex gets mad, gives me a vague threat via text to back off or else there will be payback (probably in the form of humiliating me in front of friends or family, but I'm not sure really). I keep texting his dad, but my anxiety is at 1000%. At first, dad cooperates, and passes me over to his daughter, the sister. She is extremely rude and aggressive and only wants to give back half of it. See, my dumbass gave him 500 in cash, so they just gave back what I can prove. 

Now it's my move. I have some screenshots of him pretty much begging me to buy him food/delivery to his place. I have screenshots of the barely-dressed pics he sent me and basically just proof that were dating. I am considering telling his sister that If I don't get back my money, I will send everything, including her responses to me to the fiance. I've never done something like this before. I'm generally a naive person who never gets in the way and I'm not sure what the consequences to a ""warning"" like this could be. I will fully go through with it if sister doesn't give me back what I'm owed, but I feel this is bigger than me.

Some unknowns here are whether he has something on ME. Well, I never sent anything close to nudes, barely even face selfies. But what if he secretly has something on me? I am also from an extremely conservative country. This COULD be incredibly damaging. 

Reddit, would this revenge benefit me or would it backfire? The intended outcome is to get my money back. If not, the secondary goal is to ruin his relationship with his family and fiance. I'm also contemplating to just be happy I even got half of it and just close this chapter forever and just live with the humiliation and consider that lost $500 a dumb tax and an expensive lesson. I'm so lost. What would you do if you were me? What would you do if you were the sister? I'm trying to plan for all possible outcomes.

239,"So I met this guy years ago, and we quickly became best friends. Originally it was innocent and fun, but as time went on, cracks started to show. He would constantly push boundaries- with me, with other people, or in general. By this I mean he would like randomly spit on peoples cars or door handles because it was funny, or persecute people for their appearance/race/etc. as they passed by intentionally loud enough so that they could hear him. He has also committed some petty acts of crime and vandalism I won’t get into. Obviously I was horrified. I’ve tried to discourage this behavior in the past but he’s impossible.

Here’s the thing though; I have no other friends. When I first met him I was completely socially isolated and would be again if I tried to cut things off. My relationship with my family is strained (distant) too, so if I cut him off I’m worried I’d commit suicide. In fact, I’m pretty certain I would.

I realized this problem early on. At the time I was desperate and went along with his jokes (to an extent). And as he kept doing worse and worse shit, so did I (no illegal shit but still). But I hate it. I hate myself more than I did before I met him.

I’ve been trying to meet other people, and while my social anxiety and appearance have improved greatly since before, I have yet to form another connection with anyone else (so the social anxiety is still there).

I’m a senior now. I was originally planning on waiting until college to cut things off with him completely but I can’t stand it anymore. I feel absolutely worthless, and I know I deserve it because of the things I’ve done or said in the past.

262,"  

So, for the last four/five years things have gone steadily downhill in my life. A family friend got diagnosed with Cancer (he survived, fortunately) my Gran got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. My Grandfather got diagnosed with Cancer (he has since gone into remission). 

These are the real major points. My Gran has gone downhill terribly and is a shell of her former self. She isn’t well but is well enough to know she doesn’t want to go into a home, which is a sticking point. She has carers come out, but they can only do so much. My Grandfather refuses to spend their savings on fulltime carers, even though they’ve got enough money to cover the costs for the remainder of their lives. 

This is affecting my life terribly. I still live with my parents, and my mother is constantly looking after our Gran. So, she is always tired and stressed despite us helping. Since she is stressed, she takes it out on us and gets irritable easily. It all cascades down, so my father and I end up stressed as well. We tried to take a holiday a month back, but we had to cancel it after one day as my Gran fell ill. That sucked. 

My daily life consists of waking up late, going to work and being stressed all day, getting home, helping my parents in the evenings, getting more stressed. I get very little time to myself, evenings or weekends. I'm always having to help, which I won't lie, I do find it annoying, but it needs to be done. 

My problem is, I can't see it improving. Once my Gran is no longer with us, my Mum will unlikely be less stressed. I can't move out yet to get away from it, as I need to be there to help my Dad cope with my Mum, and my Mum cope with her Mum (my Gran). 

Even if at that point I could move out, I doubt it. I give my Mum a few years and I reckon she will need full time support, so I'm going to have to be her carer for the foreseeable future. (My sister lives too far away for it to fall to her. Lucky her). My Mum is no longer self-sufficient now, constantly needing help doing things, jobs, even simple tasks like taking a towel into the bathroom when she has a bath. I fear she already has early dementia, but she won't see a doctor and gets angry when we suggest it. I hope it gets better once my Gran is no longer with us, but I find it unlikely. 

This all makes me feel more worthless, as I'm soon hitting 30. I still live with my parents, I've achieved very little in my life and I can't try to learn new things as I get little time to myself to do anything new, and when I do, I only want to sleep or play a mindless game. My life feels like a huge failure, one big stressed mess. My work life suffers as I'm always tired, irritable or miserable. I see people having fun, enjoying life, and I just can't wait for it to be over. My colleagues learn new skills, move up the ranks in the company. I don’t have the time to do it, so I feel even more of a failure as they do better than me, get more money, better job satisfaction and I’m just stuck. 

I drink daily just to take the edge off, to try and cope with it all. I know this is a bad habit, I'm trying to kick it, but it's so easy to relapse. I've become bitter, miserable, angry and a shell of my past self. I don't enjoy anything really, it all just kills time while I wait for it to end.

I can't see me having any time to myself for the next twenty+ years, and it's driving me crazy. Just looking at my current life, knowing it sucks, looking at the future and knowing it will suck just as bad. 

I don't know how to cope, and I honestly feel like I want to end it all. I won't, as people depend on me, if I can just make their lives easier, it's worth sacrificing my happiness. If I killed myself, it'd just add to their troubles. 

I'm sure I've forgotten something, but does anyone have any advice? It feels hopeless, but I'm expecting my current life is clouding my ability to see any solutions.",07Dec2018,1

264,"A little back story; I had my own place, but a few months ago was sexually assaulted. So I moved in with my ex’s mom because it was a safe place for my kids and I to go. 
It started last Friday night when my ex and the father of my children asked me to go out with him at a bar nearby the house. I didn’t want to go at first, and then he kept texting me telling me to come. I put on some pants and walked to the bar. When I got there, he was drunk, he said he was unsure of how much he’d had to drink. Knowing him for 8 years, I could tell he was drunk. We talked a little bit, but then he got up and started to ignore me and talk to his friends so I decided to walk home. I really didn’t want to be out anyway. I had one shot and two drinks. That was it. I decided to call my mom on the way home and talked to her for a bit (she lives in a different state) and was sitting on the porch when I saw him walking fast and looked angry. We went inside and he asked me why I left, so I told him. Then we started arguing and he kept saying over and over again that I only went out tonight to see if he was with any girls. And I kept repeating that I went out because he invited me. The next thing I knew we were arguing pretty loudly, the table was shoved, he called me a whore and told me to go get raped again. I punched him in the face. One time. That was it. I was thrown onto the ground several times. I wasn’t able to get up, and the only way I could was to bite him so I could get myself up. We were standing in the kitchen and I asked him to just stop and to calm down. I told him to go into the bathroom so we could clean off his mouth. He kept refusing and then was shouting. His mother came down and was asking what happened and I told her we were fine just needed to calm down, but he couldn’t and then told her I was hitting him a lot and then she started hitting me in the face and they were both dragging me out of the house and obviously I was trying to stay in. I didn’t have any clothes. I didn’t have my purse. And they hit my glasses off my face so I couldn’t see anything. They finally got me outside and threw my things all over the yard. I could not see a thing. I knocked on the door and asked for help because I didn’t have my glasses on and it was dark outside. After collecting everything, I got in my car and left. I drove to my place of work to grab my inhaler because I didn’t have one on me, and was hysterical. I sat in my car to relax a bit before driving to my best friends house. I received a phone call from the police department a little over an hour later asking me to come in and give my statement. I told her it would be about 20 minutes because I was driving to my friends and she lives a little ways away. Once I got to the police station, the officer asked me what happened and told me to write my statement out. When she came back, she had another officer with her and told me they were arresting me for domestic violence. That he wasn’t pressing charges, but the state was. I asked how is that fair when I literally hit him one time, I was thrown onto the ground more times than I could count and his mom continuously hit me in the face and head. She said “well do you have any visible marks?” I told her I didn’t know. I didn’t really have time to check. So she put handcuffs on me without checking my body for any marks or bruises and never read me my rights. I was in jail for the weekend. I had court on Monday and got out on an OR bond. My friend signed me out because it was video court. I never actually left the jail. During the hearing, I asked about the kids, because there was a no contact to be put in place for my ex, his mother, and I. The judge specifically told me that I was able to see my kids as long as it went through a third party because he isn’t a family court and has no say in any of it. Especially with us already having custody agreements with my daughter. So I did exactly what he told me, had my friend ask about getting my kids. My ex turned around and went to the same court and asked for a temporary protection order for my kids. The judge granted it after telling me he couldn’t do anything. I spoke with my attorney and he said he isn’t allowed to do that. Especially at that court house. Not to mention we have no legal documentation stating my ex has rights to our son. I took all the pictures of my marks and bruises the day I got out of jail. (There are a lot) He and his mother and continuously texting my family and friends slandering me. Harassing them by blowing up their phones and asking questions. No one is responding. I guess I am just concerned at what is going to happen.

267,"She's always been needlessly defensive, patronizing, and startlingly blunt ,but today she kind of just set me off. In September we decided to spend Thanksgiving together with another friend. She rightfully bailed because her sister also lives here and she left to spend TG with her. I was disappointed, but held my tongue. I invited everyone in my main friend group (her and one other person lol) to watch Christmas movies and play cards (we usually just drink and play cards).

She in turn asked that we go over to her place and watch a play of her favorite show, and since the guy in the group likes her more, we're doing that on Saturday, but we never set up a time. We live abroad and I want to spend this weekend buying presents for my family. Since it's Saturday, I thought it'd be cool if I went shopping around 5/6 since we usually hang out until late. I asked her what time and told her about my plan. Her response:

  Welp. I *was* thinking about an afternoon/evening viewing, but if you want to go shopping in the afternoon...

268,"There are A LOT of signs that point to her drinking hand sanitizer at work, I can’t even begin to start with all the reasons why so I will list a few that are flashing red in my brain right now: 

1. Found her sleeping under her desk yesterday, she had laid down her jacket, shut off the lights and locked the door. I had thought she left so I went to unplug the blaring radio she had playing in her office, see that she’s purposefully napping while at work (she’s a recreation coordinator for patients at a living assisted facility). 

2. Multiple times she has asked me where hand sanitizer is, and if I could grab her 2. 

3. Coworkers from other buildings (we get transferred to different buildings frequently) says that she will take a bottle of hand sanitizer when she leaves the building. 

4. She leaves mint rappers all over the ground. Has at least 5 mints a day (fairly normal, I know, but considering the circumstance.. odd) 

5. Has a history of substance abuse 


6. Yesterday she had a 3/4 bottle of hand sanitizer on her desk, and it’s gone this morning. Also yesterday she was seen grabbing another bottle of hand sanitizer. (Meaning she had 2 bottles in her possession yesterday, both gone) 

7. Has made remarks about how her being hypoglycemic makes her seem like she’s drunk. 

8. Claims the water in the sink near her office doesn’t get hot, (truthfully it doesn’t get hot, but still, washing with cold water and soap is actually still better than using hand sanitizer) so she feels like she needs to use hand sanitizer to stay disinfected. 

9. Is visibly tired and (seemingly messed up) looking, along with leaving early very frequently complaining of migraines. She has left at the very least 3 times complaining of a migraine. Which is also normal, but usually doesn’t display the symptoms of a migraine. My mom gets chronic migraines and she is nearly bed ridden, it’s not just a super painful headache. 

**Am I going crazy? I usually keep my nose out of these things but of course my supervisors are asking me about her since I was the one who found her sleeping. I’m noticing these things and it literally only points to her drinking it. I have NEVER seen her put on hand sanitizer or hint towards being a germaphobe. But I just need to know if I’m just worrying and thinking about her too much... Or if from an outsiders POV it doesn’t seem this way? but if she really is drinking hand sanitizer she desperately needs psychological help/rehab/something. Anything. Advice please**

269,"Long story short my parents were together for over 30 years and divorced last year. I am 25, and live across the country so it doesn't impact my day to day life that much, but was obviously fairly upsetting. They weren't happy together and both of them seem to be finding greener pastures on their own. Ultimately, it was probably the best thing for everyone involved and it's nice to seem them both doing well.

However, my dad now wants me to meet his new girlfriend. She is a bit younger than him and for whatever reason I cannot bring myself to want to have anything to do with her. It's been less than a year, and I want my dad to be happy - we're really close. I don't think he's doing anything wrong by being with her and I don't conceptually mind that he's dating anyone but I just have this visceral negative reaction every time I think about meeting her. I genuinely feel pretty bad about it.

I am sure she is fine, and I haven't said anything about this to my dad (I don't want to hurt his feelings). But man what do I do? It's been easy to avoid thus far because I live a 3 hour flight away, but I am coming home for the holidays and I don't know how to navigate this. I wish I didn't feel this way but I do. I want to be supportive of my dad but I worry I may meet her and just like totally shut down. 

Anyone have any advice for what I should do when we meet? Should I talk to my dad about this? Should I just meet her and just be homie and try to be nice? If I do that option - are there any exercises I can do to mentally work through why I feel this way?

I saw people come into the building and leave without getting asked for a second interview so I was wondering if I should call them back and ask on if they were interested in having me be a part of the team.

278,"It has been a bad month. A few days after Halloween, I received news that my divorce from my toxic and abusive wife was official. I spent the weekend celebrating with my long-distance girlfriend. We live 12 hours apart, so we would meet halfway, in Pennsylvania. On my way home, my life changed dramatically.

I hit a deer. 

My car was totaled. I was stranded 2.5 hours from home in a town called Cambridge, OH. The nearest car rental was 30 miles away and I was stranded. I spent 2 days in the scenic South Gate Hotel and Tiki Lounge, scrambling to find a way home. My dearest friend drove up and got me after work, a 6 hour round trip, all told. 

The news just kept getting worse. I was upside down on the now totalled car, owing $6500 after insurance. No gap coverage. My savings still empty a year after leaving my abusive ex. I used Uber and Lyft to commute to my job, but my boss made it clear that I needed to change my car situation because he needed me to do installs all over the state. 

My girlfriend of 6 months hatched a plan. I'd get a one way rental car, move in with her, use her car, and find a job in her area. I put in my 2 weeks and packed. The move went smoothly, I fit everything I own in a rented Sentra and took off. 

It didn't work out. She got morose and sad hours after I arrived. Distant. Within 48 hours, she told me that I needed to leave. I was shell- shocked. Wrecked. She paid for a rental car home and here I am. 

This is my situation:

I live in a friend who lives out of state's house. It is cheap but precarious. It is currently in probate and could be sold. It's a roof. I pay utilities and keep the place clean and inhabited. 

My boss is letting me work part time, remotely. There's no full-time position available since he replaced me. I have to get home internet and a USB headset to do this. 

I have no car. Because of the negative equity and lack of down payment, buying a car is unlikely. 

I have around $800 in the bank. No certain future income.

 Today the store manager told them that only English is allowed in the we shop area and the ladies are very upset about this.  Most of us who work in the store believe it was wrong of the manager to do this and had no problem with the ladies speaking Filipino.  Is it wrong of him to say this?

287,"I'm a 17 year old boy and recently I've been thinking that I was molested as a child. I never thought that I could've been abused as a child. I had an extremely good and healthy childhood. I played with my friends and sisters and I can't think that anything was ever seriously wrong.

About two weeks ago the thought crossed my mind if I could've been possibly molested. I don't know why but it just came up in my head. Before that I've felt disgusted thinking about somehow touching a child and being around children makes me feel gross and dirty for some reason and this sounds so ridiculous and disgusting but I need to do something.

Just now the thought about me being molested crossed my mind again and now I can't get rid of it. It made my cry and feel so disgusting, trapped and out of place somehow. Typing this, I feel ridiculous and stupid but I don't know what else to do.
It doesn't feel like I can get up and just continue with my day right now I feel so trapped.

I just need advice on what to do next. I don't want to tell my parents and just make them stressed and worried, especially if nothing like this ever happened and I'm somehow just being a stupid deppresed teenager. I don't know what to do. ",07Dec2018,1
288,"Hi, so I’ve been having problems occuring my stress where It’s gone to the point where I can’t sleep and think clearly at school. I have headaches, constantly worrying and lack of sleep. On top of that I just recently discovered that I have OCD (Obsessive compulsive disorder) which doesn’t make my situation any better. I have bad thoughts in my head of what could possible happen if I didn’t do a certain thing. My stress is mostly because of how little time I have to do stuff that include school work. I practice sports 4 times a week which are about 2-3 hours, and have private lessons once a week in the language I speak at home, plus I get school work every day. Schools a very important part of my life and I always try to get the best grades, but I just can’t find a way not to stress for every thing. Many may suggest for me to visit a therapist, but I’m afraid of that. You may think It’s stupid, but I don’t want my parents worrying about me and thinking I have some kind of illness or that I’m mentally sick, because stress happens to almost everyone ATLEAST once in their lives, I just don’t know how to cope with it well. I have a hard time coping with this since I’m very young, and I have never stressed so much to the point where I just go to the bathroom, lock myself in and start crying. This stress mostly occurs before I go to sleep, and I wonder if anybody else has any advice on this. I would be very happy and thankful if you could answer me, and share something that could help. 

(P.S If anyone gives me advice that I should take some sort of stress relieving medication I won’t, so please, if you do have any advice don’t just straight up say use medication. I don’t want to take something that’s not 100% accurate for almost everyday if it could ruin my health.) ",07Dec2018,1

291,"Hey guys,

so here's my story. My mom is addicted to sleeping pills. I was acting like it's nothing for long time but this weekend she didn't even know what day it was and I assume it was from the pills since she was on friday for 2 boxes. On Monday I called her boyfriend (who is living with us for about 6 years but I never really got along with him) to stop bringing her another pills. He told me ok I won't, then hung up and called my mother that I'm coming home to take all her pills. I got in huge fight with mom because of it and today I almost got in fist fight with that prick boyfriend. He then wrote me note of how much should I pay him for living home or I should leave.

I'm studying college and looking for stable job since mine is not payed well enough now. I got options to go live with my friends like right now for free for couple weeks but I won't have money on food and other stuff.

I feel like if I will leave home there's no coming back and I can't imagine meeting him daily. Mom won't leave him because she doesn't have enough money to live on her own. So now I don't really know what to do. I like my mom but she's living in her own world where I'm the bad who can't see that the pills are the only answer.

When I was fourteen my dad remarried and they got divorced last year. My Dad now has this girlfriend that he says he's in love with. She has a kid and they plan on having a kid together.

I want to be happy for him, but my dad tends to see past a person's faults when he's in love with them. My mom was abusive and had mental health issues that she needed to get treated, but never did. My step mom treated him like garbage, made fun of the things he liked, and embarassed him all the time. He didn't see these things because he was in love with them, and that's what love does.

He goes on and on about he loves his new girldriend and her daughter. I'm just afraid that she's not as amazing as he says she is. I want him to be happy, and I want to be supportive, but I'm afraid that he might have put her on a pedestal like he did with my real mom and my step mom.

My boyfriend denys again. She keeps asking and he starts to get upset because he really doesn't want to go. She keeps explaining how the servers are very flirty and hot, and she explains all of this right in front of me.

Now, I don't mind my boyfriend going out with his friends and having a good night because he knows boundaries and I trust him. But the more that I thought about this, the more weird it got. Why would his sister want to go to a place like that with him? She didn't even mention how the food tasted or anything she just kept mentioning the women there.

(Not the first time we've had this argument; long backstory). I've been so stressed out since yesterday morning thinking about all of the implications this might have on our immediate future as well as long-term. She doesn't want to seek couples therapy and says she won't be convinced otherwise. I'm fearing it's over. We talked a little last night and some this morning about next steps--we didn't argue, just tried to be civil. She suggested we got married too soon/too young (I'm 27, she's 26). She said she needs time and space to think; which I'm completely fine with. Just don't know who to turn to.

• Idea of marriage ending  
• House with 29.75 year mortgage left (we rely on each other to pay the bills)  
• Not financially set to hire an attorney  
• Debts linked to each of our names (mostly the mortgage)

A few months ago a stray cat followed me home and is been living with us since then. He’s really cute usually but he tends to be very loud. Since he’s still young he jumps around a lot and loves to play like kittens do it but sadly it’s almost always in the night. 

Yesterday the people living under us were really aggressive and told us to shut the fuck up or they gonna call the cops on us when I told them that it’s the cat and there’s nothing we really can do about it they just made funny noises to make fun of us and then I just told them to move out if they didn’t like it. 

We are allowed to have cats but I’m not sure if we can get kicked out because our cat tends to get loud. Is there anything I can do? Ps:  We brought the cat to the vet and he’s healthy, we are going to neuter him next month and hope that maybe that will calm him down a bit. ",07Dec2018,1

I’m in halls, and the kitchen has just a huge pile of bin bags in it, it takes up a quarter of the kitchen. Some of the yogurt pots have been there since first day of term. There’s loads of moldy food. 
We can’t even take the bin bags out. Because people have started dropping food on top of the bags when they cba to open the bin. Which means the bags are all covered in moldy food. Therefore, now we have about 1000+ fruit flies. They reproduce every day. Every wall in the kitchen has flies on it. I’m now getting paranoid that they’ll fly into my mouth or ears when I walk in because there’s just so many of them. 

The bin bags block the fridge so to get to the fridge you get close to the bin bags and disturb all the flies. I have to try and cook super fast and cover everything. Because if I leave something for more than 10 seconds a fly seems to get into it. 

I don’t know my flatmates. I’ve never spoken To them or even really seen them much. So I don’t know how. I left a note but it was ignored. 

I tried complaining to the halls reception. But they just said they’d send an email asking people to clean. It did nothing. 


What can I do?? I can’t cope and it’s so messy I feel sick every time I walk In. I know it sounds over dramatic but not having access to a kitchen and to cook is super stressful and makes me feel trapped. I’m broke and can’t afford a cleaner.

Whenever I tell him I made a new friend, he ALWAYS asks, ""Are they Black or White?"" (Like those are the only two races). He wants me to say Black, which is why I'm a little reluctant to say another race.

When I tell him I made a White friend or anyone who is non-Black, he goes ""Have you been making any Black friends?"" I have Black friends, but I also have friends that come from other backgrounds. I'm not so narrow-minded to the point where I am going to pre-judge someone because of their race or not be friends with them because of it.

My father asked me once, ""Would you ever have a White best friend?"" I said ""yes"". He flipped out a little and went, ""Are you serious?"" He proceeded to give me a little speech on how a Black person and a White person can never be true friends. I just ignored him because I think it's completely ridiculous.

I have friends who are also Asian, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern. My father is not too fond of this either, but he mostly has problems with White people.

My problem is quite simple. I share a house with other three people and each one of us has their own room.
In winter we have little heaters, but in summer we don't have an air conditioner. A guy in my house just bought one because the summer is very hot and he has less tolerance than the other people in the house. He put the air conditioner in his room (and we're welcome to hang in there if we want).

Now the problem is that we (the rest of the house) sort of deal with the hot temperature with fans and showers, but this guy had had the air conditioning on for the past 48 hours. Non stop. He never switched it off and because he's so comfortable with it, I know he won't switch it off even when the temperature comes down (he's comparing that it's too hot for him even with the air conditioning on).

I know that she does not have/make much money at all, but is constantly making hundreds of dollars worth of purchases in things she doesn't really need. Yesterday alone she spent almost equal to the amount that my entire credit card bill for the month typically is, and this is a normal occurrence. My other friend (also a best of hers) and I have had discussions about it and just by speculation, knowing her patterns, how many different credit cards she has, etc, we're estimating she's probably at least 20k deep in debt with no sign of stopping. In the recent past, she's confided to the other friend that she may be suicidal. Lately the spending has gotten worse and worse, we think maybe as a coping mechanism, and we're worried she's digging herself into a hole she can't get out of, potentially because she doesn't plan on being around to. The problem is that she is also very proud, and doesn't take well to confrontation of her issues/talking about her weaknesses.

Location A and B are small but both in the same town I live in, and I already know everyone there and the environment. Location C is a 45 minute drive (or 2 hours on public transit), and is a big company that I've never gone to.

If she does that when I am working, I worry that it could mess up my job. So in short, I don't have a reliable means of transportation.

316,"Okay. I want to keep this brief. Will also keep it vague to remain anonymous. I've been in my current job almost three years. It's 42 hours a week of office work, very dull and monotonous. I intended to be there 6 months but life didn't work out how I wanted it to. I applied for the odd job here and there, had a few interviews but no joy.

The job has caused me rather serious anxiety and depression for most of the last two years. I struggle from personal issues, largely to do with a low self esteem and low self worth. I am working on these with counselling and by exercising. I feel like the job only compounds my problems for a number of reasons.

1. Its not at all what I'm qualified in, I only got it as I was friendly with the boss. I have no interest in the work as a result and it doesn't help me at all with getting towards my ideal job/career as its completely unrelated. So I feel I'm wasting my time in it.
2. Pay is not great and commute is long.
3. Co workers and managers don't treat me well. I get along with everyone to some degree but so often I'm the errand boy as I rarely complain or refuse to do even the worst tasks. I'm not shown much respect overall.

I have left on sick leave once before for three weeks after being borderline suicidal over the whole thing. Came home from work a few days prior to Christmas break, had what I can only describe as a huge anxiety attack at the idea of having to go back to that job after the holidays. I'll not go into it but it led to me seeing a doctor and being made to take off for a few weeks. 

I also actually quit at one point to pursue another temporary role. When the role was complete I was offered the job back. I dreaded the idea but I also dreaded my hard earned savings draining away and so went back for almost a year, bringing us to now.

I have a few applications away but no job to move to as of yet. I'm in a bad way at the moment and know that the job is actually damaging my mental health (and consequently my physical health too). I come from a background where if you don't work you don't eat, I know how people will act if I leave. I'll hear plenty of mocking and people looking down on me over it. 

I also know it's financially irresponsible but I save my money better than most and can say I'd be comfortable for ages with my savings even with no income. I live with parents so my weekly expenses are very low.

All I want is advice on what others would do. Most tell me it's stupid to quit, a few have told me I need to for my health's sake. I am looking for a range of views as I genuinely don't know what to do. I can't give all the info away but if there anything that needs better explained then please ask.

318,"Title kinda self explanatory. I consign crap that my family no longer uses at a local shop, my mom gave me a suitcase full of things to bring in that she had found cleaning out the attic. Most of it was taken. 

In September i got a call from the store saying that in the pile was one of those portable audiobooks, and a woman who claimed to work for the school library had come in and thrown a giant fit demanding to know who gave it to the store and saying that it was the propee. They couldn't answer her or give her my info of course but they said they would contact me and tell me what had transpired.


When they told me the name of the book i immediately recognized it as a book i had checked out in the 8th grade, im now a senior graduating in June. My mom told me it was a mix up as she thought the book was one i had bought from a library book sale, and i got the idea that they had turned over the book to the lady who came in complaining after i confirmed that it belonged to the school district


Apparently that wasnt the case, i got a call today from a VERY annoyed worker (not that i dont understand why she was annoyed, it was more work than she needed to deal w) telling me that the shop was being relocated and they need me to come in in the next few days to get the book, and when i said i was made to believe that it was returned to the lady, she informed me that no they legally cannot return it to anyone other than me since as far as theyre concerned the book is my property and they have no way of being sure that the lady is from the school. 


I'm going to pick the book up on monday, but this got me worried. When i was working at a library a little while ago i remembered that we almost never pursued items that were missing unless the person was a repeat offender, we usually just sent them a little card and unless they had taken a massive amount of material we almost never sent them to collection agencies. I have no clue if school libraries operate on this principle. 


Ik it sounds silly but the last thing i want is to find out my diploma is being withheld because of overdue charges from middle school. Plus, since im out of town working and at class and i go to an alternative school not the main high school, i have little if any opportunity to return the book before any sort of break (plus, to be honest, im a little bit afraid of the walk of shame itll take to buzz into the local high school and give the receptionists a book thats been missing for almost six years counting the time i spent out of school/held back) 


My question is, as long as i get it out of the hair of the shopowners, what are the chances ill face some horrible consequences for not returning a library book. I live in New York, where the school legally cannot withold my transcripts for fines/missing materials, the most they can do is take me to small claims court now that im 18, but im not sure if diplomas are covered by the same laws. All the information google is giving me is for fines owed to outside libraries or for colleges",07Dec2018,1

326,"So a couple of things before my problem:

&amp;#x200B;

My GF and I are in high school. We met each other a year ago and around 4 months ago became a couple. She is the kind of person that you could call risk taker and very open to experience new things, even what many consider illegal or taboo. So obviously we go to parties with our group of friends, drink (sometimes get a bit wasted but all good) and have fun. We are top performing students, so no concern in academics from both of us. 

Now my friend... I met my friend when I moved to my current school (3 years ago) and have been great friends since that encounter. However, he has always have the tendency to let himself get influence by emotions with girls and not thinking at all. Result? Every attempt he has given upon a relationship ends up failing (longest lasting: 1 month via phone cuz long distance). So this failure, this... Absence, per say, of company, of feeling love is missing for him.

Before this year we were pretty much the geeky type of dudes that will play video games and discuss about comics and shit, but this year he tried to be in a relationship with some psycho of a girl that make his life impossible three times already. This I think, has generated a bad use of alcohol (we are both 18) and the constant use of weed. Now he cant pass 2 days without either going out and getting drunk and depressed or high by buying so much pot.

Ok... Now the problem. I am a person with the believe that drugs are just unnecessary to deal with these problems and for recreational use I hardcore despise it. I have discuss this with my GF, because of the way she is, she wants to do it more times. She knows I HATE IT and she feels guilty even if I said I totally give her the freedom. My problem is that my friend from a couple of months has been always encouraging the idea of drinking heavily and do weed more often.

What do I do? I have never experience the feeling of fear and anxiety I get from her even talking to my friend about it. We even got into our first fight because I thought she was high with him a couple of weeks back even though she wasn't in the end.

330,"A bit of an obvious throwaway account, as this is sort of a serious situation.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, I was leaving work due to a panic attack I was having, and a colleague came up to me and tried to hug me. I told her, ""Hey, can I have some space right now? I'm not feeling very well and need some space."" and she kept trying to hug me. I asked her several more times to stop touching me, as it was making me feel even worse (at this point, I was shaking, crying, begging her to stop touching me) and she kept touching me. I ended up yelling at this colleague for not leaving me alone and for making me feel uncomfortable.   


Obviously, no one saw her touching me but heard me yelling.  


I spoke to my boss about the situation since I knew I was harassed and I was not comfortable. He told me to get over it- that was one of the first red flags.  


I spoke to HR about it and she did not see it as an issue, either.  


I ended up taking some time off to recompose myself and come back with a clear mind.  


When I came back, I apologized to the coworker that touched me inappropriately and thanked her for taking   
care of some of my tasks when I was out. She didn't respond, but I just kept working.  


I've been dealing with minor retaliation from said coworker (her knocking over my desk displays, business cards, things that are petty and make my eyes roll) but what really got me was that one of our other coworkers, her work best friend, is now going out of her way to try to put her hands on me. I don't know if this is something that she told her to do, I don't want to accuse, but now I am being touched by another coworker.  


Flash forward to yesterday- about two months have passed and my boss asked me why I wasn't on good terms with my colleague. I told him it was because I was uncomfortable around her and he said, ""I thought you got over that.""   


We had a talk with HR about the situation, HR was also upset that it was still an issue. HR asked me why I couldn't get over it, and I told her it was because not only my wishes were violated, but my body was violated, too. She told me it's not a big deal and that she needs to bring in a lawyer to figure out if this is harassment or not and if they should even go through with any sort of talking to with said-coworker. They also told me that they don't believe that another person is touching me in the office, even though there are a number of witnesses that say she has touched me.

  
I don't know what to do anymore. I'm obviously looking for another job and currently interviewing at other places, but I just don't know how to hold on. A part of this post was to vent, but the other part is to ask for advice. Have any of you dealt with awful behavior at work like this? I'm honestly so shocked that in 2018, especially in the city I work in, there are still people touching other people without their consent. I am sick to my stomach every time I come into work, and anxiety is only getting worse.  


Give me some advice to just hang on in there, Reddit. How do you hang on when you know you're struggling? Help me get through these horrible days.

With relationships, I don't want to date anyone younger than me (I'm 17) and there are several other smaller things. 

As for friendships, I was treated badly by a former school friend for 5 years and now have none. Being gay and not the most masculine of guys, I often write people off as potential friends, especially if they are overly blokeish. I always feel as if I won't have anything in common, but unfortunately that excludes a lot of straight men. I do want straight friends but I don't always have a feeling that they want to befriend someone like me.

- heart rate increases when im stood up/climbing stairs
- exhaustion and fatigue
- brain fog/ memory issues
- limb pain and weakness (mainly my legs)
- nausea/appetite issues/general stomach problems 
-orthostatic headaches
-anxiety/mood swings

There are other things I have but I cant list everything because its too much. 
Anyway, everything has just got on top of me today. I ended up breaking down to my manager and crying and telling her that I wont be in tomorrow because its too much and im not handling things. On top of this, I also have been waiting for my gallbladder to be removed for nearly 3 years now so i also have issues and pains with that.

As the title suggests, i'm worried about my brother. He's always been quiet, but he's a bit of a hermit. He spends all day cooped up in his bedroom on computer games. 

Now, don't get me wrong. This is not the problem. Everyone loves a bit of alone time, playing their favourite games. However, I mean that this is all he does and this is his escape from life.

Talking to him is like talking to a brick wall, and he has few relationships with people outside of those he's met online. Recently my boyfriend found him on Twitter and his tweets were a series of depressed anecdotes of how lonely he is and how terrible he feels and now I'm sat here in tears thinking the worst will happen to him if I don't help.

My problem is, we don't live in the same country. I live abroad and have done since last year. I will next see him at Christmas and I want to talk to him and spend time with him but I'm scared he'll turn me down. Not because we don't get along, but because he is cripplingly shy and doesn't like to go out. I know he would never see a doctor or therapist and claim he's ok, but from his tweets, I feel like he needs specialist help.

I am desperately seeking advice from anyone who has any sort of ideas of how I can make sure he feels loved. I'm his half sister technically, and we fought like cat and mouse as kids but I love him with all my heart and it devastates me to think he's suffering.

338,"So I have this friend (we recently became friends a couple of months ago and connected on our struggles with mental illness). He’s been struggling for a very long time with depression. He told me about it all one night when he was very drunk (about the same time we started actually being friends). 

He’s always been very pessimistic. He talks about how he hates his life and is just floating and has no energy. He says he’s suicidal so I always keep that in mind when I talk to him. 

Very recently, however, he’s run into some bad luck regarding chronic kidney stones and it’s really affecting his life because nothing is working to help relieve the pain. Because of this, he’s started to worry me with the things he says. It finally came to a point last night where I was worried for his safety. I ended up texting his mom and explaining the situation. 

I’m struggling with my decision to do this. He is, rightfully, very upset. He told me I made things worse and that all his parents are going to do is bitch at him and stay on high alert for a week and then forget about him. 

Before, the reason I chose to tell was because I myself struggle with depression, and having the weight of the possibility of his suicide on my shoulders was a lot. Not to mention I have just gotten over my depression hump that I’ve had consistently for 3 years since I lost my brother. So to me I could not lose another person.

So, my sister (""Sarah"") and BIL (""Chris"") decided to separate about 8mos ago. Prior to this, Sarah worked full time and Chris stayed at home with their 4yo daughter (""Penny""). They never had trouble paying their bills and covering the basics. Penny had always been an extremely happy, easy baby. Their marriage was clearly rocky (Sarah, mostly, was really hard on Chris, even verbally abusive), but they kept their heads about it and Penny was oblivious to all of it until they told her mom and dad were getting a divorce. She was upset, naturally, but at this point it seemed like everything was being done right.

For context, Sarah and Chris were high school sweethearts and married at 24yo. Sarah had never so much as kissed anyone else. The *second* they had the talk and decided to divorce, she downloaded Tinder and started swiping. I want to say that within the week, she was bringing dates home to hang out (I dont think they were staying the night yet, but still...). They hadn't even filed for separation or begun packing for Chris. Of course, Chris is annoyed about this and decided to start dating as well... dating *men! * We are a very liberal family - my brother is gay, I'm a bisexual vegan hippie myself. But Sarah and Chris are definitely the conservative leaning outliers. I've known him for 15 years - he talks *a lot*, but has never so much as hinted that he was curious, bisexual, or gay. It was a huge shock twist, but cool... except now both mom and dad are bringing home multitudes of strange men, which I imagine is quite confusing to a 4yo. 

At this point, I recall talking to my mom, brother, and younger sister about what was going on. We concluded that Sarah and Chris were just releasing pent up energy and exploring a side of life they missed out on. My mom is their neighbor (FL) but the rest of us live out of state (I live in WI). My mom said she'd keep an eye and offer to watch Penny more to give them space.

FF 2mos: Chris has moved out and lives an hour away. Sarah brings home ""Kyle"" for the first time. She calls me *gushing* about this dude. She's telling me how they both are really into eachother, but have agreed they want to take things extremely slow (okay, sure), but then she starts telling me over and over how he says he's ""not into titles,"" which is such a strange thing for a 30yo man to say. I tell her it's a red flag and she brushes it off. She says Penny really likes him, and I also try to remind her to be cautious about introducing her daughter to new men, for obvious reasons. Again, brushes it off. Whatever. 

FF a month: Kyle is moving in with Sarah and Penny. I also find out at this point that Kyle does not have a job, and he basically takes over Chris' role and is *watching Penny alone* while Sarah works. I haven't gotten any bad vibes from him yet, but I'm 1000 miles away and this is just such an obvious *fuck no*! We try to talk to her about it, but she ""knows what she's doing"" and we ""don't understand"". This was also the first month she called to ask my mom to pay her rent. She would continue to ask her every month afterwards, as well as send her ""money requests"" for random amounts nearly every single day.

There's so much thats happened since then, but I don't want to torture you with the novel. In short, my mom walked in on her sending nudes during my grandma's *funeral*. She is leaving Penny with my mom for half the week or more. Chris is regularly seeing this dude who could have been Shaq's little brother, and is only seeing Penny every few weeks. Penny is starting to have extreme night terrors - waking up screaming, crying, and running. One example was her dreaming of Jafar getting his throat slit (?!). Penny is also starting to show major signs of anxiety, but Sarah will not acknowledge that this is alarming behavior.

On Halloween, my mom goes trick-or-treating with Sarah, Kyle, and Penny. She tells me later, that after my mom mentioned how good a baby Penny is (which, again, she honestly is so chill and probably the best kid a parent could hope for) and Kyle laughs and says ""Yeah, she's cool but she's a pain in the ass!"" I was a single mom for 6 years, and I have broken up with dudes for far less. But maybe that's just me. 

We've been becoming increasingly concerned since then for similar comments and situations. Chris has seemed to chill out, but Sarah just seems to keep getting worse and worse. Like I said, she has asked my mom for $1000 in rent every month, and then began asking for help ""buying tampons"" or ""milk"". After a couple months, this turned into an almost daily request for anywhere from $10-50. After 5mos of this, we were finally able to convince my mom to stop giving her money. My mom denied her at the beginning of this month, woke up the next day and saw that her card had been charged for Sarah's rent. My sister had her card info and took my moms money anyway. 

I was already angry about this and everything else, but then my mom called me last night. She said she was watching Penny during the day, and decided to keep her overnight because Penny told her that ""Kyle smacks her with a belt and mommy doesn't help her,"" and that ""Kyle flicks her really hard."" 

I convinced my mom and sister to not say anything yet. Sarah had sent me a message the night before saying she needed to talk, but couldn't call. I was hoping it was about said situation. Nope, it was about her shitty day at work and Penny ""being an asshole."" I didn't say anything directly, but made some passive aggressive comments. I think she could tell, and suddenly ""had to go.""

Without getting into my feelings about this, because I know this is so long already, we are at a loss of what to do here... My sister is in a place where I know confronting her will not lead to self reflection, and it would probably negatively affect Penny and my mom. I thought of calling Chris, but same reason: Sarah would know it came from my mom and I worry that she wouldn't let Penny stay with her anymore. CPS crossed my mind, but I fear a wellness check would lead to them dropping the case because everything looks relatively fine on the surface, then same reason: my mom would be blamed. I suggested my mom might talk to a family attorney about grandparents rights to, at the very least, protect herself from being shut out of Penny's life. But I don't know much about that. 

I know I need to step in for my niece at this point before things escalate any more, but what do I do here??? ",07Dec2018,1
351,I'm failing every single subject. I'm a junior in high school and it's by far the hardest year of my life. Last year was a breeze and I passed with A's and B's. This year I have F's in everything. I try to apply myself but it just doesnt work. I find it very hard to do hw and I procrastinate very hard. I don't see a future and my friends tell me I'll be a failure in life. What do I do. ,07Dec2018,1
352,"I've been at my current job for almost 4 years.  Over the years I've grown to love my job but the stress has been weighing on me heavily lately.  I've gone through phases of feeling burnt out but the feeling always passes after a short while, however it feels like over the past few months, I've been feeling more and more burnt each time and it takes longer for the feeling to pass.  If I were to quit my job, I have no idea what I would do instead.  I dream of having a job where I sit at a desk all day and have to find shit to do to fill up my time, but I also know that I would go crazy doing something like that.  At my current job, there is zero downtime, I'm constantly on hyper alert mode and have to be incredibly aware of everything happening around me at all times.  It's very stressful every day and I feel super stressed hours or even days leading up to my next shift.  I want to quit but also don't want to be out of a job for however long it takes to find a new one.  I also don't want to push myself to a breaking point to where I leave on bad terms with anyone.


There are also perks to my job, which I likely won't get with any other job I find, at least not in the immediate future.  I work 4 10-hour days a week.  I get 4-5 weeks of paid vacation time every year.  I make pretty decent money, enough for me to save a bit and spend the rest on whatever I want to live comfortably.  Good benefits.  My boss is super cool and we have a great working relationship and friendship.  


But the more I think about actually doing the work I need to do, the less those benefits shine.  What's the point of working 4 days a week when I dread every single one? What's the point of having so much vacation time I don't know what to do with it, when there are some days I need to call in sick just because I can't handle the stress of it?


Another factor that has come up in the past couple weeks- I was injured last year and was unable to work my normal job for almost 6 months.  My job was cool about allowing me to work alternate positions for a while, but it got to a point when my injury wasn't healing, that they basically were going to have to let me go if I couldn't return to my position.  I was able to get by with my injury thanks to the nature of the job at the time.  Now, I feel the same injury coming back and I'm scared to go to the doctor because I won't be able to do a crucial function of my job in order for it to heal.  It's not completely debilitating, but it is very annoying just in my daily life to deal with, and I feel it getting worse every day.  I feel that since I've already been through this same thing before, my job is not going to allow  me to work another position and will just tell me if I can't work then that's that.  Which honestly, wouldn't be a bad way to go.  Also, I should add, I likely got this injury due to the physical requirements of my job, but don't have the paperwork to prove it since it's kinda developed over a period of time, so I can't really count it as a work injury.


I'm just at a lost.  I really don't want to take a major pay cut, but I also don't want to work anything related to what I'm currently doing, at least not in the same position.  There aren't other positions available at my job currently, but there are people at my job that have sort of created positions for themselves in the past.  I have an idea of something I could present to my supervisor, but I'm worried they wouldn't want to pay me for what I'm doing, especially right now as we have interns that are currently doing a lot of the work that I would propose to do in this created position.

It feels good to get all of this out.  If anyone has been in any kind of similar position and has any advice or guidance, please throw it out there.  I don't really have many passions, I'd love to do something related to gaming but I have zero experience doing anything outside of my field and the thought of going back to school for something totally different is just such a major setback.  Plus I fucking sucked at school in the past and I'm really worried I'd fuck that up again.  I currently live with my girlfriend, and she doesn't make enough to support both of us, so I need to find something that pays decently enough to support myself, at least.",07Dec2018,1
353,"Hi there, I'm a 19 years old italian student.  


I've been a self-learner for 3/4 years (or more) and i learnt a lot so far, i enjoy learning new things and most important... i enjoy programming.  


However, almost 1 year ago i dropped out my programming courses on YouTube and I started to follow some MOOC courses to get a more in-depth understanding about CS.  


The thing is that i always enjoy learning Math, maybe because i can get immediate satisfication by doing math exercises.  
This doesn't work for CS courses, in which the only part that i actually enjoy is the coding part.

  
For example, I recently followed some lectures about Warehouse-Scale Computers and I felt so bored.  
I often think if i really like CS and the answer i give to myself is: ""YES"", however, i've to admit that i can actually enjoy Math much more than those CS courses.  


So the question is, how can I make my CS courses more enjoyable?  
If you're curious to know what I'm learning now, i'm taking the slides, the notes and the video-lectures from [THIS](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa18/) class.",07Dec2018,1

We don't live together and only see each other on weekends or if we're able through the week. Everything was perfect until she just dropped a bomb about everything she sees wrong with me, some of which she knows I'm actively trying to be better at. She said she is emotionally exhausted and that she has to put herself first now because she can't take the strain anymore. She said it's like she's pouring out of a cup that's empty. And since then almost everything has changed. Like she is more or less not affectionate when we see each other anymore. She is really distant now and I don't know how to handle the situation. I asked her if she still wants to be with me or if she still loves me and she said yes, but I'm not sure if she's still in love with me. 
I have been trying to give her space to think things through and work it out because I don't want to keep pushing the subject.

356,"So I've been on a total of four dates with this dude, let's call him Bob. We met back in October, but had been talking for a while before that. He's a really nice and funny guy and I'm afraid I like him a lot. To be perfectly honest we've had sex our last two dates and it's been great. We just made plans for another date tommorow. I've been told that I should ask Bob ""What are we?"" Or, ""Are we exclusive?"" And I really want to. I'm just afraid that it's too soon and he'll get spooked.
I'm also leaving in January for two months but I really want us to be a thing for the next month. 
I'm thinking about bringing it up tomorrow on or date, is that a good idea? And if I do should I do it before or after we have sex? Because I don't want Bob to say anything just to get in my pants, but we usually cuddle after and I feel like it'd be a good time to talk. Help 😭😭😭😭

360,"A little backstory:

I’m a 25 year old man currently in union construction in the Midwest. I’m married and my wife is working at her alma mater earning almost 50k annually. I myself have been making around the same amount.

I’ve been pursuing my college education since 2014 while still working full-time. It’s been a slow roll and there have been setbacks.
Ive always wanted to get a degree in psychology, but never entirely sure what occupation I would choose. I gone from family counselor, to industrial psychologist, to Human Resources, but not quite certain on any.

I’ve finally found a career where I would feel happy working  and that is occupational therapy. Occupational therapists get to work with relief groups in order to help with the well-being of victims of natural or man-made disasters at least that’s the part of the job I want to do.

Now, I just want to know of anyone that has pursued a bachelors then a masters after working full time for so long. I realize that if I don’t get the full experience of college like being able to take advantage of a professors office hours, I’d be missing out because in the past I’d go straight to work. I want to be able to give my education full attention and not worry about not being able to reach deadlines because of work.

I wish I knew more about college or even the college application process when I was in high school, but I was held back by the fact that I went to an unaccredited Christian high school that tried to funnel all its students into its own Christian college in the same network, which I fell for.

Is there still a chance for me? I really wanted a life where I could help people some way somehow, and I feel like I’ve found something.

So, I'm 18 years old and I feel completely lost about my life in general. It's needless to say that I'm depressed and the main causes are social isolation and lack of interest in life. Pretty common themes for such age, right? I got myself in such trouble by drooping out of school after 8th grade which basically means that I won't be able to get a job(and I don't actually desire getting any) and will graduate somewhere in the age of 21. Yes, I wasted 4 years just drowing in myself without getting any skills.Because of that I don't feel secure meeting new people irl therefore I can't make friends coz I'm embarassed of what I am and it makes me feel not really good.

365,"Before anyone tries to reassure me I'm not. I'm pretty sure I am, and the worst thing is, I don't even realise I'm this way until I had a major blowout with my mom.

I genuinely don't care about my family, and my parents say that I don't even deserve to have a mom and dad and I honestly completely agree with them. I literally falling apart on everything I'm supposed to do, most of the time I don't have the energy to get out of bed, and I've barely even been going into university. I literally don't do anything around the house, and the worst part is I can't even take my brother out because my sleep schedule is absolutely insane (for no reason). My family wanted me to write a book which I'm in the process of doing but it's honestly shit, I can't do a single thing to help them - and I don't even *want* to from the heart, its just because I think thats the right thing based on how other people act. I just want someone here to give me a wake up call, I want blunt truths, I'm 19 years old and I barely even go out with my friends, the only thing I do is binge on sugar and make up excuses. 

I don't have feelings for my dad (anger), or my mother (also anger). She struggles all the time I literally do nothing, because I never think, or if I say something I know it's because I have to say it, almost lip service. She has been literally indirectly asking for my help all this time and I've never picked up on it until right now, and still I don't even feel anything, I didn't even know she wanted help but I should have automatically helped her. I don't even think I have any empathy for anyone in my family, it's to the point they think I get jealous of people that are ill in the family because it takes the attention from myself, which I didn't think I did that - but now I'm seriously doubting myself. I seriously don't give a shit about anyone, I'll be sad if they died but I don't even know I'll be sad for the right reasons anymore. My dad is the same as me, we literally have zero emotions, every burden my family experience is an inconvenience to me, I don't even know why I'm like this now - I used to be okay when I was younger, now I have the mentality that I live with my enemies, that will literally laugh at me when my life falls apart. I'm spoilt, I'm apathetic, and I thought I did care about my family, I thought I was at least morally sound but I'm really not. Now that I think about it, I'm actually really amoral and a really, really shitty person. Typing this out, I still don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, it's only because I've been told this.

What the hell do I do to feel sympathy? feel sorry for people? I literally have to act all the time, to the point I'm accepting this to happen because I don't think I have any redemption, not now anyway.

I do have difficulty remembering stuff and totally forgot how much I pay every time.
Yesterday I found out that generally I pay about $30, but yesterday I paid $100.
I think the mechanic gave me the wrong impression and talked me into paying the highest price and now I am repenting. Is there anything I can do about it?",07Dec2018,1
380,Im going to college this fall in Maine and I am super nervous and wondering what college life is like. How different is it from High school? Is it really as challenging as people make it out to be? Is there actually days where you are up all night working on schoolwork? How overwhelming is college?  What should I expect coming into my first semester? Id love some advice on how to make college the least stressful as possible. ,07Dec2018,1
381,"I always have her in my head, she always unintentionally makes me worry about a lot, and I find myself checking up on her. In the gym I use my phone to track my progress and she's messaging me. When learning or studying I get distracted. She makes me feel jealous on purpose and starts talking about other guys, and she has a guy friend (hes a new friend, ive known her for 1 year) that makes her laugh and they speak a lot and they have their own handshake and jokes. (She didnt speak to me once that night cause she was too busy laughing with him) She most of the time speaks about herself and her stories and sometimes I feel like she only likes the attention that I give her. (Im american in a foreign country) i feel like shes using me.

I know shes not really distracting me, but i'm really doing this to myself.

I dont know if I should breakup with her cause I want to commit to myself. I really love her, but its hard. ",07Dec2018,1
382,"Hi,

For personal and privacy reasons, I have never wanted or needed a personal Facebook account (please let's not debate that point). However, I started my own business this year and I'm finding that without a FB account reaching clients is ridiculously more difficult. Marketing solutions in my field are nearly all dependent on having a FB account. 

So I tried, twice, to make a FB account and failed, twice. Once, I didn't know that you had to use your real name, so I used my real first name and then my business name on the account. I used my logo as my profile picture. FB asked for a selfie to ""prove"" it's me. I sent a picture (not me, but not a picture that was otherwise posted to FB and since my original picture was a logo there was no reason they should have known this was not actually me). This appeased FB for a few days, but then it just asked the same thing all over again: send a selfie to prove it's you. This seems like it could be an endless loop and from searching that problem, some say it is. FB oddly said my profile should really be for a business, and asked if I wanted it to be a page for my business instead. I said yes, provided my real name and birthday, but I still got flagged and my account got disabled. That burned my business email address with FB.

Then, I tried using my personal email address with my real name and real birthdate. I used a real picture of myself from a distance as my profile picture since I don't want to be in their facial recognition database. Within a couple of days, the same thing happened: FB asked for a closeup selfie to ""prove"" it's me. Again, my account got disabled and this burned my primary email address with them. 

I tried using a family member's FB to make my business page. I was able to do so, but when I want to make a group, it's not the business that creates the group, but her. So this won't work either. (Note: she has a picture of a pet as her primary profile picture). I see plenty of people using pictures of things other than themselves as profile pictures, so I'm not sure what the issue is and why I keep getting flagged and deleted. I'm not prostituting myself or doing anything untoward. 

I made a new email address just for FB and I just want to create a page where I don't have to post endless pictures of my face but also not get flagged and disabled. Before I proceed with this last attempt, I thought I'd ask:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a way to make a FB page without a closeup of my face for a profile picture? Can I use a picture of my pets? 
2. Is there a way to make a FB account without having to constantly upload selfies? 
3. Why do I keep getting flagged and disabled? 

I really appreciate any insight anyone has in this manner, and if this should be cross posted in another subreddit please let me know. Thanks!!! ",07Dec2018,1

390,"Hey guys, this is gonna be a long one so settle in. Just a guy pouring his heart out. Would really appreciate your feedback, i don't know how to talk to. 

So me and Ashley (name changed) were born 6 days apart and have been friends since birth. From about birth till 14 years old we spent almost every hour of every day together. I'm not exaggerating. Her mum worked so my mum baby sat us. We took baths together as toddlers, we slept top and tail together for years when we had sleep overs. We went to the same kindergarten. When we started school she would come over around 7:30 in the morning for breakfast and we walked to school together, we walked home together and spent all our time after school together till it was time for one of us to go home. Even at school, out of the 11 years we were at school together we spent 9 of those years in the same class (don't mean to brag but we were always in the gifted kids class, that's how we always ended up in the same class).   


Just trying to paint a picture here.   


When we started becoming teenagers (around 12yrs old) we got curious and our relationship started becoming a lil sexual. We were young and didn't know anything. We never talked about becoming 'boy friend and girlfriend' or putting a name on our relationship or defining it or anything. She was my best friend and i was her best friend and now we also had a physical relationship. Over the next 2 years from 12-14 we never had outright sex but we did stuff that came really close. People would tease us even from a young age that we were boyfriend and girl friend but we didn't really pay attention to it. We were just 'us'. Our physical relationship was private though, we would never kiss or anything in public like normal couples do. Thinking back our relationship was super dysfunctional and weird. I think we kept the physical part secret because we knew our parents would try to separate us if they found out (which the kinda did eventually)



Anyway now to the falling out.



So one day Me and Ashley were hanging out with a third friend of ours, i remember it so distinctly, we had climbed the tree in my front yard, in the summer we loved to just sit in that tree and talk, play game boy, read comics and stuff. I can't remember how the conversation got started but we ended up telling this third friend that we had started doing sexual stuff with each other.   


A few days later Ashley didn't come over before school, so i stopped off at her place to pick her up but she had already left. It was super weird cause she didn't say anything to me about it. So i get to school and find out I'm the talk of the whole school, Not me AND Ashley but just me. So our third friend was a really crappy friend and had told EVERYONE what we shared with him. The thing that really sucked was that my best friend Ashley totally threw me under the bus to save herself from being the subject of gossip etc. Instead of people talking about 'Us' and what 'we' had been up to, people just seemed to focus on me. Instead of it being me and her against the world like always it was just me against the world, and she had joined the side of people gossiping about me. She told them about a birth mark i had on my right butt cheek, and had talked about what my Penis looked like and weather or not i had pubes yet and a whole bunch of personal stuff, like really really personal stuff. We had spent almost every hour of our lives together for 14 years so u can only imagine the stuff she knew. In order to save herself from being the subject of peoples gossip etc she just directed everyone's focus on me. She didn't come out of it unscathed, she got the 'slut title'  her reputation was damaged and some of her relationships ended or became more distant. But for me... holy fuck. there was no way i could even go to school. You all know how cruel teenagers can be, i had a dozen embarrassing nick names before 10am had come around.  


I was beyond hurt, the sting of betrayal of was unbelievable. I don't even know how to describe it, i wanted to kill myself i was in so much pain. I just left and came home and cried in my room for about 3 days.   


After that we never spoke, not once, not one word. we couldn't even look each other in the eyes. Maybe on a good day MAYBE we might quickly flick an awkward fake smile at each other as we walked past semi ignoring each others existence. You know that fake smile or nod you give strangers when they walk past because it would be rude to just outright ignore them. yea that. that's about as far as out interactions went. But even that was far and few in between. 


One foul swoop and a friendship from birth was obliterated. We didn't even try to talk, or argue or get mad at each other or anything. It was like a switch had been flicked. What had been done was done and could not be undone. We didn't have the maturity or the skills for any kind of reconciliation to take place. Also the news came back to our parents and my mum wanted me to have nothing to do with Ashley anymore. Her dad was really mad at me too, he must have thought i was taking advantage of his daughter or something i don't know. So without the help of adults to patch things up we had no way to fix things.


We both suffered really bad from not having each other. I cant even begin to explain, like honestly without just throwing out random cliches, i was just super lost and my life had no meaning. I didn't understand what i was supposed to do, i didn't see any reason to live, to do or be i just was like 'what is life'. She took it really bad. Looking back i know now that she would have felt guilty as hell. I turned to over eating and pornography, the porn became really really bad, Especially because we had become sexually active at such a young age. So im 14 and know what sex feels like but don't have a healthy outlet for it. We needed counselling or professional help. My life got pretty bad, i stopped going to school, stopped going to church, dropped all my clubs and hobbies, avoided friends and social stuff, just slept 14 hours a day and played video games the rest of the time.   


Her life descended into a complete nightmare! Like run away from home, drug addict pregnant at 15 nightmare. She really spun out of control and hit rock bottom. It was like something out of a movie! During this time her Dad died of a heart attack, her older brother committed suicide and her mum had just become so sad and angry and a lil crazy. I can't even begin to describe the hell her life became it was so ugly and sad. I felt really bad for her. Last i saw her was when i was walking to school one day, it was about a month before our 16th birthdays, she came out of a bakery and got into a car, she was like 9 months pregnant.


I'm 28 now. I moved out of home at 16 and went to a boarding school to turn my life around and thank god for that. it worked, i got my high school diploma, went to university. I have a well payed job, been in a few relationships but nothing that stuck. I'm still a lil dysfunctional when it comes to relationships but i know my weaknesses and im actively working on them and i know how to communicate them to a potential partner and im confident i can be a good husband and dad some day if i can find someone who can handle this package of damaged goods.

Last i heard Ashley was a single mum. Drug free, working hard and has 3 kids..... until Last night. I popped by the mall on my way home, i come round the corner and there she is. We stood there a lil shocked for a bit. we were both like 'oh hey....' She looked happy. She looked good. I was happy she looked happy and healthy. We exchanged random conversational niceties. The exchange lasted probably like 30 seconds. As we were moving away from each other she said 'Hey i'll add you on Facebook yea?"" I said 'yea cool'. She doesn't know that I've searched for her page many times but never found it, i thought she didn't have one. I'm friends with her older sister on Facebook and she doesn't show up in the friends list, or anyone's friends list from high school or anything. I've only ever seen ONE photo of her across the entire internet.

I got home around 10pm and started writing this around 1am. its now 7am. I've been sitting here writing this and crying for like 6 hours. I just stayed up till the next day trying to get this out.

What do i do? I'm not sure if emotionally and mentally i can handle reconnecting with that part of my life again, with that part of me, with her or anything.

Do i suggest we sit down with a counselor or mediator to talk things out

I've become a very straight forward person. I'm respectful but i speak my mind and i don't play games or put up facades. I don't pretend that things are fine if there not fine. I don't ignore the elephant in the room. I know 100% that if we chose to meet (as opposed to bumping into each other on the street) I'd want to get into it. I couldn't meet up and pretend like we both didn't become suicidal and completely self destructive for a good 3 years (Her a bit longer)

If i had to describe the way i felt about her before all this mess it would be this. I want to be by her side. I want to spend every hour of every day with her for ever and ever, if that's all i had in this life that's all i would need. 

So IF and i mean IF we decide to meet up or see each other or reconnect or what ever....

i'll tell you what i'm afraid of reddit.
1) We reconnect and i find that that feeling of wanting to be by her side is gone. Its just not there anymore. That would be really sad for me.
2) We reconnect and that feeling is still there and it comes back, but not for her so no i'm left with this feeling and i have to get rid of it.

So reddit. hit me with some wisdom. ",07Dec2018,1
392,"I (F23) left my fiance about 5 months ago. A mutual friend of ours (M27) has been my buddy through it all or so I thought until recently. 
He also had broken up with his gf a few months ago. Things were fine, we had hung out in a friend group a few times, he insisted on a hug before I left but I brushed it off and thought nothing of it until recently. 
He messaged me and told me he was talking to a girl. I told him that was awesome and hoped it would work out for him, what he said next caught me completely off guard. 
""The girl that I'm talking to, who I really liked but she gave me mixed signals so I'm like trying to play it slow but I think it's pretty obvious I'm into her but maybe she isn't quite sure maybe? Or she's not interested at all and I'm a fool that falls for a girl at the slightest hint of attention. That's you. But at the same time I know it's not a good time for any of this."" 

I in no way ever gave him cause to think we were anything but friends. I told him I care about him as a friend and that's all, that I was in no way trying to send mixed signals and that I was sorry but I don't feel that way for him and I can't force a feeling that isn't there. 
This exact same situation happened a few years ago with him and I ended up having to end the friendship because he would not quit trying.
Now anytime he messages me I get annoyed because the flirtation that I may not have noticed before is blatantly obvious now. It weirds me out. 
I think he is convinced in his mind that I'm just not ""ready"" for a relationship and when I am I will give him a chance or something.

I'm not sure what to do now. Can the friendship even be salvaged at this point? I thought he would've matured some over the years and realized it's never going to happen between us but idk. ",07Dec2018,1
393,"As the title suggests, I've recently been feeling completely burnt out and demotivated. To give some background, I'm \[M18\] and in my last year of high school, studying the IB DP programme. Outside of school, I'm currently a board member of an umbrella organization for another international organization, where I need to do grunt work, such as e-mail writing, coordinating, and so on, and also travel to different countries for board meetings once in a while. I also actively take part in a debate club, and do tutoring as a way to earn some money for traveling. 

Now, up to a certain point I was able to handle everything pretty efficiently, but after breaking up with my girlfriend about a month and a half ago, I first encountered a loss of motivation. This wasn't anything unnatural, and I recovered in about a week or so, but I still didn't have the productivity that I previously had. About two weeks ago, me and my team won the National Debate Tournament, and I ended up getting into my top universities. My future is looking great, my grades are good, I have an okay-ish social life even though I have a lot on my plate, and I don't feel sad, anxious, self-destructive or anything like that. Though, I start every morning by wanting to just drop everything off my shoulders and disappear for a couple of weeks. 

I usually love interacting with people, making small talk, having a couple of laughs, but I feel so disconnected from everyone right now, and feel like every sentence that I say takes a toll on me, and exhausts me even more. It's gotten to the point where I don't even have a drive anymore, and it scares me. I don't care about how my grades will turn out, I don't care what my friends are up to, I don't care if the organization I'm working in files for bankruptcy tomorrow,and  I don't care about debating or arguing anymore. I've lost interest in what I'm most passionate about, and the only things that I still find enjoyment in are hobbies that I can only do very rarely e.g. volleyball.  For these reasons, I'm reaching out to everyone, who has something to offer.

Thanks for reading.

P.S. I'd also like to add that I am not capable, of and also do not want to walk away from my work positions, taking a break from school, or leaving the debate club.

394,"I decided to set a goal for myself in 2018, to become a millionaire or I'd kill myself. I gave myself 3 years to do it. Clearly an ambitious goal, but I'm an ambitious woman. 

I actually achieved the goal, in 2017 my life was great. I had created a company that passively generated me 300k per year. Way higher than the 50k per year income I was used to while working a full time job. I quit my safe job traveled the world and was doing everything I dreamed. 

I invested my life saving into crypto and all the profits of the company as well. At a time I had a net worth of 650k in crypto on paper but didn't sell. I was numb to the concept of money and success. I foolishly held. 

Then I had problems with the company and the tactic I was using ended. I lost all my passive income all at once. My cash cow was gone. Also at the same time crypto took a dive and kept on diving. And I kept on holding.

For a different reason, my large friend group kicked me out of their circle due to a rumor. I wasnt invited to parties or events any longer. 

Bills began to accumulate and I was forced to sell my investments at a loss. My tax bill from 2017 is huge due to the crypto trading and profits, but I didn't have the cash flow on hand to pay it. I went into depression for months thinking about suicide every day. Little things began happening, I crashed my car, broke my phone, injured my acl, there was a small fire in my apartment, and more friends didn't want to be around me as I had become sad and out of character. My world shrunk. I thought of suicide. 

I've been struggling to get back on my feet as far as my buisness, friend circle, and investments. Slowly things are moving but nothing to the extent that I'm used to seems to be sticking. I joke that I've become quite talented at losing money. Somehow I've survived this year alive, which given the circumstances I am pretty proud of. I flew too close to the sun and now I'm basking in pure humility. I've learned a hell of a lot about myself this year. The friends that have stuck around believe I'll figure how to make it all work out. My optimism however is waning.

395,"I live in an apartment building, and we have a feral group of cats that live around. They are familiar with people and most of us feed them when we can. Well, one of the females got pregnant.

First off, I know that we need to get these cats spayed/neutered, but I've been having a hard time getting in contact with a group to do this. This is still in progress.

What I'm most worried about is a specific kitten. There are two kittens and I believe both male. They are maybe 10 weeks old. 

At first, Kitten A was very friendly and Kitten B was very timid. Kitten B was also much smaller than Kitten A, maybe half the size. Kitten B was so timid that he wouldn't eat when I put food out. I was worried about him and started intentionally making his own pile and making sure it went to him and not the other cats. 

Over time, Kitten B has started coming to me by himself. He isn't around the other cats as much, and has grown very close to me. I think Kitten A is doing well, he has become less friendly towards me and much closer to the other cats, which I think is a good thing.

Now, Kitten B waits outside and meows when he sees me for food. He's gained a lot of weight and is catching up to Kitten A. He is extremely affectionate, purring and loving the pets. He's so sweet. 

I have been telling myself not to get too involved and that this is his life and that he's being like this towards me because of food, but last night changed my mind.

He was crying as usual and I went out to feed him, pet him and loved on him, and then had to go inside to take care of some things. There's a little window where he can see me and he started crying at the window when he saw me. He's got food, and he's still crying for me. When I opened the door, he started going back and forth, playing with the idea of coming inside. When I started petting him, he actually rolled over and let me pet his tummy, and then went back to eating.

I believe he was the runt, and I know that the other cats will try to push the weakest out. Of course, I dont know this for sure. The thing is that I would love to take him in but ultimately it would change his entire world and he would not ever see the other cats again. I do not want to do that to him unless it is worth it.

For some background, I have two cats in the house that are siblings. They are siamese and about two years old. I don't know how the react, but they are extremely friendly with dogs and people. They have been smelling the kitten on me every day and at least he's a kitten that is around other cats, but I know there's no guarentee it would work out. 

Please help! I really care about this kitten and want to do the best for everyone.

396,"This has been bothering me for a while but today was kind of the breaking point for me. I’m a college sophomore, and I’m friends with those other person. We get along okay, but lately I’ve been getting fed up with her attitude. 

She complains and whines all the time, usually about small things. We have a group chat with two other friends, and every day she spams the chat with “woe is me” stuff, especially late at night while we are all asleep. We try to help her, give advice, but she makes excuses or ignores it,  gives us attitude, or whines even more. 

Here’s an example of the things I deal with: I tried to help her register for Spring semester classes. I stayed up until Midnight waiting to be allowed admission to do my thing; it was simple and I was done within five minutes. My friend was messaging me asking for help, so I wrote out a step-by-step guide with screenshots showing exactly what to do. She ignored everything I was saying and kept whining, claiming it wasn’t working and sending me screenshots of things that were obviously wrong. I got incredibly frustrated after nearly a half hour of this, and told her I could not help her anymore as I tried the best I could and to please contact the registrar for assistance. 

Today, in the group chat, she was complaining about a multitude of things. She has an ESA rabbit (which I honestly feel like she doesn’t treat right) and was complaining about how much work she was, how she “shits everywhere” and “chews up her stuff.” She whines about not being able to study abroad because she broke (yet refuses to apply for scholarships). The cherry on top was her complaining about how her sister got a car and she didn’t, and how she got a kitten yet she only got a bunny (ironic)l and extremely bratty). 

It’s gotten to a point where no one replies to her anymore or wants to hang out. Her behavior is really messing with me, I have my own problems to deal with and she’s negatively affecting my mental health. 

I want to politely explain to her that her behavior needs to change otherwise I’m not going to interact with her anymore. How can I do this without hurting her feelings or causing a huge fight? I don’t want to destroy our relationship but I feel like it may end up like that anyways. I want to prevent it, though. ",07Dec2018,1
397,"I've been thinking about this for about a year now, but it's a big decision, so I wanted to run my thinking past others.

I'm in my early 20s, so younger than most who get a vasectomy.  My chief concern is of an unwanted pregnancy.  I've researched the statistics and they're uncomfortably common, and incredibly life-derailing for the parents.  There's also a lot of research about how unexpected children are far worse off in life than expected ones.

So that's my chief concern.  There are other forms of birth control, but they all have their own issues.  Condoms can break and are annoying, and the pill can be forgotten.  My current girlfriend has a really negative reaction to BC, so we typically use condoms.

I am not sure if I would like children at any point in my life, but after doing some research, it seems as though a vasectomy is not a total roadblock to that possibility.  Most vasectomy reversals are successful, and IVF is another possibility for achieving pregnancy.  Neither are a guarantee of fertility, but some vasectomy-free couples struggle getting pregnant.

So my thinking is that this procedure will prevent the risk of unexpected pregnancy, while only slightly reducing the chances of fertility later in life when I am prepared for parenthood.  Does anyone see a fault in this thinking or something I haven't anticipated?",07Dec2018,1
398,"Any advice will be appreciated. I really need this problem to be resolved.

My mother \[53\] has always been the type of person to use guilt as a weapon. She would make someone feel guilty to get her way whenever possible. She also has random angry outbursts of which she only targets me and my dad and blames us for nonexistent problems or for problems she creates. My father \[55\] works very hard to support our family of six, put me through college, support my grandmother on my mother's side who lives with us, and soon pay for my two sister's college tuitions. We have had major problems with my mother for many years now, with her causing me to develop severe anxiety and unnecessary extra stress for my father. At the same time, she functions reluctantly as a housewife, cooking and cleaning for the family because she does not want to get a job. She has not held a job since I was born and has always used my birth as the reason why she quit her ""once well paying and respected position"". Recently, she has developed abnormal paranoia from her WeChat friend group that I, as a college student, have easy access to and am frequently using drugs. Consequently, she has been arguing with my father to cut off most of my food money (she thinks i am using it for drugs). So now my father is more stressed and my anxiety in college has grown worse.

I really  don’t have anything against the guy, I just don’t really have the energy to get  to know someone new right now, on top of that I don’t really think we have anything in common.

How should I go about this? Should I just tell him straight I don’t really want to spend free time with him? If so how should I go about this? I’ve never really had to do this before so I apologize if it comes off as insensitive.

14 y/o teenager here, living in Ireland, to be fifteen in about 4 hours. Yay. I recently moved from Southwest Ireland to county Wicklow just outside Dublin. I'm gonna get a PS4 with Spiderman and Red Read 2, I have a good friend group and a partner, and I'm doing decently well in school. Everything should be fantastic for me, right? 

Well, it isn't. I'm just not happy. For one thing, I have aspergers, which makes it pretty hard for me to talk to people, and half the time I feel like a social outcast in school. I don't know this for sure but I feel like I'm the ""weird"" kid in school. I don't smoke weed, or vape, or do illegal shit on the daily like my peers. 

I was kind of secluded for most of my life and never saw anyone outside of school until I moved, so I never developed proper social skills. I was raised by some pretty decent and loving parents who raised me to be a good kid, which does sound great but every other fucking kid in my school *wasn't* so they all do the aforementioned illegal shit, which makes me feel like even more of an outcast. 

And even in my ""friend group"", I'm still only really *close* to two people. (As in, only two people that I'd ever feel comfortable talking about my life and shit with.) One's a nerdy kid that likes anime, video games and all that jazz, and he also has autism, but a bit stronger than me so he isn't the easiest to talk to. 

The other's a really nice girl but she's also your kind of ""Tumblr"" kid, that is to say, into all those kinds of shows and blood and shit, and she's also clinically diagnosed with about five different things including depression, depersonalization and insomnia from what I know. She also has a reputation for being violent, and a couple of other kids really don't like her which means me being close to her makes me even more of an outcast in some people's eyes. 

Now onto my girlfriend. Or at least that's what I thought she was. When we started dating I knew she was a little tomboyish, but ***plot twist,*** she was actually really dysphoric and now identifies as a guy. And ever since then, I've just been feeling kind of uncomfortable in the relationship. We're long distance and we've only seen each other *once.* Yeah. That bad. Even worse, I could see her if I wanted to, but my mam's clearly kind of worried about me going so long distance to somewhere else so I'd have to arrange it with her and that'd be a little awkward and I just don't want to do all that. I just don't feel motivated to go all the way to see him. I genuinely don't feel like I want to be in this relationship any longer. 

Now, you may be wondering why he doesn't come down to see me. You may also be wondering why I don't break up with him. That ties into the next problem. They're too good. But they're also really poor. They have a couple of mental health issues, they have some seriously bad parental issues (borderline abusive) and have almost no money but they bought an €18 Christmas present for me anyway. Even worse, they *love* me. I've heard from other friends that know him that ever since we've started dating he's been way happier. If I break up with him I fear that he's going to become even more depressed, or worse. I can't do this to him even if it makes me suffer more. Breaking up with a bad partner is one thing, breaking up with a good partner is another, much worse thing. 

Now onto another, worse issue. County Wicklow. Southwest Ireland is a great place. Fields, farmers, etc. It's very rural. I had a great school and great friends. Mostly stress free.

419,"I’ve struggled with these thoughts since I was 18 so about 2 years, I got into a relationship where I completely let myself get ran over and taken advantage of and after that, I just haven’t been the same. I went from laughing and making everyone laugh to just being shy and timid around literally everyone, even my own mom. A couple of months go by and I start slipping deeper into depression without even realizing that I was doing it. I didn’t go to college or anything after high school, so I literally just stayed up until 4-6 in the morning and would sleep until 3 in the afternoon everyday, I would only wake up to go to work. I wouldn’t really eat anything, what I did eat was junk, I dropped down to 113lbs at one point, I had hit the bottom, all I did was smoke weed, watch Netflix and think. I got so consumed in my own thoughts that it didn’t take long for suicidal thoughts to start dancing around in my head. My dad committed suicide when I was 11, so I quickly began realizing how selfish it was for me to do something extreme like that, knowing how it affects people, so I kind of dismissed it for a couple weeks/months. I start kind of pulling myself out of this slump (or so I thought). Then I had one bad day, then another, and before I even had time to just think about everything, I was consumed by my doom and my anxiety was at an all time high, I couldn’t look anybody in the face, my relationships with everyone went down hill(some still are) and I started thinking of a way to kill myself and make it look like an accident. These thoughts accompanied by low self esteem and no interest in anything I use to love. I didn’t care about literally anything. Well that all changed once again when one night I took MDMA (Molly). I opened up to some close friends about how I had been feeling and made peace within myself about a lot of things I was struggling with at the time. And then I decided “I’m ready to get into a relationship “ 
Spoiler alert: I’m Not.
So I get on tinder and meet an incredible, good for me in every way I needed at the time, girl. We really hit it off and end up dating for 2 months. I’m head over my vans skate shoes for this girl, I can’t get enough of her and she seems to feel the same about me. Until one weekend, I very quickly starting using her as my therapist, much as I had done in every relationship. Anyways, things between us escalated very quickly, we both say “I Love You” very quickly, which is something I promised myself I wouldn’t do again, but I didn’t quite understand at the time why I didn’t need to do it, so I did it anyways, we have a talk about this very issue one night, I didn’t even really know what to say, I never did at the time. I was just saying things I thought she wanted to hear at the time, to keep her around because I was completely disconnected from my emotions. After we talk about it,we both kind of got into our past relationships and I end up telling the story of how I had planned to kill myself, not really intending to make it sound like a sob story, I just was proud of the “progress” I thought I had made at the time. And after that night something just told me I had set this relationship up for failure. Well not even a week later, she comes to my house, we fight and I knew it was gonna be the last time I was gonna see her, I don’t know how, I just did. And we end up breaking up, and I was devastated, I cried the entire next day. I didn’t leave my room, I just sat there. I quickly begin blaming solely myself for losing this amazing girl, who was exactly what I needed, I just wasn’t ready for her. And I decided that yet again, I needed to kill myself, only this time, I didn’t care if it looked like an accident, I absolutely could not live feeling that way. I finally reached a point where I knew I needed help and I started going to counseling. It helped but I’m not sure my counselor is right for me. I started going to gym every single day and started looking good and got my weight up from 120lbs to 135lbs in 2 months and that has really been the only thing that has helped me, I used to be a complete beta now I’m like a quarter of the way to a young alpha. But after a couple of months, I’m just slowly slipping back into it. And I don’t know what to do. I’m worried I’ll never be able to escape this loop.

Hi Reddit.

I am an international student about to start my final semester at Grad School. My first year in school was not bad - I held a scholarship, landed the best paid internship in my batch, had a part-time job, was making straight As (all while dealing with some health issues which really took a toll on my self-confidence).

I felt like I held back a lot during my internship and did not put in the effort that I should have (my project involved conducting hour long training sessions everyday - something that I tried to put off (but still saw through) because I avoid public speaking. Did not get a return offer. Add to that my social ineptitude and general anxiety, I felt miserable for not being able to try harder despite trying to.

Now back at school, most of my cohort have full-time offers, I'm making Bs and Cs this semester, the supervisor at my part-time says he does not have the budget to keep me hired the next semester, and my parents are going through a messy divorce so I worry about my mom back at home all the time.

I've dealt with being mediocre at everything throughout my life - I tried to teach myself guitar/German/art - could not stick with it and thus I've never been ""good"" at anything. My dad was always emotionally unavailable and borderline abusive, I have for the most part been socially anxious, so I do not have a bunch of friends to hang out with, do not make friends easily, my only ""real"" confidant is my boyfriend who I'm scared of driving away because of my emotional baggage and lack of motivation in life.

I need to feel something positive, I need some hope.",07Dec2018,1

We closed those accounts already and they shouldn’t have mattered and she basically ended up just changing that accounts details to the ones I wanted to use on mine.

426,"I’m not sure if this is the right place for this, if it isn’t please guide me in the right direction. 

Let me just start by saying, I always joked about getting my nipples pierced. It’s something i’ve always wanted to do, but I grew up very conservative and that is just something I was never allowed to do. 

Like every rebellious person, I went against the grain, and got my nipples pierced. (Given the chance, this is something i’d do again, for me personally, I am happy with the piercings.) I went with a group of friends, but I was the only one to actually get any piercing. This is important because I do not actively tell people in casual conversation that my nipples are pierced as it is none of their business. I did this about 6 months ago, so my piercings are still fairly new.

Ever since I got them pierced, my friends always send me, individual texts and group texts (with people who weren’t there and have no business knowing about the piercings) with the most graphic horror stories with nipple piercings being ripped out. When we are all in a group setting, they always feel the need to have an intervention type conversation and tell me about horrific stories about the piercings being ripped out. I know none of my friends were okay with me getting the piercings because “how could you let someone pierce your nipples” or my favorite, “that makes my nipples hurt just thinking about it, yikes.” 

I cannot tell if they are actually concerned and feel the need to warning me about the potential danger of the piercings or what. I usually just laugh off both the texts and the interventions, because I don’t have to explain my choices to them. Only now, it seems as if I owe them an explanation as to why I got the piercings if they come with potential danger. 

I have expressed many times to my friends that I understand the potential risks that the piercings have, and before even getting them, I did fairly decent amount of research on them. Again, I usually just laugh off the texts and the intervention conversations. Conflict isn’t for me. I don’t know how to tell them to stop sending/showing me these gruesome pictures and stories.

I mean I've felt more passion in past relationships rather than this one (but then again it is my longest relationship around 3 years and I felt passionate the first year or so of our relationship but feel like that was just the honeymoon phase.)

Now, one of my sister’s who is 20 does not want to invite our 23 yo sister for Christmas dinner at her apartment, upsetting myself and my mother, stating that she doesn’t want to feel uncomfortable with our sister “invading” her space.

The underlying issue of their troubles is my step-father (who isn’t in the picture anymore) obviously favoriting the 23yo and  maligning the 20 yo.

431,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I don't know what to do. I \[F22\] have been experiencing both serious mental and physical health issues for the past year exactly now. Some context - I lost a substantial portion of my body weight rapidly (I was 120(+-3)  and am now 105(+-3)). I am constantly fatigued and almost faint most times I exert energy and get up. I experience depression, social anxiety, BPD, suicidal tendencies, and constant panic attacks that are out of my control. My mental health has affected my physical health.

Money is tight for me and I don't have much set aside I could use to see a physician. And since I no longer have health insurance I'm worried that going to a walk-in clinic or a general primary care physician will cost way too much I have no coverage. 

I haven't had health insurance since I graduated May last year and I don't have any family able to financially support any doctor appointments/therapy/health insurance (some context - parents are divorced, dad used to support me mainly, after I graduated no longer did, understandable, I tried to transition onto my mom's work health insurance plan, got in trouble and he threatened me and forced me to go off of it bc I'm not allowed to accept help from my mom since I was a kid). 

I had to stop going to therapy because I couldn't afford it and some days I don't even have money for food and some days I do but I'm too depressed to eat. I KNOW I am sick and I am aware of how shit my mental health and physical health went just in 4 months (I lost 10 pounds just this past 2 months) and I've been battling with suicide and major depressive episodes the past 4 months. I know this is not me and not the woman I am and have been my whole life but I truly am lost of where I can go for help with my limited resources.

I would like any advice on what are the cheapest ways I could see a primary care physician for a checkup because of how underweight I am. I haven't even gotten the flu shot (which I want) because I can't afford it. I'm not worried about seeing a therapist or psychiatrist right now as I am financially tight, but I must see a doctor and do an assessment and basic physical and professional help and resources pointed to me about gaining weight or supplements or medicine. Maybe there are free clinics? Or do some doctor's work with you? I can't afford health insurance. Please, any guidance helps. ",07Dec2018,1

My daughter is 6 and her bestfriend from school was killed in a car accident last night. The school left it up to the parents to discuss what happened and will provide counselors at school all next week. Her teacher reached out to me given that they were very close. Having never dealt with death before, I am completely lost on what to do. They told us at the end of the school day what had happened so with the weekend being here, I don’t have time to consult a Psychologist. Apparently, they are going to discuss this on Monday at school as well so I feel overwhelmed with how to approach this. I reached out to her primary care to see what to do and they offered to tell her with us but I’m concerned that my daughter will develop a fear of the doctors office if I do that. The teacher offered to come by and help but should this be a family thing? 

Please help, Reddit. How did you tell your children about a loved one or friend dying? Or how did you learn about death when you were a kid? How did it affect you or or your kids? I don’t want to scare or scar my kid.

All we did was make out and grab each other with close still one and I played with her breast and sucked on one. Then in late September (2018) we got back together and our love was stronger than ever. Now it's December and I feel like I should tell her what I did. In a sense it's fine bc at that moment in time we weren't together. But morally I feel a sense of disgust in myself. I know now I want to spend the rest of my love feel with her and she loves me dearly it's so evident...

448,"TLDR: What town do I file a missing persons report in? All the towns are pointing fingers at each other.

I will try to keep this short.

My sister is moving back to Illinois after living in Arizona for 4 years. She stopped at a Walmart in Iowa to purchase a new phone and withdraw money from an ATM. It was a 4 hour drive from this town in Iowa to her new home. She never arrived home.

I tried to call her around the time she should have been home, and someone picked up the phone and I could hear her talking, and then hung up quickly after. No hello, goodbye, nothing. She is not supposed to be with anyone.

We immediately began calling and messaging her, but she didn't respond. It has now been almost 24 hours since contact.

We called all the hospitals along her route, and she is not a patient. Her cell phone carrier, MetroPCS, will not let us know her last known outgoing call, even though we have all of her account information.

I called the town in Iowa she was last known to be at, and they put a BOLO out, but not an official missing person report. They told me I would have to contact the town she resided at in Arizona, or my local police.

I called the town she resided in. They said unless she is in danger, they won't file the report, and that Iowa needs to do it, since she was last known to be there. I explained the odd phone call pickup situation, and they didn't say anything about it, just repeated themselves. My local police said the same thing.

I called Iowa back. They said the AZ towns were being ""lazy"" and that's incorrect, I need to file the report with them.

449,"So i work at a Tutti Frutti in my home town. im an insecure 20 year old dude in college. i have a really hard time saying no to anyone.
as far as i know im the only employee other than the owner. everyone else either quits or gets fired because nobody actually gets trained. i've been working here since may (2018) and i never recieved any w-2 or any kind of tax form to fill out. the owner took copies of my ssn and never really gave them back. when i asked about the tax forms she brushed me off and said they fill it out for me. i don't know if that's legal or not, i tried googling it but came up with nothing. 
from the first day to today, everyone either quits or gets fired in a week, don't ask me why im still here, its probably because im the perfect doormat. i was never really trained, the owner showed me around during my interview and gave me a brief explanation of how to make drinks, and then gave me a key and said ""open tommorow"". i work alone, there is never a day where she shows up on time. it will be an hour after my shift and she texts me asking me to close the store (open to close was sometimes as long as 12 hours and as little as 10). in the beginning i said yes every time. 
i run the store by myself, basically figuring it out as we go. most of what i say is ignored and stuff is always breaking. i.e. recently the card reader broke, we got a new chip reader, but now all gift cards are completely void and the owner just doesn't seem to care?
i dont work nearly as long as i used to, i stay firm at only weekends and never open to close. that doesn't stop her from calling me all throughout the week, from midnight to the middle of class, there are no boundries to her.
we get paid bi weekly with a check, its often wrong and in the beginning i had trouble because i didn't know i should be taking pictures of my hour sheets every time i write down my hours. 
we have no schedule, we used to have a spreadsheet we reference, but one day she just stopped updating it and tells me to come in on a certain day every week. that would be fine if she didn't change it every week.
i absolutely detest my job, i've had some bad jobs before but this job drains the life out of me. its not even hard, i stand at a register the whole time and take money. there are never any customers so i usually just play on my phone the whole shift.

451,"I’ve been working at this particular company for about a month and a half. it didn’t take me long to notice that there is no diversity in the company, We have a total about 30 employees and literally all of them were white. I noticed it but didn’t really put much thought into it.

I work as a receptionist in the front lobby and quite honestly you can hear about every conversation from the cubicles in the back of the floor. The first incident where things got weird happened right before Thanksgiving. There was a group of about five male coworkers who were making cruel jokes about native Americans, and then went on to say that it was downright stupid that the Native Americans couldn’t just embrace Thanksgiving. It was more so debate about so-called social justice warriors. They tried to bring me in on the conversation, but I just shut them down and said that there was no reason to be so upset about that. 

Today was downright awful. In a span of about three hours I heard each of these coworkers say the N-word referring to a customer they’d had problems with. I was floored and even began to shake. They kept repeating it over and over in anger until finally one of the guys pretty much told them to lower their voices. 

And then finally, we had a customer call in having to use a translator because he could only speak Spanish. I was in the room taking notes. An argument broke out between my coworkers and the translator, and then one of the coworkers called the Spanish speaking customer another slur. Out in the open for everyone to hear.

I remember quickly apologizing to the translator but the translator knew what had been said and told us to pretty much fuck off and hung up the phone. The amazing part was that my coworkers actually got mad at me because I attempted to apologize for his language. I was furious at this point too and I stormed off. 

To be honest I don’t think we have a particular HR representative. One of my direct supervisor is a pretty nice guy and I want to talk to him about this but I’m also afraid that he might secretly have these racist feelings as well. I’m starting to wonder if it’s no accident that literally we have 30 employees who are all white. 

 part of me is angry because it’s just plain wrong, and another part of me is completely infuriated because what they don’t know is that I have a grandfather who is black. I have a grandfather who grew up hearing those words as a threat to his life. And they have the audacity to say that and think they can get away with it. It hurts me and infuriates me.

Today I come in and I’m fired for creating a hostile work environment. First, they had there son do it who is a manager and also my cousin. They didn’t even come to me to do it themselves. When I ask for his dad he told me he was at the hospital visiting sick uncle so I was stuck talking to him. He said it sucks cuz he wasn’t there to see any of it happen but an employee said I make them feel unsafe. They said I threw a trash can and dishes. They said I was being mean to them. I know I can be blunt, that’s just how I am, but I’m never rude. I say things matter of factly if that makes sense. When I’m not in a good mood at work I simply stop conversing and work harder. This has never been an issue at my last jobs and I’ve never even been talked to about it ever, this is the first time I’ve ever heard this about myself. I don’t throw things or talk negatively towards people. Regardless, even if I did do any of that, they didn’t even have a discussion with me they just fired me. I honesty stormed cuz I was so mad.

I was outside for 2 mins before I decided to go back in and get more answers. Guess who I see?? His mother fuckin dad in the kitchen. So I call him and ask if we can talk. He basically tells me the same bullshit, saying his hands are tied cuz as soon as someone complains he has to take care of it. I get that part, but he’s literally going off someone’s word. He said if he didn’t fire me the other person was gonna go to whatever agency and complain that he was not doing his job as good employer and stopping work hostility. I get that, I would do the same but he literally had no proof and it was based off of one day and some word of mouth. Didn’t even ask me about it. 

Not only that but when I first started I felt like some of the other servers were out to get me because they would complain to the managers I’m not pulling my weight with tasks. Bull shit. The moment I come in I’m looking for stuff to do. I was a a manager at my last job, my job was to make sure everyone else’s job was done as well as my own. I stay busy, if anything this job was boring at times because I went from having so much responsibility to only having to do wait tables and some chores my managers asks to go home. I’m a great worker, they have customers that ask for me by name. Customer service has been my job for close to 8 years now, I’ve worked my entire career out of HS in restaurants while I’m going to school for accounting. I know what I’m doing to say the least. 

I complained to these managers (my cousins) that I felt like I was being unfairly criticized and they told me “oh well you work with a bunch of girls, that’s just how girls are” really? Fuck you. I complained and they do nothing to help me out, just tell me to forget about it but the moment they hear something about me slacking they had a talking with me about why I’m not pulling my weight. Maybe I need to come back to be re-trained? Really? I’ve been working in food and management for 8 years and I need to be retrained? And now I created a hostile work environment, so bye bye! I’m over them, fuck them, I will never view my family the same. Not only that but my cousin (another manager) who eventually did “re-train” me fully realized I didn’t need it. She even said that shit to my face. 

Anyways, that’s just the back story. I was so mad I was honestly considering consulting a lawyer because I’m the only male waiter and my complaints were disregarded while I was fired for some he said she said bull shit. Truth is I really don’t want to go through all that hassle but I just can’t let it go. I’ve been considering calling the health department and putting in an anonymous tip. I’m not gonna make anything up either, just simply state things I saw. Cooks with open beers in the back while prepping, open employee food in back, more than two towels in sanitizer bucket, thawing food at room temp, mixing chemicals, not properly labeling things, a lil mold around the ice machine... you know, the usual. It’s a very lax place and I want to bring the hammer down on them. Am I wrong for wanting to do this? My mom and dad just want me to let it go, but I just can’t. Maybe that’s bad but I have so much hatred in my heart right now. My sister quit in retaliation so that made me feel a lil batter but man, honestly fuck them. I want to send them a big ‘ol FUCK YOU, what do you guys think? ",07Dec2018,1
464,"Well, this friend of mine, was a girlfriend of another friend of mine, that i met through him, and since then, i can say that, even being through internet conversations, that normally ain't too deep, that i had feelings for her, even tho i know it wouldn't go anywhere, since it's just internet friendship, i said it to her a while ago, and she said that i seemed like a decent guy and that if wasn't for her boyfriend, and of course, the distance between us, i could've had a chance, then recently they broke up, she discovered that my friend was betraying her, and i don't know what to say to her, i think she's depressed, and she's been depressed other times in the past, said too she used to take anti-depressants and stuff, i don't think she's confortable telling me about her feelings, but i want to make sure she knows i'm there for when she needs me to talk, and if she need support, but i don't know how to express this very well.

465,"At my workplace we have 2 different main languages in a group of about 14 people. 5 people (including our supervisor) speak the language that isn't native to our area. This wouldn't be a problem except that they openly talk trash about the rest of us in the break room constantly. 

Going to our supervisor would do no good as he knows about it already and doesn't care. One of our newer girls actually speaks their language as well but they don't know. She is transgender and they mock her for it, not knowing she understands them. She wants to leave, and due to the hostile enviroment, a third of our crew avoids the break area entirely.

I am no newbie to dealing with bullies, but with no one else willing to stand up with me, most of my usual tactics won't work. The only conclusion is that I be friendly with the group to either make them feel uncomfortable in the break room and avoid it themsleves, or feel guilty enough that they stop talking trash about us.

468,"I don't want this to be a wall of text, but I'm afraid that I just can't get around it.  Will try to have a TL;DR at the end.

I have had the air knocked out of me again, again, again, and again by life.  I'm finding that a lot of the depression and anxiety that I'm facing now is coming from very low self-worth from all of these different defeats, and I feel like I'm just very full of some ""toxic shame"".

I've been married for almost 10 years.  We have two little boys.  We are confident the oldest has autism, just haven't gotten that formal diagnosis (he currently has a ""global developmental delay"" diagnosis) and our youngest is trending very similarly in delays that his older brother has.

About 3 years ago, I had a mental/emotional breakdown at work.  I was burnt out, constantly being told how useless I was by my boss since everything I did was apparently ""wrong"" (the clients were happy with my work, my boss just had a power trip of an ego), and I just couldn't take it anymore.  Went to the clinic on site, and they basically told me I had to go out on medical leave to get some of this mental/emotional stuff sorted.

Tried some different medications for depression and anxiety.  Didn't really seem to help.  Tried to find a therapist, but the one I found I never really clicked with (Looking for a therapist again now).

I have been in this state of flux for almost 2.5 years now. My wife and I stay home and try to work from home because both of our boys have some medical stuff going on that we are trying to figure out.  We are losing friends because they take a 10 minute look at our kids and tell us nothing is wrong with them (They are both in early intervention programs due to speech delays, motor delays, and motor planning issues.)

To sum it up:  

My 1st defeat came from my job.

My 2nd defeat came from anxiety and depression kicking my butt.

my 3rd came from my kids experincing these delays, and losing friends because no one except the doctors and the programs that the kids are in believe the issues we are facing.

4th comes from trying to make an income from home while caring for the boys (and not doing super well.  We are on food stamps now and other forms of aid)

5th comes from my marriage.  We are around these kids all the time.  We can't find someone who will look after them so that we can get a break, and our marriage is suffering.

My wife and I are tired, beat up, stressed, and falling apart.

Now... for some ""positives"".

We just started working out again as a form of self care.

My wife is meeting with a therapist today, and I am going to see if I can get an appointment with a therapist at the same office.



I'm just super discouraged.  A lot of this feels like we are never going to get through it.  I think the biggest stressor is money.  I know that I can make more than what we are doing.  I was making 10x more when I was working 3 years ago.  I just don't know how to do it now while being at home all the time.

Also, if I'm really honest, I would love to learn a new skill like programming, but I don't know how when I'm also trying to provide for my family and keep everything else afloat.  I have caught myself thinking on several occasions what is the point of trying anymore, but I know I can't give up.  I'm just so damn tired...

Also, I'm currently reading some of Brene Browns books. Currently reading ""Daring Greatly"" and will probably move onto ""Gifts of imperfection.""

Typing all of this out has helped a little, so even if no one has any advice for this situation, at least typing it all out was helpful for me.

TL;DR:  I have had many major ""defeats"" lately and my self worth/esteem is in the tank.  Don't know how to make it out of this darkness.",07Dec2018,1
469,"So, I am a working student at a research institute in Germany for the past last two months. Everything was going well until I had a breakdown leading to being not productive for at least a week or two. During this time, I was mostly working from Home which is happily accepted in the company culture. 

Last week, I had a meeting with the my supervisor regarding the progress I have been making for the project I have been working for. I don't think he was impressed by the presentation of my work. Additionally, I did not show up due to some misunderstanding for the meeting a week early which caused the HR manager to mail me to be available for the meeting if you have committed for it. This was a misunderstanding between us so I think we sorted it out.

Actually, I am kinda a stuff in one problem (work related) and can not figure it out for the last two week leading me to work from home.

Now, my boss asks me what's been happening lately and I have no answer to just repeating what I said to him two weeks back. 

I am really worried that, as this is the last probation month of the contract plus I think my supervisor is a bit piss about me missing the meeting. Idk, what should be the right move forward here? I know I need to figure the problem out. Should I talk to my boss about the recent events and ask him he want to see in him?

471,"I am currently a Junior in High school and I’m happy to say I have my college plan pretty much set. However I think I might be too ambitious and could easily get burnt out. Here’s my plan:

For majoring I’m thinking of linguistics at ECU and studying both Chinese and Spanish. I’m taking Chinese right now and it’s really interesting to learn about. I am very passionate about learning more and becoming fluent. Spanish seems like an obvious choice for linguistics. It would be very handy to learn and become fluent in. 

I am also considering taking a class of American Sign Language. My mom suggested it while talking about college and I feel like it would also be extremely useful and fun to learn. Not as a priority, but maybe a fun minor or something. I haven’t looked it up yet.

Considering all this, I want to go into Air force ROTC. This would probably help me stay on track since they monitor you and I’ve been wanting to join the military as some sort of linguistics job or just an officer. I originally wanted to join the Navy, but I personally don’t think I could get into any of the schools that they offer Navy ROTC for. 

That’s my plan for the next couple of years! I might possibly go as a masters in language and I feel like that’d give me a good chance to travel and further my learning. The only bad thing is I might get burnt out. I heard language degrees are difficult but I feel like I could manage since I feel very passionate about learning different cultures and their languages. Is this a good plan? Should I tweak anything or give up a class? Any advice is welcome! Thanks",07Dec2018,1

I'll be honest and say that that's because I want to fake some confidence and make him think he needs my company more than I need his, but it's the exact opposite.

479,"I've lived with my dad for about 10 years (am 21-going on 22).

About 5-6 years ago, he was fired from his job as a maintenance supervisor at an apartment complex for sexual harassment, and has been separated from my mother for about 15 years.

He's been an alcoholic for nearly 35 years of his life (he's 55), and has expressed that he doesn't want help; even after I've offered to help him seek a way to get off it (i.e. going to Alcoholics Anonymous, etc.). Since living with him, he's just been slipping further into alcoholism and depression, and every time I try and help him, he rejects it. He doesn't even want to talk about it.

After quitting his job about 3 months ago, he's been applying for jobs, but has been turned down because of his reasons for leaving his last 3 jobs (being fired for sexual harassment, being fired for lack of work ethic, and quitting because he didn't like the manager.)

In the past 3 months, I started working fulltime at a restaurant as a dishwasher for $13.50 an hour, and since then he's started asking me for money to buy groceries as well as alcohol. 

I'm not comfortable with him spending my money, that is supposed to go to supporting the house, on booze, and I want to tell him that the drinking has to stop if he wants money from me. I've tried telling him how much it affects our relationship, but like I said above, he says verbatim ""he likes being an alcoholic and doesn't want help.""

I also had an opportunity to move out and live with a friend about a month back, but missed out because he had been mentioning suicide and how he doesn't want to be alive. So I chose not to, in case he'd do something like that; because I'm pretty much all he has left, he's pushed others away, doesn't want to meet new people, and the ones in his life have started seeing him less and less, and me leaving might destroy him.

Another opportunity to get an apartment with a friend of mine has risen up since the last one. But I'm hesitant to leave for this one too, for the same reasons. It's like I'm trapped here.

I'm not trying to make this about me necessarily, but it has been quite difficult for me, dealing with this on my own. About a 2 years back, it had gotten really bad, and I had actually moved away to live with my mother; but she's not the best either, and our relationship is strained to say the least. During this period, I was institutionalized for a suicide attempt, and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but in the past year I've made a lot of progress in defeating them both.

Anyway onto the topic of my post, I am a 17 year old guy but I have never felt trule comfortable with myself, now this isn't about me being insecure about my looks or anything, this is about me not feeling like a guy, for years now I have always felt more like a girl but have never in my life been able to express it obviously, since a few days now I can't keep my mind off of the thought, I hate being a guy and have always said I would've preferred being born a girl (not to my parents but only to some of my closest friends) they kinda shrug it off as an odd and special thing about me but we never mention it ever.
The thought of being a transgender has never appealed to me before because how would my parents react? What about my family? What about my classmates even? (I am sensitive about being judged).
But the past few days it keeps crossing my mind, for a while now I have been watching a certain youtuber (MsBreezy) who is also a transgender and she looks amazing and super happy now that she underwent all the changes, this gives me hope but i'm afraid people will hate me or not support me, I don't wanna tell anyone about this or feel like doing it anytime soon but i've felt trapped inside this male body for years now...

Anyway onto the topic of my post, I am a 17 year old guy but I have never felt trule comfortable with myself, now this isn't about me being insecure about my looks or anything, this is about me not feeling like a guy, for years now I have always felt more like a girl but have never in my life been able to express it obviously, since a few days now I can't keep my mind off of the thought, I hate being a guy and have always said I would've preferred being born a girl (not to my parents but only to some of my closest friends) they kinda shrug it off as an odd and special thing about me but we never mention it ever.
The thought of being a transgender has never appealed to me before because how would my parents react? What about my family? What about my classmates even? (I am sensitive about being judged).
But the past few days it keeps crossing my mind, for a while now I have been watching a certain youtuber (MsBreezy) who is also a transgender and she looks amazing and super happy now that she underwent all the changes, this gives me hope but i'm afraid people will hate me or not support me, I don't wanna tell anyone about this or feel like doing it anytime soon but i've felt trapped inside this male body for years now... I don't know what to do and hopefully this clears my mind a little bit... Have a good day everyone :).",07Dec2018,1

I’m 17m so I’m still not completely sure how to act around kids, but I’ve been told I’m good at it. Maybe I did set good boundaries between the two of us when we first met?

When I tried to put my foot down a little and tell him I was going to help the other kids build with some magnets he hardly participated in playing with the other kids and would try to stay somewhat near me as I went around the room, and at the end of the day he refused to dance and sing during their song time.

I was an ugly duckling growing up, very fat as a kid, and even though I had a lot of guy friends my unattractiveness absolutely killed my confidence with women. I had little to no women outside my family that I talked to until end of high school to college, and even in college I have no close women friends that I actually hang out around. 

I don’t want to sound like a dick but I’m now in very good shape and have been told I’m a very attractive person. Women come up to me and flirt with me pretty often, and all the women I’ve been with have initiated with me because I’m too nervous about approaching since I still feel like that fat little kid, even though I am unrecognizable to the person that I was back then.

My question is how the fuck do I get over this? Sometimes I can be very charming and cool, but most of the time I am extremely self conscious and nervous around women. Even women I’m not attracted to sometimes. This nervousness is not characteristic of my appearance and it puts women off of me. I’m told I look masculine and jock-like, but to me when I look in the mirror I just see a derpy little fat kid. Shit sucks. Anyone else have a similar experience to me that has tips on how to improve?

496,"So Im studying abroad and while here I developed a crush on a guy I met here who is from Latin America (we are in Europe). I have a boyfriend and this guy kept making avances on me so about 3 weeks ago I decided I would not see him anymore, because I had enough. Im still pissed with him because of this. 

Today he posted a picture on social media with a cryptic message about loss, being strong and family, along with a picture of a card with names written on them and candles. I don’t know exactly what happened but I assume its bad (maybe they died). I was very shocked when I saw this. 

I know he hasn’t seen his family in 2,5 years and doesnt have enough money to go visit them (its fucking expensive). I dont know why but Im thinking about buying him the flights to go see his family. Am I insane? Its about half the money I received from my grandma (she specifically said we can do with it whatever we want, no strings attached). It just feels unfair because I get to spend the holidays with my family almost for free (a cheap Ryanair flight) and he cant even go see his family now that they are in despair. 

What should i do? Is this a crazy idea in general and considering him not respecting the fact that I have a boyfriend? I feel like I really have the opportunity to change someones life but then again, there are so many things that I could do with the money myself. 

TLDR; received money from my grandma, “friend” who I had crush on is too broke to visit his family, thinking of buying him the flights.

498,"( I apologize in advance if I come off as rambling I just want to get the details out)

When I was 16 I moved out of my parents house into an apartment that my dad signed for with my best friend Fernando. We were both lifeguards on the beach so we made a decent amount of money at the time. Our friend Jacob was the third musketeer in a sense for the past couple of years, we were always together. We always went to party’s together, we had a huge skate crew and were always at our apartment hanging out. Fernando and Jacob were my absolute best friends. To this day, I’m 23 now, I’ve never had friendships as genuine as those. 

So Fernando a friend named Kendall, and she came over to the apartment one day and the first time I met her I instantly fell in love. I would always try to make her laugh when she was around, and she would always laugh and  brush me off  in a nice way. This continued in for about a year and I was always secretly insanely jealous of anyone she talked to or dated because she was known for staying single and not getting serious with anyone. (Never jealous to the point of getting mad or saying bad things about the person or anything like that lol) 
One Saturday night during my early senior year Our buddy Kyle had a kickback that we all went to. Everyone brought drinks, we sat around the fire and just hung out into the late hours of the night and early morning. People slowly left, Jacob and Fernando went back to the apartment and me and Kendall were the only ones left. We sat and made small talk for about an hour and when the fire was about to die out she asked me if I wanted to go lay down and talk and I swear my heart exploded out of my chest.
We lay down and talk for a while and she finally tells me to shut up and have sex with her( literally the best night of my life at the time, I couldn’t believe it)

Fast forward to the next day, we talk about everything when we wake up and decide to keep it quiet. Like I mentioned earlier, she liked to keep things quiet about her life. We never get together again because I wanted a relationship with her and she knew that I was notorious at the time for floating between girls and not taking anyone seriously. I was young and dumb unfortunately, you know how it goes. It stayed that way for the rest of the year and me and Fernando decided that we were going to the Marine Corps once we graduated towards the end of 2013, and we did. 

Fernando and myself went to bootcamp and Jacob stayed back to pursue a life in producing music, he was really good at it. Me and Fernando ended up going to school together and both of us got stationed in California together! We ended up being together for the next five years and went on 2 deployments together.
Backing up a little.... in 2015 me and Fernando decided to go back home together to see our family and friends. I was with my new girlfriend Devon at the time and was bringing her back to meet my family. On a Friday night me Jacob and Fernando were hanging out with Jacobs sisters. Everyone wanted to go get BOBA for a snack but my stomach was hurting so Devon and I decided to go home and sleep. Everyone gave me shit for wanting to go home but I really wasn’t feeling well. 

I went home, fell asleep, and was awoken by a phone call. 

This is the phone call that changed my life and still affects me to this day. 

My friend James called me and I was groggy when I answered but immediately knew something was wrong. Between sobs, James managed to choke out that Fernando, Jacob and his sisters were hit by a drunk driver. Jacobs sisters had a few broken bones, Fernando had a broken arm and a punctured lung and was in a medically induced coma at the hospital, and Jacob wasn’t wearing a seatbelt and had been thrown through the windshield and he died on impact. I rushed to the hospital and proceeded to have a a huge part of my life ripped away from me. I’ll never forget Jacobs parents coming up to me that night. A few hours later I called and she Kendall came to the hospital but we didn’t speak. 

I’m going to skip ahead in time, because I’d prefer not to dwell on the subject any longer because Jacobs death rocked me for a long time. 

In the time that I skipped, everyone healed emotionally and physically, me and Fernando became closer than ever and I ended up getting married and having a son, who I named Jacob and he has been the light in my life ever since. Me and Kendall haven’t spoken for a few years at this point. 

Fast forward a bit more, I’ve gone on a few deployments, got divorced and am a single parent. I got out of the Marine Corps this summer (2018) and got a good paying job while I go to school full time and take care of my son. I have a girlfriend of 7 months who is wonderful to Jacob and does everything for me. We live together and we have a great relationship. 

Well today, Kendall messaged me for the first time in 3 and a half years and said this. 

“I just wanted to let you know I think it’s really awesome you named your son Jacob. I’m not really sure how he felt about me when he passed because of everything that happened at the time with me and you but I considered all of you really good friends and I wish I could have been there more for you at the time. I’m glad life is treating you well.”

Kendal has two kids now, and is also a single parent. 

I’m not trying to take it as anything, but I can’t help it. Every relationship I’ve been through the past few years, Kendall has never left my mind and I have a new influx of emotions towards her. I’ve never felt heartache for anyone like I have for her and I’ve thought about her every few weeks for the past 5 years.

I'm a high school sophomore, and I have a few friends. I'm not wildly popular or anything, but I'm not unpopular either. I try to be kind to everyone and pay attention to quieter kids because I know what it's like to feel unseen. 

And that's all very fun. I enjoy my friends. But after school, I just can't stand being around them sometimes. Is this normal? 

Let me elaborate a little, because I think a little context could help. When I was younger, I used to move around a LOT. I never left the state I live in, but I never stayed in the same school for more than two years. Since my last year in middle school (ninth grade) I've lived in the same area and gone to school with the same kids. 

So I'm not used to lasting friends. I've got a very particular place for people in my life and I don't let them take up too much space, usually. 

I've been getting closer to people, and now I know all the kids that live on my road. (I've lived in my current house for about a year now.) We're all good friends, but I hate when they text me to hang out. I feel awful turning them away, but I just really cherish my private time. 

Idk. Am I being dumb? Is it normal to feel... anxious-ish when ppl try to make plans with you? Should I just suck it up and try to be a better friend? Thanks for reading. Sorry it's  such a silly first world problem, lol. ",07Dec2018,1

I don’t really know what to say.

508,"I started a new job 3 weeks ago and the woman who I work with on a number of projects has been picking my work to pieces. She is head of Fundraising and I am head of Communications.

This is my co-worker's first year with the organization and she is trying to fundraise $3M but has only had 18% of her targeted people donate so far. So she met with me and asked me to put together some posters for social media.

So I did.

She didn't like the first seven drafts I presented to her.

On the eighth draft she said it looked fine and for me to post ""contribute now or something like that...""

So last night I did just that. I posted the graphic she signed-off on with two sentences of accompanying text that read ""Have you contributed to our blah blah? Here's the link blah blah"".

She sends me an email a few hours later saying for me to make sure I run everything by her so I get the messaging right.

So I emailed back to ask if there was a problem with anything I had promoted online, she backtracked, said it was ok, and that she wanted more compelling copy next time.

I have a huge problem with her requesting ""more compelling copy"" considering she has done ALL communications via email without asking for my help. And has only achieved a 23% open rate on those emails! Her writing is sloppy and the graphics she sends out to donors are even worse. So FML.

Today I send out another draft to her since she asked for me to start a countdown on social media for donations to be received by 12/31. She writes back and says take out copy from the graphic because it looks ""too busy"". IT DIDN'T. I've worked in communications for years and she doesn't even have social media accounts (she told me).

I honestly don't know what to do. I feel like quitting already because of this micromanaging. And to top things off, I found out this week SHE is my actual supervisor.

509,"4.5 years ago, I had an amazing summer fling with a great man while we were in the same place for a summer. We had an instant connection and became friends. The conversation was good, the sex was great, but most of all I cherished his friendship and companionship that summer. We both had commitments to work/university in our countries so we never pushed it beyond that summer. We didn’t friend each other on social media, but for a while we occasionally messaged on WhatsApp. Our conversations became less frequent, then we got new numbers, new relationships, and moved on with our lives.

About 2 years ago, he added me on Instagram out of the blue. I went onto his profile and saw that he had met a beautiful woman, had the cutest kid with her and then got engaged. I was genuinely so happy for him. I liked one of his pictures, and then, less than 24 hours later he had blocked me. Perhaps his new partner knew about our summer and wasn’t comfortable? perhaps he had followed me by accident? It has messed with me ever since. I would love to reconnect with him. 

I have since married and I assume he has married his fiancé by now. I have no romantic feelings towards him, but would love to know how he is doing. He helped me through some tough times in my life that summer and was a positive influence that helped shape my priorities. He was an amazing friend, even if we only knew each other briefly. I will potentially be moving to his country in a couple of years as my new husband is from there and I would love to see him.

Should I cut my losses? It is so hard to do so when I thought we had a special friendship. Should I reach out to him on LinkedIn? It’s the only other form of social media he has? It feels really wrong to forget about him when he pushed me in the right direction in life.

One day I was using her phone because mine was charging and I saw a text saying I love you from one of our ex coworkers. She tells me they didn't do anything physical and while she does have feelings it was more of a fantasy than anything else. Never intended to me that but just yeah but that’s besides the point. She said it was that she was feeling insecure about herself and me not spending enough time with her. The insecure part was she and I are about the same age early 30s. But she still works at the same retail job she had since she was 20. I work full-time and go to school full-time so when I’m not at work I’m at school or studying. before this what we really had a great relationship. At first when I found out I was devastated but she did so much to convince me to take her back. Like three days after she stopped she said that she is so upset with herself she doesn’t want to do anything physical because he doesn’t deserve my love. She has been like this for three weeks she said if I leave she will understand. However I want to stay with her because even with all this she means so much to me. I will leave if she continues this attitude the problem with me leaving is my whole family lives in a different state and I have no family or friends that I could bunk I will have to move.

527,"I get pissed off over the littlest things and I act like a complete asshole. I honestly dont know why I still have friends but I'm not surprised I don't make any extra friends. I'm full of hatred everyday and honestly, I hate everyone and everything and idgaf what poeple think. But I really want to stop being so mean to everyone because they dont deserve it. In the end I dont give a fuck about them but still, especially with family members I should stop being rude. Also my attitude is absolutely horrible and I always give up and act bitter towards many things. I also blame everyone else when something goes wrong and I'm realizing I'm a really shitty person but I dont know how to change, hence writing this post. ",07Dec2018,1
