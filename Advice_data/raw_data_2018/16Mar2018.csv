1,"This story starts when I ran into an old friend of mine at the gym, We'll call her E. E and I hadn't seen each other since we were little, her being a friend of my sisters. We were both in the middle of a workout, so we just said hey, got each others numbers and said we'd hangout and catch up sometime. We eventually go to the gym, get something to eat, and have a hell of a time. I felt myself catching some feelings, and since apparently she'd had a crush on me when we were younger, I thought she might feel something too.  At this time I had a girlfriend who I was very distant from, and was looking to break up with her, just didn't have the courage too. Long story short, over the next week we work out together a lot, and we always end up talking in my car for hours, and one night I did something I've always wanted to do and just kissed her out of the blue, and she kissed me back. At this point I told her about my current situation with my GF, and she said she understood how I felt, eventually telling me that she suffers from the same, almost inability, to love the way we want to (sounds stupid if you don't experience it). Long story short, we hang out some more over the next few weeks, becoming a little more intimate, and making connections; having what was basically my ""teenage dream"" so to speak. I also found the courage to break up with my then girlfriend during this period. 

Then out of nowhere, E texts me one night telling me how she's just not ready for a relationship, and how she hopes we can still be friends etc etc. I was more or less heartbroken, it wasn't until then did i realize I actually had made real connections with her like I hadn't before. We end up talking in person because I wasn't going to settle for the phone. Eventually I found out shes afraid of not being able to have feelings for me how she wants, so she doesn't want to try. I tried everything to explain to her that it was something we could figure out as we tried, but she didn't even want to go that far. So I settle for being friends, lifting and running like a banshee to clear my mind. 

Here's where shit really gets FUBAR. I start to become remorseful about just exactly how I broke up with my last girlfriend, and I decide I wanted to talk to her. Long story short, I end up taking E to see the music festival (she adored music, and was having a bad week so I took her to get her mind off of stuff) where I planned to talk to my ex. I told E I was going to make some things right between my ex and I, and told her I'd be back shortly. The show ends early, and E has to wait for me to finish talking to my ex. She wont ride back with me and has her brother pick her up. 

It was at this time I realized what it looked like, and had just performed the exact scenario of worst thing done with the best intentions. She thought I just took her to make my ex jealous, and after i tried my hardest to explain I was just a dumb-ass, but she said she needed some time. So I gave it to her, and she texts me about a week and a half later with a link to a song. I responded asking if she had anything else to say, but for reasons that would make a long story even longer, I didn't open her response. It deleted from SC, and I have no clue what she said. So now, after taking time that I think I really needed too, its 4 months later and I have no clue what to do or say. I had a dream with her in it the other night, and it was a little jarring. I also started thinking about the song a little more, and I cant help but feel like she was trying to tell me something. Who knows, maybe it took pain for her to realize she might actually have felt something too (wishful thinking, I know). 

I dont want to fuck things up between the girl I fixed things with now (that's complicated, but good, and I doubt anyone would understand), but something about me misses her, and I don't just want to leave shit where it is now. Part of me says let sleeping dogs lie, but I've always believed that you're more likely to be disappointed by what you didn't do as opposed to what you did do. So what the Fuck do I do?

TL;DR: Caught feelings for an old friend, she didn't like me back, accidentally made it looked like I used old friend to make my ex jealous. (would prefer you read the story before formulating advice though.)",16Mar2018,1
2,"I submitted an assignment, it was about a book we read, and that was the only source. I didn't use an MLA citation, but I mentioned the book's name and author, and used in-text references for the quotes with act numbers and line numbers. But, no MLA citations. Emailed my teacher and he says I have to contact the coordinator (IB program), so I did, and I'm very scared that if I can't change that then I'll be in huge trouble for plagiarism, and get rescinded from college.

My world is about to come crashing down. ADHD, anxiety and depression on it's own was bad enough. I feel like curling up in a ball in my room, and crying. I don't even want to study anymore because I feel like everything I've worked for is going to be shattered in minutes.

3,"I won’t go into all the details but basically my ex isn’t sure what he wants so for now we’re friends and I want to be more but we can’t be more because I feel like that ship has already sailed. I just don’t think he’s in love with me anymore since he doesn’t hint at all that he wants to get back together and truly doesn’t seem as heartbroken as I am. Yet, I don’t know why i’m taking this so hard to the point where I can’t focus on anything else but him.

4,"I just started a new lease with an apartment complex in PA. I am enjoying my new place but one of the largest reasons I chose the place was because of the ""free and ample parking in the parking lot"". I have been here two weeks and the parking is an absolute disaster if I come back after 9:00-10:00 at night. I have brought this up to management and she always responds that they will always find somewhere for me to park and have security cameras if I am squeezed in somewhere and somebody hits my car. She obviously doesn't care because she would rather I pay an extra $100 per month for a reserved spot in the garage. When I come down in the morning I have seen multiple cars parked in the exit lane of the parking lot, randomly against curbs and anywhere else they can conceivably squeeze in. We have also been instructed to park in the handicap spots because ""nobody that lives here is disabled"" even though the parking lot is open to several businesses during the day. Is any of this illegal and does anybody have any ideas for what I could say/do to keep management from taking in more tenants than they have parking for?",16Mar2018,9

I have hEDS, a connective tissue disorder. I have chronic joint pain, chronic fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath, unstable joints etcetc. I can’t stand for more than an hour, at that point I feel like I’m going to faint and my tumor starts to hurt. I’m getting a holter monitor for my heart for 2 weeks. I just got new insoles for my false flat feet due to hEDS. I got a blood test done last week, as well as 2 x-rays. I have to see my GP again soon. I’m worried about my health. I’m geting POTS symptoms again. Sometimes at school I have trouble standing so I end up nearly falling, leaning on to walls and in the end just sitting down on the floor while I watch my friends.

My dad just recently moved away for a job. He won’t be back anytime soon. On the days I go to school, I normally end up not speaking to my mom, and then we start having problems and our relationship gets ruined. I don’t know why but when I get home I can’t talk anymore or I’ll snap. When I stay home for a while, though, my separation anxiety comes back, it’s kind of happening now. I had it severe when I was little.

There’s a lot of shit going on at school. I got caught up in this drama and it’s so tiring and annoying. A month ago I stayed home for 2 days because I couldn’t take it anymore (my best friend did the same). I’ve been trying to get out of it but I can’t. I have this “friend” that’s been making me really uncomfortable, being touchy and getting too close. My best friend and I are having problems. 

I don’t want to go to school. Last week was spring break + monday off. I went to school on Tuesday. Stayed home Wednesday and today, I just can’t go to school. I want to learn, I want to graduate and go to college but I can’t deal with it or the people right now. I want to stay home tomorrow. My body is tired, I’m emotionally exhausted. I’ve been through hell since I was 7 and I feel like I’m going to have a break down. I know I missed a lot of work already but I can catch up. I wake up at 5:30, leave at 7, come home at 5, (do homework, physiotherapy, practice music) go to bed at 10 but I don’t fall asleep until 11:30-12:00. I can’t get enough rest during school days.

9,"Hi I’m Wyatt and I’m 21! I was recently hired to be a server at Restaurant A and Restaurant B. This would be my first server position. Restaurant A is higher class and part of a good organization, but they both offer a similar salary ($4.25/hr). I accepted the job at Restaurant A. However, I was recently informed by Restaurant A that I would no longer be working as a server, and instead as a cashier($10.30/hr). I would like to be a server and would like the experience for my resume, and I don’t want to work as a cashier, but the people at Restaurant A are very nice and I guess I’m also afraid of taking a leap. Also, I may have the chance to work as a server in the future at Restaurant A after 90 days.

10,"First off, I just wanna say that I did post this a couple days ago, but it was at a time when most people were sleeping, but I do also have some new stuff to add. 

I work at a grocery store, and there is more than 1 manager. Usually about 5-6 of them. I’ve been working here for 2 years and recently, 3-4 of my coworkers have asked me if I was thinking about moving up and being promoted. It was weird to think that some people believed that me at 19 years old would be capable to moving up, but the 3 people asked me in a span of 2 days. I thought about it, and I told myself that if one more person asks, I will look into it more and today, another coworker asks me if I want to become manager.  This happened last weekend. On Tuesday, the boss of all of us (managers and crew), pulled me outside and asked me if I was interested in becoming a manager. This role is most likely not short term. If I do decide to take it, it would be a long term job. 

I dont know if it’s a sign or something but it’s just weird that it all happened so fast. School isn’t really an option for me right now, but I think what’s bothering me the most is that if I do agree, this could be the rest of my life. Or the rest of my “teen” years. I guess I’m just conflicted about if something like this is right for someone so young. Any advice is awesome, and thanks in advance. ",16Mar2018,1
11,"so my best friend and i have became distant this past month for whatever reason but days ago something happened and I’m unsure what to do. Let’s call this girl friend 1. Friend 1 is basically mad at me for not tagging her in my recent photo on Instagram, i know. it’s stupid. But before i posted the pic i tagged another girl who we are friends with, that she doesn’t really like anyway lol, but let’s call her friend 2. Friend 2 was helping me out on this post in a groupchat that friend 1 actually left bc she’s “not in the friend group anymore.” Friend 2 was picking a caption and picture with me and later asked for a tag which i ofc said yes to. After i posted, minutes later friend 1 texted me “thanks for the tag in ur recent.” I told her that i only tagged friend 2 bc she was helping me out in the chat that she left.  She was being rude to me and didn’t have any argument considering she would never have texted me if i didn’t tag friend 2 or anyone at all. The worst part is that she even commented on the photo with a nice comment before she texted me all mad omfg. How was i supposed to know she would be mad, i mean she left the chats that we were talking about the photo in sooo. Also it’s not like i have only two friends where i need to tag both friend 1 and 2, like wtf this is so ridiculous. I’m honestly trying to stay her friend regardless of how she feels about people in the group and how they feel about her but it’s so fkn annoying how she is acting lately. Like she tells people she has no friends but she’s the one who cut them all out, they didn’t. So when i got to school the next day we just ignored each other, i mean i would’ve liked to talk to her and have things normal but she didn’t wanna talk to me, i could tell. The past few days have been exactly the same as well, just ignoring each other even though we have classes etc. like today we sat at the same lunch table without making any eye contact or conversation. And i would totally make an effort to reach out to her explaining myself or whatever but I’m tired of being the one who always does that. Whenever we got into a fight she never would be the one to apologize, like she doesn’t care. Not to mention, last year i cut her out my life bc she didn’t make me feel good about myself and was just not really a good person, but we ended up being friends again and now it’s happening once more. That’s why I’m wondering if i should just let this friendship go bc i don’t even know if i care anymore either. Or should i talk to her. Like always. She never sees the things i do for her, I’m always protecting her regardless of the shit people talk behind her back bc she has a horrible reputation. What do i do. ",16Mar2018,1

It’s my first time posting to r/advice, so apologies in advance is my format is wrong. Also, apologies for the long post. 

——
I’ve been in dental school for almost 4 years. I have 1.5 years left, and I simply can’t help feeling like I’m wasting my life. 

I honestly don’t know why I applied to this course. I was an ignorant child, so when we were prompted to apply for universities in school, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I had heard Dentistry is lucrative (which isn’t really true, at the time, I read an article that some dentists make 4x the salary of David Cameron on the local newspaper - but I now know this is a tiny population), so I figured I could retire early and spend more time doing stuff I enjoyed. 

The problem is I had NO idea what a dentist’s job entails. I had only been to a dentist once or twice in my life before, and had done no work experience (I lied on my personal statement to get in...), and now I have come to realise - I have absolutely no drive or passion to be in this field. 

——
Last year, I took time out of the course and joined an academic course in the school of Medicine, where I shadowed a lot of medical professionals, namely, clinical geneticists and oncologists (cancer doctors), and I was fascinated by their work and BLOWN away by the impact they had on patients’ lives. Yet here I was, spending my afternoons telling patients how to hold a toothbrush. 

I’m still unsure of what I want to pursue, but I really don’t think this job is for me, I feel miserable every time I go on clinics. But I also feel like I’ve wasted too much of my life to start pursuing Medicine?

19,"I would describe myself as a social butterfly. I could easily spark up conversations with strangers and befriend them, which is cool and all, but then I realized that I never really had a close friend. I transferred schools a couple of times, but it wasn't hard for me to quickly find others to socialize with. People around me consider me as their close/best friend, I don't really see them like that. The thing is I don't really have a problem with that at all.

I'm in high school right now, and I already understand and accepted that friends don't really stay with you forever, but I think because of this realization, I have been putting less effort to build stronger relationships with others.

22,"To start: I know there are plenty of females in the gaming industry and are into gaming as much as I am. 

However, I feel like if I bring up Overwatch or any video game really, I will be questioned on if I really play the game and if I actually know anything about the game. I’ve met plenty of fake gamer girls, like legitimate one. I know they exists, and I feel like a lot of people still see female in gaming as fake gamers. I’m afraid I’ll be seen as one them and interrogated on my knowledge about the game. 

This is why I mentioned Overwatch specifically. As of right now, Overwatch League is going on. This is another eSports tournament with teams competing against each other. A lot of fans will buy jerseys to support their favorite players, and of course, I would want one too. It’s quite an investment too. A jersey costs around $70 which is a lot considering I hate spending money and only spend it on things I really want. If I were to get a jersey though, I’m afraid I’ll be judged for it and once again questioned on my knowledge about the league, teams, and the game. 

Here’s the thing, I have no doubt over my knowledge on the teams, player or anything game related. I can hold a conversation about the game when it’s with someone I know. I just feel like I can’t join in on conversations because I feel the need to constantly hide this part of me.

A couple of years ago, I met this girl at a church gathering and we had dinner together. We had a lot of mutual interests and we took to each other quickly. One of our mutual friends started- er, pushing us together, you could say- and we became close friends. This mutual friend was not tight-lipped and was able to convince me that this friend had feelings for me. At some point, we talked about this and we both admitted we had feelings for each other, and started acting a little less discrete about it. 

Then schedules changed and I wasn't able to talk to her for eight months. Now we have the opportunity to talk twice a week (if we're lucky) but only for a few minutes. Because of the time constraints, I've been having trouble discerning if she still has feelings for me. We are still close friends, but I've cut off all contact with our mutual friend (though I'm trying to get it back) and she has too, so that is of no use. I still have feelings for her, (though not to the extent of before) and would like to know if it is still mutual. From what I can tell, there's a solid chance that there is, but I won't know for sure unless I ask her directly.

tl;dr: my fiance made a tinder and messaged a girl about hooking up about 20 minutes after we had a fight. 

My fiance and I have been together for about 2 years now and he knows about my history or depression and anxiety. He has his fair share of it too. For the last week or so I've been barely able to get out of bed due to my depression being so bad.

Last night after he got home from work he noticed how upset I was and made dinner for me which was really nice but I was too tired to show much appreciation. I went to our room to lay down and when he came in he went on his computer to play games. I asked him if he was still going to hangout with me like he had said he would and he said he changed his mind. Maybe I got more upset than I should have over this, but I couldn't stop myself from crying.

He got really upset and told me he was trying his best to cheer me up but I wasn't responding to it and he was tired of it. 

WE fought and I got overwhelmed so I asked a friend to come get me so I could get out of the situation for a little while, which in retrospect wasn't the best thing to do. I told him I was going out for a little while and he said that maybe I shouldn't come back at all. 

I was gone for about an hour and when I came back he was coming out of the shower, dressed, with is hair done. (it was about 9 pm at this point) I asked him why he was dressed like he was going out and he said he was going to go to Walmart with our roommate to buy curtains or something. 

He told me he needed to think about things (our relationship) so I left him alone until he left.

After he left I went on his computer and looked at his messages (I know, invasion of privacy, whatever) and he had messaged this girl on Facebook about 20 minutes after I left saying he had seen her tinder profile and though her bio was funny. He also told her he was newly single and looking for hookups. 

The conversation didn't go much farther than that but he definitely was looking at tinder and to hookup with someone. I asked him about it this morning and he told me she was just a friend from high school that he decided to talk to because he was upset and didn't have anyone else. 

He's since deleted the messages and tinder off his phone so I don't have much proof to show him what I clearly know. I realize the most obvious thing would be to break up but I want things to work out. He is usually the greatest person to be around and I love him very much. As far as I'm aware, this is the first time he's talked to another girl like this since we got together. 

I just want to know what the best way would be to bring this back up to him. I want it to be constructive without anyone getting defensive. ",16Mar2018,4

He and I are separated, and it seems important that she have her own card that I can present at her doctor’s appointments, because I can’t guarantee that I’ll always be able to get his card from him when she needs it. 

Is it normal for her to have to use her father’s card in lieu of her own, or should I have him contact his provider and request one specifically for her? 

If it helps, the insurance provider is Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield in the state of Ohio. 

I apologize if this question is stupid, but I’m not very informed when it comes to matters of insurance. 

Thank you in advance! ",16Mar2018,4

BACKGROUND: 
I have been employed at a small (private) family doctor’s office for the past year and a half. We only have 12 employees, most of which has been around for the past ten years. With that said, they are not keen on any sort of changes. 

In October 2017, we brought in a new doctor who had worked in downtown Detroit for 20 years with ~4,000 patients. Meanwhile, we always had more of a “white suburban” demographic of patients. When the new doctor joined our practice, his diverse population of patients came with him. Unfortunately, this was not a welcomed change for my close-minded coworkers. 

When patients started transitioning to our office, everything became chaotic. We were no longer at our “usual” comfortable pace, but working harder to accommodate the new doctor and his former patients. This can certainly induce stress in the workplace, but it cannot rationalize the behavior I have witnessed from my coworkers.

I’ll try to keep this simple: My coworkers treat the new patients (most coming from the inner-city in stricken poverty) as if they aren’t human. Their snarky and dismissive tones, as well as lack of cultural sensitivity astonishes me. They (literally) slam the door in patients faces, refuse to work with them, and treat them like  burdens. We have received many complaints from the incoming patients about how they are being treated, but there has been no resolution. My boss was initially receptive to these concerns (which I have also voiced over several occasions), but I think she has too much on her plate to care anymore.

My educational background is in social work and public health. I have been educated about health literacy and the correlations of socioeconomic status + healthcare. I have been sitting by and watching this discrimination happen without standing up to my coworkers. Although I cannot “prove” many of their wrongdoings, there must be something I can do to stick up for our new patients. They do not deserve to travel from the inner-city to their doctors office, only to be treated in a less-than-human manner. 

I have verbally addressed these situations to my boss on multiple occasions. Should I write a formal complaint letter to her now? Should I start documenting everything concerning? Should I ACTUALLY contact HR now? Or should I start suggesting health literacy education for my coworkers? 

In all honesty, I cannot see resolution coming from my current coworkers. The best thing for the practice (in my opinion) would be to hire new employees with better attitudes. That’s not my decision to make though. 

TL;DR: White suburbia doctors office isn’t open to change. Detroit doctor joins practice and brings his old (mostly African American) patients along. Coworkers are openly discriminating against them and I’ve had enough of it. What can I do?!",16Mar2018,5

41,"So I live in Michigan, and about 3 months ago I got hired at an AFC home. During the hiring process, they asked me if I have ever been convicted of a crime. I said no. 
This isn’t quite true. Full story, I was arrested for marijuana possession about 2 years ago when I was taking some coworkers home, was pulled over, and one of them so kindly hid their bag of weed under my car seat real quick. I was offered a delayed sentence, and the way the prosecutor made it sound, I was under the impression the charges would be dropped once as my probation ended &amp; fines were paid. I abided by all terms, and was let off probation, so I assumed legally I was good to go. So being that, I answered no during the hiring process. Since then, I’ve looked on the Register of Actions for my county, and it still shows up. This was the other week, and as I said, I’ve been at my job 3 months so I assumed I’m in the clear.
Earlier this week, I got an email from HR to report to a facility where I’d be fingerprinted. Now that I’ve discovered my record is still out there, I’m scared it’ll show up and I’ll have lied to my employer. Am I about to lose my job? ",16Mar2018,3

44,"So I(F/20) met this guy, let's call him Henry(M/32) in a bar a few years back, he bought me a drink. During that time I was 18, so I lied and said I was 21 due to being in the bar. He ended up telling me that he is a producer. Immediately, I told him I was 18 and that I would love to intern for him. We exchanged numbers and went our ways. 

About 9 months ago, he helped make a project of mine into a dream reality. It was everything I had ever hoped for. Due to the fact that I was 19, I didn't have much experience and that lead to a lot of conflict on set. We bickered and didn't end on the best of terms. I apologized on many different occasions, even though I was not truly in the wrong. 

I introduced him to my friend, Danielle (F/20) on set and they soon become very close. I was left out of everything, which was hurtful due to the fact that I introduced them both. 

A few months ago, Danielle told me that Henry has told her some interesting details of how we met, including how I was ""flirting"" with him. This really hurt me and pissed me off due to the fact that he bought me a drink in the first place and from my memory, I was absolutely not flirting with him. It was embarrassing that he talked that way about me, and I felt betrayed. 
Especially since this was to my really good friend, he had to of known it would get back to me. Also, we were now on professional level, and he made me honestly feel gross and belittled me with that comment.

Today, we ended up chatting over the phone. He brought up some of the conflicts in the past to clear the air and things were going smoothly. I thought that finally I was able to have a mature conversation about how I was not okay with him telling Danielle (and who knows who else) that I was flirting with him. He got angry, and ended up blaming it back onto me. We ended the phone call angry, and I started to cry. I just am not sure how to even get my point across when I am always shut down. I wanted to hear your thoughts.

45,"I’m a sophomore in college and I will occasionally drink from time to time. The issue is in high school I got way past my limit once drinking and my parents found out and totally flipped. I always assumed they knew I drank like at prom and some of the events I went to but I was totally wrong as my mom was pretty upset. After she calmed down, we got in more arguments because she was telling me to never drink again and I wanted to talk about drinking responsibly. I love my parents to death, and I know why they don’t want me to drink. But I feel like it’s much safer to just let me, so I don’t have to lie. For example sometimes I go to a function and sleep in my car just so I don’t have to request an Uber for my mom won’t see it on my bill. Idk why their so naive and think I’m just supposed to think I’m a perfect person. I’m just an average college kid who likes to have fun from time to time. Recently, my friends and I went to a lake house for Spring Break. And my dad asked me if there was going to be drinking there. I lied to him and said there wasn’t which really hurts just to lie to him like that. But I really didn’t want to go home and sit around the house for Spring Break, I just wanna live sometimes.",16Mar2018,4
46,"Forgive me if this is garbled I have a tendency to run on tangents.

Basically I'm single. I have been for a while now (5 years or so). I'm kind of attempting to relearn how to be social period after years of depression due to my weight (I'm 5'9 and I was 230lbs at the time), mild anxiety, and loads of ""friends"" using my generosity against me or dying due to drug addiction.

For some context about 6 years ago I used to loath myself and ended up sinking into suicidal thoughts and to add to that I lost my 2 year old nephew to a birth defect at right about the same time. After month of this I realized the life I was living sucked and I wanted more from myself.

So I started talking to some people from my work and got to know a girl who I really enjoyed talking to, but she had a boyfriend. I was completely under the impression that things could have swung my way because......

""she had no idea who I was until a little while ago. If she's flirting with me, then clearly she's not happy and I can't really blame her for having a boyfriend"" (basically I was under the impression that if I ment enough to her that she would flirt with me then it's possible she would dump him for me.)......but as you can expect, things didn't go my way, my guess is I was a bordom thing for her.

 Due to my mentality I turtled back up immediately and swallowed my rage for professionalism..... After sometime and refusing to sink back into depression (because I knew if I did I'd have hung myself) I started going to the gym with a friend I made through that same job. Flash forward like 10 months of dedicated workouts and me quiting my previous job and getting one at this gym. I'm leaner, healthier, and happier.

During this time I ended up meeting a girl who I knew from when I was younger. She and I hit it off (or so I think). We end up chatting at a coffee shop for like 5 hours.. we would text, but she would hardly text me back (she claimed she was horrible with social media/texting and hated using it). She didn't have any social media, so I would just text her.

Basically after a bit I felt like she didn't care so I stopped texting her...after like 2 weeks of no contact I messaged and applogized if I may have came on too strong or something and basically sated there was no hard feelings. She claimed she still cared and that she honestly was really bad at texting...so feeling hopeful I went back to texting her and trying to just spend some time with her. She kept saying she had work or went to get a massage or some other excuse.

After a bit of this I finally texted her and said clearly she didn't wanna hang out so I told her not to worry about it and let's just be done with whatever this is.

 She freaked out asked me for my address then drove over and we talked for like a few hours again. I told her I'm tired of this and that if she liked me she needs to show me. She claimed she was going to collage soon. I said I really didn't care about the distance assuming we actually had something to hold onto, but i didn't want to start out our relationship with her gone for like 10 weeks. I just wanted her to tell me if she actually cared or not..basically just put at least something somewhat concrete between us.

Things ended up with me more or less not asking her out and her leaving. I texted her the next day things seemed like normal. After a few weeks I texted her again. Still seemed normal. Later I lost her number by messing with my phone. Since she has no social media I couldn't just ask her for it. During all this one of her old co-workers ended up getting highered on at my job. So I asked him for her number. That's when I found out she started dating some girl the day she left for school from him.

A few weeks after I thought I'd try a different approach and meet someone new not a co-worker or someone from my past. So at my job I ended up finding someone who I thought was cute and was interested in and I said ""hey I'm sorry to bother you, but I wanted to say I think your pretty cute and I wanted to get to know you."" But before I could even finish my sentence i got cut off and told No and that she wasn't interested. I said sorry for bothering her which she said it was ok, then I walked off. Im pretty sure she's attracted me Ive seen her staring at me when i workout.

So here's where my questions are.

1. Am I missing something when it comes to dating or am I just unlucky. I genuinely don't wanna hurt anyone all I'm trying to do is find a women who's nice and I can enjoy her company.

2. I don't get how to sell myself to women. I feel fine about who I am and feel im a great guy to be with(probably biased lol), but no matter who I talk to it seems to blow up in my face. So is there something I can do to fix this. I'm not sure if im intimidating them, I'm ugly, or just stupid.

47,"I have a ‘friend’ who’s in a part of my friend group. We used to be really close but recently, for no reason to my knowledge, he’s been cutting me out (not talking to me unless I directly ask him something, not inviting me to go out when he hangs out with my friend group). His actions make me feel pretty bad on a weekly basis, but if I cut him out I risk losing the rest of my friendships in that group. He’s the one who’s car we’ll often hang out in, the one who owns the vape we all use and very close friends with another member.

52,"I've been working part time at a donut store underpaid at $9.50 and hours that aren't the best, but it's probably one of the only jobs I've ever truly felt comfortable and can almost be myself at due to my really bad social anxiety. There's only like 5 people there and I'm learning in therapy that I have a giant personal space bubble of like 10 ft, and I'm legitimately not bothered much by any of them. That's huge for me. It's under new ownership since last week, and there's talk of a small-decent raise and possibly benefits. 

I'm moving out soon, so I had to apply for at least another job. I recently got an offer to work at a groomer for 12 hours a week, where they want to put me at full time once the semester is over. I love working with dogs so I agreed, but it turns out its way more people work than I expected. Not a big deal I guess, but they're only paying me 50 cents more than the donut shop so not sure if it's totally worth it. 

A couple weeks ago I got an offer at a really big Southern grocery chain known for its awesome pay ($12/hr for me) and benefits. Like, really awesome. But I've worked in large stores. I know myself. I freak out big time in that kind of environment. I hate the culture and the social climate and because I pretty much never talk people tend to spread nasty rumors about me. I even got reprimanded by one of my former bosses because people were telling them I had an ""attitude problem"". The other day at training my trainer and another girl were talking about how weird a quiet person in the meat department was and I was like shitttttttttt. I can almost never get adjusted and my quality of life suffers because of it. I end up abandoning those jobs without a word in 1-3 months.

For reference, I'm 25 years old and have been struggling with this, PTSD, and depression for the past 15 years so I know pretty much this isn't a phase. I won't bore you with a long story, but it's really not something I see myself getting over until I'm done with intensive therapy. 

I've been panicking nonstop about this. I have a hard time making choices and confronting people in the first place and I haven't told my donut boss that I'm supposed to start the grocery store next week because I don't even know if I'm going to do it. There's no way I can keep all 3. I have trouble balancing two with just two classes, and the grocery store wants me for more hours.

73,"Please excuse myself for any spelling/grammar/syntax errors. English is my sencond language and I am not really good at explaning complex situations in general:

So here’s my problem :

I currently live at my parents’ house with my twin sister, who is a very toxic person. She is extremely manipulative and belittle everyone as soon as she has the occasion (espescially my mother and I, bonus points if there’s people around to hear her shit). She knows my weaknesses and use them at her advantage when needed. She often yell at us or talk with contempt, just like if she was superior to us. 

My parents can’t support her attitude anymore, but fear to kick her out because they think she may bring them to court (knowing her, it is really possible). I also tried to confront her one time, but I, just like my parents imagined, ended up with a lawsuit on my back for “psychological assault and harassment”. Yup ! She recorded me while we were having the argument and, of course, she only recorded the part where I was throwing shit at her and she was “crying”. Happily, she retired her complaint a few months later, after I spent almost $2000 in lawyer fees and lived on my aunt couch alias hell (I wasn’t allowed to go home since the bitch was living there) for three months. 

So yes, she is really intense. My parents and I are convinced that she has a borderline personality disorder or/and a narcissistic personality disorder, but she refuses to go see a psychologist because she think that we are the problem and that she is the only one who make sense in our home. 

I am writing this tonight because it will be a year Monday since she filed the lawsuit and put me through hell and, once again, she pushed me to my limits tonight by ripping one of my paper that was due tomorrow because I refused to read a text that she wrote. Of course when I started yelling at her (I was still careful because who know if she was recording me) my dad went up the stairs and my sister started to act like a victim (my dad know how my sister is, but she still easily manipulate him. ) and started to “cry” (she gave me a bitch smile while my dad was looking away) . So yeah, I am just done with her bullshit.


She also haven’t spoken to my mom in a year despite living with her because she once agreed with me instead of listening to her bullshit. She also, as a revenge for taking my “side”, spread some rumors about my (and also her) mother in the family and in her circle of friends. Some of our family members first belived my sister’s bullshit (trust me, she is fucking creative and credible) but happily now they know that this was all lies. My sister’s friends tho, when they come to my home they always look at my mom with a scornful air. I tried to let them know that my mom, despite what my sister told them, is a really nice person, but since they don’t see me often and my sister is talking shit about her almkst each day I don’t think my operation was successful.



Anyway, I hope you at least now have a small idea about how my sister is and can help me to achieve what I want. 

So here’s where I need advice :

I can’t move out. Apartments are extremely expensives where I live and they are also far away from my current job (and there is no possibility that I quit). I also don’t work enough (still studying and I am the kind of person who is easily stressed, so I could not take anymore hours than I actually do) to rent something, and I have a really nice relationship with my parents, so why would I move out ? The only problem is my sister. As I previously said, my parents would like to kick her out, but they fear a lawsuit if they do so. So I just want to cut ties with her. I don’t want anymore of her bullshit, belittle remarks and scornful comments. I can’t stand her anymore. I am to the point where she sometimes makes me want to kill myself because I don’t know how to deal with her. I feel stuck. It’s exhausting and I don’t know what to do. 


I think the best thing that I can do is to, as I said, cut ties with her but I know myself and I can’t barely hold a grudge towards anyone. 

So I need your help. How can I deal with such an awful sister ? ",16Mar2018,1

I think they’re trying to cause me to get into an argument with me to use it as an excuse to kick me out. They’ve been slandering me to family for years, so moving in with any of them isn’t really an option in the case that they do kick me out. I’ve got a job, but I’m unsure if I’d be able to afford food and rent or even be able to find a lease on such short notice (or get a guarantor to help me sign the lease since I’m still pretty young and almost certain I’d need one).

I’m also not sure what I’d do about the family dog (who is known to starve himself if I’m not around, so leaving him behind isn’t an option I’d like to pursue). Idk

I don’t wanna get kicked out, I try to be non confrontational and do what’s asked of me but it increasingly seems to not be enough.

Let's call the advisor Tom and my friend Bob. Bob let Tom know that I was onboard and ready to work whenever and really qualified for the job or internship. Tom promised to help me out and look for something during the summer but never got back to me. Tom, after wasting my time and making me think that he was actually going to help ends up with not a single email reply. Later Tom tells Bob at an event that he has no need for me, Tom couldn't tell me this himself.

Now: Tom found a group of 3 individuals to work on said internship. Now Bob, and his two peers constantly discuss their progress in a project they are working on and every time they mention it, it makes me upset.

So aside from losing valuable experience, the project could have helped me out in the long run. Bob is a good friend, he ""tried"" to get me on the team but it didn't happen.

I ended up feeling like crap the day Bob told me about not needing me anymore. I never confronted Tom I just told him that one door closes another one opens..

87,"I’ll start off saying that I’m a pretty good student. I don’t see myself too highly, however seemingly the entire 500 student school (how do I put this not sounding like a complete ass) knows I’m the smartest in the school, I guess. I’ll spare the specifics, but people see me as a genius. I’ve been having some problems that have just been getting worse where I just can’t do homework. Because of this, I tanked 2 classes for the first half of the year. 

This principal absolutely wants to destroy the band, for some reason. And he’s been doing everything in his power to make our life hell. 

Little background info: This year I was chosen to be president of our music Honor society. Even though I was failing classes, I had what was necessary to stay within the society. (Avg of 80 in non music classes)

Because I'm somehow also the bane of this sad man's existence, he knows of my low grades. He tried to say that I shouldn't be president and I'm not fit for the role yadda yadda yadda. 

The first time he talked about my grades, he walked into the school's fitness room, while female throwers for the track team were working out (who knows why he would go in there) and then just openly says ""BbPenguins is a smart kid, but he's failing some of his classes."" This was to a whole bunch of people I didn't even know, except one of them, of course is one of my best friends so I heard it immediately. No one brought me up as well, he just said it out of the blue to these random people.

Second time: I had thought it was only the one time, but I learned of this recently. So the principal was talking to one of the singers and one of them brought up the Honor society. She says she's being inducted and tells him and he has the audacity to ask ""Do you meet all the criteria."" ( No we're just gonna induct people for the fun of it and at the induction kick them out cause they don't meet the requirements). And of course , since he wants to act like a little school girl and "" spill the beans"" he brings up some sly remark with his Kermit the frog voice like ""idk maybe you don't cause you know the current president is failling right now"" and I'd assume he pranced away like a little flower girl carrying a basket full of slips of paper saying I'm failing,

Do you think there's anything I can do to stop him from continuing this childish bullshit.

In the past month or so, I've applied to over 25 stores and chains in my area but I've only gotten one call back. When I call and ask why I was declined, I found out this is due to my hours and tight schedule. Where I live, the economy isnt well and most places only want employees with more free schedules.  I can't change my classes and they are until June.

A friend reccomended being a sugar baby. But I'm not sure if I can go through with it. I recently got out of a long term relationship and can't fathom being with anyone else right now, and that includes a sugar daddy. The only way it could work would be if it was non sexual (and most likely online). Even with the non sexual idea though, I'm afraid it will impact my future romantic relationships once I tell them I used to be a sugar baby. This is my biggest worry. I don't want something like this to cause potential partners to leave. 

I realize that's my best shot at getting a good sum of money, besides a job, however. 

My parents are currently on a budget which includes cutting out allowance. This happened recently, and during which we also moved and thus had to quit my old job. They originally told me that they would pay for these fees because my job is gone but today I was informed they will not any longer. 

I'm honestly freaking out quite a bit. Things like selling weed and asking friends for money are off the table completely because I'm not comfortable with that.

92,"This is really just a rant, but any advice would be appreciated.

I don’t talk to much of my friends anymore, and I didn’t realize how much it would affect me until now. These are the friends that I spent pretty much my whole 2017 with. They weren’t my ideal friends, which is why I guess I didn’t think I’d be affected by it. I think I’ve been kind of lonely for a while, but I guess it’s gotten worse. 

Last summer was my first summer doing dumb stuff, as a teenager. Before that, my best friend that I had known my whole life, Jake, introduced me to one of his friends, Daniel and some of their other friends. I guess it sounds odd to say, but that was kind of an era in my life and it’s coming to an end. That night that Jake introduced me to Daniel, was the night that I smoked weed for the first time. I’d spend a lot of more time with Daniel and Jake after that. 

We started going to Daniel’s house, and I met his cousin, Evan. We would get stoned in Daniel’s room and just be. I was never a lot like them, but it was nice to feel like I belonged, I guess. We went to a small party, where I introduced one of my friends, Brooke, to Daniel. Soon after, they started dating. That was right before summer. 

When summer came along, it was the five of us all the time. We were with each other so much. I introduced Jake to one of my friends from school, Anna. They’re dating now. 

Brooke and Daniel broke up, which was the end of an “era” in itself, because Brooke was really one of the guys. She was so cool. Anna started to hang out with us more, and we’d get stoned like we always did. By now, it’s about November. I started to distance myself, because I thought I was getting high a little too much. I still hung out with them once or twice a month. 

Well, now Anna doesn’t go to the same school as me. And Jake might be getting in trouble with the law, maybe Daniel and Evan too, but I wouldn’t know. I wouldn’t know because, Jake’s mad at me, and Daniel and Evan were really ever only mutual friends. Maybe Jake stopped smoking weed, like he promised Anna he would. I doubt Daniel and Evan did. I still talk to Brooke sometimes, but we don’t ever hang out. I heard a while ago, that she made out with Daniel, which might be the beginning to the next installment in their on and off relationship. But I don’t think they’ll get back together. Probably for the best. 

Now, I feel like I’ve kind of been left behind now. But, it’s really my own fault. Sometimes, I want to smoke weed with everyone like we used to. Like we did before Anna got mad at Jake because he was reckless when he was high. I wonder if I want to just because I wanna get high, or because I miss having some friends. 

Sorry for dragging this out, but I wanted to get this off my chest.

95,"Hello Reddit,

I am 29, F, have a great job that pays well, a boyfriend...yet I am not really happy.

I don’t know if this has anything to do with it, but I was abused as a kid. Both my parents have PhDs whereas I was a mediocre student, and so I would get beaten regularly and locked out on the porch to “think about what I did” for half an hour or so. I would constantly get compared to everyone, even kids my parents never met, and nothing I did was ever good enough. If I got 100% on a test but missed the extra credit point, my mom would get irritated and focus on that. I constantly got told that there was no one in our family tree as shameful as me, how did they have such a kid, etc.

When I graduated from college, I couldn’t get a job right away. My mom put me under house arrest, comparing me to her dog and saying how even the dog knew when to come to her when called, even the dog ate every tiny bead of food off his plate, etc. I ended up having a mental breakdown and walked for 7 hours in the rain until the cops brought me home.

Anyway, that was 7 years ago. Now I am doing a lot better in life but my mind is still there? At work, I was called into my manager’s office so another manager could show me some cool thing they designed, and I glanced at this craft made of popsicle sticks on my manager’s desk. I could tell it was one of those crafts little kids make in school to give their parents, and I nearly started crying right there seeing my manager put it on his desk because I once gave a similar gift to my own dad and my dad started yelling at me and saying that if I try to give him trash then I shouldn’t give him anything at all. Just little things like that, constantly, and never thinking I am good enough.

I dunno. I have seen therapists, one just ended up crying and the other one excused everything my parents did as “cultural” (they are Asian, so was that therapist) and saying demeaning stuff like “any suicidal thoughts this week?” as an opening line. And that useless bitch cost me $500 for like 8 sessions. A nurse practitioner in psychiatry also pushed Wellbutrin at me, and a month later when I said it wasn’t helping he doubled the amount, and a month after that I said it still wasn’t helping. He told me to keep taking it, so I left because he was no help either.

My brain is like, fixated on my earlier years and so many people would trade to be in my shoes but I am just alone in bed and crying right now.",16Mar2018,1

99,"She throws around words like “racist” and “sexist” without care. For instance, one time, she and her brother were fighting, and she got in more trouble than her brother did. The next day, she accused her father of being sexist because she got a bigger punishment.

She claims she is a “Dunlap” which is my last name, she claims she is my sister, she dyed her hair dark to match mine and my sisters. (She was blonde and now dark brown) and has even told someone she died it to look like the “Dunlap” sisters. Uhm creepy!!! So on sept 29th, I got engaged. Of course all the attention was on me and she could not take it. She lied about being in a head on collision with a drunk driver the next morning. Which never happened and that was confirmed.

101,"A little back story when I was 14 I had a HUGE crush on a girl that I was pretty close with at the time. I was pretty young back then, but I knew I had liked her a lot because we had talked a lot at school and sometimes would hangout outside of school, but never alone. Only with other friends. Towards the end of my our middle school graduation I had to move out of state and it absolutely broke my heart. Even if I had stayed she was going to a completely different school and moved to a different city. To say the least I was completely heartbroken. 

4 years later I'm 18 and I've been living in this new state not liking it here at all. On my vacations I would visit my old state and stay there for a while visiting old friends and enjoying myself. The times I visited I'd sometimes see the girl that I like and the old feelings I'd get would come rushing back. Just absolute amazed by her. Recently I've been talking to her over snapchat sometimes and having somewhat short conversations and re living the past feeling with her. I just ALWAYS end up to start liking her again when I talk to her. I'll actually be moving back to my previous state to graduate there and I've been thinking if I should do anything about how I feel. I wonder if I should maybe ask her out or hangout with her sometimes. These feelings always happen and I just end up so confused. 

SUMMARY: Used to like girl in middle school a lot, were somewhat close friends with her. Moved away felt heart broken, would talk to her even after moved sometimes through snapchat or in person by visiting old state. Will be moving back to old home and live by her again.

106,"The owner of the apartment and I get along pretty well. I always thought he was nice but socially awkward and he doesn’t know how to act around guys. We talk about him and his girlfriend (who he sees over the weekend) and I’ll talk about my friends to him. Everyone lives in their own private bedroom so it has been quite relaxing for 1.5 years, until now.

A few weeks ago, the owner (also my roommate) had texted me that he had left a gift from his girlfriend in my room. I felt extremely shocked that he had walked into my room without my permission and told him that though I appreciated the gift, I didn’t want him in my room ever again. He apologized but I got a weird vibe from it because it didn’t seem genuine. I started to search for other apartments shortly after.

Later I was helping the owner find a new roommate and asked him if it could be a male. He immediately said no, and I asked for his reason. He said that it was become my other roommate (let’s call her Britney) wasn’t comfortable with a male roommate sharing the same bathroom with her (owner has his own bathroom). Fair enough.

Later I was letting Britney know that I was moving out and asked if she knew anyone who wanted to take my spot. She mentioned that the owner probably didn’t want a male roommate and I asked her why. Turns out she didn’t care about her roommate’s gender, so i thought it was odd that he did that.

During my search, I found that most women weren’t comfortable living with an older guy. For assurance, I told them that they could install a lock on their door. I was talking to the owner on whether the new roommate could install a lock, and he immediately said “no”. I asked why and he said just in case there was a fire, which didn’t make sense to me.

Shortly after, I noticed that my roommate had a lock on her door and I asked her about it. Turns out she had installed a lock because she found the owner in her closet... he said that he wanted to give her a cover for her iron board. She installed the lock and the owner lost his shit, threatening to kick her out since she violated her lease. She retorted that he had done something illegal by going into her room and he let her off.

Now I’m worried that he has probably came into my room and I’m hoping dearly that he hasn’t done anything weird to my stuff. I haven’t noticed any missing items. I no longer want to help him find a roommate and I no longer want to talk to him, but he tends to knock on my door to talk. He has also been asking about my new living situation, parking, and wants to see my place before I move into it... it’s really creeping me out. I move out in 2 days and am thinking about staying at my friend’s place.

Could he just be very nosy and is not good with boundaries? He does seem to shake my packages whenever he’s giving them to me and will ask me what it is. Or is he a closet pervert? I don’t know what to do and I’m freaking out.


TL;DR: owner (who has a girlfriend) who lives with me has been lying about things here and there. He wants a female roommate and does not allow door locks. He has been caught in my roommate’s room and came into my room while I was out to give me a gift from his girlfriend. Is he nosy or a pervert?

114,"I had a dinner party a few nights ago and one of the guests really seemed to overstep. 

He...

-Parked in our neighbor’s driveway and made a big fuss about having to move because he “Gets nervous leaving his car on the street.” He came pretty late, so to put him in over driveway, like four people would have had to shuffle. 

-Sat at the head of the table

-He announced “Well I guess we’ll start with the salad first, then we can put out the main dishes one or two at a time.” 

-He welcomed every guest that came through the door. They are our friends, he only knew one or two of the other guests. He actually shook their hands and said “Welcome, thanks for making the drive.” 

-He contradicted me in front of my grandkids. One of my oldest, (15), was there and she passed the bowl of Brussel sprouts down, I didn’t have a problem with this she’s old enough to make her own decisions. He said “Honey, at least take a couple, .” And took the bowl back and put them on her plate. He’d never met her before that night. “Honey”?! 

-He went in our bedroom. We’d intentionally closed the door so the guests wouldn’t wander in. He said he was just “taking a tour of the house.”

-He shut our dogs in one of the back rooms. I thought maybe they were napping in there and someone shut the door without realizing they were in there, so I opened the door again, then saw him leading them back in there. He said he “just wanted to be sure they didn’t bother anybody.” I have a new rescue dog and he gets very anxious being shut up. None of the guests were allergic. They’re elderly. They don’t bother anybody. 

-He opened one of our bottles of wine we had in a cabinet in the kitchen. We didn’t intend on serving this bottle. 

-He decided when it was time for the dinner party to end. He started saying “Well, thank you for coming. Drive safe.” While I was in the middle of talking to my guests. 

-People offered to stay and help clean and he told them “Oh, that won’t be necessary.” Before I had the chance to say anything. (I would have thanked them and declined because they were guests, but still, not his place.) 

-He took a ton of leftovers home with him, uninvited. In Tupperware. Who brings Tupperware to a dinner party?! 

I didn’t put it together at the time, I saw each little annoyance but not the overwhelming big picture. I should have probably just asked him to leave. Now we’re supposed to see them in a couple weeks and I don’t want to see him again. My husband said he was just “making himself comfortable.” We don’t even know him very well!!

116,"Hi Reddit, so I don’t know why but my girlfriends dad literally hates me. I have done nothing wrong to his daughter or to disrespect him or his house while I’m at his house. The only time I guess I disrespected him was when I was two minutes late dropping her off (he’s really strict). Anyways, I think it’s because he notices that she genuinely likes me. Like when I’m telling you she loves me, she cooks for me and gives them to me when I pick her up at her house. Another thing she has done is kiss me whenever her dad walks by. So I’m thinking that she’s just trying to tell her dad that she loves me, don’t get me wrong I really love her too, but I mean it’s not like I’m a fuckboy. Well sorta, but I don’t look the part and act like it. I just watch anime, play video games, and wear thrift shop clothing. I’m really a nice guy, and can hold a really good conversation with anyone. Anyways, I really don’t see the point as to why he doesn’t like me if I treat her daughter right. Oh btw, she’s hated her dad these past few weeks bc she told him I want to marry him and that fucking blew his mind. Ever since then, I haven’t spoken to the dad since. The only thing I’ve confronted with him is when we first started dating I’ll go and say hi to the dad while waiting at the doorstep, or if I’m going to her house I say hello first to the dad. But as of late I haven’t done that. So idk what to do Reddit. What can I do to gain his acceptance or whatever. I told her if I should invite him to do something one on one. Btw I’m 20 and she’s 18.

117,"Hello Reddit
First of all Sorry for my English, as it's Not my Native Language. Also i hope this is the right sub to Post this and i dont bother anyone.

So Long Story short, 6 Years ago i was diagnosed with an Autoimmune disease which took me till now to get used to. I am seeing Multiple Doctors regularly  so i have a pretty Good Basis there. 

My Problem is that over the course of these 6 Years almost my whole Social Life died. I have almost nobody to Talk to (which is fine, as One of my Doctors is a Therapist and that is getting worked on) almost no Friends or Contact to the outside world. In top of that i struggle to get the most Basic Things in the world done. 
Although i am in a pretty stable Relationship (we live together since 4 years) i have the feeling that having almost no daily schedule, Responsibilitys or Friends 
Keeps getting a bigger Problem by the Minute.

If anyone could help me with any advice i would be Really realld greatful.
Thank You

118,"So I have been skipping school recently, but I got help from you guys on this sub-Reddit, so I want to thank everyone who helped me stop.

On to a different manner.

I haven't talked to anyone about this, not even my parents but since you guys have helped me from before and no one knows who I am, I can go ahead and tell you guys this easily. 
I am sorry for going into details, but I feel I have to.

I have an unusually small penis to the point where I even have trouble masturbating. I can't pull back my foreskin, and I can't fit it in the palm of my hand. The times I have had masturbated I have to use my fingers but as you can tell it's not very pleasuring. I feel anxious about it being so small that I don't know what to do when we are having P.E. in school when I have to change. Most of the time I go to the bathroom and change, and I don't want my friends to think I am weird for doing so. This is also a bit embarrassing, but I used to be bullied during 4th grade during shower periods, they called me the lollipop since it was little like a lollipop. Whenever I wore swimming trunks, it got stuck in the net.
So you get it by now.

• So, Is there a way to get rid of this feeling that I am so anxious about my penis size or Is there a way to make it bigger and healthy, so I don't have to worry about it, is there anything I can even do to make me feel normal about my penis.

120,"So I'm apart of an Australian Catholic school, and they have been practicing some sexism.

Like for example, they told us that a woman is less than a man and a womans life is not complete without a man.

And a lot of times women aren't allowed to do certain things (E.g sports, activities, some better stuff) and only men can do it.

This has been upsetting a lot of the girls there and it's been making them feel less and just overall bad.

126,"Sorry for the long read but this is a years worth of stuff coming out here and what im saying here has never come out all at once (some of it never). I have some other underlying issues that i wont discuss for personal reasons which has along with this made life a bit tough but right now i want to focus on sorting this out before tackling bigger issues. 

So i met my ex a year ago and the entire experience was literally a fairytale. We were in a foreign country on tour and after a week we startes dating. We dated for 2 months and whilst it was a beautiful relationship it was ruined by my own insecurities which made it hard for us to continue. He even told me that this was mostly the reason why he had to end it. He was my first everything. I was devastated and the insecurities and paranoia i constantly live with accelerated. I became a hermit for a month which i look back on as a good thing cause i had to study for my trial exams and it gave me some critical self reflection. In this time i lost 7kg because i stopped eating as much (i went 36 hours without eating one week after the breakup). We said we would stay friends but that meant i could see all his social media and whenever he or his friends posted stuff i would get sick to my stomach. I actually vommitted a few times but this could also be coupled with the lack of food. A few months go by i hang out with his best friend at a club one night where he told ne i should be over it all by now. Sidenote here, this friend is really the only person i confide in about how i feel for my ex. Alls good and i started to move on until.... we met up and hooked up. This happened a few more times until he admitted he was kinda using me. But to be honest i was kinda doing the same so it didnt hurt too much. We agree to just be friends again and that we would keep in touch. At this point i thought i would be over him and i was for about a month. But then one night something clicked. I was listening to Fall Out Boy's new song at the time ""Hold me tight or dont"" and everything just hit me like a truck. I knew i didnt want a relationship with my ex but i also wanted something intimate. So we became FWB! I have no regrets about this cause our friendship became better for it. This lasted 3 weeks and it was his birthday during this time (cue drunk make outs in front of 70 people at party). But my drunk ex said a lot of things that night, he told me he loved me (as a friend he would later explain) but some of these things were hard to hear and it just made me fall for him. After a few months of ""wtf are we doing, sex and emotional confusion"", we decide that we need to be done as anything more than friends. This kinda broke me in a sense, i felt so worthless and it still has kinda left me feeling like nothing. I had fallen for him and now i didnt know what to do. The issue i have now is that yes i want to move on but how do you move on from the most amazing person who is one of your best friends? To top this off my own insecurities and general anxities about him have escalated. At this stage, i would say that im not coping well, i have lost further amounts of weight (now 11kg down from original weight to almost underweight) and i cant seem to move on. To further add, my friend (the one from earlier) told me the other day that it seems like i am obsessed with him which i dont believe i am but my own insecurities have made me worry that i give off this vibe and that im pathetic for doing that. How do i tone that down? I think the world of my ex and i never want to lose him even if we arent meant to be together. How do i move past it all and create a lasting friendship? 

Tdlr: cant get over most amazing person i have ever met who is like my best friend. What do?

127,"I am currently doing a 5 month internship at a large international company. I have just finished my seventh week there and thought by now I would start to feel more comfortable with my co-workers and manager. 

Firstly, my manager, while extremely nice sometimes, is a very bitchy person. For example we interviewed candidates for a new role this week and on 4/5 occasions she made horrible comments about them. She said one was too fat and needed to go on a diet and even mimicked one of their accents for sounding too posh and 'stuck-up.' Also with me sometimes I will talk and she will just completely ignore what I said.

My co-workers rarely invite me to lunch even though I sit on the same row of desks as them during the day. Yesterday a lot of people were out of office and it was just me and one woman left. I heard her ask someone if they have had lunch and they said yes. She proceeds to get her lunch and go upstairs to the canteen by herself even though I'm sitting there. I don't know if I am reading too much into this but it is really getting me down. What is wrong with me? 2/4 times this week I have gone to lunch on my own.

I do not know how I am at fault here and what I can do for them to not exclude me? The previous intern before me I'm told did not speak to my co-workers much and took a while to introduce himself. I take this as they did the same to him as they are doing to me.

I live at home with my parents ( but I'm helping them payoff the mortgage). I realize my circumstances are very fortunate yet, any time I want to buy something for myself I agonize over the purchase. I haven't bought new clothes in about 7 years. No new shoes in the last 3 years. Last week I finally spent about 275 dollars on some clothes since none of mine fit or were too faded or had holes in them, I also bought new work shoes for 80 bucks since mine stunk.... and I bought a hundred dollar perfume. First time I had spent money on myself in years... i lost sleep over the money i wasted, so yesterday I returned two of the clothing items and returned the perfume saving about 130.

My current grade is a B, but I’m not sure how much longer I can keep it that way.  Its a tough course and it takes a lot of energy out of me, not to mention it creates me a good deal of stress.

The pros of dropping the class are reduced stress and more time to focus on my other classes.  Right now I’m going through an emotional rough-spot , and Id feel a little better if I could remove some major stressors in my life.  Im not interested in the course material too much, unlike my other classes, and that makes it harder to find motivation.

The cons of dropping would be purely moral.  Id feel like a lazy quitter if I dropped the class, despite the fact I dont need it for my required credits.  I sorta feel like its the easy way out, and that isn’t usually how I roll.

Kind of in a weird arrangement with my roommate at the moment with food and sharing of food.
Bit of back story i moved in with one of my friends i knew from high school and his mum has over a years worth of food stockpiled nearby for him to eat through out the year (frozen meals, meat, etc). For the few weeks that we had been in uni  he (and his mum) had offered to share some of the food with me. For a while it was fine, sometimes having those meals and others buying food together to cook something fresh, but after a while he has started to ask me to cook/buy him dinner as a fair trade for the food he shared with me on occasion. generally when we do cook we take turns and just help out where needed but lately he has just not helped at all and left all the cooking and washing up (bowls included) to me. 
Anyway getting to the point am i misguided in thinking that he is kind of taking advantage of me being there? Like is it fair me having to spend all of my own money while he spends none for us all to get the same meals? Should i just start to buy my own stuff separately and leave him to do his own thing?

As a kid, my classmates who weren't originally from that place hated it. I felt shunned from the community as a whole because my dad didn't work in a major company that all my classmates belonged to and kids like us never got invited to the company picnic, etc.

My BF insist on saying how he would have loved living there. I told him several times that he didn't live there as a kid so he can't say shit like that and he would insist. 

It really annoys me a lot when he says crap like that. I feel that saying, ""You saying this is not respecting my experience and I really don't like it,"" won't get anywhere.

156,"I have two main friends. I’ll give them names; Jessica and Sarah (Fake names). Jessica is kind of the leader of our group being a model, actress and having an amazing singing voice. These things also help her get all the boys she wants. Sarah is crazy about this one guy. We’ll call him John. She’s liked John forever and recently Jessica just randomly started liking him too. So guess what? They are together! That was last year but they broke up. Sarah moved on to another person and Jessica has been telling her lies about him liking her back... and she believes it. So now I really like this guy named Blaine (fake name). On my phone I put a heart next to him contact. I was at Jessica’s house and left me phone there. Jessica always wants attention from Blaine and tells him everything. Jessica promised not to tell our crushes out but apparently now she’s “loyal” to Blaine. So when I was in 1st period, Jessica decides to take my phone to school, tell Blaine I want to go out with him and when he says He doesnt believe her, she’ll show him my contact. Well she gives me my phone back and doesn’t mention this exchange at all. When I get home I get a text from Blaine saying that “He knows who I ‘like’” I say who and he says “Me”. Trying to hide this I say “What? Who told you that?” He said Jessica so I go to text her. I ask her why she told him and of course she gets defensive saying that he’s lying and that she didn’t say anything. After a while of texting she gives up and says she gave him a “hint”. I ask him about it and he just said she straight up told him.

157,"Hello everyone. So before I get into this, I have never before in my life ever had delusions and or paranoia. I have never felt that anyone has stalked me. So this started over two weeks ago. A next door neighbour of mine is an elderly man in his 60s who used to be a High School teacher. This man over the last two weeks has been driving his Ute out at 1:30 in the morning every day for the last two weeks. It wakes me up and I have looked at the window every time to see if it was him and it was. I fall asleep again pretty quickly and he comes back at around 5:00 in the morning. 

Lately whilst I have been out walking in my unit complex I have noticed this car with pitch black windows driving near and parking near this man's unit. The car then drives off and no person has ever got out of the car. This man also has never seem to have noticed the car. The car sometimes drives in early in the evening just as I'm walking back home and also late at night(I've seen it when I've woken up from hearing the car and I looked out the window) and then the car parks with the headlights on near this man's unit. The car then switches the headlights off and drives off. The car comes into the unit complex about twice a week and parks for a short time and then drives off. 

The latest this car has come into the unit complex is around midnight. No one in the unit complex has seem to have noticed the car except me and my parents. I believe that this man could be being stalked and I have no idea why. This man is friendly and he chats to everyone in the unit complex. It's also strange to me that this man goes out at that time of the morning. He's also widowed with no family. Could I be totally wrong about this and could the car having nothing to do with his man?",16Mar2018,1

160,"I’m 24 and I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember. I first started talking about wanting to die when I was 8 and got first diagnosed at 14, and now that I’m an adult and I’m supposed to recover, there is nothing to return to. I don’t *have* anything that I used to be or do before I got depressed. I don’t have a personality outside of it.

Trying to choose hobbies and who to be seems overwhelming, I put my standards too high and then get ashamed and anxious because of course I know I’m not going to be the next Mark Twain or Frida Kahlo, and the thought of just being an ordinary human being who is neither sick or somehow phenomenal is simply absolutely alien.

How do you *become* a normal person? How do you accept it? It feels like normality is such a narrow seat, and once you’ve slipped off there is no climbing back, and the only other options are being a disaster or something magnificient.

161,"Okay so I have a best friend who is a guy. We recently broke off our communication for a while. I feel like he doesn't cherish me enough or is putting in effort for our friendship. He says he's just lost and that he really is unmotivated to do anything. But I don't know. He just vanishes for a day or two and comes back as if he didn't just ignore me the whole time. It would be okay for me if he told me like ""Hey, I really don't feel like talking right now."" That would have made it so much better. But he just vanishes like I don't matter.

He goes online or can text but he never replies to me. I get so worried sometimes because we're in a long distance friendship. And we do love each other so much. We consider each other as the other's soulmate. Our connections goes so deep but I feel like he just doesn't cherish me at all. That he's okay with not talking to me for days while I get stuck worrying about him all the time.

We broke off communication by my initiation because I just can't do it anymore. I feel so undervalued and I don't think he sees my worth.

Got screwed over bad and totally out of the dark. Due to us being best friends, we didn't sign a contract on the business and now after me doing most of the work for 4 years, he just suddenly denied my access everywhere and basically took over the company.

I have consulted a lawyer and unfortunately it looks like our verbal agreement + text message logs talking about our mutual business will not hold up in court, so legally speaking I'm screwed here.

However, it was me who did most of the work and who was the expert in the niche, so I'm building a competing site right away and I'm hoping to launch in a couple weeks.

I still have access to the old company's Instagram account (which he knows obviously, because he can't login) and the Google Analytics (this he doesn't know about). I haven't posted anything on Instagram after the ""breakup"" because I don't really know what the wisest thing to do is.

Time might be a factor here, because the ex business partner has access to the parent Facebook account and might get the Instagram account with the help of Insta support. Also, he might notice the Analytics access and revoke it, but this isn't as likely.

166,"Backstory: When I lived in the same city as this guy I'm very much interested in, he was in a relationship the whole time. They eventually broke up and we started going out for a month, but then I had to move back to my home city. Now we visit each other occasionally (once a year) and text sometimes. Whenever we see each though it's like no time has passed and the conversation and sex and everything is just fire.

Here is my problem: I would very much like to pursue a relationship with this person, and I know he would be interested in dating me as well if I still lived in the same city as him. We have joked about making a marriage pact, and he has even asked if i would've said yes if he asked me to marry him. I just don't know that long-distance is a good way to start a relationship, and I'm not sure that's something he'd even be open to. Uprooting my life to move back to his city to date feels like too big a gamble right now. I would rather visit with more frequency since it is a short flight away.

I like the idea of a marriage pact since we've both been tired of being single for a very long time now, and we vibe together so well. I know he cares a great deal about me, as I do with him, and I think we could be happy together. I also think it'd be easy for either of us to move based on what we both do for work. The only hassle is one of us is American and the other Canadian, so there is the issue on attaining citizenship. But that could be worked out. 

I'm currently in his city for a visit and we have two more dates together before I leave. I'd really like to bring up the idea of escalating our relationship whether it be through giving long-distance a shot, or creating a marriage pact for the next few years. We've known each other for 8 years now and have often talked about how we really missed our chance back in the day... I just don't know how to proceed in this situation.

171,"Firstly, apologies if this runs a little long. I'm writing this on a mobile so I can't really get a sense of length. Excuse typos and rubbish autocorrects for the same reason.  
  
I married my high-school sweetheart when I was 22 years old. By this point we'd been together for around six years. We had a child together the previous year and the circumstances were difficult. I had foregone traditional university education to start an entry-level career, was doing great, was studying for a degree with a distance-learning university (which was rough, let me tell you!). She was studying art, had a small business selling her pieces and to my mind was doing really well. The end of her formal education rolled around and (though she never admitted it) I suspect she was terrified of being part of the real world and getting a job. She started piling on the pressure to have a baby and initially I resisted because I was sure it wasn't the right time. We were living in a rented house; I was still at the bottom rung of the career ladder and was studying hard to make sure I could progress. I wanted kids, I told her, but not right now. She also knew how important it was for me to be able to provide a stable environment for our children because it was something I didn't have when I was growing up. We were always getting kicked out of houses because my parents didn't pay the rent. There was never any food in the house because neither of them worked. I wanted better for my own children, a lot better. Anyway, the pressure progressed to the point where we'd have arguments about it, her friends were joining in and she kind of made it seem as though she was prepared to leave me if I didn't agree to have a child with her. Remember, of course, that she was the only woman I'd ever been with and I was absolutely head over heels in love with her. So I gave in, we had a baby and immediately I fell in love with him too. He was perfect. Maybe things wouldn't be so bad after all.  
  
Life got progressively more difficult as the university workload increased and as I slowly climbed the career ladder. I grew resentful of the way she could spend every moment with our child while I had to spend most evenings and weekends studying. I missed out on trips to the park, Sunday dinners at her parent's house, all because I was working hard for our future. Less than two years after our first child was born (so less than a year after we got married) the cycle begins again - she wants another child. It was easier for her to get what she wanted this time because when she started to suggest she'd leave I caved immediately - I didn't want our child to have a broken home. Our second child was born in 2013. Again, I loved him to bits. I loved my first child. I loved my wife.  
  
It didn't last long, though. The realities of life set in and I was back to studying, back to working as hard as I could to ensure I could provide for all of us alone. Only this time the negative feelings I had were doubled. Now I was missing out on spending time with both of my children. I recognised within myself the symptoms of depression, I took myself to the doctors and was prescribed anti-depressants but I never told my wife. I didn't want to seem weak, although looking back I realise how poor that approach was. Ultimately nothing worked, until I met somebody who made everything seem OK again. Just talking to this woman made life seem liveable. I have to stress that I absolutely did not cheat on my wife with this woman, although I was accused of doing so by everyone when I ended my marriage in 2014. It destroyed me to do so, because I loved (and still love) her with everything I have. I just couldn't handle the way my life was going. I didn't feel in control, and all the things that she knew I thought were important (like owning our home; having a steady job and a strong education) were pushed to the side so she could have what she wanted.  
  
I last spoke to her in late 2014. We were discussing how we would share childcare arrangements. I hadn't properly seen either of the children for around four months because after the break up I hit the bottle. Hard. I kept everything together, somehow, because I didn't lose my job and I don't think anybody else knew. But for those four months I was a typical, broken alcoholic. I went cold turkey a week or so before the last time I saw her and haven't touched a drop since. At this meeting, she said the children had forgotten me, that neither of them asked about me, that they were happy. The eldest was just starting school and that he shouldn't have to go through the upheaval of being re-introduced to me etc. Like a sucker, I agreed, thinking that she only had their best interests at heart. I wanted what was best for them and I trusted what she was saying. Essentially ""let them grow up and if they want to know you, they will"". That was the last time I ever spoke to her, even the divorce proceedings were done by mail.  
  
Since then, I've finished university and gotten my PhD. I'm a respected member of my industry. I have a new name (remember the bum parents I mentioned earlier? They got in trouble with the law so I needed to disassociate myself). But every day I wonder how my children are. Every day I wonder what they look like. Every day I wonder whether they're being treated well, by their mother, by their step-father if there even is one in the picture. It was the eldest child's birthday at the beginning of the month. He's seven now. But I can't send him a card or a present, one because I don't know where they live and two because he probably *has* forgotten all about me. It kills me to know they're growing up without me. It kills me to know that she and I may still be a happy family if she'd just let me get to this point. Now I'm ready for children. Now I desperately want them.  
  
And that's what I need advice on, redditors. I've missed out on a huge part of my children's lives. I do have the legal right to see them, if I wish. I'm not a deadbeat, I'm not abusive. If I went to court to gain access to them, I could probably secure visitation rights if not joint custody. I just don't know whether it's the right thing to do. On the one hand, I want to be a part of their lives, and I want them to be a part of mine. But if they've forgotten me, and if they're happy and healthy, should I force myself into their lives? Do I wait until they're old enough to find me on their own? If I do that, will they hate me because they will think I never bothered to try and make contact with them? If I do leave them be, how do I stop crying myself to sleep some nights because I miss them so much?

As I was driving home, I also occasionally tapped on my phone to change music as well. Then, as I was nearing my home, which is about another 5-10 minute drive.

184,"In June of 2017 I found out I had cancer. Luckily, I would be able to remove with a surgery due to the type of disease I had. However I was 18 at the time (19 now) and the whole thing felt surreal. I told a few friends right before my surgery what I had been dealing with, but for the most part I handled it on my own, which was potentially a mistake. 
See, in many people's lives i'm a listener and advice giver. I'm always told i'd be a good therapist because I can listen and am honest (idk if I agree because I know very little about actual skills involved in clinical therapies but.. yea.) It's safe to say, when my friends needed me, I was there. 
Moving back to campus last August started out well. I was recovering well from cancer and my social life had remained the same. 
Then, my closest friend cut me off, and the other took a semester off. I felt the loneliest I had felt in years. Weight gain kicked in, I started sleeping all the time, and it felt like everyone who should have cared never reciprocated efforts, so I just stopped trying to hit people up. I was convinced everyone hated me and was sick of me, and very few people did anything to convince me otherwise. 
At the end of the semester I mainly had 2 friends still be there for me and they were N &amp; T. 
After winter break, I decided to open up to the few people i considered close about all I had been going through. No resentment, just to let them know so they could help me. Keep in mind that I never open up about my emotions so this conversation made me feel extremely vulnerable. Everyone I had told was shocked. When I told N &amp; T, they even had tears in their eyes. That was mid-jan. 
For the next month, I hit up N &amp; T 1-2 times a week to hangout but eventually replies dwindled and then stopped altogether. They both became a lot more busy, but they still were going out, on their social medias. I mean, is replying to a text once a week really that hard? 
Luckily, I became a lot closer to a different friend group I knew, so they helped me take me out of a slump. 
It began to feel like no one from the last year and half of my life seemed to really care that I was going through this. All i ever wanted from people was for them to hangout with me once im a while and be my friend. 
I eventually called out N after two months of not seeing her (I've known her for way longer.) 
She was quite upset but agreed to hangout. N &amp; T are roommates, and as I walked in, I saw how half the pictures in their room had me in it. The hangout went well, it seriously felt like old times. When I had to leave, they were begging me stay. 
T recently hit me up saying she ""needed me in her life."" Other people who I was extremely close to before all of this shit are also trying to HMU now that im back to going out and seem happy i guess Is it shitty that im mad at these people for not being there for me? or is it unfair to hold it against them? and honestly how do i know that all of this isn't some game or anything? i just don't understand how you can cut off a friend for 2 months knowing they have depression lol ",16Mar2018,3

At my current job I am also the marketing lead so I get to set up shopping events, skate events, snowboard events, tuning events, take care of our social media, etc. It’s pretty fun and exciting and I enjoy making the connections/relationships outside of retail with people.

I have also volunteered at events to give back to our community which I really enjoy as well. 

I just want to move on from retail and don’t know what direction to go in if I don’t have a degree in anything other than art. I don’t know where to start, what to look for, what I really want as a career. I feel stuck. Any advice? ",16Mar2018,1
187,"I have a C- average in junior year of high school. I’m a good test taker, but I’m bad at deadlines and generally unmotivated to do my work. I have a 31 ACT score and a 1210 PSAT, but my grades are bad. Some of this can be explained by the fact I have a severe learning disability. My options for college are limited, and I’d consider community college, if it weren’t for my parents. My mom’s moving to the city once I graduate, and she’s said she won’t have room for me with her budget. I don’t blame her for it, it would be good for her to be closer to work, and she’s wanted to do it for a long time. If I go to community college, I would have to live with my dad and his wife. My dad is emotionally constipated, constantly shits on my interests, blames me for my disability, is a homophobic asshole, and basically treats me like I’m something to control. His wife is an absolute control freak. I’ve gotten yelled at for asking my dad to pass me something instead of her. I cannot live with them anymore. It’s essentially torture. The community college offers dorms, but I’m told if I go there, I’m going to live with my dad, because of something about money. I want to be a screenwriter or a concept artist, but I’m afraid with my grades I’m never going to able to do something I feel passionate about and life will be just as meaningless to me as it is now.

195,"A little background info: I live in a cramped 2 bed, 1 bath apartment with my SO, our roommate, a dog, and two cats. My roommate has had her SO staying here for 3 weeks now. A few days here and there is fine, but it has been almost a month since my roommate's SO has stayed a night at his own apartment. He's starting to use our facilities to get ready for his day(which sometimes causes issues for the rest of us getting ready), taking up parking in the tenant lot, adding more devices to our already shitty Vermont internet (so it lags even more), and I just feel as though I'm not able to be myself around this person. How can I bring up these issues and have a conversation without hurt feelings or someone getting upset?

198,"I apologize in advance for the wall of text.  I just moved into a student apartment with random roommates relatively recently.  I've talked to them before and it seemed like we hit it off but lately I've felt like they don't like me anymore or they have some sort of problem with me.  For example, I walked in with my groceries a couple weeks ago and all of them were in the kitchen.  I smiled and said hi, but no one really acknowledged me; I figured, okay fine they're mid conversation.  Then, I left and came back up not 2 mins later with the rest of my groceries and they had all left.  All but one of them ignore me when I see them in the kitchen or living room since then, so I've tried my best to stop saying hi in case I'm being annoying.

The other day, I woke up half asleep and went to open the door for my boyfriend (we've discussed SOs staying over night and they all are okay with it, as we all have SOs who stay over frequently).  It was 12:30am and I forgot to put pants on (half asleep and thought no one else was home, considering it's spring break and I've seen my roommates do laundry without pants on).  One of my roommates was in the kitchen and I smiled at her but she didn't acknowledge me.  About 20 mins later, I went to put a load of laundry on (with pants on this time, because I saw she was home).  As I was starting the wash, I overheard her in her room (it's right in front of the laundry room and our walls are thin) ranting about something and she said ""her and her skater ass boyfriend.""  I believe she was referring to me, as my boyfriend is a ""skater ass"" and she had just seen me let him into the apartment 20 mins prior.  The only thing I can think of that I did wrong to her was take a bite of one of her biscuits on the counter.  I had ordered food and my bread was wrapped the same way; I wasn't paying attention and got the two foil wrapped things confused and did not realize it was not my bread until I took a bite.  I rewrapped it and texted our group chat to apologize and explain myself.  I offered up one of my garlic knots/said I owe someone a biscuit just let me know but nobody took me up on it.

I also stopped texting the group chat about stuff.  Our apartment tends to overcharge us for electric and I asked if anyone had tried to resolve it before, but only one roommate responded.

Am I being paranoid that they don't like me or have some sort of issue with me?  If they have an issue with me, what can I do to help fix it? I moved into this apartment to get away from a horrible roommate and really hate living with tension.",16Mar2018,13

One year later, she couldn't finish her thesis, after having spent several thousands of euros, not getting her master, just being left with a post graduation, since she  only finished her classes and not the final thesis. 

Now she just gets home and gets to sleep in order to not think about anything, she can't concentrate at her current work because of this sense of guilt, of desiluding her parents and spending their money and not being able to finish.


Is there anything I can do to help? I've been just saying that I'll always be there for her, and that no one is disapointed in her, but of course the pain won't go away with this words. It just makes me really sad that I can't do anything about her",16Mar2018,3

217,"I loved this girl for over a year. She was in a long term relationship at the time. We spend a lot of time together over that period and I grew to love her (her boyfriend lived in another town), I didn’t do anything because although I knew it was unhappy without her saying so it wasn’t my place to try and end her relationship so she would be with me. She leaves the guy a month ago. I decided I’m going to gauge how she is for a couple of months then if I feel good about it, ask her out.

Throughout this whole time my then best friend goes from encouraging me to spend time with her and “play it long” to then discouraging me and telling me she’s bad news, that she’s a slut because she’s very affectionate with everyone and making it out to me that he doesn’t like her at all. Leading me to think that when he’s playing nice with her he’s only doing so not to make it awkward for me. I was completely under the impression that he didn’t like her and wanted better for me, whatever he thought that was. In terms of me and his relationship, we were very close he described me as “like a little brother to him”. He even recounted me a story of when someone asked if him and her were together and he told them that “she’s the apple of my best friend’s eye, no way”. He knew very much that I loved her. I asked him for advice before I felt that he was tired of hearing about it a few months ago.  Which I wasn't happy with but I thought that he was going through a hard time so it wasn't fair to bother him with something like that.  He even advised me to ask her out whilst she was in a relationship.

Fast forward to Tuesday. My best friend tells me he went out with her the day before and they kissed. Not only do they kiss but he claims that she was telling him that she liked him at the beginning of the year and that she had been waiting for him to kiss her. It’s important to note she didn’t leave her relationship because she wanted to be with my best friend. That’s what she said. His father is dying and apparently she had gotten close to him and was listening to him a lot about it. He fell for her a couple of months ago he says. So I spend Tuesday walking around this shopping complex with him having a mini breakdown and him answering a whole bunch of questions from me before I decide I don’t want to do this anymore and just go home. He then tells me two things “we’re the same age and in the same profession, I’m better for her” and “I’m counting on you to get over this because I want to be with her, whether it takes a few hours or a year”.

It’s worth noting that a few of our mutual friends had guessed that he liked her from long before he found out about his father’s condition. According to him that was true. Most of them had advised him against it. One of our mutual friends showed me messages they had exchanged before the day and he claims he felt like shit for feeling how he did before he went on the date. Which means he went anyway. The people who have known about this before Tuesday all chastised him for being a massive piece of shit and being entirely selfish. A few of them have actually said this to him and he’s warped by the guilt. Me and him then decided it was best that we don’t speak to each other for a while.

So he tells me and I am absolutely crushed. First of all my heart is broken and now I feel like I have been massively stabbed in the back by someone who described me as “like a little brother to him”. It dawned on me that I have been lied to for nearly a whole year by someone I trusted. I feel like he was trying to set me up to fail this whole time simply so he could have a shot with her. He knows I would never do this to him. Last time I knew a girl he liked I refused to even check her out because I felt she was off limits. I now never want to introduce a girl to him because I feel like no one is off limits to him.

At the end of the day on Tuesday he goes to her workplace and he tells her what happened. He says they agree that now is not the time to be in a relationship. I didn’t know exactly what she knows because I don’t really trust him at that point. She’s crushed and he says she had no idea how I felt about her.  I tell my friend that he is not going to be the one who fixes this for me when he messages me later that evening trying to convince me that it will all be ok.

She messaged me the day after saying that she had no idea and that she feels like she’s hurt me. She says she thought I maybe liked her a little bit but she has no idea that I felt that strongly about her. She feels absolutely gutted and she wants to talk at some point over the phone. Just me and her. She values our friendship a lot and feels like she should listen to me and be there for me like I have been for her. I told her I needed space and I had no idea what to say to her at the moment, and that neither him nor her were going to get me through this. Because I truly had no idea what to say, I am absolutely crushed and feel absolutely betrayed.

I speak to her over the phone the next week and she tells me that she had no idea how I felt.  She also says that he barely mentioned his dad's condition and that he maybe brought it up twice that she could remember.  She really didn't know that much about it.  That and she says she never even mentioned a relationship to him because she's not over her ex-boyfriend and still has to make peace with him and how their relationship ended.

Between then and the next time I saw her this guy had stopped talking to all but one of our mutual friends, who I don't know that well.  No reason for the most part, just stopped.  One of them he snapped at when the friend asked him how he was.  He also tells everyone that he's leaving to live in another part of town that's an hour away from where I live.  That and they agree to keep seeing each other, she thought he was probably just telling me how he thought it would all pan out.  

I see her for the first time in person and we have a long heart to heart.  We clear things up, she admitted where she was wrong with me.  I told her straight that if she pursued something with this guy at any point then I couldn't be there for her.  I would just be telling her all the time how I thought he was a scumbag and was looking to hurt her.  She says she felt bad about kissing him when he made it seem that he was the only one who felt bad about it.  It turns out that they agreed to just take it slowly and she maintains that she clarified to him that they aren't together.  However she now knows that he's been telling other people differently and isn't sure why he's doing that.  She also says that her ex-boyfriend is showing up to her house every couple of days begging for her to come back and she's considering it.  I tell her that I need space from the situation and that she should take space from everyone too.  She told me that she would do that when I left but I haven't seen her or hear from her for a week so I don't know.

The day after I see him at my gym.  He storms into the changing room and then he storms out 5 minutes later.  I witnessed this as the place I was exercising is right by the entrance of the locker room.  A couple of days later I see him pacing around on my way home (my gym is about 10 minutes from where I live).  He spots me and my friend so he pretends to take a phone call.  This is about 9pm.  That and none of our mutual friends live in the same area.

Fast forward to today and he's now reaching back out to a mutual friend who he previously snapped at when they asked him how he was.  How do I proceed?",16Mar2018,5

At New Year's Eve i was invited by a girl to this girl party, let's call her ""Caroline"" we talked because we've known each other for a while, she was very amazed by myself and how i've changed from a fatty/party animal to a guy who cared about himself and his body. Spended next saturday together, went to a local restaurant, i was very pleased how good i was spending time with her. Next weekend she invited me over to her place, stayed up late up to 5am, was getting a weird nervous/blushing red from time to time vibe from her. And other 2 weekends we've also spend with each other, but her persona in my head was always as a friend, didn't want anything else. The last week we've seen each other, we got very drunk, i've said some deep serious shit about myself and how i would be pleased just to have someone since i don't have literally anyone at this time, besides my parents and sister who lives at the other part of the world. She cried but i managed to notice just because of her voice, didn't react because i don't knew how. Texted her next day, because she wanted to meet me, asked if it's still on, she said that isn't feeling well.

She said she cant count on me because she got into a fight with her friend the night of our fight and was really upset. then i got upset that she lied to me and she thinks that since i knew she was upset and still got upset, i added to her anger so that means she cant count on me. Even though I got angry that she lied, I still stayed and talked to her so i can be there for her. I also told her it hurt that she lied and she denied that she lied, said bye and left. She tells me bye and hangs up, then she tells me i’m not there for her. What? 

Her friends even text me once in a while telling me what a great guy i am, how they are so happy to know that my girl has someone like me because they know they can always count on me to take care of her and keep her happy, and that they know she doesn’t show appreciation for most of the things I do but they appreciate it and know she does too

Idk if my post made it sound like i’m not happy with out relationship but i am. Her and i are so happy so when we get into dumb fights like this over nothing its annoying

idk how she can tell me she can’t count on me. Honestly one of the worst things she could have said to me.",16Mar2018,1

242,"So basically the title, I made a little bit of a mess of my life where I live now and have a lot of depression/anxiety from my life growing up here blah blah, so I'm taking an opportunity at a new great job and actual career path for myself on the other side of the Country that I am extremely grateful for. Upon telling one of my friends this he told me the next day he had been wanting to get out of this place too we live and basically wanted to move with me and live together in the new location.

On the one hand it might make sense financially, at least in the short term, and it would be nice having someone I know there, and he is a friend (not an amazing one but good) and we have much in common. I feel like I'm overthinking it but I guess it's because I have mentally been psyching myself up to take this big adventure alone, and it won't quite be that if my friend comes with me anymore...and may even hinder how I branch out and ultimately grow as a person which is one of the main reasons I'm leaving, because I'm stagnant here where I am now. The second thing is the family I'm moving close to is famous. I slightly worry about the logistics of how I'm going to split up and put my foot down on the times I bring him with me to hang out with that family and/or events I can go to because of them and the times I'd frankly rather just do those things alone. He would know about these events going on of course.

If I was moving an hour or a few away I would definitely room with him. I'm just kinda caught off guard by it since I'm literally moving across the Country where I'll know no one other than family. I feel like that's a much bigger decision to go into with someone. What would you do? Smart to bring a friend on the journey for financial support and someone I know and get along with pretty well or do it alone?",16Mar2018,2
243,"I recently started my first full time job after college , I was initially very exited about it and I was promised there would be many opportunities for career development / learning new skills. However in the past month or so I have increasingly been given mundane , tedious tasks to do that are well below my capability. I’m repeatedly assured by my superiors that I’m doing a fantastic job and that I will be rewarded in the future with more interesting work but that never happens. I’m told all i need do is ask and I will be given more challenging work but when I do ask I’m told there’s none available. 
I recently spoke to my boss’s boss and he said that I had great potential but the issue was that I was too quiet and therefore being overlooked. I found this incredibly frustrating as he was essentially saying that what’s holding me back isn’t some objective skill that I can work on but my personality, I’m not really one for small talk and I have no issue with the fact that i’m a more introverted person , that’s just who I am. I also felt that I was being fobbed off with another bs excuse for why I’m being sidelined , the three most senior people on my team are also very quiet people so it just doesn’t add up.

245,"Hi all,

I graduated from college with my MS in Dec 2016, and since then have been working at a small start up (25 minutes from my house) as an Associate Scientist. I make $78,000 per year, salaried, with a 7.5% annual bonus. 

I started having some trouble with my boss’ management style in October, and so started looking for a new job. In January, we were put on furlough every Friday and our pay was reduced 20%. This turbo charged my search. The company said once the venture funding was acquired, as a retention bonus, we would be reimbursed the 20% of our furloughed salary, and our bonus would be paid out. 

I was offered a contract position at a very large company as a Scientist at $45/hour ($93,600 a year) for 6 months. I was concerned about it being a contract position, but the recruiter spoke to the hiring manager, and she told me that they are definitely looking to add someone to the team permanently if the contract goes well. Unfortunately it is 1 hour away (by train).

I just found out that my current company is expecting funding to come in next week. This would mean that if I stayed, I could collect the back pay and my bonus, so maybe around $10k pretax. But if I stay at my current position, I would still want to find a new job, because of my issues with my boss. However I would have the luxury of looking for a new job with the security of a full time permanent position, albeit with the stress of continuing to work with my boss.

If I take the new job, I get a pay increase, a better title, and the opportunity to join a larger company with a great reputation. Their salaried employees get great benefits, such as a pension plan and better health insurance than what I currently have. However the biggest downside is I could be looking for a new job again in 6 months.

Should I take the risk of the new job, or keep my old job and keep looking? I am married with a mortgage, so I’m not too footloose and fancy free unfortunately. But my husband makes plenty and he’s very stable in his current position, so we could be fine on one income for a few months.

I am an anxious person, and both options make me uncomfortable. I’d just like some other perspectives. Thanks!!",16Mar2018,4

I almost crashed twice, once I forgot to take it out of reverse when backing out and almost reared a 1000 pound dumpster. The second time I didn’t realize the while was still one rotation into the right and almost swerved into another parked car. 

The second time I drove my uncles old truck to 7-11 about a mile away at 1am. There were no other cars so the street was easy. No particular mistakes. 

The thing is my uncle moved and we don’t have any family within 600 miles of us. The only car we have is my dads Nissan platinum which was a measley 60k and it’s not even 4 months old so I really really hate driving it.

It makes me sad how she never really stands up for me when my ex-friend is being mean but I don't know if I can expect that from her. For example.. I had an important doctors appointment today because I'm not doing well. She asked me to call her after but when I did she was with my ex-friend who was very annoyed I was calling and then she said ""I guess I should hang up"" and I heard my ex-friend say ""Yeah maybe you should!""
I wish Steph would just tell her to shut up.

Steph often adapts herself to other people and I wish she would stay true to herself more. I know she doesn't want to lose us but it hurts when she doesn't call my ex-friend out for her behaviour towards me. She mostly just talks along afraid to chose for what is right. 

I am scared of how my ex-friend is influencing Steph in treating me differently. I shared my feelings with Steph and she admitted to having done this in the past.  

Steph is a truly good person. She is just very easy tot influence. But I don't feel like that is a reason to not fight for our friendship.

So my sister married a guy with a prior felony conviction. I'm fine with that as I believe everyone should have a chance to rehabilitate. Well in the last year he's had multiple felony weapons charges and drug charges against him. He's out of jail before our wedding, and we decided that he is not welcome at the event. 

My sister threw an absolute fit. She's the type that posts drama on social media all the time, and constantly sees herself as a victim. We explained to her that we are open to having him at future events. We told her that we feel that his release from jail is too close to our wedding date, and we aren't comfortable having him there without him showing us he's changed. 

My mother is now blaming us for causing the rift. So my sister and mom see no issues with his behavior. My sister went as far as to say that his actions were fine, he just got caught because my mom's boyfriend reported him to the police.

They just say “it’s because you’ve had bad posture your whole life”. They think it started because I’m tall and I bent over a cash register for 3 years of my life, because I was fine before 19, when I started working at Staples doing the register, is when I noticed the pain.

272,"I’m unemployed and on benefits for my mental instability, 21F is a full time chef and 28F is a full time carer. We live in quite a big house, quite old, but we love it. We all share the WiFi bills and pay electric in turn, do our own shopping etc. But we have a massive issue with 28F; she doesn’t tidy up after herself, she only buys food for work and then helps herself to whatever 21F and I have bought. She does not replace what she has taken. The agreement was that I would keep us topped up on everyday food such as bread, cheese, milk. 21F provides the laundry products and food, and 28F is supposed to provide toilet roll, hand soap etc. So far, 28F has not held up her part of the agreement and acts very hostile when asked to buy something.

When it comes to paying electric she will acknowledge the electric is out completely and leave for work or go to her own Mums in her car, and when she does pay it she only puts in £5 when we put in £15/20 each time. Both housemates are aware I live on benefits so am unable to continuously pay for things when it’s their turn, 21F and I work together to pay for the house itself but we feel we are treading on eggshells with 28F. She will walk by a full bin and not do anything about it, nor will she take the bins out to be emptied on Tuesday nights. She will put rubbish *next* to the bin. She doesn’t do her dishes and often just.. leaves her plates, bowls, food packaging etc. lying wherever she was eating.

Our landlord and owner of the house called round in January, the house was damaged from a previous tenant and it needed a serious clean because no one cleans up after themselves and shit tends to build up a LOT. She did not sign the contract. She offered to clean the bathrooms, there’s three in our house and we knew she wouldn’t be able to do much when she became heavily pregnant so we let her off with that. The bathrooms still weren’t cleaned a fortnight later. She doesn’t seem to realise or care that we cleaned the house top to bottom, did various skip runs and deep cleaning in every single room while she chilled out in her mothers home until late on the night before our landlord came round. She will bitch and whinge if others leave ONE plate or bowl out, or if the full bin tips over, but she won’t do anything about it. She has continued to smoke in her bedroom and chuck her butts out of her window onto the ground which we clean despite us asking her to stop numerous times. She is 6 months pregnant now, she is fully capable of still being a full time carer but refuses to participate in any household duties or pay for anything when it is her turn. She did not contribute to buying heating oil last month so now we are broke and living in a house with no heating, and she is now demanding we buy a TV and TV license for the living room so she can watch it downstairs. There is a flatscreen in 21Fs bedroom that we ALL use for streaming, they both have iPads and I use my laptop, but she thinks we’re being totally unreasonable not wanting to buy another TV.

How does one approach this with her without attacking her or losing their shit? We have called house meetings numerous times in the last two months and nothing seems to be changing.

Edit: 28F is planning on staying with us then moving out when she can afford to live on her own, but hasn’t addressed the fact she will then need to pay for electric / food / heating to care for her child even when she will be earning less monthly. We are unable to continue paying for 3 people, soon there will be 4 and we are worrying that we will not be able to stay here much longer. She has yet to buy anything for her child apart from a pram and car seat.

273,"My dad (dentist, sole family income) is currently on a financial plan to pay back the IRS for some missed payroll tax payments in 2015. He's been able to make the payments on time so far, but the dental business isn't doing very well right now and things don't look good. 

My parents are about to burn through the last of their savings account to keep up with these payments. They were told that if he misses even one payment, the IRS will take everything - the business, their house, their cars. They can't afford to take out any more loans, so that's no longer an option. 

My mom, who has taken over the financial side of the business since finding out about the payroll tax mishap, is extremely depressed and suffers from regular anxiety attacks. She barely sleeps anymore and is on a mix of anti-depressants and sleeping pills at any given time to combat her extreme anxiety. My dad is also on anti-depressants but he's better at putting on a brave face and staying optimistic. I'm really worried about them financially but more so I'm worried about their mental health. Neither of them have many close friends anymore due to their stressful life and my mom refuses to go to therapy because its 'too expensive'. Yesterday she put her car on Craigslist in an act of desperation to come up with some cash. She absolutely hates this job, but she feels trapped. I'm sure my dad feels trapped too.

We were all getting along, then one day he loses his shit saying someone stole a single shot. Moved the whole bar, glasses and all his alcohol on his room, blamed all of us and our friends of being thieves (he brings people twice his age home at 4am to do coke with btw). I was annoyed by the behavior but didn't care too much because I strictly drink beer or wine.

While I was away one night, the other two roommates thought it'd be a lighthearted prank to hide his booze somewhere, and when he got home he literally SCREAMED at them.

When I got home, all of my weed was missing. Grinder was scraped clean, and my nugs were picked, and stems left, and keef (lots of it) was completely gone. Next time another roommate was gone, her weed (and other stuff was missing).

I applied to major in anthropology for WCU, and a pre medical biology track for Bloomsburg. Despite my terrible math and science background, I somehow got into BU for biology. So now I have 2 choices- a.) WCU, which is much much closer (around 45 min. from where I live), in a major which I know what I’m doing, and is close to family. Or b.) BU, which is around 2 hrs away, in a major which I’ll probably struggle with the whole time I’m in college, and much harder to lean back on family. The thing is, the more I think about it, I really want to be a doctor. I know it will be extremely difficult to catch up in math &amp; science, but I think I can do it if I work hard enough. So for that, biology at BU would be the obvious choice. What should I do? Go to the school that’s close to home and start with a more ‘realistic’ major, or take the risk and go far away in the hopes of possibly getting my dream job? 
(Also as a side note, I have extremely bad social anxiety, which makes it all the harder to go far away. College in general scares the crap out of me, but BU could be hell if I don’t get over my awkwardness and anxiety, while WCU will likely be much easier.)",16Mar2018,1

I am scared that if I do not publish these texts, I will be forced into legal issues that might only further damage my character and take time I do not have, as I have recently moved and require time to find stability.

If I were to publish these texts with all photos, names, and specifics blurred, only implying that whoever they are from is someone that would have no excuse for lying in such a way.

I hate to do this.  She had before asked me to delete messages between the two of us to exonerate herself if questioned by her partner.  However, after asking me back, I promised myself I would not do so again.

The messages go on for about 5-7 months, showing a pattern of requests for me to have an affair with her.  I realize I was wrong in being part of something so dishonest, but I am losing relationships and friendships I have built because of this person's inability to stop herself from building this image of me.

I am a 18 yo male. 

I will explain my current schedule and then ask for advice on what I should do.

I wake up at 5 am, get in the bus at 5:43am and sleep till 7 am. At work, I work out in lunch, 11:40 am till 01:00 pm.

Then I leave work at 5:36 pm, sleeps in the bus till 7 pm.

7:15pm is class, I always arrives late.

10:50 pm I leave class and go to sleep at around 11:30 pm.

I usually get 5 hours of sleep. But since I'm adjusting to student residence, I sleep 4.

I am a technician in eletronics (did on high school) and my work is actually a extension of technician. It is aeronautical projetist. The course ends in September and there is a good chance of hiring. 

College, I am coursing mechanical engineering and it lasts 6 years (I'm on the first year).

My main goal after graduating is going for Japan to get a permanent visa and to live there and build my life.

My problem right now is that I want to sleep more and be able to study Japanese and do extra curricular stuff. And since sleep is super important for a good long life, I am thinking in dropping the work. I don't really need the money, my parents could sustain my bills.
But I think the experience of working 6 years in the aeronautical field would be good for getting a job in Japan.

So, any advice on what I should do?

That's all, thank you for reading!

283,"I'm probably overacting. But during the school holidays an elderly relative came round while my parents and sister were out. Everything was fine until he asked for a kiss, I though he was joking but then he said he wanted a snog (does that mean something else to old people?) He lent in but as he went in to kiss me I turned my head to the side, so that he kissed my check. I didn't really want to kiss him on the lips as I've never had a boyfriend and want my first kiss to be special and not with a pensioner. He than asked if that was all he was getting and I said yes and then he kissed me on the check twice more. Is this normal behaviour? I really don't want to cause any trouble by telling and he's never done anything like that before.",16Mar2018,1

286,"A couple of days ago I injured myself while I was at my intership. The wound was small but there was blood and I started to faint. So everyone had to come and help me.
There is people at this other office that were trying to shut down ours and now they have the perfect excuse: it is not safe.
I feel very guilty, after the whole scandal was over my boss made clear that if I would have stayed inside our office instead of trying to get to the bathroom this matter wouldn’t have blown out.
The people who interships with me could be fired and their hard work would be for nothing. Some of them have been there for over a year.
I don’t know what to do. Even if the office stays open I would feel too ashamed to come back. ",16Mar2018,2
288,"So my grandpa is very old. He’s 88 and definitely not doing so well and has declined fast. I know death happens, and I can accept that. But just knowing that it’s coming and that I’ll get the call soon is causing me so much anxiety. How do you stay calm with that? I’ll miss him, but I know he’s lived a long life.. I’m almost more worried about how my grandma and dad are going to handle it honestly? I’m not too emotionally comfortable with my family and I know this is going to be a mess.",16Mar2018,1
290,"I’ve been working at a company for about 2 months. I hated it from the interview. I could tell it was shady but being 17 and on my own, I was willing to take anything that came to me. 

   I knew one of the managers through a friend a few years ago. Though I only met him once and didn’t even recognize him. A few days before I started the job, he found my social media profiles and was messaging me talking about him having sex with my friend and how he thought i was cute and was happy to work with me. I immediately told him it was inappropriate and he backed off and blamed it on being drunk. ( I still have the messages). 

  I brought it up to the GM and he claimed it seemed harmless and to just get the hang of everything and do my job. 

   I just forgot about it and did my job like he said. They worked me 6 days a week 6-8 hour shifts depending on what time we closed. ( 10 pm weekdays and 12 am weekends ) 
  I didn’t mind the hours- I appreciated them. Although I was upset I wasn’t able to take breaks which is illegal for a minor to work more than 5 hours without a break but I just “ did my job” and tried to keep my mouth shut. 

  One Sunday morning , another employee asked me for a threesome with him and his girlfriend. I felt disrespected and violated. I didn’t even know the guy other than some small talk every now and then. I told a coworker and she told a manager and I had to file a complaint. So I did. On Monday night, another employee made a comment about my butt when i was bent over picking up a menu off of the ground. This time I went straight to the manager working ( who happened to be my friends friend who was messaging me ) and told him what happened. He then got an attitude and was pretty much saying it was my fault I keep getting harassed and said HR would call me. 

  HR called me and I told them everything and he said they would take care of it. I went into work today and my manager told me they fired the guy who asked me for a threesome and i wouldn’t be on the same shift as the one who made a comment about my butt. Then other employees were all being rude to me and telling me it’s  sad because he’s a single dad taking care of 3 kids and I’m a horrible person etc. I ended up clocking out and telling my manager I was done. And I left. 

A part of me feels like it was childish of me to quit and I’m being irresponsible. But another part of me is saying I had every right to leave. I just don’t know how to feel about the whole situation. I have another job lined up and I start soon but I just have mixed feelings.",16Mar2018,1
291,"I had this crush on a girl it's been like 4 years it started back in like 8-freshman year of HS now I'm a senior in HS and I always think of her I heard a rumor back in freshman year that she likes me but I guess I was too scared to do anything about it. I guess I have the fear of being rejected. I haven't had any classes with her since freshman year and it sucks because I barely see her in the hallway and when I do I get nervous and I can't even say hey or even give a smile. 
I remember this one time I saw her in the hallway and everything around her and I just moved very slow 
I really like her , everyday I was think of her 
Even tho I heard that rumor that she liked me idk if it's true but if she did is there still a chance she still likes me?",16Mar2018,1
292,"So I am an 18 year old dating a 39 year old guy and we hangout about once a week and just chill or watch TV, although we don't have sex as I am a virgin but we do other stuff. So this is my first real relationship and I am not sure what real dating should be like. We've never gone out anywhere together since we started dating. We have been dating exclusively for about 2 months now, although we started dating like 4 months ago.

294,"It's a recurring theme I am seeing on reddit lately. People hating on other people because they don't want to talk, or calling people arrogant for thinking this way. Sorry if this post breaks any rules as well, I just didn't know where to post this.



I [17M] just don't get any satisfaction out of talking to people, it usually bores me. I don't have any friends and I am fine with that. I sometimes think about spending an entire day without saying a word, or going to live far in the woods/mountains of some unknown place and never interacting with another person again. If I'm being honest it comforts me, to have no extenuation. I prefer to live in my own mind, I can spend hours before I go to sleep just thinking and actually forget that I am awake with how lost I get. I don't think about anything worthwhile or anything in particular, I just feel satisfied by that feeling. I don't know, at this point I am rambling. I only go out once every week other than college, and just with some family members, I mostly do it to keep in touch, it doesn't really do anything for me and feel exhausted by it after a few hours. I'm not as cordial in college, when in college the most I will do is tell someone what we are doing if they ask, or give yes and no answers, when they talk I try my best to drown out noise as best as possible, if I can covertly cover my ears I do, they don't notice or pay any attention to me, and I like it that way. I intentionally grew my hair out long so people think I am weird and not speak to me.



I have been talking with a therapist lately and in our last session she started talking about spectrum's, and how we're all on the spectrum to some degree and things such as this, she said I was on 'a different level' to other people. I don't even know what to make of such a statement, she sugarcoats everything and I asked her if she was insinuating anything and she said no. This has mainly set me in motion of really evaluating myself and whether I may be on the spectrum. I feel like I am aware of social situations and can easily congeal and fit into social situations when I invest effort. I only have 1 more session with her before I get transferred to something different, she said she doesn't like giving out diagnoses so maybe she thinks this and doesn't want to tell me? She kept saying that I see things differently than other people too. It seemed it was mostly in response to this, our conversations have gravitated to this before, she always says something along these lines afterwards.



Basically, is this the behaviour of someone who is arrogant, I find it self-entitled that people expect others to join in on conversations with them in the posts I am seeing. I wouldn't have paid much attention to it, I just got strong vibes that my therapist was saying I may have some form of Asperger's or ASD. I understand that this all sounds like an 'edgy teen' kind of deal, but I don't tell anyone about these kinds of things, most people like family think I am a normal teen, and I didn't pay much attention to this myself until a few days ago. There are worst things in my life I usually think about.",16Mar2018,11
295,"So my life is preety shit at the moment. I'm just living on autopilot. 

I have a job, but it's the most boring work imaginable. I have A-levels, but not the greatest grades. I'm 22 and my life is just flying by. I'm depressed and have no friend in real life. I also have social anxiety and poor social skills. I'm too afraid to do most things like learn to drive, go to uni, or go on a holiday on my own or do anything on my own. 

If anyone has any advice, it would be most appreciated. ",16Mar2018,2
297,"Hi everyone,
So basically my mum (I am 17) thinks that I need to share everything with her - except for sexual/inappropriate stuff. She gets really upset and angry when I don't share something with her. I think what she fails to realize is that teenagers keep things from their parents. 
What caused this is I pretended to be sick yesterday so I didn't have to go to school and she is really angry by the fact that I didn't tell her that I wasn't really sick. I know I should have gone to school, but no teenager just says to their parents ""Oh hey mum I wasn't really sick I just didn't want to go to school today"". I don't know how to get the message across to her.
Thanks",16Mar2018,2

299,"Hi Reddit,

I've been conflicted about whether or not I should quit my job and focus my attention on starting my business. For most people, I can completely understand why this is not the smartest decision, but I've got different circumstances.

I'll start with my job.

I'm very indifferent about what I do. I took a part time job while I was studying and, when I graduated, they asked me to stay on. I never had any intention to be in this field and, while I'm good at what I do, I really don't see the point. On top of that, I'm under-paid and, because I work in the public sector, it's not as easy as asking for a pay rise. They'd have to revamp my position to justify an increased pay. 

My department is under-resourced and our team (myself included) is having a lot of difficulties keeping on top of our duties. My coworkers regularly stay after hours to get work done. There is just so much work to be done and many of my days are filled with pointless meetings that I simply do not have time during office hours to work on simple tasks like emails. As a result, I'm stressed out and I've had a migraine/headache every day for the past two weeks (side not: I get migraines quite easily and one of the triggers is stress and exhaustion). This April, I'm meant to be doing the work of 3 people because someone is going on holiday for a month and the other will be gone for the next 3 months. My boss thought I could handle it, so she agreed when the other managers asked her if I could step in. 

Financially, I'm lucky enough that I can quit my job and focus on starting my business for the next year without having to change my husband and my lifestyle at all. He will be the sole breadwinner, but I'll also have income coming in to support us on top of whatever I might make through my business. We won't have to touch our savings to pay our bills and living expenses.

Basically, what I want to do with my year is to focus on my business, study part time (language, its something I've always wanted to do) and focus on my fitness (which I can do now anyway). If I do this, I will give myself a deadline of 1 year. My husband, while supportive, feels like its not the best idea because I shouldn't jump in head first without knowing whether or not my business will succeed. He says its harder to fail and get a new job than it is to stick out and quit when I am able to make some money. I'm conflicted because I understand his point of view, but at the same time, it wont change anything for us. If I fail after a year, I'm going to look into a different career path than the one I'm currently on.

I wanted to get some advice from an outside party. 

**tldr**; I want to quit my job and start a business while studying language part time. This will not affect our finances at all. Thoughts?",16Mar2018,3
300,"*They’ve been together a little over a year* 

So my boyfriend saw this sooner and tried to talk to him a few months ago (they are best friends) but his friend didn’t see it/still doesn’t. 

Examples: 
1. She won’t let him play video games for an extended period of time. My boyfriend and him play Monster Hunter. Just a few minutes ago he had to leave because she set a timer for him. 
   *theory: if she isn’t getting 100% of his attention she’s mad* 

2. She calls him stupid, idiot and hits him (on the shoulder). It’s not playful either. The other night she wasn’t explaining things clearly and he wasn’t understanding it and she was like ‘stop being an idiot.’ 

3. She gave back a fucking dog. This is what pisses our friend group off the most (there’s 6 in total including the girlfriend and friend). She was going to re-home an older dog (as we’ve deemed it ‘for instagram’) and after not even a full 24 hours gave it back because ‘he wouldn’t sleep’ and ‘barked occasionally’. Two days later she spent $500 on a 4 month old puppy who cannot be left alone in the apartment. 

Also, the other night we were playing DnD and she got mad that she had to be the ‘bad guy’ to the dog. *side note: he is such a sweetheart and doesn’t have a mean bone in him*. Also, she gave her dog a bunch of treats before we started then got mad at him for giving her a treat a few hours later. 

She also was upset she had to take her dog outside. *ITS HER DOG* 

Any advice? 4 of us are seeing this and want what’s best for him seeing as he’s been a friend the longest.

301,"What the title says, I feel empty sometimes. I do normal things, eat well, exercise, socialize a few times a week, have a hobby, have family. Pretty much everything is good for me, the only real thing I'm lacking is a relationship, and maybe some friends. But I still feel like I am missing something and I don't know what it is. 

I'm 19, currently in community college and plannning to transfer once I'm done with my credits I need. I worked for a while, quit, found another job for a little then quit and started applying to jobs recently and have some interviews coming up. I have a hobby(jiujitsu) that I really enjoy doing and hope to do for as long as I can, and that's about most of what I do.
