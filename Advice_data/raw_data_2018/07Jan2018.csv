1,I got married two years ago. My son just turned one. He’s a beautiful little boy. My husband is deployed overseas and I live with his family in the Middle East. For the first year and a half since we married I have regretted every day. I live with his family and used to be very soft and sensitive. No matter what I couldn’t get over being nice and wanting them to like me. I would endure kangaroo courts. Yelling. Ignoring. And it got worse as my son came. One night his sister who is very difficult woke my sleeping son up saying he’s hungry. I was just after a c section and very distressed. Lonely and I hung around for an hour. She said she had dreams of breast feeding him and would often pretend to be his mother and tell me she was his mother. So weird. My husband said if they ever step out of line tell him. I did he turned in me. If we go away for. Weekend he willget a hotel with an adjoining. Room and ignore me. I’m not an attention seeker but I noticed there is no intimacy with us but he is very affectionate with his sister mother and  nieces. The other day my younger niece said you have to help uncle with his ankle it’s for wives only. And I come I. And my my 12 year old niece is massaging his ankle. This isn’t new. He asks them for massages all the time but she is too old for that I didn’t grow up with that. His sister doesn’t mind right now he is back for 2 weeks and he will spend the entire night in the room with them while I’m with my son. I feel very neglected. He doesn’t ever want sex. He doesn’t ever instigate affection says he’s not built this way yet tickles and play fights with his wife and her girls an dmother. So if he is capable why can’t he with me? I have spoken to him but he says I’m demanding.  He is very affectionate with my son but doesn’t remember things like toys birthday card anything really. He doesn’t sent me any money. Says I live I. His house for free. I feel like a lodger not a wife. He speaks about us and me as if I’m some woman from the street who has outstayed my welcome. AlwYs saying how I let myself go but if I take care of myself he will interrupt me. I don’t have themeans to leave him right now. Going back to my home country is very expensive. I wouldn’t have the family support but I feel like is this normal. You’re home for weeks but spend every waking hour with your sister and mother and nieces. His sisters marriage broke up due to her attachment to her brother and mother. He would step in and pay for holidays and school fees. I’m at my wits end really. I think why am I here. He says im so demanding. But I want us to have a life together. Like he promised. He went mad when I asked to go to the shop today. I’ve tried everything but it’s past 2 am and he is with his sister and mother and nieces and I’m alone here in the room. He wouldn’t care if I was alive or dead as long as I’m in the house. I have read every self help book going. Been to Counsellinh spoken to friends. But I can’t solve his absence in my life. His neglect. The lack of sex. The lack of affection and his smothering attention to his family. I feel like an outsider and I’ve said it many times. He alwaycounters with divorce threats. Any help ,07Jan2018,2
2,"I’ll try to keep this short. 

I spent 2 years in test engineering, but I have a CSC degree and I know how to code. I lost a bunch of that ability in meaningless testing because at first, I didn’t think I was good enough to be a developer somehow. 

I changed my mind. QA is way too boring and not my thing. But - I don’t know how to approach Development. I’ve never really made anything, and I’m not sure how to approach it. I have nobody to ask to help, so I’m here on reddit asking you fine people. 

I did the Google onsite interview and passed that, but couldn’t take a job in CA due to personal reasons. 

Any suggestions people? I plan on applying to FAANG again but wanna know what it’s like in the day in the life of a dev. ",07Jan2018,2
4,"I’m 25 male with a BS in Business. I have a job that pays me about $23-25K after taxes. It is a “professional” type job but there is no prospect for advancement, raise or anything like that. I need more income, I have loan debt and bills to pay. 

I am considering applying for jobs that only require HS diplomas so I can have a second job. I have had second jobs before that didn’t require a degree but I am not interested in working in those fields/companies anymore. 

I’d prefer to find something where I can just do hands on work and/or not a front facing customer service position. 

I think stock/merchandise clerk or if I could get something in a call center would be great. Really anything where I can actually get hired and not have to have years of experience works for me. 

My question is does anyone have experience with applying to jobs that they are considered overqualified for? Any tips? 

Any ideas for jobs I can get that aren’t to difficult to qualify for and don’t require much personality?

Looking for $12-15 an hour, but of course more the better. 


Thanks,

5,"About 3 years ago my mom suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and it completely wrecked her. She suffers mood swings and serious fatigue. She’s been lamenting the lack of a partner to help my brother and me (she’s a single mother). I do what I can, but sometimes it’s just too much to take care of us for her. As she frequently says, “I’m only half a person taking care of 2 boys!” There’s no way in hell we could afford a caretaker, and the only other option is to live with my father, who lives in Japan (I know no Japanese). Is there any other way that we can get some support? I feel so hopeless right now.",07Jan2018,2
6,"When I moved into my apartment my landlord warned me that my neighbor is A Mess and that because she's on a month-to-month, he's not sure how long he's going to keep her around for. I thought this was weird but I found out what he meant pretty shortly after I settled in. She is a drunk, and she screams at people on the phone with her door open, and as we share a main wall, I hear her drunken rants all too often.

The first time I heard her drunkenly singing on the porch I asked if she was ok and she begged me not to tell the landlord. She kept it down for a little while after that, but her ranting picked up again and it's just getting obnoxious. I really don't want to be the reason someone loses their home, especially if she's in need of help. Should I just keep my headset on as much as possible and try to ignore it, or should I approach it with my landlord? I'm afraid that my complaint will be the tipping point and I would feel terrible if I made her lose her home. (Plus I don't know if she would retaliate and as I live alone that idea also horrifies me.)

Any input would be appreciated!",07Jan2018,2

9,"It’s been 4 months now - I have had a great time going out lots, seeing friends, seeing a couple different girls, having sex but I think I’m done with it all?

So one of the girls has been a casual hook up for 3 months. Meet up, go out, have fantastic sex but there is no spark. Therefore, I can’t keep doing it because I do not want to lead her on and there is clearly no seriousness ahead of us.

The second girl, well I quite like her but it’s not the right time, she has some major flaws which I could not deal with. We have had sex, good times but I know she does not want anything serious.

So now, after having a great 4 months of the ‘single life’ I need to cut back on the going out, drinking and meaningless sex. Focus on myself and work. Especially work because it has suffered the last few months. 

The problem is that I feel like shit now. Mostly when I’m not busy. Basically when I get home from work or on the weekends, when I have no plans. I’m kind of just sat around waiting to go to bed so I can go to work. Or for the weekend to finish, so I can get back to work.

I love work. And the people there but I am not enjoying my time outside of it. 

I could meet up with these girls again but I have decided that is just going to prolog this feeling and lifestyle. I could try meet someone new but it will do the same.

Maybe I should focus on me for a while?

I’m pretty down about it all.

Not sure what I’m getting at here. Just that I need to get it off my chest.

I kind of have no motivation once I’m not at work. I try to get into something, a hobby or what ever - but I just can’t get motivated to do it.

Any suggestions, from experience?",07Jan2018,4
10,I have never met my father. I am 17 years old. Long story short I found him on Facebook and wanna reach out to him. I just want closure. I've talked to my mother and grandmother about it and they are both against it. My mom said I could do it when I turn 18 and leave the house but I wanna reach out now.

12,"On friday my sister went outside at 4 am then called me to open the door for her because she got locked out by my brother not knowing she was out there so I went back to bed very tired and slept through my alarm and ending up waking up at 12pm so there was only an hour of school left no real point in going so I ended up staying home and this made my brother mad (P.s he was also sick and hungover from the night before) so he bangs on my door and yells at me to clean the kitchen so I start doing this and I was super pissed called my mom and she told me she wanted to talk to him so I went and knocked on the bathroom door where he was and told him our mom wants to talk to him when I told him this he yelled ""mrman1125 your such a fucking pussy"" and I yelled back ""fuck you"" then my mom called him later and they talked.

Now here is the problem we haven't been talking since friday after that last incident what should I do should I wait for him to apologize or talk to him.

13,"So this is probably a pretty generic problem but its a huge life decision for me.

I have just had my first semester of my first year studying Computer science in an average university in the UK.

I do have interest in programming, but I know it's not a field I want to stay in and in all honesty if it was an option in my head it is not one that I even want to enter. To be totally honest with you the only reason im staying on is because I don't know what else to do. I would drop out because I don't have a passion for my subject, but if I drop out I've got no foundation for anything else. I've got no backup plan, and I would have no direction in life.

My life long dream has been to be in the police force, but here you require a degree to be accepted and you need 'life experience', something that i, a 19 year old that has lived at home and only had 1 job my whole life, do not have yet.

So the reason I don't want to drop out is because if I do, I would likely just be sitting around for 9 months finding another uni/course to apply for and then still not really have a passion for the subject and push through a 4 year course for no reason other than it's something I have to do.

I struggle. I really struggle to stay happy at university sometimes. At least 2 times a week I stay in my room and feel sorry for myself, watching as many inspirational videos as I can, trying to convince myself I'm making the right choice. To be honest I could do it. I could stick through these next 3.5 years but I don't know if it's the right choice.

I would feel scared to move on in life right now without a degree. I know I'll probably get negative replies for saying that, but if I dont, how would I get in the police force?

Do I just have to make the best of a bad situation and stick it out for now, so that I can achieve happiness later? Or do I stop now before I dig a hole of confusion even deeper?

I've been sitting on this post for the past 2 months, I've never been able to write the whole thing or post it without feeling like I'm making a mistake, like I need to push these feelings away and get on with my degree. I tell myself that after my degree, I can do what I want. For now I need to focus on it.

Thanks for any advice. Please don't be afraid to be brutally honest with me.",07Jan2018,2
14,"READ THIS BEFORE COMMENTING

So recently, I was thinking of changing schools. In my current school, all of my friends have moved away, with the last one moving away next year. 

The one I'm most likely to attend is my step-brother's school. He is one year younger than me, but we still get along pretty well. I also know his friends and always play Overwatch, with one of his friends being my girlfriend.

All of this is fine, but I'm afraid that this might effect me academically. My grades have been very low for the past few months, and I've also gone to a different country the prior year before returning back.

The exam was said to be easy, and my step-brother has told me I could even get a scholarship. When I also revealed this piece of news to him, his friends, and my girlfriend (which is really pestering me at this point to come) they were all so happy! I have not told this idea to my mother yet, but when I asked about the school, she said it might come off too hard. I don't think that is going to stop me though.

Anyway, what do you think? Responds will be appreciated and thank you all in advance!",07Jan2018,4

17,"Hi Reddit, 

I was in the middle of getting a tattoo when my mom calls me and tells me she found my 2 year old dog dead on the freeway. 

I was two hours away and had to drive home completely heart broken. 

I handled it and got home. They would not let me see her and I can no longer take the usual route home because they do not want me to see her blood. 

Hopefully it washes away with the rain soon. 

Anyways, onto the advice...

My best friend was also there, she was helping my mom when I couldn't and my friends dogs were my dogs best friends. 

I went over to her house today and she offered to take me to a shelter. 

I agreed and we went. 

I found an emaciated little boy that looked like he could be my dogs brother. 

Him and my dog have the same personality and he was so comfortable around me. I immediately broke down. 

I was so conflicted. I in no way want to ""replace"" my little girl, but I do want a dog. 

The dog ended up accidentally biting me when he was getting a better grip in a game of tug of war, I wasnt meaning to report anything i just needed a bandage because he hit right at the cuticle and those bleed. And with that the shelter made me report it making him unavailable for ten days.

So I have ten days to think about it. 

I guess what im asking is: am I a horrible person?  Would this be okay? I don't want to replace my little girl, but this boy needs love and he was just so comfortable with me. 

I'm so broken reddit.

18,"I'm 24, and I have many photos and videos of two of my friends' girlfriends (let’s call them Jess and Ally) that I've secretly saved and taken over the past 4 years. Not any hidden camera stuff (hell no). But the media I’ve saved are from shared photos and videos from events or parties we’ve all been to, and some are from places like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat (secretly taken). All this media is on a saved flash drive.

We all met through a dance event and were good friends at the event, and I’ve been soooo incredibly attracted to them. Ally is an asian hip hop dancer who recently turned into an import model, with amazing legs, and a gorgeous face. Jess is also really pretty latina with really nice boobs. I have a girlfriend of my own who I find attractive as well, but I tend to constantly try to save any media Jess and Ally share and store it secretly. Like almost all the time. And I masturbate to their pictures/videos a lot. Sometimes I spend a couple of min to a full hour finding their new stuff to save, and masturbating too. And I also sometimes Photoshop and edit their face onto nude bodies from the internet just so I can imagine them nude. 

They don’t know that I do any of this, but one time when I used Snapchat to screen record my other friends Snap with Jess doing something really hot, Snapchat had notified them, even though I had previously use methods to screen capture what she was doing by other means and it didn’t notify anyone before (this was before an aforementioned update).

Am I weird? Or creepy? Is this bad? How can I stop? Should I stop?

We've both agreed that there are strong feelings between us both but because of who I am (her ex's brother) she can't see us working. Now I agree to an extent, she's terrified of birthgiver aka my mother.

tl;dr I have fun going out but thinking about it makes me exhausted. Should I seek help?

Longer version: I like going out with friends and usually i enjoy it. However, for example: if we plan to go out on a friday, but it's monday, for the entire week I'll be thinking about it and making me feel exhausted, sometimes I make excuses just so I can stay home and stopping this feeling. Sometimes I just accept it, try not to think about it (and it wouldn't be fair with my friends, family or gf) and just go.

But shit, every single time, i fucking hate this feeling. At this moment I know I will enjoy it, but I can't stop feeling exhausted of just thinking about going out.

26,"Summary: started seeing a guy i went to school with (from elementary on) romantically for a few weeks (both 26). Everything is going amazing and then he suddenly acts super weird and rude/distant and breaks things off. I think his reasoning was disingenuous because of how ridiculous it was but he claims to have not wanted to date me because one of the nights we hung out a week earlier (we hung out every single day) I asked if we could do something else besides watching movie marathons which we’d been watching constantly. He says it made him feel like he wasn’t good enough and couldn’t entertain me and he didn’t like feeling like shit. Fair enough, but a) I asked a valid question and I didn’t ask in a mean way and b) he has always told me practically constantly how amazing and happy and kind I am so that didn’t exactly add up to me especially since I reciprocated. I was upset because I felt we really connected naturally and if I would’ve known he was going to flake out I wouldn’t have risked the possibility of a lifelong friendship for a fling. 

Anyway, since then he has been stalking my Instagram stories (all I have is Instagram). He watches all of them and pretty quickly after I post them. I don’t understand why. I guess I hope he is thinking he made a mistake and will approach me but I also know that he could be seeing them just by chance and i may be reading too far into it. I’m not a crazy person just confused by his behavior :). Basically tonight he posted a story himself and it had another girl in it. Idk how they know each other but either way it really bothered me and I don’t want to feel that way. 

Should I block him on Instagram or is that petty? My stance right now is that he really hurt me and it is not awesome for me to keep seeing his name pop up all over as I am super active on Instagram. BUT I don’t want to be out of sight and out of mind for him if there’s a chance he is thinking he made a mistake. I know I sound like an idiot but if I block him do you think he will even notice I am not on Instagram anymore, or do you think I should keep him unblocked? I feel like with how things were left off I would not be comfortable reaching out to him like an adult via phone call.

30,"This is my first post, and it has to do with social media ""etiquette"" and my best friend. Ex best friend? Yeah. Or something. AM I IN THE WRONG? AM I JUST FUGGIN BITTER? I'm tired of telling my friends this story and trying to get something meaningful out of them. Sorry, long post - scroll down for TLDR.

So for awhile after I hit 18 y/o, I became a social recluse and went through a really odd awkward phase that I'd never experienced before. It felt like I'd found it hard to come up with any sort of stimulating conversation or keep one going due to my anxieties and this brain fog that overcame me. I was also smoking a lot of weed at the time. Anyways, me and this girl (20 at the time) met through a mutual following on twitter - we knew some of the same people from high school and eventually we added each other on snapchat and hung out shortly after. 

The first time we hung out was super weird, and it sort of set the basis for the rest of our relationship - at least on MY part. It felt like a Tinder date that just wasn't meant to be, yet she was persistent about me hanging out (she still doesn't have a drivers license to this day) and considering I had no other friends beside my bf at the time who lived in the same town, I was cool with it. Like...better than nothing type of deal. I sort of figured I'd get over this odd, disconnected, uncomfortable feeling. 

Fast forward our whole relationship - uncomfortable-ness never went away, I'd drive 30 minutes out to see her about twice to three times a week. She would copy everything I would do - dresswear, music choice, dialogue, interests, seriously - anything. I f**king hate that kind of person. I attract them. So gradually, after about a year and a half, I was really growing disinterested in her. At the time, my car started having problems too, so I told her that coming out to see her wouldn't be easy anymore and I couldn't afford the extra mileage because I couldn't get it fixed. While I cared for her, my priorities were real. I was growing out of the drugs, weed, and pastimes that we would do. I had a better, more serious job and -bad timing, I got into a really serious relationship with a guy who was a customer at my job. He became my new best friend and I adopted his social circle as well. I never drove with him. Considering Rebecca was sort of a relationship crutch in the first place (as awful as it sounds...but I did care for her, but she was also an askhole and wrapped up in herself so being a friend was hard in the first place.) I didn't drive up to her for three months. In that time, she quickly started seeking attention from the girls she used to complain to me about. She would straight up diss on these girls, one in particular, she said, ""So-and-so is trying so hard to be my best friend and it's soo annoying."" They ARE best friends now and Rebecca's becoming little replicas of these girls now, too, the same way she did with me. 

Anyways, I got really annoyed with how she just tries hard to be something she's not - and the constant selfies and self obsession on social media. (If you start every one of your 3,000 tweets with 'my' and 'I' I'm gonna get tired of it. Personally.) I hated the obsession in general with social media. Like she felt she needed to appease to her followers every thirty minutes of the day. There was tons of attention-seeking posts. Everything she did was to be posted on snapchat, Instagram, or twitter. I unfollowed her, really on everything. I just couldn't stand to see her wear this personality on social media that would be completely different had she never met me or specifically this one other girl she's currently obsessed with. So she unfollowed me back, never said anything. It wasn't necessary, I didn't care for it, but I thought that she might text me about it. ""Hey, what's up?"" Anything at all - but no. Total silence. A friend even sent me a tweet where she called me a fake friend. I took this girl to California and let her stay in my Grandma's house, like...at one point we were really good friends. 

We haven't talked since then. It feels like I wasted two years of my life and now I can't stop thinking about if I'm just the biggest bitch ever or if my ex-friend is just immature. Where did I go wrong, seriously? I'd love some answers to put my mind at ease. 

TLDR; Had a best friend of two years where our relationship revolved around showing it off the social media, and when I grew out of it and got tired of her attention-seeking, self obsessed posts - I unfollowed her just to stop seeing it. Never ended our friendship, didn't really intend to - but she unfollowed me and called me a fake friend. Thus, ending our friendship. No contact followed and now I think about it because I can't tell if I'm the bitch or if she's insecure.",07Jan2018,2

33,"   I [26 F] work in an assisted living home and my primary job is to serve residents food. The company has a dining room set up like a restaurant, and we basically pretend we are real servers in a real restaurant (more or less). They choose between 2 daily specials or 3 other plates we always have. I have some sort of condition, autism spectrum disorder I guess, which makes me extremely awkward to be around. I have poor short-term memory which is slowly improving because of my employment here, and that's good. But I'm still the slowest server here because I have the hardest time making the residents comfortable, so they freeze up and get confused when I try to take their orders. Sometimes they just stare at me blankly, even if I speak loudly and enunciate everything. Most of them have at least some memory loss, which is probably the only reason I still have the job (most of them forget how weird I am until the next day and/or have lived too long to give a damn). 
   I went into this job because I couldn't get another job like my old one. I used to be a cook in a skeleton crew of two (occasionally 3) people. Very little social interaction was required so I didn't learn those communication skills, and now I'm realizing I need to fix that.  
   I feel a high level of stress about these very short interactions with these people. I see them every day but can't figure out how to act natural with them, therefore building rapport, therefore becoming better at my job and better at maintaining human relationships. When I speak to these people, I have absolutely no idea how to look and sound welcoming/friendly/familiar. I just feel like this scary wooden doll person. It's been 4 months and it has only gotten slightly better. 
   Basically, can anyone give me some advice or point me towards some resources on building interpersonal skills manually as an adult? These are things I did not learn when I was young, because I avoided doing so. As an adult having finally decided I can't actually live like this forever, how do I learn these skills? Does it just come with practice, or is there any way I can expedite the process?

40,"Yeah so... I was in what could be described as a fairly serious/serious vehicular accident on Tuesday of this week (1/2/2018) while on the job.  I work for a small business as a driver; delivering sanitary products (toilet paper, floor cleaning products, etc...).

On this particular day, I was in the sprinter van, and I was driving under an overpass to a yield sign - the merge point of which was from left to right.  Checked my mirrors, only one car was coming, waiting until they passed me and merged into the single lane.  For about an 1/8 of a mile I'd say it's just my lane until the barricade between the road started; on the opposite side it was two lanes.  From where I was positioned at the time, the barricade turned into a median in the road.  Being that I'm in Pittsburgh and as the saying goes... ""Pittsburgh drivers, right?,"" in addition to, the weather conditions, I hovered below/just about the speed limit because I traveled the road I was on before - I knew that given the conditions it was not safe and therefore, I should travel with the utmost attention to detail.  

Then it happened.  In a split second the driver on the opposing side of the road (to my left), was not there, then they were.  I would describe it as near head on.  His vehicle crashed into mine.  Again, a split second later, the airbag detonated.  At this point I don't know whether I blacked out for a few seconds, or just lost control of my sight, but when I was able to see - I looked ahead, and looked to my right.  Everything in my cab was shifted forward; somehow my glasses were not broken, no facial injuries.  I picked up my phone which fell on the floor, and slowly opened the door and touched foot to the ground outside.  At first I could see vehicles starting to arrive, but my prime focus was on the vehicle that hit me.  The first thing I noticed about this car was that both the front and back end were totaled.  I assume the front end because it hit me, and the back end because it may have/must have spiraled into the barricade before the median, and the first thought I had was, ""I hope this person isn't dead.""  I ran over, with this thought in my mind.  At first, when I approached the vehicle, I did not see a body; however, I also did not see any broken glass from the front windshield nor the back.  I opened the driver's side door - still not seeing a body, assuming because my vision was still a bit out there.  Then I saw the outline of the seat belt, which I followed, then there he was.  Pinned up against the passenger side window.  Blood was present from his nose, his facial expression in a shock.  I unbuckled his seat belt because from my opinion, it appeared as though it was restraining his legs against the seat, therefore, cutting off the blood supply to his legs.  He tried to move, maybe out of confusion or whatever, but I spoke to him in a firm tone to not move, that I am getting help - that I'm calling for help right now.  

I stuck my head out of the vehicle, a row of cars now stopped behind us.  Wreckage behind me from my vehicle and his.  I ran over to the first person I could find, yelling for assistance.  Thankfully the person second who rushed in was/is an off duty officer, so he was able to speak with the dispatcher and pinpoint an exact location of this incident.  Thankfully, again, there were two patrol cars behind us before this incident happen - I'd say a delay time of maybe 5-8 minutes, so they were the first on the scene.

Much of my memory about this event is still grey; I provided my statement to the officer who requested it.  Called my employer and being that I had a slight tension in the right side of my neck, I was transported to the hospital for evaluation.  I don't know what happened to the other driver besides being taken away in a bus - what their current status is, I mean.

Basically, this is my first *serious* auto accident, and I guess my mind is oscillating between ""why/how did this happen?""  and to, why did I survive in the condition that I did, whereas the other driver did not?  My intent on posting this is to one, ask for help in the realm of others who have also been in serious or near-fatal accidents, and see what they have done in order to overcome it and two, just for someone to listen to what I have to say on the matter.  Everyone at work is still concerned about my well-being, and a few friends of mine know about it, and are worried about my physical/mental health, but it's beneficial - in my opinion, to seek counsel from those who have been through it.  What they have done.  What they may still do to understand, and move forward from it.

Secondly, I see a chiropractor for my lower lumbar for an unrelated genetic deficiency, in case anyone mentions the medical/physical aspect.  He's keeping a close eye on my case so I can receive the best treatment possible given the circumstances.  I was cleared by two physicians at the hospital I went to - no severe fractures present - no need for CT/X-Rays scans.  

So yeah... I can try and provide more detail if necessary, but otherwise this is my story.  Anyone who is reading this, please be safe out there due to the weather conditions regardless of where in the U.S. you live.  Please, please, use your turn signals, and proceed with caution, again, given the conditions of the weather.  

Thank you for reading and I appreciate any advice on pertaining to this matter.",07Jan2018,1

Now that doesn't sound that bad until you look at what lies around the corner. I live in a lower middle class family and noticed this Christmas that if I don't invest in my future I am totally screwed.

I've only driven with my permit once. 4. Save up for a car. Need a way to get to my dream college. 5. Make money for college.

48,"I've been getting a little sick of all the nonsense I've been hearing about social justice and all that, just wanted a break from it. I watch a lot of Netflix shows and from Ozarks to Dirk Gently S2 they seem to be putting a lot of homosexual scenes in it.

I voiced discomfort at watching the sex scenes (not just because it's two guys, I just don't like to watch men having sex with each other) and used Dirk Gently as an example of the rise in how common it is for Netflix to add this to their shows although Dirk Gently is very PG and doesn't have the aforementioned scenes.

I stated that I don't mind what people do regarding orientation and just don't like watching all the scenes especially in Ozarks. I don't like watching unattractive women having sex either.

But then an entire god damn forum jumps down my throat calling me a homophobe and they're notoriously unreasonable people so I just wanted to check if I'm in the minority or not when considering myself someone who accepts and supports doing-whoever-you-want (I just don't want to have to watch it all the time).

Now I'm really, really sick of the whole social justice thing. I think a lot of people are. I think the people labelling everyone a homophobe or sexist are the ones who hurt the rights of people involved and everything related to it because people get sick of it. But now I'm just ranting.

52,"Hello. So I (19 y/o female) recently graduated high school after five years. The extra year was because of mental health issues. I was hospitalized for sixth months in the middle of my freshman year and even though I did all my work in the hospital, I went to a vocational school and ended up failing because I couldn't be at school where I could do the vocational part. Anyways, I'm turning 20 in less than a month and I feel absolutely lost, stuck and directionless. I got into a university but I couldn't afford to go, I didn't get much financial aid because of my parents, but that definitely sucks because I don't even live with them. I was kicked out at the end of high school because I couldn't hold a job. I got addicted to self harm (I am diagnosed bipolar and have ptsd) at a young age, I'm only 4 months clean but I think I'm done for good with it. Between my self harm (my arms are scared pretty bad) and anxiety, I had a hard time staying at my jobs. They were shitty jobs and didn't mean much to me, a fast food place, a bookstore that was hardly ever busy and kind of a dumb, a disgustingly shitty bar that was marketed as a family restaurant but was a just a local watering hole for the shittiest people I've ever met. I moved to a new state with my sister and I live in the south now. Minimum wage is a joke at $7.25 and I just got a job here at a coffee shop. I know it's better than nothing and It at least shows her and my family I'm doing something, but I dread going to work every day and I hardly make enough to support myself. I'm going to go to school starting in the fall (still, months away) at a community college near my sister's house and I'm pretty excited, and scared. But just the act of going to school, even if I'm starting while I'll be almost 21, just makes me feel like less of a shitty person.

So, let me get to the point. Part of my problem is that I'm not entirely sure what I want to do with my life. Ever since I was a kid I had a plan set in stone, and I carried it with me throughout my whole life up until this point. I was going to be an English teacher. However, now I can't stand the thought of becoming one. I know it's about passion, and not about the money but they don't make the best and there are a lot of things I don't agree with about our education system. I wanted to work at a publishing company instead, but I feel like for some reason that won't ever work out. Clearly, my passions lay in writing and in English language arts but I just don't know what I wanna do and am always scared nothing will work out. If I could do anything, I would go to film school and try to find a job in the film industry. Even if it was a shitty job, just being in the industry and working around my passion with a salary I could live off of would make me happy. Basically, all I'm trying to say is, how can I move forward? What steps should I take? Do you have any ideas for some better jobs I could try and find for now that might help? My sister said I should apply for SSI just for some extra help but I don't even know where to start with that. I know I probably have to carry on and push through some, however many days, of making coffee and being treated like shit from an unprofessional manager for shitty pay with no tips and hold my own until I figure something out, but any advice on where to start? Maybe I'm just looking for some comforting advice, cause a part of me feels like I'm not alone but another part of me feels like I'm just a whiny millennial who needs to suck it up, yanno?",07Jan2018,3

I'm always on the computer with friends as we don't really go out too much. The area we live in is filled with a lot drugs, bad people, etc etc. Just not a generally nice place to go out. We do go out sometimes but it's not too often, along with all the shit here there's basically nothing to do.

I do have plenty of friends and I talk to most of them daily be it calling or texting and throughout the majority of the hours I spend gaming it is spent with friends.

I imagine if someone saw my daily routine they would think I'm depressed or a recluse but I'm honestly an extremely happy person that doesn't really know what else to do.

Ask questions if needed for more knowledge on the subject for a better response, I guess this is kind of vague! Just trying to say that where I live is boring, I could either be doing drugs or doing what I do now. Ofcourse there is an inbetween somewhere though.

64,"Tldr before the story; (22F, 2F)Went to college for one whole year, dropped out in October due to father being very ill and I had a cancer scare, find out I owe $990 until I can return to school. What to do?

So in 2016, I had gone through a lot of emotional stress and physical abuse from my daughter's father. I decided to get a restraining order, and set up court for custody and child support. Fast forward to that fall in 2016, I had enrolled in college to try and recover from being entrapped in a physically abusive relationship and was really enjoying my experience being free and learning. My mother was able to watch my daughter while I went to learn. I had obtained a 3.8gpa, and was doing well.  

Back in October (2017) I had learned that I had abnormal lumps in my breasts. I had gotten them examined by ultrasound since I was too young to receive a mammogram. He had told me to just watch them for now and see if they get any bigger but said they were from possible bleeding under the skin?(sorry if tmi) I have to go back to another appointment in February to see if any change has occured. Shortly after experiencing this, my father had gotten gravely ill and I was requested by my mother to stay home and help take care of him.

 I dropped out in October(2017), and had no choice. I am looking to try and get my Pell Grant back to further my education for my daughter and I, but cannot even enroll until I pay back $990.

What can I do? I have tried applying for jobs, calling the stores and asking managers if they currently have openings, walking in in person and asking for an interview if they have time and noone seems to be ""hiring"" because my hours are literally from 6am-6pm(due to my daughters child care provider). I have even put open availability even though I truly am not open just to get a foot in the door. 

(My parents refuse to help me financially even though it is for furthering my education. They believe the school should pay for it since I am low income(aka no income right now, because my daughter's father refuses to pay child support... And I don't have a job.), but I tried explaining to them that I owe them that money since I had to drop out to take care of him, and it's for repayment of what the school gave me. )

Are there online alternatives to making money? Could I work from home or are there any opportunities you guys know about I could take advantage of? I would really appreciate any advice, thank you!

I thought nothing of it and then next month they send another bill... This cycle continues through December 2017 and the bill is now up to 289$. I just recieved a letter today that my account has been turned over to a collection agency. Should I pay the debt or what? I haven't had/ or used Frontier since I called in July to cancel.,07Jan2018,1

So I had a borderline personal conversation with the boss yesterday - something I've never done before (it takes a while for me to open up to someone). I asked about things I can improve on and that's where it took an awkward turn for me at least. I felt a bit uncomfortable hearing what was said but it was nothing new to me. ""Speak out more/ask more questions to contribute etc.."" Now I'm worried that things will get awkward after this conversation the next time I see the boss. Am I overthinking this? Or this just another part of a boss' job to deal with people like this? I act normal around my coworkers but I get nervous around bosses.

On top of all this, I've got a job interview coming up. There is a presentation component to it - something I've never done in a work setting either. What are some good tips for giving a good presentation during interviews?

73,"So I recently just got promoted to a manager at my family’s restaurant. I’ve always had a bit of a crush on one of the employees though, but I’ve always thought there’s just too many reasons not to ask her out for a cup of coffee or something. 
1.  Employee/supervisor relationships are generally frowned upon these days
2. My dad is the owner 
3. It could make things weird at the workplace if she were to say no
4. Her older sister is one of the people training me
However her and I are of the same (23 if that matters), and there’s always a chance it might all work out. Am I being reasonable in my doubt, or am I just overthinking things? Should I just say screw it and take a shot?

86,"So this has been an ongoing thing since Trump was elected. But lately it's stressed out my mom so much that she's been seeing a cardiologist due to her high blood pressure. She claims I am stressing her out so much that it will kill her or my dad. Note my dad had a mild heart attack 15 years ago (one of the reason they blame it on is that my older sister came out to them) but survived. 

First of all, they don't even support Trump. But they are pretty conservative. This all came to a head when I ""liked"" a public post by NBC talking about the legalization of marijuana. Therefore my mom saw that in her news feed that I liked it. She interrogated me on why I support that (I don't even really smoke weed, maybe a few times a year) She says if my uncle finds out, who is a retired chief of police, he will be furious and will feel disrespected. My uncle has helped me out financially before, I paid him back, but she's all ""He won't help you again if you continue to act like this."" 

Also, she says I need to stop ""liking"" pro-lgbt posts, because our relatives (who don't know about my sister) will question that maybe my support for lgbt rights means my sister is one of them. My sister lives a very private life and agrees with them. I told them that my support of the lgbt community has nothing to do with my sister but rather just, you know, being an accepting and tolerant human being. But they don't see it that way because they are so afraid of what other people think.

What is my solution here? I can't unfriend my family members, or god forbid my mother, because they will be hurt. I already control what posts of mine they can see, but they can still see the things I ""like"" and ""comment"" on. So do I just refrain from liking and commenting on political posts on facebook? 

I say sorry, will continue to voice my opinion because I am an adult and this is a way of expressing myself and I like to be public with my views. But then, my mom claims they will die from a heart attack. Which honestly isn't too far fetched being that they are in their mid 60s and with their medical history. OR they won't die, but rather I would be cut off from my relatives. When I told her that I don't care about what my relatives think, she freaked out and was like ""what ever happened to family first? your family are the ones that will have your back in the end. no one else!""

My ex roommate and I got into a huge fiasco and I ended up moving to a different dorm room, and I just feel like nearly every friendship I've made up here has failed.

Along with that, I've had prior high school experience in my current major (ctc course jr and sr year) and I feel like the pace of my major class is just too slow and so many of my peers seem so cocky (I go to an art school) so it makes it hard to connect with them and makes me feel like an outsider.

As for my other classes, they haven't been the worst, but some of them don't even seem necessary (but I know most colleges do that).

And I feel like my school is made to seem a lot better than it actually is, as it's a really small school and the graduation rate isn't super high. The tuition is really high and not really seemingly worth what I'm getting.

I've just felt really out of place and this was my dream school, so I don't know what to do.

I said this 4 times before he acknowledges me and told me ""no, I want to watch this mom doesn't care"" I obviously don't believe him since he has a history of lying, but I didn't want to wake my mom up to confirm so I just told him shut up and get his ass into bed. This wasn't the first time and wasn't the last time. He routinely ignores anything I have to say, even once told me to shut up. I may have developed an anger problem with him specifically. I talk to my mom about this but she doesn't seem to think it's a problem, and is convinced that he'll grow up to be fine. But this attitude is so trash, he never says thank you, sorry, or please. He plays on his iPad all day and never does homework. I have no authority and he knows it. It's been months since I moved home and I feel like my brother should know that there are consequences to his actions, his disrespectfulness and his iPad addiction.

TLDR: my little brother is 12 and he's getting incredibly disrespectful and spoiled, but my mom doesn't care. Should I try to convince my mom, or should I let him continue this pattern of disgusting behavior?",07Jan2018,1

125,"My friend isn't a bad person, but a bit self centered maybe. I've recently been distancing myself for various reasons and she's been feeling lonely and not really doing all that much. She wants to do everything with me all the time, if I say I'm going to do something she won't leave me in peace she will ask loads of questions or ask for my input if I don't reply she just continues or asks if I'm ok, or she'll go do it herself and assume I want to talk. She says hi to me every morning and if I don't reply she says it again later and asks if I'm ok. I constantly have to deal with her petty issues which contradict themselves most of the time. She constantly wants to know how I'm feeling and if I give my reasons and they just aren't good enough essentially, she will tell me but it would be better so she knows what I'm going through. Most of the time if I say I haven't been up to much she will ask why I didn't talk if I was bored. She constantly asks if I want to do x sometime or x later, assuming I can just hang with her all the time. She wants me constantly and seems to think I need to give her my attention all the time. When I explain I have stuff to do I usually get a sob story at some point explaining she just wants to be a good friend and gets worried. She has a very much victim mentality despite being one of the most sheltered people I know (I could go off on that but for the sake of not making this too long I won't). I just can't do it anymore. The friendship is dead, I don't want to be so close anymore.

So any advice on how to distance from her or deal with her? The last thing I want is to hurt her feelings but it's getting to the point every little thing infuriates me.

126,"So I have just started a short course (6 weeks) in Germany. I've been here for about 4 days now and I'm hating it. It has nothing to do with the actual course or anything, I'm just sick of Germany. I've had a few bad experiences here and it's making me feel like crap.
I want to change my flights to go home to Australia.
I can do this without spending any extra money but I'm still not sure if it's the right choice. I know I probably won't get a lot of my money back for the course (if any), but money is not a big problem for me, not if it stops me from being happy.
This course also isn't compulsory or anything, and I can still finish my degree next semester without it. I signed up for it in the first place thinking I'd gotten over my problems with Germany, but now I don't think that's the case. 
I guess, what do you think I should do? I miss home like crazy and it's making me depressed, but at the same time, I've been here for such a short time, classes haven't even started yet.",07Jan2018,1

In all honesty, I don't even know if this kid died. I don't talk to him, he wasn't on the news, my friend is the only person I know who also knows them so I havent seen any other people posting about him. And this friend is a guy who likes to joke about pretty dark/inappropriate things so I wouldn't put it past him to put something about someone dying even though they're not dead. And the same day he was posting funny stuff again, however with less interaction with people than before (liking peoples comments, replying, ect) we're still on winter break so i haven't seen my friend in person yet and therefore haven't seen any if he looks down or anything. I don't want to ask my friend's girlfriend or dig through his friends list to find someone else's social media that will confirm this kid died because that seems creepy especially since I dont know the kid. I dont wanna ask my friend because that seems insensitive. So I don't even know if I should try to talk to him or not.

I am doing some soul searching, Its January, its back to my minimum wage factory job going nowhere. And that's been pretty much the story of my life since I left school, just floating along from one dead-end job to the next not knowing what I want from life but having a clear picture of what I don't and these dead-end jobs are not it.

I've done a lot of searching online and reddit etc, I see quite a lot of stories like ""Oh I quit my well paid corporate job and went and done this"" I can't resonate with these kinds of stories because to me it sounds like they have already made it. I am living pay check to pay check here, earning just enough to keep a roof over my head and feed my kids, I don't have the luxury of being able to just get up and leave and even if I did what would I do as I have real talents or interests as I mentioned.

130,"I have been experiencing sexual harassment at work for a couple of months. At first, it started with inappropriate comments regarding my appearance and then upgraded to requests for hugs, stroking my skin &amp; arms. I complained about this a couple of times to my direct manager, and she said to verbalize to him that it was unwanted. I had already done that, which I told her. When I continued to tell him I didn't want to have personal conversation with him or told him something was inappropriate, he would ""jokingly"" berate me for being ""too good for him."" He also started to make my job difficult by ""losing"" items related to my particular tasks.

During this time, he also started harassing another coworker. He was giving her gifts, also commenting on her appearance and making her uncomfortable. She would refuse them and tell him it was inappropriate for him to give her gifts. One of these gifts was a knife. The last time he did this, she told him it was inappropriate, that she didn't want his gifts and they weren't necessary. He said that they were, she may as well throw them away, and that he didn't want to be just her friend. I witnessed one of these occurances.

Later the same night he last offered her a gift, when I was briefly alone in a room with him, he grabbed at me while I was passing to hug me and then tried to kiss me. I tried to yank away, and he held onto me, saying, ""It's just a kiss!"" I finally fought my way away from him and into the hall where two coworkers witnessed me yelling at him that it was inappropriate, and that he had no right to touch or try to kiss a woman without her consent.

I immediately told my manager who said, ""Let's get through tonight and we will deal with it later.""

He was allowed to finish his shift that night and return the next shift, where I had to work with him and he continually tried talking to me, leaning against me physically, until I had to leave whatever I was doing to avoid contact. That same night, I was asked to file formal paperwork with HR regarding the harassment, and I expressed my discomfort to multiple managers/HR personnel with having to continue to work with someone who put his hands on me and has repeatedly tried to have some sort of contact when I have repeatedly said No. I put this in writing, along with details regarding the type of interactions I've had with him.

The other woman who has experienced harassment did the same.

They did not fire him. He is still allowed to work, and they said if he messes up one more time that he will be fired. They are waiting for him to mess up and expect for him too. The liability and risk is worth it to them, it seems. He confessed to everything and signed off on paperwork saying he did was he was accused of. They took 4 days to talk to him about it, and he still had access to me before that and was continuing to bother me at work after the assault.

I also missed two days of work this week, because the stress is pretty damned high. Lots of panic attacks.

Tonight was my first shift working with him after this Leave The Women Alone Talk, and halfway into my shift, he ended up splashing scalding hot water on me and the coworker standing beside me. ""Accident."" There were witnesses.

Obviously, I have to inform management of this. They have promised me the first sign of anything inappropriate, they will fire him, but I feel the company has unnecessarily continued to put their employees in the way of harm by not addressing this issue a lot more quickly - i.e. when he was first making us uncomfortable.

Do any of you lovely humans have any idea of where I stand, in terms of my rights? I do intend on writing a letter to HR expressing my concerns in detail, and I was told the LNI department might be my next best option. Although I've experienced harassment in the past, I've never been brave enough to go through the process of standing up for myself and continuing to stand up for myself when the outcome is unacceptable. 

Thank you in advance, and have a great evening.",07Jan2018,4
131,"Ok I'm not super sure if this is the right place to post this in, but I figure it's worth a shot.

I just recently moved apartments, right before the holidays, then went home for Christmas and the like, and am now back at my new apartment. What I didn't really pay attention to when I was schlepping all my boxes in so I could catch my flight was that this apartment complex uses electronic key fobs instead of the traditional keys. 

So I have a key fob for my apartment, my roommate has a key fob, and if one of us loses ours, we pay a fee of $65 to get a new one. Though I'm usually pretty good about it, I am known to forget to check my pockets before doing the laundry (and have ruined chapsticks, earbuds, and even an electronic car key this way). Usually I can clean out the inside of whatever electronic it is, dump some alcohol in there, and fix any other broken pieces, but this key doesn't even have a battery.

My landlady is very sweet and motherly, and had mentioned that if either of us has a gentleman staying over, even for a week or two at a time, she's not really opposed, which I took to mean she isn't super strict about our lease or the fact that we're only supposed to have two people living here. 

I'm wondering if there's some way to get a spare (just in case because I really am trying to improve on forgetting this), potentially sighting another person occasionally needing to get into the apartment, but I'm not sure how to phrase it, or if she would then charge us extra when we moved out if we didn't return all three keys.

Last night: so let's say I bought $100 of stuff online (from a reputable site). I payed with one method and decided eh, I don't want it on my credit card, so I switched to my debit card. Sweet. Switch was successful and I got an email confirmation from both paypal AND the retailer website for one receipt. My transaction history in Paypal is also for one payment of $100.

Well, on my bank summary (online), it says I have two pending transactions for $100. I'm really worried that I'm going to be charged twice, but I ordered these items less than 24 hours ago; I was thinking that initially my card was charged, but then the bank just hasn't updated the cancellation yet (just as it takes a few days to initial a refund). 

Do you think the bank just originally had that statement from my first payment before I changed the payment method? Again, I ordered these items less than 24 hours ago. So do you think I should just wait a couple of days to see if the bank updates it?

138,"Hello guys, first time posting here.

In 3 weeks I am moving away from the city where I spent last 4 years of my life (university). During this time I met a lot of people, but I never met someone I really clicked with. So when things started going south, I started feeling extremely lonely and was unfocused in school/job. I decided I want to move to another city (bigger city with more job opportunities and also some high school friends). This was 4 months ago.

A little while before I decided to leave, I got in touch with a group of people which I knew from the third year of Uni. We stopped hanging out when some of them left for Erasmus (student exchange), but now we got back in touch and I even met some of their friends.

During those 4 months they became the best friends I ever had in my life. They helped me overcome all of my issues that plagued my life for years and more. I finally feel like I belong somewhere. They even tried to convince me to stay and help me look for better living here since I already made arrangements to move away.

And so here I am. In my early 20s thinking about what to do with my life. I already booked a flat in the new city and I am looking for a job. I got in touch with my high school friends and they are excited I am comming. I only feel like I am leaving the best thing that ever happened to me behind and I don't know what to do.

Should I follow my brain or my hearth? Thanks for any advice.

A bit of background, over the last 8ish years or so I've been a bit of an anxious/depressed person, I've gone to therapists and psychiatrists, but have never been prescribed anything.

142,"I've lived with my brother my whole life (I'm 26 he's 24) and over the last 7 or 8 years he has really changed. He used to be this smart, funny charismatic wise ass that got on my nerves but he's my little brother that's what they're supposed to do. Then somewhere along the way he started doing drugs and acting out. Got locked up a couple time for truly idiotic things. While all the things he's getting himself involved in are really bad and stupid, it always seemed like his actions were a reaction to something else. Over the last two years he's gotten extremely violent. To the point where he trashed our house repeatedly and gotten physical with me and my mom repeatedly. We  had to take out a restraining order just to keep him in check. I honestly think he has some type of mental illness because when you speak to him he makes no sense. I have repeatedly walked in on him having full blown conversations with himself and more than anything he has these really violent outbursts that usually end up with holes in the wall, doors being ripped off hinges and the police at our house. I've been dealing with this for years now and I'm at the end of my rope. The only reason I still live at home is because I'm still in school but with graduation coming up in May I will be moving out and I'm scared to leave the rest of my family (my mom and my youngest brother) alone with him. I don't feel safe in my own house. I have this subconscious fear that one day I'm gonna come home and find that he's hurt my mom or my brother or worse. He needs help but refuses to get it.

144,"Just to give some context I'm an 18F and he's 21M.

Id been dating a guy, and had confessed my feelings for him. I really fell hard, and was I guess ‘under his spell’. It was hard to say no to him. One night I invited him in after we’d been at the movies. It was around 10:30pm. He immediately began to make out with me and I clearly stated (multiple times) that i did not want to sleep with him that night, and that i wasn't ready for our relationship to progress that far, and I wasn’t going to have sex. I was very sincere when I told him I wanted to talk and get to know him and that was my intention for bringing him to hang out with me. I tried multiple times to initiate that but he had no interest, and kept trying to kiss me when I spoke, saying ‘there’s nothing to talk about’.

He ignored what I’d said and began trying to undress me. I let him take my top off, and I don’t know why. I wasn’t saying anything. He moved his hand down to my crotch maybe 10-15 times and I kept saying no. Maybe it wasn’t a straight forward, or brutal enough no. But the memory in my head plays like a broken record of my no’s. I didn’t feel capable of even using that kind of tone with him. I was falling in love with him, after all. I didn’t want to let him down? Eventually I just let him finger me, I was so tired from the constant badgering. I thought this was consent, but was it? He did more stuff to me, and I wasn't enjoying it, but I just laid there and let it happen because I felt too awkward and scared to tell him to stop.

So.. fast forward, I made him cum, in hopes that he would finally leave my body alone, and just lay next to me. At around 2am I was nearly asleep, when he rolled on top of me not supporting his weight at all, and starting trying to ‘convince’ me into having sex with him. I still said I did not want to do that.

We were both still naked, I was so tired that I didn’t bother dressing as I thought we would’ve gone off to sleep after me getting him off anyway. So when he rolled on top of me, sex was already inches away from happening. I repeated 'I don't know, I really don't know' over and over, many times. I still don’t know why I couldn’t stand up to him, I don’t know what came over me but for some reason I just couldn’t be assertive, I felt just weak in every sense of the word. I physically and mentally wasn’t prepared to deal with the badgering again and I could feel it coming. He continued to pressure me saying things like 'come on... it'd feel so good, you know you want it, your body is telling me you want it’. I was just quiet at this point, kinda looking at him and looking away. I’d stopped talking because I felt like he just wasn’t listening and expected him to just get off me. Then he just stuck it in without much warning and without a Condom, which he knew I didn’t want but didn't seem to care. This all happened within about 10 seconds.

Unfortunately I froze. Since it was already happening I thought I must've somehow... consented? I was just in a state of pure confusion, maybe even disassociated a little and forgot somebody was inside of me cause my head was filled with ‘what-the-fuck’ness. Um... anyway. He was really into it, he put a hand over my mouth (still don’t know the intention behind that) and just didn’t look at me. I just lay there silent. He noticed after about 15 seconds and asked if I was ok, to which I responded 'no, I don't know' in a panicked voice. He continued for what would've been like 3-5 seconds, and then he said he didn't feel right and stopped. This is what makes me feel like this wasn’t rape/assault. Maybe he would’ve stopped had I been more assertive? During the sex, I never said to stop, and I never made any active attempts to stop what happened. I was just submitting to him I guess. Which has lead to me thinking it's partially my fault, for not being ‘clearer’ when the clothes came off.

I don't even know what to call this. I spoke to him briefly a week after it happened and he said it was my fault for sending mixed messages, that I let him get me naked, my invitation to my house meant I wanted sex, etc. he also apologised though and spoke about how much he cares about me, and wants to take me out again. His reaction to my implied accusation was just very mixed up, all over the place, and I haven't known what to make of it since then. I know there are many factors at play here, and that I'm not perfect, and that this isn't black and white. But this is why I'm here on reddit, so please be nice with your comments.

This guy is very manipulative and very smart I might add. But I've felt sick and anxious every time I've thought about that night, it just didn't feel right, but I don't know if I can bring myself to give it that label. My question is what do you guys think, what would you think if you were me? Would you call this rape?

146,"My landlord is a friend of mine. He bought this house and is renting out the rooms to me, my boyfriend and all our friends. It's pretty great. Recently though, he quit his job and went on a month long trip to Thailand and got wasted every night. This situation is the first time he's gotten super wasted since being back home.

He invited a couple of his other friends over, who brought two 18 packs of corona. four people drank all that, did tons of shots and could barely stand. The friends he invited over left around 2:30 this morning, and they drove home. This is where my first part of advice is needed. *How do you stop someone from drinking and driving?* I don't know these people he invited over, and as a small woman, there is no way I could stop them from leaving. I was afraid that they might hit me if I spoke up, as they seemed to be a very physical bunch while wasted.

This second part is... insane. I really don't know how to help and need advice concerning the situation. After his two friends left, our landlord vomited all over himself and the floor. Luckily another roommate of ours and his girlfriend were woken up earlier and able to help. We got him upstairs and to the toilet, where he vomited more, stood up and fell, subsequently passing out. We figure we can continue to clean up and leave him there for a minute. A pool of blood began to form underneath him, so we flipped him over and discover he has broken his three front teeth and gotten a massive gash in his chin. At this point, I think I would have called an ambulance or something, but our friends/roommates just started to clean him up. They bathed him, changed his sheets that had vomit on them, put him in pajamas and got him in bed. We bandaged up his chin, laid him on his side and are hoping for the best.

But what would you guys have done? How do we handle this in the morning? Should I have called the cops/medical unit and let them handle it? I feel really lost and would appreciate any advice.",07Jan2018,3

We actually were both mutually scared of anything sexual in nature (not because of the risk of pregnancy, but sexuality itself made us uneasy and flustered). We had no experience with relationships, much less anything sexual, prior to when we finally started dating after years of friendship. Up until only at that point (the sex) did we feel ready and the rest happened. Some weeks after that night of passion, my girlfriend begins feeling sickness and frequent upset stomachs. She took a pregnancy test and it comes out positive. So here we are now trying to figure out how to prepare for the baby.

Some situational information about ourselves:

We both just graduated from college back in 2017. I work at a major biotech company as a researcher and make about 81K while she works in marketing at a major tech company and makes about 110K. We both are about 6 months into our respective jobs. Her company allows her 17 weeks of maternity leave and gives $4000 for each child birth. My company gives 8 weeks for paternity leave. We also both currently live together with four other housemates (very close friends we both have known since high school) whom we share the rent and utilities with. They all know about the baby and say they would be okay with us raising the baby in our house (at least that is what they say right now). I am Filipino and she is Vietnamese (if anyone can culturally relate), and we both come rather traditional families.

We have been asking around for advice and why not here as well. This is rather unexpected and will definitely a major turning point in our lives when the baby is born. We want to be as prepared as possible for this, and we want all the advice we can get. Things that come to mind (but are not limited to) include: What we need to set-up/buy/prepare before the baby is due? Finances? When to take our parental leave? What other benefits do you think we can take from our companies for our child (just in general)? How to tell our traditional families about the news? Raising a kid with four other housemates? Etc.

We are still rather young, so we are quite scared, but we want to be strong for our baby. My girlfriend always loved children and playing around with her baby nieces and nephews. She always jokingly said back in high school how she wanted a baby in the future, but did not expect it this soon.

TLDR: My girlfriend is pregnant, how do we finance, prepare, and reveal (to our families) for an unexpected baby while living with housemates?

Thank you all for your kind consideration. Feel free to ask me any questions that might be beneficial to your advice-giving.",07Jan2018,9
150,"He's been brainwashed by that human filth ""Breivik"" who's an anti-Islamist, and recently, he's been going through a lot of psychological therapy, ECT, and sedatives due to his psychologist taking him to the hospital by force. He's been diagnosed as Schizophrenic, and bipolar (No clue which type), and I've been supporting him all the way, but I feel like I'm out of advice. He's hit a dead end. He tells me he's not feeling anything anymore, he can't focus in school, and he's been unconsciously drawing scars on his body related to this ""Breivik"" guy. He keeps mentioning suicide, and honestly, I think it's going to relieve him of a lot since his father, mother, sisters, and brother have abandoned him since he was like 13, and he's 19 now living on his own, but I'll never actually tell that suicide is the solution. He lives in Turkey which is full of Muslims, and I fear the hallucinations will drive him into committing a crime since he tells me he hears ""Breivik"" telling him to hit, kill, or run away from Muslims he sees in the streets and transportation, but he has a small skinny body, anyway, and hasn't harmed anyone before despite repeating to me how all Muslims must disappear.",07Jan2018,5

153,"Hey everyone! I came out to my parents earlier today and let them know that I was bi. Unfortunately, they didn’t react well at all. I saw this coming and told them right before I left town so I could avoid the awkwardness of their reaction. However, my flight was cancelled and I’ve got another day or so in town. I’m looking for ways to explain being bi to them, and to help them understand. Thanks! 

For context, I’m a Canadian male 22 year old professional and student who was straight until about a month or so ago when I realized I liked guys as well as girls. 

A couple misconceptions I’ve run across and attempted to dispel already- 
You can’t be bi unless you’ve done sexual things with a guy to know for sure. 
You can’t be bi, you can only be straight or gay depending on the person you’re with (and you switch or something, I’m not sure). 
Who you are is going to dramatically change based on being bi. 
When you’re bi you have to like guys and girls 50/50 each- for me it’s more of a 20/80 split. 
They’re sad for be because now I’m going to have a worse life (why?- I live in two tolerant cities and pretty much everyone I know is accepting of me) 
Also they’re shocked- “they never saw it coming with me”. 

If anyone has any tips or suggestions, they would be much appreciated.

156,"So I went to dinner with this guy. It was the fourth date but there was about a month in between. I asked him to hang out after we had just had sex and he said he was sick and I think he actually was but then I got sort of upset so I felt bad and apologized...I thought he only wanted sex and not a relationship. I met him online. We've had sex. He seems like a pretty cool guy, but he was telling me about how he just got caught by the cops for driving with no headlights on (I've done that before too) and how he ran a red light, but then he said he was arguing with the cop, which kind of scared me a little bit since I don't know him very well. We went to dinner last night and we had a good time and he gave me a ride back to my car. We split the cost of dinner and had deeper conversation than usual. However, he invited to his place beforehand and I said we should just meet at a restaurant. We argued a lot about it and then finally went to dinner and didn't have sex or kiss or anything and he said he'd text me if he wants to hang out again. I do like him. He's a fishing guide and grows his own marijuana. He's pretty cute and I think he's pretty nice and kind of funny too. I just don't want to be in a dysfunctional relationship, and sometimes I have questionable taste so that's why I'm posting here. He has always showed up to hang out if he  says he will. He had paid for every meal except this last one, and he works at a dispensary most of the time as well. His brother was in jail and he was in jail once for possession of alcohol when he was a minor but he got bailed out and hasn't gone back ever since. He likes to go hunting and snowboard and cook as well. Do you think this guy sounds decent and should I say yes if he does end up texting? Or does it sound like he just wants to get laid and doesn't want anything else? Also, there's the chance he won't text so I guess that would be a clear indication that he doesn't want to hang out. Does this guy sound like he's okay overall? Also, when we did have sex he playfully spanked me (which I kinda liked ;)) but he stopped as soon as I asked him to not spank me too hard...and he was playful but respectful. ",07Jan2018,1

159,"My fellow humans! I need your energy! (And ideas) 

When i say cold turkey everything i mean it.

Quit smoking, spending unneccesary amount of money, working out and dieting.

I used to be fat(ter), and back then i used an app where you type in everything you eat and it counts all your calories for that day, and show some real nice statistics alongside... And it actually worked! It was really helpful because it was always just short term goals you had to reach. Made it really easy to and very fullfilling by the end of everyday. Even though i went to bed hungry a couple of times, the feeling that you just fought something and won was very europhoric! :D 

So now i want to set myself some harder goals.
Im going backpacking in 2 months and i would like to save a lot more money than i already have, be smokefree and fit. 

💰,🚭,💪. 

What would be a nice way to go about these three things? And if there is some “Mr. Perfect” out there, tell me how do you do it? Use a calendar? Gain satisfaction from other places? Maybe use some really smart app to help you out on the daily goals?

I am really curious on how you guys tackle the “self-help” issues.

160,"Sorry for posting that again, but I would really want to hear what you people think. I feel like I am about to snap and really need some advice.

Well 2017 was very bad for me. My health was bad due to anxiety (I have asthma and I had a few asthma crisis due to anixety. Plus I had a problem with my eye, spending weeks not being able to be outside at the light and feeling a lot fo pain). I spend most of it unemployed (thank you economical crisis for that) and the months I was working, I did it for 350 euro per month. I spend the last year feeling sorry for myself and a complete loser. I used to have dreams and hope for the future, but now I feel like reality is taking them away from me. I did not share my economical situation with friends, because i did not want them to feel sorry for me. I am ashamed for what I am going through, although I know it is not my fault. I am ashamed to ask for money that I do not know when I can give back. I am ashamed eve to start a fundraiser or somethin. I just feel ashamed. I come from a single parent family and my mom is not so wealthy to provide for me. And I do not want her to. I am at an age, when I want to do things, work, feel useful to society and myself, wake up every day and feel like I am doing something with my life. I studied to do something with my life, but reality in Greece is so tough right now. I want to leave the country, but don't have some money on the side to make a new start, so I stay here where I feel miserable. I spend the last year considering my whole life; what to do, where, if I wanna live, if I have the strenght to continue. There were times I said to myself 'That's it. Just get over it', wanting to kill myself. The only thought keeping me from that was my mom. She gave everything so my brother and I are where we are now. It was not easy for her to raise two children alone. And I feel the utmost respect for her. And she is the ony thing keeping me here. There were other times I said 'Well I can go through it, just say positive' and some days went through feeling happy. My mood has been like an elevator; up and down, up and down. 2018 found me at the same spot. I try to be positive that something will happen and I can make a new start. It is not very easy to be positive when your life is full of shit. I feel so alone sometimes. Like nobody understands me or cares for me. And I cry a lot. I am trying to deal with it. Have you ever been in a similar situation? If yes, how did you deal with it?

165,"Sorry for my english. 

A few years ago, I noticed my friend wasn’t attending school as often so I messaged her to check up on her. 

I ended up pushing my boundaries and said “If you’re depressed, I’m here for you” which pissed her off because she wasn’t depressed (at least according to her).

She moved schools and so did I. However at my new school I was constantly looking at her social media accounts, reading our messages, googling her name on every platform and finding old photos and information. I’d save every photo of her and try to cut my hair the same way, do my makeup the same way. There was nothing I wouldn’t copy.

Recently I’ve stopped copying her. I’ve found my own image and appearance, and I have let go of trying to be like her. 

She’s blocked me on most social media platform which is understandable, however I can message we through DM or ask a mutual friend to send the message. I’m not the best at apologies, how can I apologise first and ask to be friends again?

However, I recently got messaged from a random girl on Instagram who seems really keen on me and we seemed to have a lot in common. Yesterday, I met up with a friend of mine and got talking about it. He said he'd got messages off her around two weeks before me as well, where she'd claimed totally different things about her personal tastes and family life to make them sound alike. When he told her he was happy being single, I can only assume she moved on to message me.

Since then, we're asked around to all the guys and girls (she's bisexual) we know who've spoken to her, and all of them have said the same: That she's told them different things about them that just happen to sound like common ground to whoever she's talking to.

Knowing now that she's probably lying to me just because she loves being with someone as opposed to that actual someone, I'm really unsure what to do at this point, having no real experience with people like this. Therefore, I thought I'd turn to this subreddit to ask. Any serious replies would be happily appreciated.

180,"School is about to start in a little more than a week. I'm really nervous about it. I sometimes pursue boys and sometimes they pursue me, and I really don't want that to happen. It is very distracting and I feel objectified quite a bit. I don't want to be the girl who complains about guys hitting on me and asking me out. I am lucky that they think I'm pretty and that they do ask me out. However, sometimes it feels very empty and it feels like they only want to have sex or control me or look at me and they don't want to know me for who I am. I am really sensitive and have had my heart broken once after dating, although I've been hurt deeply by males and emotionally abused as well, which has really deeply affected me and my self esteem. I am very angry and hurt. I am scared to go back to school because the town I go to school in has a reputation for its unhealthy population. I know it's partly my emotional health that is the issue, but it is also very distracting and difficult to have to say no to most males once a week who ask me out before knowing me and sometimes even before knowing my name. We've only had one conversation before this happens, and I don't want to be mean, but I also don't want to be easy. I think I may have a reputation for being easy even though I've only dated one guy.

184,"So for a while, since my teens, I've had these occasional desires to hurt people. Don't worry, I don't act on them!
These desires are like a less physical version of lust or hunger. There's no anger or sexuality involved, though. It's more associated with excitement, curiosity, or confusion, although these might be partially due to how I respond to these feelings.
The desire tends to feature strangulation or slicing skin, often with a strange gentleness to them, and occur more frequently towards people I like.
I'm tempted to call it ""bloodlust"", but this is already used by the vampire community for a different sort of feeling, and has associations with rage that don't apply in my case.

185,"I am 23, from Ontario. In high school I met a group of people who I bonded with because we were all mentally disabled, we were all fat, none of us showered, we were in Special Education together, we were all told by the school district that we couldn't do Uni and had to chose retail or trades, we used to game, and we got bullied alot. So we formed our own clique, it had 20 of us in it originally, 15 by graduation, and 4 now. I've since cleaned up my life, lost 150lbs and started Crossfit training sculpting the muscular athletic body I wanted, I shower every day, sometimes twice a day, and keep up with the latest men's fashion trends. I don't game much anymore, except on GTA Online after school and work, where I cruise the backroads while eating supper and watching youtube. I've developed an interest in Judaism despite being catholic, and plan to soon volunteer with the Chabad in Toronto. I also on a whim signed up for University taking food science, and began getting 80's, imagine that, eh? After this semester I have to move to Toronto and decide what to do with a few friends. These friends talk about change but incite it, they just sit around in their grandparent's basement talking about glory days of high school, in our crime-ridden small racist town.

Friend 1, BFF: 
My first friend, Cate is my best friend. In high school, she was the girl who never cared what anyone thought, never washed her hair nor wore makeup, and would make-out with anything that moved. We bonded because neither of us had friends for the first semester of grade eight. After grad, I moved up to work at a gas plant deep in the Alberta woods for 4 years and when I got back she'd developed Bipolar Schizophrenia and was in a mental institution. She was so lost she couldn't make coffee. I've stuck with her for a few years, helped her get back on track, but here's the negative side. She is the type of person who'll invite you to dinner to thank you, order an extravagant feast, then ask for your debit card to pay. In facts, she won't talk to you if there's no money in your account. She told me she's gonna go off her meds if I delete my facebook and has bounced between halfway house and halfway house doing everything to get thrown out. I think of her as a brother, but while I've grown she hasn't. She tags me in posts I don't want people to see and refuses to untag me, she lies to her guardian expecting me to lie as well, and when I don't she refuses to talk to me.

Friend 2, Cates brother Liam: 
Liam has always been big, biggest of our group, that's nothing negative though I'm just trying to paint a picture. In high school despite him being a Final Fantasy geek with no dating history to speak of everyone wanted to be him, he was the mayor. He still is sort of, whenever he posts something everyone will like it, 40 people average per post, sometimes his whole friend's list. He's always had these wild mood swings, he'll turn on a dime to be the most abrasive, callous, reprehensible guy. There'll be times where he'll tell his sister and me to f off for months at a time, then message us out of the blue to hang out and if I don't I'm considered a jerk, and if I don't forget the months of him leading us I'm also a jerk. He talks about going to Toronto with me, but constantly says wait 2 more years, it's not the right time for him. He's been a stocker at Superstore for the past 14 years. He's also a competitive and award-winning Marvel Vs Capcom player. In a moment of personal vulnerability, he asked me to get him in shape, to motivate him, help him with his mental health, and I have been for years and nothing come of it. 

Rhett, Friend 3: 
Rhett is Liam's best friend, and he's by far the most baffling of our group. He went to Toronto way before me, earned a degree in Indigenous Studies and began teaching it. He has people who love and respect him. Yet he'll constantly call in sick and drive 5 hours to our small crappy town to have an all-nighter with Liam where they eat fried chicken and rap whatever new game is out. He'll book a three-week vacation to hang out in Liam's grandpa's basement that smells like piss and mould and play Overwatch rather than his apartment which I can guarantee is nicer. He's also the one who's always commenting that he doesn't recognize the version of me that emerged from my fat. He doesn't understand why I shower or wear American Eagle clothing rather than Loblaws brand, why I go to CrossFit, and why I don't really game. He also has his mood swings, if he's down and Liam wants to spend time with Cate and I he'll demand they go to Ottawa and leave us in the dust. I don't know why... 

They've said if I move they'll still load up the car and contact me out of the blue for a night of heavy drinking which, I don't drink, and I'm sure I won't have time for. I'm hoping to make new friends, and will going to school full time, and working, and volunteering at the Chabad, so I don't where they'd fit into my new life. I will miss them but I've tried as hard as I could to motivate them, I dunno, I'm unsure, that's why I'm asking here.",07Jan2018,2

I would say I'm a skilled gamer, and I play everything from GTA5 to Overwatch (was in Top 500 EU once) to Fortnite to LifeIsStrange, all on PS4. 

I play a saxophone and a piano (I switched from keyboard). (Though it's a hobby I have lost interest in)

I played football for some years before, I'm more skilled in defending than attacking.

I listen to music that I actually like and not music that I want others to know what I listen to so they will view me differently. 

My grades at school are not too shabby, we don't have A, B, C, D, E, F but instead we have 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and I usually get 4, 5 or 6, mostly centered around 5. 

I watch anime some times, I have watched Sword Art Online, Re: zero, One punch man, Konosuba, and some other stuff. I used to watch Pokemon every sunday morning when I was a kid.

I have a YouTube channel currently at 269 subscribers, I have videos with everything from 10 views to 20000 views. (I don't post videos anymore though)

The social medias I have are Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Reddit.

I guess I have some form of social anxiety since looking at people in their eyes while I listen or talk is a awkward thing. At least I'm not fat but oh well 

I have two friends that are one year younger than me but I have known since I was in second grade and they was in first grade. They are the only friends in my life that visit me to this date. I still don't feel like they understand me though.
I also had a really close female best friend that I had known since kindergarden, but she stopped visiting me because someone else visited her all the time and we sort of lost contact after 8 years of friendship. Now she is like a stranger when I walk past her at school. 
I have 3 people I meet before school and in the lunchbreakes at school, though they are those types of friends that I could sit through the whole lunchbreak saying nothing and they wouldn't really care. They are the only people at my school that I can normally talk to without getting a silent response when I ask something.

I have never done anything out of line with him. I don't even see him like that. I didn't meet his wife because I never got the chance. I can see it from his wife's pov mainly because she hasn't met me and doesn't know what my intentions are. Idk, I guess I'm just wondering if this is a normal thing (it is for me) and since he usually texts me first, should I ignore it to respect her wishes? I run into this situation a lot because I work with a lot of guys and they're the only friends I usually make. Is there any way to avoid this?

I should start by saying that I am a decent high school student. My GPA is currently a 3.78, and the only C I have is in my math course, and it’s higher than a 75. My SAT and ACT scores are just a teensy bit higher than average. My strongest courses are Biology and English, and I enjoy both very much. I’m also fairly good at art, but I’m not sure that counts for much. I am not very confident in myself or my intelligence. Although I know it’s wrong, I constantly compare myself to others, particularly my two close friends and my partner. They all have a 4.0 or higher and have already decided on a major. I feel like I’m behind. I know I’ll get into some college, I’m not worried about that, but what I am worried about my career choice.

I have no idea what I want to do with myself in the future. 

Over the years I’ve toyed with a lot of ideas in my head, but nothing ever sticks, or is anything I think I’d truly be content with. I thought for a while maybe I’d want to be a Nurse Practitioner, or a Nurse Midwife, I thought maybe about being a Healthcare Administrator, or even a Dental Hygienist. As a last resort option, I could see myself as a art teacher or an editor of some sort. (If it isn’t obvious, I’d like a monetarily comfortable career. Growing up without it has inspired this, but I suppose it isn’t a necessity). By this point, it should be fairly obvious I’m all over the map. I don’t know what I want, and the endless barrage of counselors giving me shit suggestions hasn’t provided enough for me, I’ve turned here for help.  

How can I determine what I really want without wasting time? 

Is my fear of math and/or lack of confidence holding me back from finding what I want?


Thank you ahead of time. ",07Jan2018,1
192,"I have just heard back that I was accepted for a waitressing position. I've done waitressing before, and it wasn't a good time. I had panic attacks before every shift. When I went home I panicked about having to go back. 
Unfortunately, I don't have a choice in what job I get, because I desperately need a job to survive. 

When I panic, I cry. I can't seem to control it. So I'm panicked about that. I'm so scared I'm going to fuck it up. Drop food, not know the name of what's on the plate, forget about a customer, not know where the table is, fuck up an order, get a complaint. I'm just really fucking nervous already and I know it's pathetic but right now it seems like a big deal. I don't think I can do it.

So I am aware many of my posts have been about boy troubles. Part of the issue is them, but part of it is that sometimes I search for a boyfriend. It is difficult for me to stop because I feel very insecure and sometimes even unlovable. Do you have any advice (women especially but men are welcome too) for increasing self esteem and being content being single?

196,"My family is very keen on my boyfriend visiting us first before I can travel to his location since it is online dating.
But my boyfriend isn't in the spot where he can just come and go, like my brother where as he has family who can provide him money.
My boyfriend is currently working his ass off to live better and to transferring to a University which he really want to go. But he recently just purchased a used(new) car and now he doesn't have the money to come over. I'm not really sure on his finances other than what he tells me. But he really wants me to express to my family that he's not made out of money etc.
And when I was out eating with my mom and aunt I low key insulted her/our family?? I think I said along the lines like ""you don't understand being poor and that he's not made out of money and can't just come and go"" and my aunt just rolled her eyes (and our family were dirt poor) and I guess I was just frustrated being told he has to visit, when is he going to visit? like your not going to see him blah blah that I just got so annoyed and outright explained myself wrong. 
I've constantly been telling my family he's not rich, he can't just get money or use money to come and go. I explained his situation the best that I can. $300 can be nothing for my mom or our family but it's a lot to him. $100 or so for hotel may not be a lot for my parents but it can for him each day he spends to see me. I also think he doesn't want to leave his dad because when his dad has serious health issues his parent started fighting/arguing and his mother supposedly verbal abused him. I think there's a lot more reasons as to why he can't come and visit me and I'm being very patient and understanding. And yes it does upset me.
It upsets me even more when family reminds me that I'll never see him/ or can't see him if he doesn't visit first and that this problem will be a deal breaker etc. and I asked my mom and my brother if they can go down with me to go see him but my brother said no and that he's a man and has to come down.

200,"First of all, I want to say that my brother and I share a very tight bond, and we both love each other very much. So I never considered myself to be his half-sister - only in the moments when I have been very pissed at him for some reason. So when asking this question, I do not mean to tell him that I am his ""half-sister"" and thus not ""real"" sister - I simply want to tell him that we are not as closely related as he might have thought. My opinion is that he has the right to know. 

So anyways, him not knowing that we do not share a dad has been bothering me ever since he was born. Not so much in the beginning, because he was just a baby. As time passed, however, I got more and more uneasy about this matter. I feel like the more time goes past, the more tricky this subject becomes, and I am afraid that if my family does not tell him now, this information will hit him much harder later (One reason to why I am especially concerned about all of this is because my brother is a rather sensitive boy, even though he doesn't show it anymore. I care a lot about him, and do not want him to be hurt or sad or anything like that).

I find it very awkward when my brother brings up things like ""why don't you spend much time with dad? I spend so much time with him, but you don't"" (I am not really close with my step-dad because he married my mother when I was around 10 years old, so at that point, it was hard to get used to him. Plus, he is a kind of annoying person, so I don't really enjoy talking to him or spending time with him). It also gets awkward when I am telling him about my childhood or when my mother tells him about the years before he was born. Yeah, basically, all of this annoys me and makes me feel uneasy. I asked my mother recently if she could perhaps tell this to him. But she is completely against doing that. She absolutely loves how close my brother is to me and the good relationship we have to each other, and she is afraid that if she tells him the truth, he will stop considering me his full sister and might even start despising me. I tried to tell her that it is best to just do it now, rather than to wait until he becomes older and enters his teens, but she says that she wants to wait until I move out before she will consider telling him anything (I will move to another city for the university in August 2018). I understand where she is coming from, and I am slightly afraid of how my brother will react after he gets to know that I'm not his ""full"" sister as well. But I also feel like it is unfair to keep this information away from him, and I feel that if I were him, I would have been very hurt if I found out that my family lied to me about my sibling for all my life. 

As I said, this has been bothering me for a while, so now I wonder if anyone here has some advice regarding what I should do? Should I try to convince my mother to tell him asap? Or should we follow her plan, and tell him this information either right before/right after I have moved to another city? Am I worrying too much about how this will affect him?
 I would greatly appreciate any comments or advice! Also, if anyone has any similar stories to share, especially from the perspective of an unknowing younger half-sibling, I would like to hear them as well. ",07Jan2018,2

202,"I know I shouldn't care because we never actually dated (and it was my decision), but I still can't help feeling a bit annoyed.

She was actually the one who originally set us up, because she was really good friends with him and he had expressed some interest in me.

Anyway, one of the reasons I decided not to get involved with him was because I realized that I wasn't really all that comfortable with how close they were, and he had confessed to having a crush on her like two weeks before he asked me out. So, major red flag.

I also noticed that she became somewhat cold towards me when me and the guy started talking...even though she set us up.

Well now, about a month later...they're dating. I guess I dodged a bullet, but I still feel like shit.

Anyway...I guess this is more of a rant than anything.

203,"So I have a seminar that is due tomorrow, and it's a huge assignment that's worth a good chunk of our grade. We had around a month to do this, and I urged my group members to start getting the ball rolling early on. Needless to say, as of right now, I have done my fair share of work, but they haven't. Of the three in our group, one person will not do anything. I am confident the second person will do work, because I have discussed what we had to do earlier, but so far, the second person did not add their stuff onto the seminar PowerPoint and handout. 

What I am worried about is that I have been sending reminders about getting work done by certain due dates, however, they have been completely ignoring me. The last time someone replied was last Friday in the early morning hours (the fifth), when I told them specifically that everything should be done by the fifth so we could rehearse this weekend.  Of course, nothing happened. I'm quite stressed because we still need to rehearse our parts (has to be memorized), but I fear that if our group is not finished and don't rehearse the seminar, our marks will suffer. One of the group members tried emailing my teacher regarding final due dates (our teacher is somewhat unclear about due dates, so I'll assume it's due tomorrow), and how to prepare for presentations, but my teacher did not respond, meaning we are screwed. 

What should I do at this point? Should I do a separate PowerPoint and handout just to show my teacher that I completed the requirements and ask for separate marks, or wait till the end of today to see if they finish it (which roughly translates to, pull an all-nighter before my presentation day)? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL:DR-Important seminar worth a significant amount of my mark is due tomorrow, yet my group members have not finished their parts yet, meaning our seminar is incomplete, and that we're not prepared for tomorrow.

207,"So I’ve been friends with this guy for a year and a half now, he was there for me when i got kicked out of a group at school. He’s helped me through all my hard times but i’ve always felt like he’s used me for money whether it was for food or alcohol or for my house to sleep at. I’ve never really felt like i was as great of a friend to him as other people and like that i was just there when he wanted something yet he always told me i was.  On a few occasions he’s pushed me to a point where i’ve wanted to stop being friends with him cause of how much he takes the piss out of me or lets me down but he always manages to be nice enough to me to make me feel like i’ve meant something to him when low key i don’t think i do.

Well recently we went to this party and i got too drunk and passed out at pres and he decided to put gum in my hair and cut it. I had no idea he was doing any of it and when i got to the party i realised how shit it was. My hair was patchy. Some parts were at a level 1 shave and some was as long as it was before. So i decided to shave it all off just in an attempt to look a bit  better and while still being very drunk i asked my other mate to shave it with a size 2 shaver and there he was again taking off the size 2 and making the other guy shave my head with a 1. 

The whole walk home i was depressed and just wanted to know who cut it and who stuck the gum in my hair and he continued to tell me that it wasn’t just him and that multiple people did it. It wasn’t till the next day that one of my other mates let me know that he was the only person to put gum in my hair and cut it.

He’s not the most well off kid he lives with his mum and lives in a house about the size of my living room. He always manages to convince me that it was somehow my fault or that its not as bad as something is, depending on the situation. I honestly want to shave his head back in frustration but now that i’ve been typing this i think it might be a jealousy thing because i’m a bit better off than him and was about a 7 with hair compared to him being about a 5. I honestly dont know what to do in this situation, he’s so funny to be around and always manages to make me smile, but then he goes and does this shit that makes me feel shit and just unwanted.

So i’m looking to you guys to help me.

How can I consistently build and maintain connections and relationships? Want to make a difference in the community with an effect that lasts more than like- three weeks.",07Jan2018,1
209,"I’d like to split this post into three main parts: Backstory, Arguments and Exploration.

So first a little backstory:

We met years ago at the beginning of school by chance. I quickly bonded with people in his friend group but never directly contact him, his beauty was too intimidating. Even then I knew I was bi. Over the years however he’d randomly message me on Messenger with random cute emojis and messages telling me that he wants to “share a bed” and would change my chat nickname to kinky stuff. However I fell out with his friend and we separated. Over the upcoming three years he’s often make nasty remarks about my long hair and a particular jacket that “ makes me look like Hagrid”. It wasn’t until I got Snapchat and has randomly added him that we started properly taking. We would tease each other with side pics of our upper thighs and just showing pubic hair. This continued throughout our on and off arguments. Until one day we FaceTimed and showed each other everything.

Arguments:

One argument which shapes this entire thing. So after exchanging picks for a good 20 minutes he tells me some girl is messaging him and he tells me to go back on my console and leave him be. The next day I freak the fuck out at him and asks him what’s his issue and he tells me “he only likes guys when he’s super horny”. I don’t know what to make of this. Is he exploring sexuality? Did he ever like me? We stop talking with on and off arguments for several months until December.

Exploration:

Halfway through December he sends me a random snap in the morning with two letters “Ft”. I tell him yea and he unblocks my number and we chat and exchange pics for thirty minutes. He then abruptly ends the call. He patched me for the next month until I messaged him two nights ago on Snapchat saying “ Do you want to talk again?” He goes on telling me about his friends, my former ones.

So, now with all that data, my questions are-

How do I make my feelings clear to him? I do like him and think about laying next to him so often.

How do I find out his sexuality and if he’s interested?

How should I ask him out and make my intentions clear that it isn’t anything less than a date? I want to be with him more than anyone before. I do have an active girlfriend that he doesn’t know about though.",07Jan2018,1
210,"Im going to elaborate on some of the words I used in the title real quick. I say semi close friend because he graduated with about 30 people in his class and is very close to those people. I came in a couple years ago and don't get to hang out near as much due to school and work. He's higher on my friends list that I am on his if that makes sense. 

The suicide in quotes was used because they haven't found out if it was a suicide or the gf murdering him. There's a long story I will not share but it's fairly horrific. Either way, the man list his only brother at 22 years old and I want to be here for him as I've lost 3 close friends young to suicide and didn't have friends that would do this for me.

I don't want to bombard him or pour salt in wounds. He's a very stereotypical man and will not reach out to anyone other than his wife most likely. She's not dealing with it wonderfully either.  She's calling him every 30 minutes while he is at work just to make sure he is still breathing. He has talked about just wanting to die. 

This event happened just 3 days ago if that matters. He works 12s 4 on 3 off. That's not only a long time to get lost in your thoughts at worl, but also a long time to get in a grove of wallowing in the depression. I'm thinking about just showing up with some beers and playing some pool or something. I know when I was in his spot, I appreciated it when people somewhat forced me to do something so I wasn't thinking. But everyone deals differently and I sure as he'll don't want to make it worse.

214,"Hey there, so I am looking for some life advice or guidance, I don't know who else to ask so I came here.
I am 27 years old and I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years about 7 months ago because I found out he was cheating on me. I am still living with him due to financial problems and mental problems but I know I can't forever. He was my only true close friend and we are still 'friends' in a weird way but definitely not that close anymore and don't hang out or talk much, we keep to ourselves more when we are home together. I have some other friends but no one that I feel that close too, and they all have significant others. I am mainly close to my parents who I am thankful for.
I am mainly living with my ex still because the rent is cheap, only 250 for the each of us and I am used to living with him, and am scared of losing contact with him, but I know I will eventually. I work at a vet hospital as a kennel technican and get paid $10 a hour 35 hours a week or less. I really enjoy my job and working with animals but I am worried I won't be able to support myself independently. I live an hour away from my parents and they are really the only close people I have in my life. I am a big introvert and a quiet person so it's hard for me to make close relationships. I have met a few other guys after breaking up with my ex but haven't been able to have a great relationship with them, mainly sex.

I know I need to change something soon because I have been very depressed and feeling a lone and lost. Should I move back in with my parents for a while with their support and find a better paying job and save up and move out later on, try to find another place to live with someone else that I can afford with my current job, or find another job that pays better and try living in the same area? I like the area I live in now but I wish I was closer to my parents and it could be good to get further away from my ex. I know I sound helpless but I am feeling that way.

The new co-worker continuously tries to get out of work, and whenever the supervisor says no he starts arguments.

216,"I've never had that many friends throughout my life. I've always been socially awkward but I am working really hard to change that.

I'll first start from a young age. I am not from a western country. I have special needs, and since the education system of my country is really strict, my parents sent me to a westernised school. It is a private school, and some of the kids there are super wealthy. I found everyone extremely materialistic and some of them are upper class kids who act like Paris Hilton, you know, like living a lavish lifestyle and partying. Some only care about partying every week on yachts and stuff. I didn't really click with them, and left high school with only one close friend who lives abroad. I've been told that high school tends to be the easiest to make close friends but that didn't happen.

Fast forward to uni, I was reclusive in the past. A girl was somewhat close to me but she ultimately left me. I became somewhat depressed and withdrew myself from social interaction. My class for my major is super small and since everyone has already formed social circles, it is kind of hard to enter them. One group does let me have lunch with them but the group members didn't add me to their private WhatsApp group. I guess I do want to make friends but I've been told that maybe I am trying too hard and should just let it be.

I've tried joining different events at uni but I've only made acquaintances. The thing is you usually only see these people a few times at those events and you never see them again. Things are similar for living at dorm. I had an exchange student as a roommate and I've invited her to hang out with me but she always politely declines (as she does right from the very start) and only hangs out with other exchange students from her country. I've tried befriending everyone else living on the same floor as me and have invited them to hang out with me. A few did say yes but they will eventually decline. I've noticed that most people at dorm almost always stick to their own social groups and others in my country have made the same observation.

I know that church is great for meeting other like-minded people but I am not religious. Any tips for making more friends?

218,"Hey guys, using a throwaway just in case someone from works browses reddit. Its unlikely but I'm not taking chances. I'll try to keep this short.

I used to be a ""horse girl"" but because of my lack of funds I had to drop my hobby for a few years. About 7 months ago, I saw a job posting for a big horse farm and applied for it. I didn't think I was gonna get it because even though I had horse experience, it wasn't years and years and years of experience like most people they'd consider but I guess they desperately needed help because I got it.

I started out really loving my job at first. I'm learning something new every day and learning new skills that I can take with me (organization, management, etc.) But after working here for a while I've realized that horses aren't really my thing anymore. I definitely don't hate them, but they aren't for me. 

I'm pretty much ready to move on but there's two (main) things holding me back. It's the beginning of foaling season and things are about to be crazy busy, and I'd feel guilty leaving because we're short handed. The other huge concern is my boss. He's been known to assault his employees. Verbally and physically. I'm really scared of him. I've been told he's assaulted employees for less than just wanting to quit. I want to obviously not get on his bad side, but me leaving pretty much assures that. Plus this job would be an excellent reference for future jobs so I don't want to burn this bridge. Another problem is they require at least a two month notice (I wasn't told till months later) because the farm has such a high turnover rate and they struggle to find workers with experience (was later told because everyone who has experience in the horse industry knows about my boss and no one wants to work for him) HR apparently knows about this but for some reason they haven't done anything about it. So I kind of feel like I'm being held hostage out of fear. 

I really don't know how to go about leaving. Either I put my notice in but get verbally abused and maybe ran off the farm anyway (this apparently happened before) or leave without saying anything and I burn the bridge. Had I known this before hand I wouldn't have taken the job but here I am. What should I do? Has anyone ever been through this?

since the whole process started i found out that i have 4 other siblings from my dad. as you can imagine i was extremely hurt, and still am. these children are from 3 different women. it’s just tough to believe that my family isn’t the only family my dad has, and it makes me feel like we weren’t good enough? to feel the need to impregnate 3 other (one of which was pregnant on two different occasions), seems as if you must be really dissatisfied with your current situation? he had also threatened to disown my brother, and lied to police and arrested him.

the worst part is that a lot of mothers at the school i currently go to know about these affairs my father has had, and they knew before i did. i just have this fear that they’ve told their children, and people in my grade know everything about my current family situation which would be so embarrassing.

my dad has done these terrible things, and i wish it was as easy as resenting him and never wanting to see him again. but of course he’s my father and i after all this i still do love him. 
what do you suggest i do? i’m just feeling quite conflicted right now.",07Jan2018,3
221,"Ok, so some quick background so you understand where I'm coming from. I have 2 children, a 1 and a 2 year, a dog, a cat, then me and my husband. We live in a very tiny house that needs work done and I have a disability that makes it difficult to get around. The big issue here, is the dog. He's a big dog and despite what anyone says, I know he doesn't like me, and he lets me know as often as possible. He shits on the floor, he steals food from my kid's hands, and just won't stay out from under from under my feet. I have issues enough with tripping, and he just exasperates it. I've tried teaching him to not lay in the middle of the walkway, even placed his bed where it's not in the way so he knows where he can lay and he moves his bed to the middle if walkway everytime! Now his ear issues aren't his fault, but my husband never does anything with them. He always tells he wants the dog, but he never does anything with it. He doesn't bathe him, feed him, clean his ears or even simply pet him when he gets home from work. But he wants to keep him? I'm just tired of the dog. At least the cat is well behaved and doesn't even scratch the furniture! Simply put, the dog needs to go. But it's convincing my husband to let it happen is the problem. He is stuck on the thought that I just hate the dog, but I really don't. I just can't handle him anymore and he needs a home that give him more attention. I just don't have the time. I've even tried suggesting to let him stay with my mother-in-law, who lives right next door and has a dog of her own with a dig run and dog door. He could go see his dog whenever he wants and I'd be free of it. But he just won't budge. 

So other than my rant, I'm just seeing if anyone has any suggestions I can try to convince him to let the dog go or at least just put him next door. ",07Jan2018,1
222,"Hello!

First I want to say that I am seeing a therapist about this but sometimes I just need some advice from people who may have gone through the same thing or have the same feelings as me.

I have been this way for as long as I can remember. I meet someone new and at first, things will go great if I am into them and they seem into me. I will be elated and have fun talking to them and have no worries. It is fun, lighthearted, and I have a great outlook on everything.

Then, after some time, I start to become worried. I start to think that all of my actions will lead to them walking away from me. I can't believe that someone would ever like me or want to be with me, and it really takes a toll on me because it turns a fun, new possible relationship with someone into something that stresses me out.

I have gotten somewhat better since I have started seeing a therapist about this, but I still have moments where it starts to come up and consume my thoughts. I can't seem to shake the feeling that I am not good enough, that I have no chance, and that any type of miscommunication or lull in communication means that they are already over it and don't have any intentions of pursuing anything with me. 

I know this comes from my past experiences with men. I try very hard not to put all men into the same category as previous men who I have felt hurt by, but it is really hard sometimes when I get into these bouts of anxiety. It makes me retreat and feel like I am bothering the person I am talking to even though they haven't necessarily shown any signs that this is true. I feel like I cannot do anything right. Everything I say or do becomes something that ""ruins"" the potential for a relationship so I kind of shut down and become less of myself which I know is not okay and doesn't help the situation. 

Its really frustrating because I know deep down that my thoughts are irrational, but I can't seem to shake the feeling. I just really want to know if there are ways to help this. I want to just be able to be interested in someone without all of this fear and anxiety surrounding my every little move. I want to be able to talk to someone without fear, without second guessing my wording and my tone. 

I especially want to know how to stop taking everything so personally. If someone doesn't reach out to me for a few days, I automatically assume it is because they don't want to talk to me or they aren't interested anymore, rather than just assuming they are living their own lives and have had a few busy days or bad days. 


I just want something to develop naturally without all of this overthinking that seems to get in the way of my happiness so much.

So any words of advice or encouragement are welcome. If you have experienced this, what have you done to help pull yourself out of it? How have you been able to start trusting again?

TL;DR: I have issues with anxiety surrounding relationships and worry an abnormal amount about whether or not I am good enough or whether or not the person has lost interest. I don't know how to not do this, I can't seem to help myself. 

Thank you!",07Jan2018,2
223,"I am really struggling to do chores such as laundry and pay off bills. My current excuse for not doing laundry is that I spent all my money on eating out, and still have not paid rent. And I have very little money left in my account. 

Laundry is expensive. And I don't have detergent. And after paying off all my bills I am going to be left with 100 bucks *for the rest of the month*

224,"I have this male neighbor who lives on the top floor in my building with his girlfriend. When he introduced himself, he told me he’s the weed man for the building and being as though I smoke occassionally (it’s legal here), I can come to him if I ever needed some so we exchanged numbers. Now, I have my own trusted connects so I intended to only contact him IF none of my people were available and that hasn’t happened yet.

One night in passing, I was coming home from a bar, a little tipsy and I ran into him in the building. We chatted briefly and he asked did I have a blunt, I said sure and he asked if he could smoke because he was “out”. Stupidly, I said yes, he came inside my apartment and we smoked, chatted and he confessed that he thought I was attractive and wanted to “get to know me” despite living with his girlfriend. He also confessed he’s been to jail for domestic violence (which he claims wasn’t his fault), started making comments about my body and things got ackward after that. I didn’t feel comfortable anymore so I made up an excuse of being tired and asked him to leave. We only chilled for an hour tops. Nothing went down and we sat on opposite sides of the couch. 

After he left, the next morning. I noticed an old deactivated iPhone that I leave on my table was missing. I texted and asked him if he saw it and he said no so I left it alone but I believe he may have taken it. I’ve been avoiding him ever since. 

Since that incident he’s been calling and texting me often. At first he was hitting me up to chill again but I’ve been making excuses so now he asks for stuff. Like he asked if I had a blunt he could “borrow” (wtf) until the next day, if I had Tylenol, a corkscrew and other miscellaneous shit. I always lie and say I don’t got it or I just ignore his text.

My attempts to avoid him only works some of the time because we live in a small apartment building, we will eventually run into each other and that’s happened twice. One night, I was coming in from the store and so was him and his girl. He tried to give me a hug in front of her and even called me “boo”. She and I both looked uncomfortable. She didn’t speak to me btw. I feel as though he is messy.

 Last night while I was out, he texted and asked if I was home and when I said no, he claimed he had some “new shit” he wanted me to try then asked when I would be home. I ignored his text so he texted back a little later “wooow” with sad face emojis. This morning, he texted to “check” on me and then asked for roll of toilet paper. I have not answered his text.

I’ve already spoken to him and told him I’m not looking for anything at the moment and I’m just not interested in dating ANYONE especially someone that lives in my apartment building. It’s really annoying and when I ignore his texts or tell him that I don’t have what he’s asking for at the moment, he still tries to see me. It’s annoying. What should or can I do? I can block his number but I still see him in passing and he is even more persistent in person. I feel ole he can’t take a hint.",07Jan2018,1

This isn't my exact field, and I know that new engineering positions come out all the time... But I know the market for engineers is super rough. (I've applied to about 300 positions over the last year. 6 interviews, 6 rejections)

I graduated with top marks, I have 2 co-op experiences, My resume/cover letter is great, I have great interview skills.... So I have no idea why I don't have an engineering position.... I ALWAYS feel like it's RIGHT around the corner.

I made a pro/con list

Pro

-	I will have a job (Many people from my program don’t have jobs at least 80%)
-	No more uncertainty looking for work 
-	Job security 
-	I’ll get a p.eng 
-	I will have money 
-	There is a great staff 
-	I will be trained for 3 months with prior supervisor, she's leaving
-	Close to home 
-	Smaller town
- Salary is actually pretty middle class
- I actually don't care about money TOO much

Cons

-	I will have to move
-	I will pay a bit more on rent
-	Getting to work will be by bus/walking
-	I will be committed (I will not accept any other position, including engineering) [Biggest worry for me]
-	Pay isn’t engineering salary (It's at average for engineering technologist)
-	Worried about future job prospects
- Some friends have full engineering positions, so I don't know why I don't",07Jan2018,1
227,"Long story short I have a best friend of many years and we always lived very far from each other. About 2 months ago I moved to the same city and we hung out a lot and I knew that I really liked him as more than a friend and I was pretty sure he liked me too because he wanted to spend all his free time with me and we would kiss and hold hand and stuff. He's had a few girlfriends before but is really feminine so I wasn't sure if he was gay and I was really nervous that trying to take things to a romantic level would make him uncomfortable. (his family/culture is really Catholic so it would make sense that he may not want to be loud about being gay). Anyways we spent a bit of time together before I had to go away for a month for the holidays. I won't even try to explain how but I accidentally ended up connected to his Apple account recently and STUPIDLY started reading one message out of curiosity (I'm only human). This one message snowballed into many more because of what it said. And I just found out that he does, in fact, hook up with a lot of men. I have no problem with this, obviously, he's one of my best friends and I love him dearly but now I REALLY don't know what to do. 

I'm returning there in a few days and was planning on talking to him about my feelings for him but now this throws things way off. I'm bisexual so I understand that this may mean that he does in fact like women as well, but judging by the messages he doesn't hook up with any women..
On the other hand, when I was there he seemed to stop hooking up and was spending all his time with me soo..I dunno if that means anything. 

Also - do I tell him what I saw?! We honestly have a lot of love and respect for one another and now I feel terrible for violating his privacy. I also feel terrible that he keeps this part of his life hidden from everybody. Regardless of any romantic relationship, we could maybe have/not have, we've been best friends for so long and I want to let him know that he can talk to me about it. But I'm not so sure that telling him that I invaded his privacy is exactly the best way to let him know that he can trust me.. (*bows head in shame*).

228,"I make $90k in the midwest, normally commute an hour each way. My first wife died of cancer in april. Her illness strained my work relationship immensely. I reconnected with someone I've known most of my life and married her in November. Middle of december, she suddenly became paralyzed in her left leg and we're struggling to figure out what's wrong, meanwhile she's in pain. We need to move to the pacific northwest to get back to be with her family which was the plan all along. But I'm essentially a single mom and caretaker right now, and i'm not doing any of my jobs very well. My work has had it with me and its noon sunday and I have a lot of work I need to finish before I can show my face (online) tomorrow. My wife has a few appointments a week right now and I am remoting in- against company preference. Its just a matter of time until they say no more. My wife is not recovering very quickly and we still don't know what's wrong. We're running out of money, and had planned on taking our youngest son out of daycare at the end of this month ($900/mo) and need to continue it now that she can't care for him. I'm overwhelmed, I'm out of money, and I'm about to get fired and need to figure out how to move a house full of my late wife's crap across the country and find a new job. Yesterday. To add icing to the cake, this house is not at all handicap accessible, and I was lifting my wife up the stairs the day before yesterday and we both fell, and I hit my head and got a concussion. We're reinjuring ourselves more quickly than we're healing. We have no family in this state, and none that can come help. We have no financial support. I've started to take a loan out against the house to cover some moving expenses and things before i lost my job, but this is too much for me and I can't move a 3k sq ft house full of stuff, change jobs, take care of my 2.5 and 13 year olds, my wife,  and still figure out how to do work in the meantime.

229,"So, I've never flown anywhere before. (25F, USA) I have a lot of questions that are probably totally ridiculous, but bear with me here. I grew up in a corn field in the midwest and am still learning about how big the world is. I'm supposed to fly from Michigan to South Dakota on Delta soon. I have absolutely no idea what to expect and was hoping some of you lovely folks could pass on some nuggets of wisdom to me. 

I wont be taking much luggage and intend to fit everything I need for a few days in a small backpack. I'm more worried about navigating system of the airport than I am the actual flying part.

Some absurd questions:

1.)Does the scanner thing you walk through without your shoes off like, x-ray your whole body? Will my titanium implants from my root canal set this off? What about the underwire in my bra? My belt?
2.) If any of those things happen, will TSA assume that I'm an extraterrestrial spy, drag me to a back room and proceed to export me to a lab in Area 51?
3.)Seriously though, a friend told me gel inserts in your shoes aren't allowed. Is this a real thing? I kinda need those. 
4.)Can I bring my liquid foundation and other feminine accouterments? Toothpaste, etc?
5.)Can I bring my pocket juice (portable battery) for my phone? 
6.)What actually happens when you put your phone in airplane mode anyway? Does stuff work up there? O_O
7.)I have a 45 minute layover + plane transfer on my trip. Is this enough time to grab a snack and find a place to smoke a cigarette in Minneapolis, or do I need to head directly to my next terminal for safety?
8.)Can I even bring cigarettes and a bic/matches? I feel like that's not a thing. 
9.)Can economy class order alcohol?
10.)What is the deal with airline food? How do I pay for an item anyway; do they somehow know to charge the card I bought the tickets with or...?

That's all I've been cycling for now. Thank you so much if you made it this far, especially with your patience in tact. I'm trying to arm myself with knowledge in the fight against irrational fear, anything helps. 

TL;DR: First time flyer with social anxiety. Fine with the idea of a sky roller coaster, terrified of interacting with humans to get on the ride.

It's as if I have literally no control of anything even though in the moment I'm not doing anything and it feels as if I don't even exist. The world and everything else continues on but it feels fake. It's not as if life isn't real, it's as if life cannot be real; the universe, our world, my spark of life all feel impossible.

240,"Hello all, super secret throwaway account here.

I apologise, first of all, as I know many people are much, much worse off than myself and are more needing of help and guidance than I am, but any words of wisdom at all would be appreciated here. This will probably end up rambling a lot because I don't really know what my problem is.

Basically, with the turn of the calendar I've been thinking a lot about what kind of person I really want to be and where my life is going to go. I've kind of just stumbled from one life-event to the next - University, simple unskilled jobs, a long term relationship. But after that last one fell apart two years ago I find myself living back at home with my Mum.

I've been here two years now and I think I'm quite happy. I took the first job offered to me (another simple entry-level job) and only work about half a day every day, so plenty of free time. I use this time to watch TV, surf the internet and play video games, which I consider the closest thing I have to a true passion. I don't have any friends in the area but I'm not a social person and don't miss pointless social obligations at all.

The thing is... I don't know if I want more. I see my friends from university becoming professional bloggers, creating successful Youtube channels, starting happy families, and I feel that twinge of envy. 

I always thought if I did anything it would be creative. I studied Creative Writing at university after all. But I never really *enjoyed* writing, I just did it because I was good at it. I can't sit down and write without becoming bored to tears. I like video games, and this year I've been livestreaming every day in an attempt to turn that hobby into something more substantial, but making video games like work in any way totally sucks the fun out of it for me.

I don't really know what I'm trying to say here, sorry. I feel like I'm scared of being myself. Like I'm at a point where I have to choose if I'm just going to be that guy who lives in a 1-bedroom flat and is content with the simple things in life, offering nothing of greater worth into society apart from the bare minimum effort into a job I keep just for the money to live, or if I'm going to go on and become something ""more.""

I don’t do well in this role, admittedly- though last week I asked for help on a ticket and my manager sighed heavily and said “I don’t understand why you can’t think this way”. Other coworkers bash other employees when they’re out of earshot, and super sweet when not. I’ve got some money saved, but I’ve never quit a job without notice. Am I stupid? Apologies if this isn’t the right forum for this. ",07Jan2018,15
243,"Well I'm here because I get rejected every time whether it's friendship or relationship. I know what's wrong with me, I just don't know what should I do to quit these bad habits. Please don't downvote if you haven't read it all. 

First, I like listening to old music like classic rock and country and blues and jazz.. whatsoever. I'm attracted to old things. Old cars (Pontiac, Dodge, Mercedes), old movies, etc. I'm twenty something yo now but I even like women generally older than me. I know it's weird but I feel more comfortable talking to older female colleagues at work. At least I can talk to someone and they're listening. I don't know. Should I listen to more popular music? I already know a couple of top artists but I don't like them very much. Sorry. I often get ""You know what's wrong with you?"" and then ""You always listen to those old records that no one likes"" or ""You're way too kind and people don't deserve it"". These are the things I often get.

Whatever I find entertaining, other people will not. My high school friends sometimes call me to go to clubs but I hate clubs, okay? I hate being in clubs. The music plays way too loud and there is really nothing to do there. Every club night ended up me leaving the place telling no one about. I just left. Bang. I think one night I just went home because I had enough of this fake bullshit. I just played some guitar at home and went to sleep. I was not angry or anything. No one hurt me or anything. I just felt like going home. Another thing with clubs is people are tend to think I'm aggressive. They say it's my face. They say my face always reflects a mean expression that says ""get out of my way"" or ""what do you want"" or something like that but I don't mean it and I don't want to hurt people. Maybe it's just because I don't like being in clubs. Should I go to smaller clubs first? You see I don't like clubs but friends always go to clubs and I miss having friends.

Although there is a small jazz club in town, no one wanted to come with me when I asked my friends. Obviously this is no cool and there is no smoking hot bitches in the jazz club but still, I just wanted to listen to the music so I went alone. That night made me realize: I have no friends. Seriously now.. I have no friends to hang out with. I really want to quit being a loner but you know it's hard when no one is interested in your things. I like going to the jazz club but I don't feel comfortable going alone. What do I do here?

Then... Generally I'm very nice to girls which might make them think I'm gay. I'm saying because it actually happened to me once. Some girl thought I was being so nice because I was gay and I just wanted to be her gay friend lol. You're being nice to ladies, ladies think you're gay... Nice... Well done champ... Well I'm not gay, okay? I like women but women don't like me. And my colleagues say I'm not ugly at all. They say there is no way I'm single because I'm so young and handsome and I have an athletic body. At least this is what they say. I have muscles but I'm not athletic. My standards are not high. I have average standards. I expect a woman to have a pretty face with a matching hair style, and to not to be fat. No boobs size and stuff. I often would take them to a nice walk near where I live and then I would want to have some nice food together. I cook pretty good btw. Most of the time I encounter with ladies having high expectations and high living standards. Recently I got so many rejections I decided I was going to just stop for a little. Now I got to the point where I'm literally afraid of asking a girl whether she would like (let's say...) country music or whatever, or whether she'd like to do anything I find entertaining - because they certainly don't. But it's not just my taste of music. There is other things too.  In my age I still prefer studying and spending time on.. You know.. to learn new things such as languages, music, cooking, sports, things like that. Valuable things. I think I could fake myself, taking girls to clubs, eating shitty food in a fancy restaurant but that's not who I am. I can't do that, sorry. I don't know what girls like anymore. I like to do exercises/work out when I fail or get rejected because it makes me exhausted. I like that because then I just take a shower and go to bed but I still miss having someone.

I like simple things. Things that make you happy. Things that teach you the lesson. I might even have the mental and physical abilities to climb Mount Everest but you know what? I'd be happier if I could do that with friends. And if one of us could not make it to the top, I wouldn't go either. If you picture it, wich one is more valuable? A self made photo of yourself at the top of the mountain? Or a photo with friends down at base camp? I think I'd go for base camp.

I'm not super smart but I'm not dumb either. I didn't go to university because I screwed up in high school so I'm working now. I want to go to college some day to dig deeper into film studies and to learn more about movies in general. Honestly I haven't really decided yet what I want. I like reading scientific and psychology related articles, I like films, music... I learn how to play the guitar and drums. But who knows? I might like so many things I haven't even tried yet. 

I'm not a native English speaker but feel comfortable with English now. My goal is to read English novels and books with no difficulties. At the moment I don't have language friends but it'd be cool to have some and I'm working on fixing that here on reddit :)

In short, here is what I want from life

 * First I want a big white paper box filled with donuts of different flavors (additional dipping sauce would be awesome)

 * I want to go to college

 * I want to meet a nice girl

 * I want to visit my cousins more often (they live abroad)

 * I want to hang out with people in my age

 * Listening to hits of the previous decades with friends (that's not necessary although I'd love that lol)

 * I want to find an instrument that is not specifically left or right handed (I play guitar but I suck because I'm a lefty)

 * And after all, I want to go to prom dance with the girl I met a few lines above. That's all I want.

245,"I’m (19,f) in my second year of uni and living in a uni house. One of my flat mates (19,f) is also in my university course and I feel anxious whenever I’m around her or even just thinking about her. In first year we were really good friends and she seemed really lovely but this year she has completely changed. She has a new friendship group now so even if we invite her to activities she doesn’t reply. She goes out late pretty much every night until the early hours of the morning and is really inconsiderate when she gets back. She also has severe mood swings and can one minute be lovely and the next absolutely horrible. I’m also a people pleaser so it makes me anxious when people don’t like me. Her room is right next to mine and we are in the same friendship group on our course. The living with I can kind of deal with as she’s moving out in 5 months to live with her new friends, but it’s fact that we are on the same course that makes me more anxious as we have the same course friends and always sit together. If I could I would just cut her out of my life but it’s kind of awkward when we sit in a row together in every lecture. Any advice? ",07Jan2018,0

I stopped attending and havent heard anything from the uni, so I have been staying in halls of residence with my friends. Today I was expecting my next sum of student loan in... this is when I found out that my student funding had stopped and I had been withdrawn from my course. Now ive got no money, no job, and no future prospects, on top of this my depression is worse than ever. I just dont know what to do.

249,"I'm 21 and due to some personal reasons I need to move out and to do that I need to be earning about $3000-4000 a month. I live outside Boston, I don't have a degree nor certifications but I have a decent amount of customer experience. I prefer blue collar jobs but will take anything I can go into right now, within reason anyway. 

* 1 year experience (my current job) of being a service valet at a high end car dealer. My duties include checking in clients, light vehicle diagnosis, jump starts, tire pressure adjustments, fluid top offs, parking lot security, and a bit of management (pretty much the assistant manager and I've gotten 2 raises since I started there)

* 1 year of sales associate experience and a few months of being a keyholder at J crew. I was a top seller, trained new hires, set up the new displays, and processed inventory. Soon after I was promoted to a keyholder I left for medical reasons. 

* 2 summers of being an IT Intern at a top marketing firm in Boston. I was in charge of help desk tickets, training new hires on computer systems, and inventorying printer supplies. I didn't like this job too much because I don't like to sit at a desk all day in an office but it gave me very good computer experience. 

* I've had a few other jobs such as a restaurant host for a few months, 2 years as a sales associate for a comic book store, but they were so long ago I don't think it's relevant anymore. 

I have an interview this week to be a AAA tow truck operator which pays $16/hour and has overtime which I honestly think I'd love but I'm just wondering if there are any other jobs I should look for, but again not ones that require a degree or certification as I need to work asap. ",07Jan2018,0
252,"When I was a child I had sensitive and medium length labia. I had some psychological issues, Chile abuse related, which made me very uncomfortable in general. It also meant that I was uncomfortable with labia. I would tuck it in and wear very tight underwear to prevent it touching my outer labia. My mum organised an operation with a Jewish circumcision artist (well at least that’s what he turned out to be). He chopped both of them off and left me with nothing. I have just a clitoral hood now, and he even reduced that. Orgasms with others are hard if not impossible, although I can sort of manage on my own. But Ive now realised I’m terribly insecure as guys don’t like girls without labia in Australia. It’s kind of like how (even I) get freaked out to see a guy circumcised. A guy I liked and slept with recently said he preferred longer labias because it felt nicer. I feel so upset. I want them back. And theres no way I can have it back and I can’t get over it. It’s been years and I’m still traumatised by losing them when I was 15. I had great sexual health as a young teenage, ill spare you the details. But now, it’s just sad. Maybe I did all that when I was young because I knew my sex life including with myself would get taken away. I feel like a fucking paper mache and I’ve even lost some feeling in the left side.

254,"So it’s been about 3 years now, and it’s slowly getting worse and worse. Somedays I feel totally numb and distanced from the world. A whole day will go by and I won’t even realize it. I’m drowning my self in tv shows so I don’t have to be with my thoughts for more than a minute. I’m really tired a lot, even though I’ll get a full night sleep and eat nutritious meals. I get sensory overload really easily. Some days I just sit in my school chair and look out the window and waste an hour of my life, that’s probably why my grades are starting to become bad. I have no focus, I can’t even focus on watching a yotube video. Somedays I feel like life has no meaning, I just drift from one place to another. I put a razor up to my wrists once, maybe thinking it will stop it all. I didn’t do it, obviously, I thought it wouldn’t be such a good idea for my family to lose me. I have nothing to live for, I’m jealous of those people who have a spark in them to get up and just be productive. Somedays I think it gets better, especially when I hang out with my best friend, but I just realize that it’s a high and I quickly crash once she leaves. My emotions are all screwed up, things that would make a person cry doesn’t make me cry. Things that a person wouldn’t be bothered by bothers me a lot. I stumbled upon Dylan Klebold’s diary a month ago (don’t worry, I don’t want to shoot up a school, I value life, especially since I wish I had one) and one page sums it up a bit (his april 15, 1997 entry). I try to be not so depressed, I work out, eat good, go for walks, listen to happy music, try and be happy. But these only last a little while until I crash again, and It gets really bad when I get my period. So even if I’m doing good this month I crash once my period starts. My parents have noticed, but my dad said,” If you don’t stop being sad I’ll smack you.” and they don’t believe in depression, they think it another label doctors use so they can give you unnecessary drugs. But I don’t want to take drugs anyway, I don’t want to have to rely on a pill to be happy. I want to be a naturally happy person and I don’t know how to become that. Advice? ",07Jan2018,1

I am really struggling, and my parents having a go at me IN FRONT OF MY SIBLINGS (very humiliating) doesn’t help - my dad even told me that if I got an A he would give me £500 because he “knows I won’t do that well”. He also says that if I fail my A-levels he will be extremely disappointed and that it would be 2 years of my life wasted, and that I won’t be successful. Apparently, I have to give my dad money for every grade below a D.

I work at a franchise coffee shop. The owner is Indian and most of the employees are indian. There is one guy named 'Kenny', he's indian, he's a pervert. He's really nice to women and just an ass to guys, everyone at work knows he's a pervert. When he's only work with women, apparently he snaps his fingers and treats the newer, younger girls bad. They just moved here from India about a month ago. He's started to really cross the line. Unwanted kissing and invading personal space and finding excuses to touch innapropiate areas. He's best friends with the owner, and the owner isn't really the type to take care of a problem with employees. We all kind of just work together and get things done. There's very little structure, which is good because we are all very different and have learned to work that way. Anyways, I'm not sure what to do. I want the sexual harassment to stop, but how do I go about it? I'm a big athletic guy and could easily beat him, but I don't want to ruin my future. I'm not very good with words. I have anger issues and I feel as if confronting him would anger me and make me attack him. I thought about contacting corporate, but the new girls don't even have social security cards yet, and the boss isn't technically paying them right now(he does loads of bad/illegal business practices), and I don't want to get them fired or something. They're really sweet and just moved here from india, to the land of prosperity. I would feel like shit if they got deported or lost their job or something.

A couple months before I'm about to go I hint to my best friend and my mother that I might not want to go. They tell me I'm scared and I'll regret it if I don't go. So I mope around for another month and don't pack anything.

The date finally comes that I'm supposed to move and I still haven't packed anything. In fact I've been avoiding anything that looked like moving. Flash to 3am the day I am supposed to leave. I breakdown and start bawling my eyes out about not wanting to go. After I calm down and I tell myself I have to go because I already told everyone I was going and my roommate is waiting.

I've been here 3 days now. I've cried for hours each day. I have made sure to get out and explore the city but I just don't like it. In my gut I want to go home. Not because here is terrible just because I don't feel like I belong here.

My problem is everyone is telling me that I haven't given it enough time and I really don't want to disappoint anyone. But the concept of sticking it out in a place that I instantly hate is appalling to me. When I know I could be happy back home.

Players have been manipulated, lied to, banned, swept under the rug, and brainwashed, for years.

Now, some disturbing news about the way scopely structures all of their games, in an attempt to maximize profits in the short term, but drive players away in the long run, so that they can manipulate the player base into effectively killing the game for them, and removing any liability or responsibility for their continued abuses.

A revolt of the player base has been put in motion. We as players do NOT want to allow this company to dump us on the ground, and continue these blatant tactics on one of their new games.

I'm 22 and very long story short I made some stupid mistakes and pissed away my life for the last 3 years. I regret it terribly and I accept the consequences that may arise from it. That said I need to start moving past it and building up my life if you will. I'll mention this for the sake of bettering whatever advice given to me I live in Australia and I have 2 ways I can play this. I can go to uni study and earn a degree before attempting to enroll in the army. Alternatively I can work for 2-3 years working practically any asdf job before joining the army. The only thing scaring me away from uni is the fact that I'm 22 and I feel like I've lost my chance at it. That by the time I graduate a basic 3 year course I'll be 25 and would that be too late for the army? I don't know. My thanks in advance to any advice offered please don't hold back I'd like to know exactly what you think. Thanks again.,07Jan2018,1

275,"Hi all,

So some time ago I got Gardasil (HPV vaccine) at my doctor's office. Its a three vaccine course, and I got it in my early 20's because that's when I got my first job with health insurance benefits. My mom has unfortunately become quite anti-vaccine in recent years and didn't think the HPV vaccine was safe or necessary (very interesting stance from her given that she actually got cervical cancer and needed a hysterectomy!)

So I got the first dose of the vaccine, and before the second one was due, the office called my home phone number (I had repeatedly updated the paper forms and online profile to show my mobile number but for some reason the old home phone number kept appearing in my documents) and my mom answered, the office lady told my mom that I was due for my second vaccine.

Lets just say I got a call at work and a very...awkward...conversation ensured.

I called the Dr's office right away to complain, and send an email to my doctor via the patient portal, she responded quickly and was very apologetic and confronted the staff personally.

While I was miffed over what happened, I overall liked that practice and decided not to go further. I got the rest of my vaccines, eventually changed doctors (this incident was one of the reasons, the office staff really sucked overall) but its always bugged me still. I believe it qualified as a HIPAA violation, should I have done more to report it?",07Jan2018,9

1. I retrieve some blackmail on him
2. I essentially 'ruin his life' and force him to move out of state because of the drama I could potentially cause i.e making it so he looks like he has done something he hasn't.
So he could lose his job, rent lease, whatever the case may be.

I ended up ditching that place because I could not afford to drive far away back and forth, devote 45 hours a week there and earn such little money. Now when I apply for jobs I don't have references to back up my last 2 jobs plus I don't know how to explain why I left both of them without making the employers sound bad?

301,"I have a friend Met him last year. We became good friends and talked, but midway through last year he took a bad turn saying he wanted to kill himself and he was depressed over discord, I tried to be supportive begging him not to do it, you should get help etc. These convo's went on for hours. And I thought he just pushed through it. So earlier today he sent me a message saying ""Im going to end it."" and at this point I snapped. I didn't rage at him I said ""Look man, Its unfair for you to keep putting me in this position because Its stressful."" to which he responded ""I don't remember saying that."" (lie.) So then he said sorry. But I was still mad He stated ""I'm ever so slightly depressed."" so at this point he was basically admitting he was doing it for attention.  I continued on by saying that ""Im 95% sure you want attention, but if you legit want to kill yourself, call a hotline or speak to your guardian."" and he replied ""the hotlines are bad."" These conversations were annoying me. so I said ""You're doing this for attention."" and he said ""I'm going."" then went offline.

I blocked him and removed him on everything but am concerned he is going to kill himself (low chance.) Please keep in mind he has been doing this since mid last year and is stressing out me and others. I just cant be fcked.

303,"Explorations and first sexual contact for me was with a guy over 20 years ago, I’m 33 now and male FYI.

So I’m married now to a woman and these explorations were when I was a preteen and teen but are relived in my mind a lot.

It went from boys hanging out and doing what they do play sports, watch sports, play games, watch tv and movies. Talks about all that and cars and girls and women used to come up and fantasies and desires. Now there used to be 4-5 of us that regular got together because of our families being close. But I was closest to one of the boys let’s call him M. M was about 4-5 years older then me.

One night it was just my family at Ms house and we were hanging out in the basement like usual and while watching some movie together with some sexual scenes and M asked if I was getting hard which wasn’t uncommon as we all did talk about women around us that we found hot and women in movies etc. I being younger out of the bunch was usually more on the listening side when the older guys were talking about things. But in this case it was just us 2. I said no even tho I was. M said I’m super hard want to see? I declined, but M insisted we show each other and compare “don’t you wanna see what a real dick looked like” he stated teasing me. Both sitting on the couch M pulled his pants down revealing himself fully hard and I noticed his dick was circumcised and I am not. (Around this same age I was discovering my foreskin and bringing it full down and up, I was not shown or told this our cultures aren’t open sexually)

So being gutsy and teased on I also pulled down my pants and both of us were there cocks out with out parents upstairs and his grandparents down the hall in their room.

It went from us touching each other to the sexual scene together to getting closer together. He eventually took my hand and placed it on his cock.. clearly a lot bigger and harder than me I was preteen and he was a teen. I found it interesting he had no foreskin lol and he found it interesting I did. We went from no lips kissing, (folding our lips into our mouths kissing) to soft kisses on the lips. And then we heard a noise and jumped up just before someone coming down and busting us in the act. Good thing about older houses can hear someone about to enter a room.

As we got together quite often but not always alone we would at times have to keep it to ourselves at times, but when it was just us two things lead to talks about that night and sexual desires but about women. We also of course got back to where we left off kisses, making out and mutual masturbation. Things then built up to wanting more and him wanting me to blow him. I was ok with the JO sessions and making out but declined the bjs many times before eventually it leading to that. I never let him cum on me or in my mouth and the same went for him never cum on or in him. He used to time me at times for how long I could do it as it wasn’t always my favourite thing and also the attraction to women still was and is in me. Things started to fall off when he would not reciprocate the BJs as much as I would be asked to. Being so young I didn’t quite understand the pleasures and desires and things I know now of course but I do have the desires for mutual jos, bjs and fun again.

It clearly has an impact on my sexual relationships and intimacy now. It has an impact on my mind and desires. It is not something I’m angry about as I would explore again.

310,"I don't want to be like I am any more. I'm 21 and I have a big issue with my personality but I don't know how to fix it.

Basically, I am an introvert in the way that I am content with little to no social interaction...most of the time. However, when actually hanging out with people who have busy social lives, I am jealous of them, even though I COULD be hanging out with people more than I am. I just prefer staying in and doing things in the comfort of my room. This has resulted in me having poor social skills...at least I think that's why I find it difficult to make friends.

Of course, being male and 21 means I have a sex drive. But when I get a girlfriend, the amount of social interaction required by the relationship leaves me ENTIRELY socially satisfied. Which is not ideal because then I proceed to push away the little number of ""friends"" or acquaintances I did accrue. The result of that is, I get too dependent on the relationship for my social interaction and inevitably when the relationship ends I enter a depression because I am so damn lonely. Rinse repeat.

I'd like to have an active, healthy social life with lots of friends that could form a support network for me and friends to go out with and such... but at the same time...I really can't deal with so much social interaction and when it comes down to it, I'd rather stay home. It's a contradiction in my desires that I can't get over.

So, I decided that I'd just force myself to make friends and learn to like it. Over the last year I tried to fix it by taking on a lot of responsibilities to force myself to go out, do a variety of things, meet people etc., but I am invariably awkward in all interactions and I can't help but feel I am not part of the ""in-group"". I try my best, but I just can't seem to ""be one of the guys"". I'm socially inept, it appears. I heard that in the military it is easy to forge relationships because you all endure the same hardships etc. So I signed up for the British equivalent of the JROTC, but...I still can't make friends. I mean they acknowledge me and all, but I'm not ""one of the guys"". I'm not witty enough, I'm not like them enough. I'm just so lost. Speaking from experience, the only people I am able to befriend are social outcasts. But I always keep in mind the adage that you become like the people who hang around with, so that's not ideal.

I just don't know what to do. One day, I want to have a stable social life with good friends and an intelligent and pretty girlfriend. But I'm just too weird. I feel like I don't fit in society properly.

313,"Hi! Anyways, right now I'm unsure if I want to drop a class. To give a bit of background, I am currently in my school's Chamber Orchestra, an audition only orchestra with the best 40-ish stringed instrument players in a fairly large school. Additionally, I am also a previous All-State musician, and am probably in the top 5 violinist in my school. However, I have found that I hardly think I will want to explore music in college or career, and as such am contemplating dropping orchestra. However, there are a few disincentives to doing so: 
1. I am one of the best players, and the teachers would be sad to see me leave 
2. I would be dropping at semester, which while is not prohibited, is not very common, especially for a two semester course 
3. As the class if a two semester course, the teachers have assigned quartets which are practiced both first and second semester for a final performance in March. If I were to leave at semester, I would leave these my three groupmates without a first violinist.

However, as of now Orchestra is not aiding my education in any way, nor do I see myself as particularly enjoying the class. I would also be replacing the empty spot in my schedule with another class more useful to myself, either a business class, computer applications (basically a course over high level proficiency over excel, word, and access), or creative writing (which while I won't pursue a career in, will most likely enjoy, and also hopefully increase my writing ability). Finally, I have a situation in which I have two classes during a single period and then later an empty scheduling slot, dropping orchestra would resolve that conflict and make my schedule work much better.

My main question is if it is sensible to drop orchestra at this point, and also when I do what the best way to navigate this tricky situation would be.",07Jan2018,1

316,"Im in Highschool grade 11, i have a Group of Friends made of six girls with who i hang out with in school and on weekends. There is always the average amount of drama for girls our age but nothing significant. There’s a girl in the group, let’s call her Julia, who helped me cope with my anxiety last year and made it easier for me to go to school with anxiety.  Recently the other girls from my group have been talking bad about her behind her back and are considering talking to her about „finding new friends“. I think doing this generally isn’t a great way to split ways (which is totally normal) instead I would talk to her and discuss the issues they’re having.

Now, what I’m struggling with is that 1) I feel really guilty about hearing my friends talk bad about her without saying anything to stop them, because she has helped me through tough times 2) I feel the need to let Julia know that they are talking bad about her so she can decide what she wants to do 3) although I am so so grateful for how supportive she was, do notice how some things she does reallyyyy bother me and some days I wish I wasn’t friends with her, so I don’t know if I want to continue being so close with her every single day or not. 

Since I’ve started having anxiety I told myself to only surround myself with people who I truly like and care about and who also care about me. No one toxic or frustrating as I just want to enjoy and get through Highschool. With that I don’t know if she is ‚toxic‘ to me or not, but I definitely know that she is putting a split into my friend group as some talk bad about her and don’t like her and some do like her.

I'm a 20yo guy. I'd love some advice.

I've always been a very calm and quiet person. I've always had my goals, and was usually able to achieve them. I lost so much weight, finished school, got a job, started college... But for some reason, I just don't feel like doing anything anymore. I don't know what happened to me. I want to do more. I want to learn new languages, meet new people, read books, finish games, anything, really. But I won't. I've tried to start sooo many times, but everytime, when I get to home from my job, or wake up on that beautiful sunny saturday/sunday I just don't want to do anything anymore. I just want to lay down and surf the web.

I've started to do things for countless times. But as soon as I have free time, I just procrastinate. I'm so depressed because of this. I've dropped from college, I haven't touched any book for months, and the only reason I'm still on my job is because I'm gonna starve without it... I'm even finding myself being rude to people recently due to the stress that this has been generating.

The even weirder part is that I'm actually in my dream job. Also, there are so many people who work on poor jobs and do many things after it, so why can't I just stop being lazy and do it too? I honestly don't know.

It makes me so depressed that, if I start something today, I'm gonna be a totally different person tomorrow. I can't hear myself saying ""but I don't want to"" anymore. But on the other hand, I know that tomorrow I'm gonna be thinking totally different and will say ""fuck it"" to everything I've planned today. I've tried ""gamify your life"" apps, reward system, but it does not seem to work.

I just feel like I'm my worse enemy, and I can't beat myself.

320,"Hello everyone, I really need your help. It's a long, horrible story but I'll try to keep it short. 

So I've been with my girlfriend for about a year now. She means the world to me, and while it's been a tough road, I love her very much.

Her parents are very much against us dating (so much that we are hiding it at this point) due to our differences in values. Let's just say they are extremely conservative and I'm fairly liberal. They also have been verbally abusing her for as long as I can remember, and I encourage her to stand up to them. 

Anyway, about a month ago, my girlfriend was nearly raped in her own apartment. It was a guy at work, who is apparently well liked, and was my girlfriend's weed guy, so that's why he was over at her apartment. She was able to fight him off in time, and he left. I consoled my girlfriend, and encouraged her to call the police. She told me it wouldn't happen again and that she would leave her job and get a new one, so I conceded. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and my girlfriend went out to drink with a few of her new work friends. She got buzzed at her last day of her old job (bartender) before she went out. Well, she tells me that she only remembers having one drink, and blacking out for the rest of the night. She woke up in one of her coworker's beds, who told her that they had drunken sex. He went out to find a few of her things, and was able to find her glasses and her overshirt at nearby bars. I think it's very clear that she was drugged. The guy's side of the story is that she had a few more large drinks after that, her other friends left, and he was very drunk too so they got back to her apartment and he had sex with her (with a condom, apparently). He is also a very well liked guy, and honestly seems like a decent person. She believes his story, unfortunately. I'm not 100% sure since I have no evidence, but something didn't seem right.

Well fast forward to two nights ago. My girlfriend's car battery was getting spotty and she needed to jump her car. She was at her apartment and called her guy work friend (who I think drugged her) (who also works at her old job; confusing I know), and he said he was too busy but would send someone from work. Well guess who he sent, the guy who attacked her a month ago. She opened the door and he jumped on her. She was able to fight him off after awhile, and he left limping. 

So then she called me and I immediately took her to the hospital. They performed DNA collection, and she also got tested for various STIs and such. 

Okay, so my girlfriend is being stalked by a serial rapist who is possibly in cahoots with one of her work friends that she trusts somehow. The obvious answer is to press charges and get this guy off the streets. But, if you remember my girlfriend's home life, you'll see that standing up for herself isn't something that she normally can do. So, she refuses to press charges, or even get a restraining order. 

So now, the obvious question is how will she be safe? I suggested moving back to her parents house and getting a new job somewhere, but she also refuses to do that. The only thing she has agreed to is getting a can of pepper spray. 

There's the option of moving in with a friend, or me, but she's too afraid of her parents to do that either. 

So, what on earth do I do? Does she have any other options you can think of? How can I convince her to take charge of this situation and protect herself? 

Thanks for reading. Any advice is welcome

TL;DR: my girlfriend got raped by someone she knows and refuses to press charges or move out of town.

322,"There was a period, a few years ago, when I really  struggled with anxiety and depression, that led me to do many detrimental  things. The worst of them being self harming. To make a long story short, I was ultimately able to work myself out and, I haven't self harmed since those first few times. 

Still, like the physical scars on my wrist, the fact that I've hurt myself will always be with me. I've very recently started seeing someone new. He's a sweet, caring, wonderful person. I very much hope to start a relationship with him.

325,"I want to start off saying that I love my girlfriend, I love her a lot. But I'm not sure how much more I can take. She's a smart, pretty, kindhearted girl who tries to be a good person, but she has some pretty bad jealousy issues and really drastic mood swings and low self esteem to boot.


We've been on and off for a few years now, breaking up for different reasons but never because we hated eachother. Usually over more practical reasons like us wanting different things from life. When she's happy, or even just content, we go together exceptionally well. She's seriously like a best friend and a girlfriend rolled into one.


I don't want to badmouth her because that's not the type of person I am, but at the same time I try to be a very realistic person and I've found myself at a loss when it comes to my relationship with her. For the rest of this post I will refer to my GF as ""Jen"" for storytelling purposes.

The issues start when she gets in a bad mood, which can happen at seemingly any moment even if I haven't said anything. She'll go from laughing and smiling and cracking jokes to quiet and crying and blocking my number or otherwise shutting down communications with me at the drop of a hat. These moods can last for hours, or even days. A few times they lasted nearly a week, although she usually restores communication with me within a day. I want to make her happy and smile when she gets like this but nothing works on her, and I can't even make an attempt when she shuts down communications entirely.

I have to be honest with you and say that I've been honest with Jen (GF) too. *Very* honest. I have told her things about my past that she did not like to hear, things that I am ashamed of. Now it's not like I just spout off my regrets and my bad decisions out of the blue, everything came up when it was appropriate for it to, and I'm not a felon or anything but it's still bad regardless. Long story short several years before I met Jen I met another woman, let's call her May, and we dated for several years on and off during Highschool. May and I were serious for a Highschool couple, meaning we thought we were a lot more serious than we really were as kids tend to think, and eventually she cheated on me and broke up with me. I learned both of these things happened on the same day. It was rough because, like Jen, May was my best friend as well as my GF. Me and May spent some time apart but after several months I looked back and realized I was sort of a neglectful BF and while I was angry with her I decided we could still be friends and we are still friends to this day.

Not too long after that I met my next GF, let's call her Sarah, and we hit it off. I was just finishing my second semester of college and she was finishing her senior year of Highschool. She was 18 and I was 19 so we were pretty close in age. We got along pretty well and became close friends. We lived very close together so we saw eachother all the time too, which helped. At least until she cheated on me that is. I found out through a third party, and had it confirmed by her, that she had cheated on me with some dude from her Highschool. She seemed sorry about it and I was in a tough spot in my life so I didn't want to lose anyone important to me and so we continued to date (big mistake I know). Fast forward maybe a year and I cheated on her. I know there's no excuse for it, but things between me and Sarah were pretty dead after I found out she cheated on me and I had a moment of horrible horrible weakness. I still hate myself for it, it's my greatest regret. Well here's the kicker, I had cheated on Sarah with May, my ex. Inexcusable I know, but I figured it was important for Jen to know now that I was with her. The cheating happened about 3 years ago now.

Jen did not find out through someone else, I told her myself like a person is supposed to. I didn't think she would be okay or happy about it, but I also didn't think it would cause as much strain on our relationship as it has since telling her. She was already somewhat jealous of other woman before I told her, and she already had her mood swings and her low self esteem too but the jealousy go far worse afterwards.

Now any time I mention another woman in general, for any reason, she assumes I'm talking about May and that I'm fucking her behind her back. Even when I mention another woman by name she gets jealous. And of course when she gets jealous like this her mood goes immediately south, and she starts to cry and cuts off communications with me for a time. I always try to help her but nothing ever does, and admittedly I have less and less energy to deal with her mood swings that are happening several times a week, sometimes more than once a day.

I don't want her to be sad, I want her to be happy. I don't want to be the cause of her suffering, but I'm afraid that at the least I'm a large part of it. I've given her outs to break up with me and she always says she still wants to keep at this relationship, and I do too when shit starts to hit the fan. But like I said I try to be realistic, and I'm not sure what to do anymore. I worry that this relationship has been broken and repaired so many times that the residual anger will keep us from real happiness down the line. Honestly I feel horrible.

My brother has been problematic since he was 16 and is now nearing his 30’s and still doesn’t seem to realise how much of a nuisance he is to our family. He did drugs, went to prison, expelled from college and all sorts of things. My parents even forked out a lot of money for him to go to a rehab centre which he ran away from eventually! Even after all this my mum( Asian)  looks at him as if he’s above everyone else ! Part of his behaviour is fuelled by my mum
Because she always gives in to him and he knows that too and takes advantage of it hence why he doesn’t even have a job or contribute to the house hold. Yesterday me and my sisters had a huge argument with and she told us that after we get married,  we will go away to someone else’s household whereas he’ll be the one looking after her and be the one carrying her body once she’s dead  and not us (in my country it’s usually men who carry the body during a funeral). I found her argument  so ridiculous because first of all it’s mostly daughters who look after their parents. And does she think he will look after her when he can’t even bloody look after himself!!! She even calls him her baby which I find sick and repulsive because she’s been through so much because of him! 

I am mentally and physically sick of this fight and am just holding on to the last string. I love my mum to bits but I just wish sometimes that she would realise how much me and my sisters had to go through because of him and look things from our perspective!

All day, every day he talks to himself as if there was someone in the room with him even when there isn't. Loud, full conversations and even commentary about videos he's watching. Now singing is fun, but he puts on full musicals on the daily... even in the morning. He's even woken us up as early as 8am from blasting his music and dancing and singing in our room. 

Is this normal? Has anyone else expedited this? How should I handle it. And no, as far as I know he doesn't have any mental disabilities. ",07Jan2018,1

335,"I've been having a reccuring nightmare about a childhood friend who I ""played doctor"" with when I was very young. In the dream she looks as she does now, we are playing on the beach and she looses the bottom to her bikini in the water, then we continue to play as if nothing is wrong. These dreams have made me remember vividly the experiences we had as small children, and these memories are popping into my head when I'm with my SO. I still have (infrequent and respectful) contact with the girl in the dream. These images are tearing me apart from the inside and it is becoming more difficult to act normal around my SO because of it.

So everybody answered and I said cop because that's what I want to do. I don't know how to describe it but the way she responded was sort of weird, it was like she was offended. She said something like, ""you know that's a hard job and there's a thing between police and black people"" and ""I haven't had good experiences with police"". It kinda stung a bit and I'm not sure if I should confront her about it or just let it be.",07Jan2018,2

I met a friend from middle school a few months ago when we ran into each other at a test (we're both seniors in high school now). She messaged me on Facebook, and we got to talking. We weren't on the greatest terms back then, as she was the perennial girlfriend/ex-girlfriend of more than one of my close friends, but she seemed like she wanted to be friends, so I kept talking to her.

Unlike before, she seemed pretty interested in what I was talking about (comic books, video games, i.e. the stuff I talk about with my friends). Pretty quickly, she starts asking if I've ever had a girlfriend (which I inform her is an obvious no), after which she told me that she was interested in me and started giving me compliments of the sort that I'd never really heard applied to me (cute, sexy, hot, etc.). I didn't really know how to respond to this, so I asked her what she wanted to do with this, but she told me she wasn't interested in a relationship, as her parents apparently hated me (something that was news to me). After some more talking, she goes into a depressive spiral about how she's a worthless slut (her words), and after sincerely attempting to cheer her up, she gives me the only compliment I cared about: she tells me I'm nice.

I ask my one of my friends (Friend A, one of her exes, now that I think about it) about this, and he thinks that she's just playing with me, and I should tell her to piss off.

Pretty soon after that, she starts messaging me with some sexual stuff, ranging from vanilla to BDSM, even calling me master ""by accident"" a few times, but I tell her I don't really know how to process that. I copy/pasted a chatlog that I had asking a friend for advice but really doing more venting than anything else, and she starts apologizing for coming on to me so strong. I tell her that I'm up to be friends, and she seems to take it well, but then immediately asks me what kind of porn I watch and soon after indicates that she wants sex.

We keep talking, and after more depressive spiraling about her perceived lack of worth and status as a ""slut"" (once again, her words), I console her again.

Since my close friend group is largely made up of her exes, I talked about this over video games with Friend B, one of the ones who knew her friend group. Lo and behold, she has a boyfriend that she didn't tell me about. After confronting her about this, she admits it with no hesitation. After some probing, I confirm that this isn't some kind of open relationship, she was (attemptedly) cheating on him. Continuing to confront her about this, she asks me to stop because I'm ""making her feel like shit."" She then tells me to leave her alone and tell Friend A that he was right, that she was just playing with me. This is immediately followed by informing me that she deserves to feel like shit, continuing with more depressive spiraling (as well as deflecting), telling me that she and her boyfriend love each other, but she's going to break up with him because he doesn't deserve this. I tell her to instead talk to him about it, asking her to try to communicate with him rather than make the decision to break up for him.

Sidenote: Among other things, I wasn't the only one of my friends who she was messaging like this and propositioning for sex throughout this timeframe. In hindsight, a lot of what she was saying before makes sense now. She didn't want any kind of relationship because she had a boyfriend. She ""actually cared"" about what I was saying because she apparently (according to one of HER friends ""uses male adoration to build up her self-worth).

Back to the main story: Trying to confront her about the whole ""using me to cheat"" thing again, she again insists that she was just playing with me and I shouldn't care about her problems. After informing her that I can't just watch somebody hurting like this (for some fucking reason), I get her to the point where she's actually willing to talk. She admits that something deeper makes her take her boyfriend for granted, and she (I assume truthfully) informs me that while she started out just playing with me, I'm (apparently) a better person than she expected (the implications of which I really don't know, not sure if she wants to be friends or if there's anything more there).

Now I'm (rightfully) having a hard time trusting her, seeing an air of manipulation all over whatever she says, but I don't want to cut off contact (even though that seems like the wisest option), because that feels like giving up and running out on a friend who's hurting (I think I still consider her a friend for some reason after all of this, I guess).

She messages me later, talking about anime recommendations and seemingly trying to be friends. Later still, she messages me about how she loves her boyfriend and ""just needed to tell somebody.

This hurts and I don't fucking know why. She introduced me to him, and she wants us to be friends for some reason. He's a nice enough guy, and he knows that she tried to cheat on him with me, but I feel like a third wheel for an obvious reason.

I still want to talk to her. I don't know if it's just to be friends or more or anything. I don't know why. I have friends, close friends who I actually have emotionally open discussion with, but I still feel so fucking fucking lonely. When she was talking to me, I didn't feel so lonely. Now I'm back to being lonely. I don't even know if lonely is the word for it. I have close friends, I have family who I'm on reasonably good terms most of the time, but I feel so goddamn empty. That changed just talking to her. I feel so lost. I still want to be her friend, I think. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to feel. I feel hurt, but I also feel like I should be helping her deal with whatever underlying problem she has, and doing so as a friend. I don't know what to feel. I'm not even sure what advice I want, but other people's perspectives would be nice.",07Jan2018,4
340,"Hi reddit, 
I have a messed up situation. My dad is extremely racist and overprotective, but at the same time he's really been the only parent in my life who truly cared about me and always supported me. I hate his racism and want nothing to do with it, but without him I would never have my degree or the career I love. While in school, I met my boyfriend who is non-white. It was my first relationship, so I figured it probably wouldn't last forever anyway so I didn't really need to bring that up with my dad (I lived at an apartment away from home during school so it was easy to hide). Even if my boyfriend was a white guy he would probably still be terrible about it, but definitely not as bad. He's the typical conservative dad who wants his daughter to be single for the rest of her life with a gross layer of racism on top. 

Over the years I kept putting it off because I know it would just lead to a terrible situation, and I was 100% financially dependent on him at the time. 4 years later, still with this amazing guy, we both have our careers and want to move in together. I'm still afraid to tell my dad because I'm living with him at the moment, and I know its probably going to be a really explosive and terrible confrontation. I don't anticipate violence, but lots of screaming and saying alot of hurtful things and kicking me out is not out of the question. I know its hard to understand because he sounds like an asshole here, but beyond the racism, he's been a great parent to me. He always did genuinely care about me and encouraged me to follow my dreams. We have a pretty close relationship even though I've been able to lie to him for 4 years. So that's what makes this so hard. I know its going to hurt him, but his racism is not my problem, and I know I shouldn't feel guilty for doing something normal adults do. 

I am mostly financially independent at this point (he does own my car, but I can easily go buy another one). But all of my things are in his house (all my clothes, computer, game systems, etc.). I'm not sure how the laws work, but I'm guessing I probably don't have much rights to my things in the house if he really decides to have a meltdown. Between buying a new car and replacing literally everything I own while trying to move to a new place, it would destroy me financially. I don't have a good way of hauling this stuff out beforehand without him knowing something is up. I also could be thinking this is going to go down way worse than it is, but if it goes the worst case scenario route, I would be screwed. 

I've talked to some more open minded family members (not household family members) about it and they seem to think it won't go as bad as I think. My boyfriend also thinks I may be overreacting. But at the same time, if you were a dad and your daughter lied about something like that for so long, wouldn't you be angry too?

Has anyone else gone through a situation like this? Any advice on how I should handle it, maybe what to say, etc? As much as I'd love to tell him to fuck off, its hard when I really do love and respect every other part of him except his racism and political views.

342,"So I moved away from my long term girlfriend In September to work in London and further my career! Been here 4 months and I’ve learnt so much but it’s so hard going back to see her every month and having to say goodbye. I guess what I’m getting at is that I have no idea wether I should consider moving back in the next couple months or just try and get on with it? 

I already know this is the girl I wanna marry and spend the rest of my life, j just don’t know what to do I guess? 

Any helps or insight would be great!
